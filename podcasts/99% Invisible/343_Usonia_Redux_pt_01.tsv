EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:33,760	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And most importantly

EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:39,136	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And it all started

EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:56,800	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Frank Lloyd Wright's home and
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:59,872	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Jacob's didn't really know anything about architecture
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:04,736	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And at that particular time he wasn't really interested in learning anything about it
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:07,552	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Because Herbert Jacobs had other things on his mind
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:10,112	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And that November of 1934

EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:29,311	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Completely unprepared
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:34,431	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	He drove 120 miles to the chill gray Wisconsin Countryside for his assignment
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:36,735	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	To meet with Frank Lloyd Wright
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:41,087	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Wright was 67 in 1934
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:43,391	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Couldn't have cared less about his appointment
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:45,439	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	With Herbert Jacobs of the Milwaukee Journal
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:46,975	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Actually

EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:51,071	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Which wasn't unusual he was known to blow off journalists
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:54,143	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	When Jacobs arrives at Frank Lloyd Wright's compound
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:56,703	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Sound completely distracted by thoughts of his wife and their baby
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:05:00,287	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	He learned that the architect was actually on his way out the door
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:02,335	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	They got to talk for just over 10 minutes

EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:16,159	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And they're part of a fellowship program that right established at his home and Studio

EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:31,519	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	But The Shining brow also has to do with rights building philosophy
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:36,639	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	So Taliesin actually is built on the brow just like your

EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:32,959	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Was really formative for right
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:38,079	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	He thought that architecture should help people live harmoniously with their environment
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:39,359	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Rather than
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:40,127	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Shield them from it
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:41,407	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The house
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:47,807	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	To become part of nature if it was made with local materials and had big windows and was oriented for

EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:53,183	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	So that you've taken
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:53,951	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Advantage of
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:55,999	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	What Nature has to offer

EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:58,815	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Nature rather than trying to fight
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:06:59,583	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Against it
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:02,655	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	You know living on the brow of the Hill not on top of it
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:04,959	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	It's all folded into a concept
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:05,727	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Frank Lloyd Wright
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:07,519	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Called organic architecture
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:10,591	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	You wanted to spread this gospel to the Next Generation
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:13,919	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Which is why he returned to the valley he knew as a boy

EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:20,831	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Fellowship with the thing that the Milwaukee Journal wanted Herbert Jacobs to cover a news article
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:25,439	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	When Jacobs drove into Taliesin that morning in 1934
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:27,999	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The fellowship had been going on for two years
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:30,303	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	It was hard for the public to wrap their minds around it
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:32,607	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Including this NBC announcer
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:43,359	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Peking is Frank Lloyd Wright

EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:49,503	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Mr. right as the fingers of my hand
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:54,111	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The apprentices had to pay $1,100 a year to attend the Taliesin Fellowship
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:56,159	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Nearly 20 grand today
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:58,719	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And it wasn't like an accredited institution or anything
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:00,767	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Students had to do a lot of grunt work
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:03,071	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Baling hay farming fields
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:04,095	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	What's and making me off
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:07,167	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	But they got to learn Frank Lloyd Wright philosophy of architecture
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:08,959	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And live with them and work with them
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:12,543	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Even though often times has meant serving as an unpaid labor for
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:15,615	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	When Jacobs was getting his tour of Taliesin
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:17,407	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	He described the apprentices as
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:18,687	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Rather long hair
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:20,223	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Smiling and polite young men
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:23,807	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Who tried their best to explain to him what Organic Market
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:24,319	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Texture means
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:26,367	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Organic architecture is
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:30,463	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Architecture of its time and of its place
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:33,023	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	You're not trying to make it look like something
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:33,791	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	But it's not
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:37,119	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Write thought that there should be no wallpaper to cover things up
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:38,399	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Paint no plaster
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:40,447	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Would should look like what

EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:43,775	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Should look like concrete
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:45,823	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	When Frank Lloyd Wright
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:52,223	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Worked with plywood he like to leave the edge of the plywood exposed so that you saw those
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:53,247	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Players and they are
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,783	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And that's became part of the
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:09:01,695	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Almost Florida Mentor detail which was different from freely traditional European style

EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:11,423	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Tiny rooms

EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:13,727	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Paint them Lacy curtains
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:17,823	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	This idea of organic architecture wasn't just a break from these traditions
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:21,407	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Who's a break from new trends in modern architecture 2
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:28,319	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Cities all over the world we're building huge boxy glass and steel structures designed to be hyper

EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:34,207	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Wright explains that these were simply not comfortable for human animal
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:37,279	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	I like goldfish and a globe
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:44,191	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And these houses that are so classified as they know how they're not sensible its attributes of privilege Center
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:46,495	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	An abusive material
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:51,103	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Frank Lloyd Wright took the traditional old materials and put them into Sleek modern forms
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:54,431	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Is organic architecture was a new style
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:56,223	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Born in the United States
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:57,759	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	An organic architecture
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:58,783	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	New sense
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:00,575	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	What constitutes
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:02,879	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Humanity under harmonious condition
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:08,255	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	A harmonious place in which to live in a harmonious way to live in it
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:10,047	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	But Frank Lloyd Wright didn't
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:12,095	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Playing this Grand philosophy
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:13,887	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	To the journalist Herbert Jacobs
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:15,935	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Because right wasn't there
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:19,263	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The apprentices did the best I could but again
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:21,567	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Jacob's was very distracted
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:23,871	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And was only thinking of his wife in the hospital
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:27,455	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	He thanked the two young man who showed him around Taliesin
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:29,247	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And got back in his car

EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,063	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Finally
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:33,343	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	I started back to Milwaukee
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:35,903	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Learning on the way to a telephone call to the hospital
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:39,743	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	That I had become a father at about 11 that morning
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:41,023	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	At the very moment
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:42,047	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	When I was interviewing right

EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:51,775	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	News reporter salary of $20 a week
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:53,567	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	This was in the mid-30s
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:54,591	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The Great Depression
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:59,711	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	So when Herbert Jacobs was offered a slightly higher paying job for the paper in the state capital of Madison
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:01,759	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The family moved by the way

EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:13,023	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	This is the voice of Herbert Jacobs himself
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:15,583	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	From a 1956 NBC interview
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:19,423	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	We can Catherine move to Madison NC any houses they like
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:21,215	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Or that they can afford
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:28,127	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Do something for us

EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:34,527	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Any murmured something along the lines of
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:35,551	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Very interesting
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:38,111	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Which his wife's cousin took as a yes
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:42,207	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	But he made an appointment for us to go out there and we went along with that idea

EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:18,047	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Anywhere expensive
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:20,351	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Show me put it as a sort of challenge
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:25,215	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	What the country needs is a decent $5,000 house can you build one
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:28,287	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	In today's money $5,000 is about $85,000
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:32,127	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	That's a pretty reasonably priced house in most real estate market
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:43,903	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Millwright had long wanted to make a more democratic form of housing
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:44,671	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Even earlier
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:49,791	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Given playing around with inexpensive methods of building and other structures
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:53,119	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	I need a lot of Concepts that had been scheming around urban planning
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:54,399	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	But now
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:57,983	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Write have a chance to make some of his Concepts a reality
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:12:59,775	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	She had the Willing clients
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:01,567	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And he had time on his
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:05,663	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	In 1936 he was in a bit of a slump in his career
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:06,943	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	People
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:08,479	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Ford fancy big new homes
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:10,783	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Again it was The Depression
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:13,343	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And a number of big projects have been cancelled
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:16,415	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And also right had already been practicing for decades
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:19,743	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	He was slowly getting written off as a has-been
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:22,303	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And then in comes this young open-minded couple
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:24,351	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Wright could tell them his philosophy
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:26,655	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And teach them how to live well
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,423	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	A good architect
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:31,519	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Do you really want a $5,000 house
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:35,359	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	She said most people want a $10,000 house for 5,000
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:38,431	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Are you willing to give up the things that you have to give up
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:41,503	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Mr. Wright made a list of the things that the Jacobs
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:42,271	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Have to do without
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:45,087	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	They really wanted a $5,000 house
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:46,879	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Tile bathrooms
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:50,975	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Extra trim finishing things like that
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:54,559	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	We didn't know anything about it we said sure that's okay with us
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:58,655	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Herbert and Katherine Jacob's didn't know it at the time
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:00,703	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	But that modest little house that
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:02,751	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Frank Lloyd Wright was to build for them
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:03,519	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Would be
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:05,311	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The most practical expression
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:07,359	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Of his ideology
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:11,199	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The Jacobs would own the first house in a movement that right called
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:11,967	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Usonia
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:15,807	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The house that Herbert Jacobs built was the first of the
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:26,303	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Usonia was Frank Lloyd Wright's name for the United States
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:27,071	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	North America
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:30,655	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	In Wright's vision usonia would be a country
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:31,679	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Full of malice
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:32,703	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Well made
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:33,727	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Beautiful
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:36,287	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Comfortable little houses that the working-class could afford
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:38,591	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	These usonian homes
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:39,615	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Would inspire
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:42,175	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Educate and write believed
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:43,199	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Create a new culture
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:44,991	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	For all Americans
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:49,599	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	I believe now people are going to know what constitutes good Ark
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:50,367	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	A texture
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:53,183	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And of course good living has to go with it
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:54,975	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Good Conduct also
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:56,511	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Good dressing to
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:57,791	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Because you wouldn't dress
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:02,655	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And I loved and vogelweh and a quiet and beautiful room
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:05,471	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	All is good things
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:08,799	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Independent Wireless one on the other
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:10,847	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	I know that something would we call culture
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:14,943	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	It's only natural girls who can attend coach
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:19,807	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Write believe the way to build a better American culture was not on Mass
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:22,111	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Not in apartment buildings are cookie-cutter developed
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:24,927	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	It was to be catered to the individual
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:26,719	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Kosher not for the crowd
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:28,255	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Cultures and individual
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:32,095	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And that's what our forefathers
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:37,471	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Band-Aid that individual is
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:37,983	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Sovereign
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:42,079	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Which two Frank Lloyd Wright meant that the masses should be unmasked
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:43,871	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	It should spread out
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:46,943	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Away from the city
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:47,967	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Is that
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:48,735	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Thing of the past
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:52,063	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	There was a time during the Middle Ages
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:54,367	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	When
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:56,415	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Said it was the only source of culture
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:15:59,487	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	There's no way of acquiring
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:03,327	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	This thing we call culture except by direct contact
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:11,007	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	That wasn't true anymore people were connected to culture through radio and telephones and Automobiles
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:11,775	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	They have
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:14,335	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Transportation speed
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:16,383	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Listening
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:17,151	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	This
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:18,175	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Cherry wood
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:18,943	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Using now
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:23,551	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	It's no longer essential for people to crowd together anyway
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:27,135	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	That was Frank Lloyd Wright's vision for America
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:29,695	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	I would start to become reality
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:30,975	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	In 1936
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:31,999	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	But the Jacobs
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:35,071	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	What she called usonia 1
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:36,607	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Jacob's house was
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:38,655	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	One of the first ones built there was this
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:41,983	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Put yourself wide open Farmland when it was built out here
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:43,519	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	This is Bill Martinelli
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:44,543	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Manager of usonia 1
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:49,663	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	It's in a Suburban Street outside of Madison now lined with little suburban houses
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:54,527	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	But you Sonia one really stands out even if you don't know what it is and you're just driving by
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:56,319	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Because I'm a street
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:59,135	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	It almost looks like a beautiful wooden wall
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:01,183	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The house trailer
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:02,207	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Back on the road
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:06,815	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Well when you get inside her if we go around back you'll see that whole back in the house all glass
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:11,935	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	It's all open to the back and he only did that intentionally the kind of close it off to the street and then
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:13,727	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Open it up to the back
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:20,127	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	As right site the point of the house would love to have a big facade to show off your neighbors with a useless
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:22,431	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Wasteful patch of lawn in the front
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:23,711	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Cinegrand entryway
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:24,223	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	No
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:25,503	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The house
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,783	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Should be built for residents
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:28,319	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Not on lockers
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:31,903	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Also from the street you can see that there's no garage
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:34,463	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Car is parked under a wooden awning
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:36,767	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Just a little flat roof with no sidewalk
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:38,815	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	This is the carport
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:41,631	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	A term that Frank Lloyd Wright coins
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:42,655	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Well this is the
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:43,935	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Carport of the houses
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:45,471	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Considered the first
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:48,543	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Named cardboard it was a term that right came up
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:52,383	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	This was one of the many tiny ways right calf cost down
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:55,199	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And also the carport was an education in lifestyle
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:59,551	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Without a garage that Jacobs wouldn't have space to store their junk
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:03,391	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	We have to Simply minimize their possessions and toss what they didn't need
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:06,463	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The carport isn't purely utilitarian
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:08,511	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The woodwork on the carport roof
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:10,559	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Has this lovely geometric pattern
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:12,095	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Who is like these boys
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:13,375	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Kind of stripes
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:18,751	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Funny when I get mad heard about the carport and like seeing pictures of it I didn't expect it to be so
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:20,543	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Beautiful in like
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:21,311	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Really nice
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:24,383	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Is house the more you look around more
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:25,919	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Moore UCLA

EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:34,943	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	All of these Innovations Were Meant to help the
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:36,479	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The family LivWell
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:37,247	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Frugally
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:39,551	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	They saved money while they lived in the house
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:41,087	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And they're also save costs
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:42,111	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	In the construction of the house
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:45,951	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	But right you some other cost-saving measure that we're kind of
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:46,975	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Cheating
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:50,303	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Like he stole some bricks from another building of his
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:51,583	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	But he was constructing nearby
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:53,887	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Well right didn't steal the bricks himself
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:21:00,287	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	He sent a bunch of his apprentices over to Racine Wisconsin where his design for the Johnson wax building was under

EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:04,383	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	He told the apprentices to grab as many bricks if they could
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:05,663	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And bring them back to Madison
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:07,455	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	If you're familiar with the
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:09,247	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Johnson wax building
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:11,295	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The corners are curved
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:12,575	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	So you can see
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:13,855	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Some of these bricks are
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:17,952	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Convex or concave while those
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:20,512	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Like Corner brick
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:23,072	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Another way right cap cost down was by taken

EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:36,128	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	He met his challenge of building a beautiful house
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:37,920	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	At Herbert and Katherine could afford
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:40,224	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	I mean it wasn't perfect
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:42,528	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The total adjustment for the family
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:44,576	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	In the house have problems

EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:49,440	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Screens in the window
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:52,512	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Which one of the kinds of complaints right got a lot
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:56,864	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	He mostly focused on Aesthetics and principles of building rather than practicality
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:21:58,912	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And ultimately
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:00,448	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The Jacob's house was
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:01,216	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Small
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:03,520	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	At the Herbert and Katherine had two more children
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:05,312	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	They couldn't fit into the house anymore
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:09,152	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	I'm so after 6 years of living in usonia 1
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:11,456	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The Jacobs family would move off to the countryside
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:15,040	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	We're Frank Lloyd Wright wood design them a second usonian house
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:19,648	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	But Herbert Jacobs thought of their first home very fondly
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:21,184	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Living in that house was
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:22,976	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Fantastic
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:31,168	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Mister Wright thought so too. Everybody should live in a house
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:32,192	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Design by humans
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:35,264	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Dishes and clothes

EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:39,872	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	He did design a lot of his furniture
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:42,944	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And at least one case he did design a dress for the wife of
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:45,760	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	This was all about changing culture
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:48,064	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	One home at a time
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:51,136	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Frank Lloyd Wright wanted to redesign America
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:52,416	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And by that token
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:52,928	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Americans
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:56,768	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Good design he thought would make a Kinder more beautiful

EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:22,048	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	We were welcomed with open arms and the enthusiasm of the people who are here and talking about their project was in Fair
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:23,072	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Directions to wework
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:25,376	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	We decided that will join the community
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:28,448	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	But it wasn't all a big romantic adventure
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:30,240	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	It was a real risk
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:31,264	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	First of all
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:32,032	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Fish with radical
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:36,128	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Nothing these days it's called mid-century modern
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:38,432	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	But the architecture then was Radical
EDL	00:29:38,944	00:29:45,344	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Meaning these homes were so strange looking to the larger world that the people who chose to live in them we're seeing a
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:45,856	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Is radical
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:48,160	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And in some ways they were
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:50,208	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Some of them were Lefty Jews from the Bronx
EDL	00:29:50,720	00:29:52,768	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Socialist ideals about land ownership
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:55,584	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The true cooperatives that we were
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:56,096	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	What is radical
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:30:01,472	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Operators in the sense that no one owns their house
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:03,008	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Also this was a Financial Risk
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:06,336	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Since the houses were not as cheap as they were supposed to be
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:09,152	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	They supposed $5,000 cost
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:11,200	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	But turned out it was not a realistic number
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:16,320	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	During and after World War materials and labor became more expensive
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:19,136	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The building of usonian homes involved
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:23,488	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Special skills and custom fixtures and the house has ended up being double or
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:24,512	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Triple their price estimate
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:27,328	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Please house was over twenty Grand
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:29,632	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	But the members of usonia
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:31,168	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Would not be deterred
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:34,496	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	We were determined to go forward with this we were all very optimistic
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:38,592	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Here we come occasionally the city's house under construction
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:40,128	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	You got to come and see you in the same to you
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:44,992	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	When Rowland and his wife signed up for the community
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:48,832	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	They thought they'd work with one of the Taliesin graduates to design their house
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:53,440	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Not the master himself we didn't dream of a project Frank Lloyd Wright's I mean really
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:57,024	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Who who is 31st
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:31:00,864	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	But Frank Lloyd Wright did in fact want to design Rowlands
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:07,776	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	They met up in New York and they exchanged letters and ideas about the plans on Roland went out to see right at Taliesin
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:14,176	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Who is the real person you could talk to him you could exchange a joke I mean people people don't don't see him that way
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:15,712	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	But they're there was
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:16,992	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Roland was 26
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:19,296	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Wright was 83
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:20,832	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Come on rolling sit down
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:23,648	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	You're my client I'm your architect
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:26,720	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	I'll redesign your house as many times as I have to
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:29,024	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Until I was satisfied all of your needs
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:31,072	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	You have to speak up if you don't you'll take what you got
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:37,728	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Roland's house would be one of three and usonia New York that Frank Lloyd wright-designed himself
EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:40,288	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	About five years after the rise lease moved in
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:41,312	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	When will when is wife
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:41,824	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Kids
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:44,640	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Frank Lloyd Wright added an extension to their house
EDL	00:31:44,640	00:31:45,664	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	In fact
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:48,480	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Roland is the last living owner of a
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:50,784	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Frank Lloyd Wright usonian home
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:52,576	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Dealt specially for him
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:54,112	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And he still lives in it
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:56,160	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	I came to realize
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:31:58,976	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	After 7 years living here
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:03,328	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	It did not been a day in my life when I didn't see something beautiful
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:07,936	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Even the terrible days that occur in every life
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:11,264	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The house is completely usonian
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:13,056	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	With simple carport
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:18,944	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And Sumptuous wooden walls that almost glow and one big main room in a tiny kitchen
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:25,344	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	It almost feels like you're outside because it has these big glass windows with long roof overhangs
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:26,624	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	To draw the eye out
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:29,696	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Towards the thick forest of trees just outside
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:31,232	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	I think that it has
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:32,768	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Had an effect on me
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:34,304	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	I'm anyways
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:38,400	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The neuroscientist say that that kind of sense
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:40,704	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Reduces stress and that is
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:42,240	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Good for your good for your love
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:47,616	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And maybe good physical health to I'm 92 years old I'm pretty good shape for 92
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:50,176	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Also
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:51,456	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Hardly I mean
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:54,016	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Who knows I'd like to attribute that
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:55,296	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	To experience
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:57,088	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Beauty around me
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:59,904	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	For most of my life which is car tomorrow
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:03,744	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Is Rowland season
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:09,888	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Frank Lloyd Wright's idea that better architecture could create a better way of life has been entirely true
EDL	00:33:10,400	00:33:13,216	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	We could depend on each other if there was a problem or need
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:20,128	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The kids will know all that wealthy adults by their first name used to say that children growing up here at 5th
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:21,664	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The answer to Uncle zhenya Sonia
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:24,480	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The first 40 Years of usonia New York
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:27,552	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Only 12 of the 48 houses changed hands
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:29,344	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	6 of those two Next Generation
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:30,368	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Members of the community
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:32,160	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	There are only two divorces
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:35,488	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	I have the job they could they couldn't decide who get the house
EDL	00:33:36,256	00:33:40,608	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	But life started to move at different Paces for people living in usonia
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:43,168	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Suddenly they weren't all new young families
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:47,264	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Are all groups of people in different phases with different needs
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:53,152	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And when it was time for homes to change hands perspective buyers were thrown off by The Cooperative nature of the village
EDL	00:33:53,920	00:33:57,504	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	In the first Decades of usonia members didn't own their homes
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:33:58,528	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	We decided
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:33:59,296	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Very relaxing
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:00,576	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	2
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:03,136	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Grants title to the individual home sites
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:04,672	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	To each member
EDL	00:34:04,672	00:34:06,464	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	While retaining all of our
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:07,488	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Common land
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:08,256	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	As a cooperative
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:11,584	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And that made a big difference that suddenly paperwork
EDL	00:34:11,584	00:34:12,096	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Wellington
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:17,472	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	If you're not Roland reisley and your house Wasn't custom-built for You by Frank Lloyd Wright himself
EDL	00:34:17,984	00:34:20,544	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Usonia houses can be a bit of an adjustment
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:24,128	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Today most of the homes in usonia New York have been expanded
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:28,736	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Any and all new additions have been built in a usonian style
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:31,040	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Using local materials flat roofs
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:33,088	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Big glass windows and radiant Sensibility
EDL	00:34:33,856	00:34:35,392	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	They have to be built that way
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:40,768	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	While the outsides are not Landmark they are governed by the board of usonia the insides are not at all
EDL	00:34:41,536	00:34:44,864	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	This is Evan Kingsley he's one of the newcomers to usonia
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:47,424	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Relatively he's been there since 2003
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:53,568	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	But I think for the most part those of us who have chosen to move here are really sensitive to the aesthetic of the interior
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:59,456	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	But there's one specific part of the Interior that has changed in a lot of the usonian home
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:02,016	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	We've completely redone the kitchen
EDL	00:35:02,528	00:35:07,648	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	As was the case in most usonian homes the kitchen in Evans home was this little alcove
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:10,720	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Very efficient in very very telling
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:15,328	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Right never realize that the whole family might actually want to hang out in the kitchen
EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:19,168	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Nowadays it's as much a place to gather at the living room or the dining room
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:24,288	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Evan is added new tiling and appliances and expanded his kitchen
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:30,176	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	But not by much
EDL	00:35:30,176	00:35:32,224	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	10in they are that's all that we gain
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:32,736	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	I'm doing that
EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:38,624	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	There are a smattering of usonian homes throughout the United States
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:41,184	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Some design by write-in some by his apprentices
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:44,000	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	But all following the same basic principles
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:45,792	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And like Evan kingsley's home
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:49,120	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Many of these other usonian houses are hard to modify
EDL	00:35:49,632	00:35:54,240	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Because they're often governed by Boards were trying to preserve them as historic pieces of architecture
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:55,520	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And also
EDL	00:35:55,520	00:36:01,152	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Donors themselves want to make sure they keep within the principles of the house
EDL	00:36:01,152	00:36:01,920	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	If you don't have cabinets
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:03,456	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Up at the top
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:06,784	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	They weren't put there in a few could Adam
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:14,976	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Violate the principles
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:19,072	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	That's Betty and John Moore
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:20,608	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	They live in Wisconsin
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:21,888	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	In the house called Jacobs
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:22,656	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Is 2
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:26,496	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	It's the second usonian house that right designed for that journalist Herbert Jacobs
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:29,312	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Yeah well you want to make sure that
EDL	00:36:29,312	00:36:29,824	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	You
EDL	00:36:30,336	00:36:33,920	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Can adapt to the house because it's not going to reject teeth
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:35,712	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Yuan
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:36,736	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Much
EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:40,576	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Like most usonian homes Jacobs to add a carport
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:42,624	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Big windows and open plan
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:45,184	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	In concrete floors with a heating system in it
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:47,232	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The floor is nice and cool now
EDL	00:36:47,232	00:36:50,816	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	But the weather is nice and warm
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:55,680	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	I mostly wanted to play that clip because I love how Betty and John actually complete each other sentences
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:37:01,568	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Betty and John's house needed a lot of attention which is why it was on the market for 4 and 1/2 years
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:02,592	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Before they bought it
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:04,384	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Everybody wanted to look at it
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:06,176	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	It's a curiosity but nobody wanted to live here
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:09,504	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	If they're really not for everyone
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:13,344	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The reason they sit on the market sometimes for so long
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:14,112	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	That's because
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:15,392	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	People consider them
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:17,952	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	A difficult living
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:24,352	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	That's John eifler an architect in Chicago who has restored a number of Wright houses including usonia 1
EDL	00:37:24,352	00:37:27,680	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	In order to preserve them you sometimes have to modify
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:30,496	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	In order to make them more lovable
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:36,128	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	But even experts like eifler have a tough time keeping track of how many usonian homes exist
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:38,688	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	So how many are there I don't know
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:45,344	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	I've heard numbers ranging from 27 to 140
EDL	00:37:45,856	00:37:50,464	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	It all depends on your definition of what an authentic usonian house is
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:52,256	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	You could consider usonia
EDL	00:37:52,256	00:37:54,560	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Period in Frank Lloyd Wright's life
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:58,912	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Period in American architectural history which would include the houses by the apprentices
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:38:01,728	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Or just a general architectural style
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:04,032	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Depending on your definition
EDL	00:38:04,032	00:38:06,592	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	The number of usonian houses continues to grow
EDL	00:38:07,104	00:38:08,384	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	In 2013
EDL	00:38:08,384	00:38:09,920	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	A new usonian house was
EDL	00:38:10,432	00:38:11,200	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	On the campus
EDL	00:38:11,200	00:38:12,224	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Florida Southern College
EDL	00:38:12,736	00:38:17,344	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	It was a design of Rights from 1939 but constructed 74 years later
EDL	00:38:17,856	00:38:19,392	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	All according to rights
EDL	00:38:19,392	00:38:20,160	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Plans and Principe
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:26,304	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Usonia certainly never came to pass in the way that Frank Lloyd Wright originally envisioned
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:29,632	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	With every American living in an affordable car
EDL	00:38:29,632	00:38:30,144	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Custom home
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:31,424	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	In fact
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:35,008	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Elements of the usonian home ever evolved into something else
EDL	00:38:35,008	00:38:35,776	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Entirely
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:40,384	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	So it is kind of true the boat that usonia directly influence the development of the Rancho
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:41,920	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Without a doubt
EDL	00:38:41,920	00:38:42,688	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	I think so
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:47,296	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Ranch style houses are all over the country
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:48,576	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And nearly every suburb
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:50,624	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	They are horizontal
EDL	00:38:50,624	00:38:51,904	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Close to the ground
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:52,672	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	One story
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:54,464	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	They have an open floor plan
EDL	00:38:54,976	00:38:55,744	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Few walls
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:38:58,304	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	So it's not hard to see the similarities to
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:38:59,072	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Dystonia
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:39:01,888	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Ranch homes are generally less inspired
EDL	00:39:02,400	00:39:04,192	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	I don't have the elegant details
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:04,960	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Lemonade with
EDL	00:39:04,960	00:39:05,984	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Standard materials
EDL	00:39:08,032	00:39:12,384	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Right might not have been pleased the concepts of usonia I got absorbed into
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:15,456	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Essentially the epitome of cookie cutters Suburban housing
EDL	00:39:15,968	00:39:16,736	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	At least
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:22,880	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	These houses really were affordable for the middle class unlike all the usonian houses after usonia 1
EDL	00:39:23,392	00:39:24,672	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Afterwards
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:26,720	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	American suburbs were full

EDL	00:39:28,000	00:39:30,048	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	There weren't that many variation
EDL	00:39:30,560	00:39:31,328	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	After the war
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:33,376	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	And

EDL	00:39:34,144	00:39:36,448	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Suburban ranch home was pretty much
EDL	00:39:36,448	00:39:37,472	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	I mean that
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:41,568	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Humongous mansion
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:42,592	| 343_Usonia_Redux_pt_01 |	Or something that everyone was
