EDL	00:01:08,864	00:01:13,984	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Logos used to be a thing that people really didn't give much thought to
EDL	00:01:13,984	00:01:20,384	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	The last decade the volume and intensity of arguments about logos have increased substantially
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:22,176	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	This is just the internet being
EDL	00:01:22,176	00:01:27,296	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	The internet but logo redesign in particular a lot of hyperbolic vitriol
EDL	00:01:27,296	00:01:31,648	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	I was wondering what this felt like to desiigner so I talked to one of my favorites

EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:05,184	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	As a graphic designer really meant
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:06,464	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	But recently
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:07,744	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	That's changed
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:11,840	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Aren't you at now a lot of times people will say

EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:20,800	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	New and
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:21,568	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Kind of startling

EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:27,712	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	What is the most recent logo they've asked you
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:30,528	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Let me ask about your own logo
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:33,856	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Oh yeah oh yeah yeah I know I was like as if they didn't know
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:38,976	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Absolutely I was back in early 2015
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:41,536	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	I was engaged in a secret project
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:43,584	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Which was to design a logo for
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:44,864	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	For the campaign of
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:46,144	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	As of yet on

EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:50,240	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	And
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:51,776	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	It launched there was a
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:52,800	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Huge amount of attention
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:54,080	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Chivas logo witch
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:55,616	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Became ubiquitous
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:56,640	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	I think the age with the arrow in it
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:03:03,296	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	And at one point before it was widely known that I was a designer but I got an email from a magazine say
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:04,832	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	That they were convenient
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:05,856	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	A bunch of
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:09,184	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Designer is to volunteer to say how they would
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,208	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Design the logo
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:10,976	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Cuz it was so horrible
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:15,584	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	And so like we'd like to know how would you design if you could have done anything and I sort of
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:16,864	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	You know I just said all you know
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:18,912	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	I think I'll pass
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:24,288	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	So tell me a bit more how they Hillary logo
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:27,616	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	It used to be that people would run for
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:29,920	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Political office and they didn't understand
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:31,712	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	But they needed a while ago and maybe they didn't
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:32,480	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Need a logo
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:35,040	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Barack Obama changed all that in
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:38,112	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	2008 Duran and
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:40,928	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	He had this now famous
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:42,208	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	O for Obama
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:43,744	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	In blue with sort of
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,024	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Red
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:47,072	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Stripes leaving
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:49,120	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Into the center of the o with
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,656	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	The old-time symbolizing
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:52,960	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	A setting or probably more likely a rising sun
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:56,032	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	And that symbol was so ubiquitous both
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:04:00,128	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	In 2008 the fact that he one kind of sealed the deal
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:00,896	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	It appeared
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:04,224	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Over the next eight years representing his candidacy in the world
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:06,784	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Go on to Brandeis Zoom

EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:21,887	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	One way or another had one bailout logo and very early on in
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:22,911	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	2015
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:25,215	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Beginning of the year I got a call from
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:25,983	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Team that was
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:27,007	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Was Consulting with Hillary
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:28,287	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Frequently asked me whether I
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:30,335	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Would volunteer my services
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:33,151	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Create a logo for secretary Clinton
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:37,247	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	And what we wanted to do was exploit some of the
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:38,783	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Characteristics that
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:41,087	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	People would come to appreciate I think
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:42,367	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Possibly by accident
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:43,135	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	And about the Obama wall
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:46,463	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	One of which was that it could be adapted
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:48,511	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Two different forms you could have
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:50,815	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	You could kind of why customized at four different groups
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:51,839	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	The Boulders are different
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:52,607	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Locations
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:53,119	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Senso
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:56,447	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	We have this idea like what if we had a symbol that you could
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:57,983	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Change every day if you want
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:04:59,263	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	If you can make it
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:04:59,775	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Celebrate
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:01,055	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	LGB
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:04,895	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Meteorites one day and celebrate Veterans the next day and then modified
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:08,479	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	For Memorial Day the day after that or Halloween the day after that
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:10,783	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Listening very simple
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:12,575	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	So we can wrap this very simple h
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:13,343	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	With an arrow going
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:15,135	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Kind of symbolizes
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:16,927	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	We thought that the candidate was moving
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:18,463	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Country forward and also
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:19,231	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Forgiving us
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:19,999	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	A way to
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:20,767	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	You kind of
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:22,815	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Point that age that other thing
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:23,583	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Meaning that Hillary
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:24,863	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	4
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:25,375	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Or better in

EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:27,935	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	For me
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:30,751	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	And it just kind of like proved to be a really

EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:13,247	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Tencent Javits Convention Center that night
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:13,759	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	For the

EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:04,255	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	So the Hillary H with an arrow logo is released in people react to it the way they
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:09,887	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	React to any logo right now is really active discussion online whenever a new one is
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:11,423	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Done
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:13,215	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	It is also in the context of this political campaign
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:14,495	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	She got
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:20,127	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Unbelievable not a criticism no matter what she did but I remember people reacting to
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:21,151	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	The age of the arrow
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:22,943	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Willie strongly some of it quite an egg
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:24,479	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Were you

EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:29,087	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Would have taken me aback
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:35,487	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	What I should have seen coming is that logo was I actually personally thought was and still think was really good I mean
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:38,303	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	No it was exactly the one that we wanted
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:42,143	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	The campaign to use we are confident that over
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:48,543	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	The course of the campaign will be used in all sorts of ways that would win people over and I think I was largely proven out
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:49,823	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	I mean I think by
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:53,151	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	The time November came around if you sort of like went on the

EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:30,783	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Got pretty close to

EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:38,399	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	And I don't think we can ask people to notice our work and thinking

EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:49,055	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	That and the other
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:50,591	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Clever logo that combined
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:53,919	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	The words Big Town written out with the number 11
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:54,943	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Kind of hiding by the
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:55,711	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	74 town
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:59,295	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	So we sort of like you could do with simultaneously read
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:01,599	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	10 and 11 while looking at it which I just thought was
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:05,439	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	You know it's a nice solution to a problem which actually
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:09,279	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Shouldn't be focused on you know I mean let's not celebrate this weird
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:10,815	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Disconnect between
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:12,351	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	The name of the conference
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:13,119	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	The number of actual
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:15,167	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	And they were going to 12
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:19,775	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	The whole thing was they decided to kind of what just come up with a logo that wasn't
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:21,055	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Based on
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:22,079	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	The actual number team
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:27,199	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Call the Big Ten Conference so we did basically a logo that was
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:29,247	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Made out of the letters big4
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:31,039	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Big and then we did a treatment
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:34,367	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	The eye and big in the G and Biggs would have a double reed
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:35,391	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	The number to
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:37,695	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	And so when that was unveiled
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:40,255	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Oh I actually got voicemail about if
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:42,047	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Trampoline
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:48,191	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	What's wrong with you people are those people are the loyal fans and I remember someone at all the big tank on
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:50,751	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	When this logo launch sort of telling me
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:51,775	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	This is the
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:56,895	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	This is the passion that kind of makes him sit in those seats when the weather is terrible and
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:19:00,735	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	And the same pasture to make them take it personally when you put it with the logo f***
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:02,271	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	What happens is
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,807	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Once people get over the shock
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:06,111	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	If you can hold on tight
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:07,391	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Don't get
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:10,463	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Used to the new logo and
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:13,535	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	If it's any good at all it'll soon be the Beloved
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:16,607	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Big Ten logo and people will sort of like then
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:22,495	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Lumberjack the next time it's changed as long as people still care about the big toenail care about it every time is change
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:25,311	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	And I have to admit we're entering a stage now where
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:27,359	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	I have work
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:28,383	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	The clients on
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:33,503	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Doing logos and doing updates to logos where I can tell
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:35,039	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	The worst thing that could happen
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:36,063	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	When is if no one react
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:36,575	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Acted at all
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:39,391	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	The best thing would be if every analog dead
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:40,159	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	But the
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:41,951	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	The worst will be of no one knows
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:43,999	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Is there like happiness or white tape
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:45,023	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	The outrage just
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:45,791	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Because
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:51,167	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Wow people really care about us it's easy people to care about a sports team or university
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,959	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	It's a little bit harder to make people
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:53,727	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Don't care about her

EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:02,175	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	And I think it's actually
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:03,711	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	What harder to make it will care about Finance
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:05,503	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	The more abstract

EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:26,495	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	The depth of feeling they have about the

EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:29,823	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	So
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:31,103	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	It's a little bit bad news equal

EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:43,903	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	With those Buckeye fans
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:46,975	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	I had this policy of
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:47,999	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Responding
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:53,375	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	They found out somehow it came out that we're done in the people found our emails and I start getting forwarded
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:55,167	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	These emails that had a lot of
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:59,263	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	How dare you were out of here how much you charge you should be ashamed of yourself for

EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:43,520	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Knights when they have a
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:48,640	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	What's the type of criticism where you just like that's not
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:54,016	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	If you design something new people for some reason are so
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:57,344	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Desperate to reconcile it with something already
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:25:00,160	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Familiar with that they'll say oh that looks exactly like this other
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:02,208	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	And sometimes
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:06,816	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Depending on their frame of mind they'll say that looks exactly like this other thing that could be
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:08,352	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Something Bailey
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:09,120	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Smarty like

EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:14,752	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Anatomy or something like that looks like so much of that goes around
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:21,152	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	And no matter what you design you know they have this very human need to kind of turn abstract shapes into something
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:22,176	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Figurative that means something
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:26,784	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Really I mean what logos are meant to be
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:27,808	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Empty vessels
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:28,832	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Into which meaning is
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:30,112	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Poornima meaning
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:32,928	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	When they work right is the meaning that your first-hand experience
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:35,232	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Represented by the logo
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:36,000	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	And I thank God
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:38,560	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	When someone just says oh that looks like a
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:42,656	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Did you see it you know this sort of is tough also
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:45,472	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	I've never actually committed this are all the way but
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:52,384	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	If you're practicing graphic designer. Young graphic designer out there I'll one bit of advice I have is if you're like working on a

EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:58,528	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	You know it's a geometric logo with a
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:00,576	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	The four parts
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:01,344	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Kind of thing
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:03,136	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	The kind of Hazzard
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:05,696	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	A rotational angular rotational aspect
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:07,744	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	If someone says
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:09,536	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	That kind of reminds me of a swastika
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:12,864	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	You won't just
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:15,680	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	You know that's a signal you should
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:17,472	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	That that logo will not be
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:18,240	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Presented
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:24,640	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	To anyone just put it away actually that sort of his life that that's close to me you can say it looks like a penis and like
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:26,688	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	You can actually get over that but I mean
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:27,968	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	What was
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:29,248	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	It's just like really
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:32,320	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	I remember I was going to a meeting with a

EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:49,984	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Carry the thing
EDL	00:26:49,984	00:26:52,544	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	It's about meeting and not even being a minister me in there
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:55,360	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	It was like an intern in The Intern

EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:13,024	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	I guess I hate that the most

EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:47,488	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Overtime had the most change of heart about it like a

EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:42,272	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Really idiocy
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:43,040	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Democratic and weird
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:49,696	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	But the same time I was thinking out but if you go to the mat there was a big complicated idiosyncratic

EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:56,352	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Inside it has so much stuff there

EDL	00:30:09,408	00:30:11,712	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	So I remember I looked at in the ICU

EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:14,272	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Taste me back some
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:15,552	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	I was used to the old
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:19,648	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	But I can recognize that in the long run I think
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:20,928	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Get well if they stick with it ice

EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:28,096	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	When you say

EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:30,912	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Just like in general

EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:41,408	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	I mean I hate to say it but just like everyone else I'll look at something and say

EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:44,992	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Rather ugly isn't it
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:50,112	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	You know in like you know I mean something like I mean for rent since we want to talk about another another design

EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:58,560	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Widely criticized and I think right

EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:04,448	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	People criticized because I think that that was like

EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:24,416	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	It just had to kind of like symbolize what was happening
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:25,696	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	In a specific place

EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:30,304	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	And would be further associated with all these kind of
EDL	00:31:30,304	00:31:32,864	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Feats of athleticism that would be the last

EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:44,640	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Come to stand for all those other things however I still think
EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:49,504	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	I just like just like ugly it's a Ramon gainly it's like weird looking
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:52,320	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	I couldn't I could never quite I have to admit
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:54,624	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	I personally and privately need
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:55,904	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	To make up a story that

EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:34,496	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	And some have that quality and I just answered you can be a mean withholding sword
EDL	00:38:34,496	00:38:38,848	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	So I have a bunch of listeners there be no design aware their design engaged

EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:50,112	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	What would you want them to know when they interact with you
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:51,904	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Like what what type of criticism
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:53,184	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Would you
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:55,232	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Like to hear or not like to hear
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:39:00,096	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Ice or do you want to field we're like almost like a lot of the things that
EDL	00:39:00,096	00:39:00,608	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Define
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:02,400	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	When I do
EDL	00:39:02,400	00:39:04,704	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Comes down to really boring sort of
EDL	00:39:05,728	00:39:06,496	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Sayings
EDL	00:39:06,496	00:39:09,056	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	It's like don't judge a book by its cover
EDL	00:39:09,056	00:39:11,872	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Or on the other hand you only get one chance to make a first time
EDL	00:39:11,872	00:39:12,640	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Compression
EDL	00:39:12,640	00:39:16,736	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Until they all kind of contradict each other you know and you know
EDL	00:39:17,248	00:39:19,296	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	The advice I give is that on
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:21,600	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	At the end of the day
EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:23,392	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Graphic design is
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:25,184	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Really important
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:28,000	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	But it's also kind of
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:35,168	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	One of those cosmetic things in the world to know if you can read an exit sign you're going to get out the door you know
EDL	00:39:35,680	00:39:37,984	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	If a door has no door knob on it with snails
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:40,288	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Close in all these are all things that are real and Padme
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:42,848	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	It's what that exit sign can be in any type face you want
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:43,872	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	I'm still going to find the door
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:50,784	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	And so I think it's some now you can make a handsome exit sign that actually fits the architecture around that you can make one
EDL	00:39:50,784	00:39:52,576	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	One that's hard to read
EDL	00:39:52,576	00:39:55,136	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	And that one is going to be dysfunctional
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:39:58,720	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	But there's a lot of different ways to do it and usually it's not a life-or-death thing
EDL	00:39:58,720	00:40:04,864	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	I think there's a lot of things that are like really life-and-death matters in the world and really important are worth getting agitated about
EDL	00:40:04,864	00:40:07,680	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	I think that probably logo design
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:09,472	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Shouldn't be one of them
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:11,520	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	There's people that are paid alot of money to
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:14,080	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	TUC care desperately about the way logos look and
EDL	00:40:14,592	00:40:17,408	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	I aspire to be one of those people I think that
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:20,736	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	If your not getting paid to do it's like trying not to
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:24,576	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	To do it too much only do degree it entertains you but then move on to more important
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:29,696	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Michael bierut is a partner at pentagram

EDL	00:42:43,839	00:42:47,167	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	So few weeks ago I had a conversation in front of a live audience at
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:48,447	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Spur in Oakland
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:51,775	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	With my pal Kevin smokler about his book Brat Pack America
EDL	00:42:52,287	00:42:58,175	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Which is this like 300 Page Love Letter to all the places where your favorite 80s teen movies were sad
EDL	00:42:58,175	00:43:04,575	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	I really enjoyed the book and our conversation but after I record it I learned that if you aren't as well versed in the 80s movies
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:06,879	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Genre as I am you might get a little lost
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:13,279	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	End the conversation just worked way better on the website we could have bed all the pictures of places that were talking about in the trailers from the movie along with

EDL	00:43:19,167	00:43:19,935	| 99pi-0251-negativespace-1 |	Quora conversation
