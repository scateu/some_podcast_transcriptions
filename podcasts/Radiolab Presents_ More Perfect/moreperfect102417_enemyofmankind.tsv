EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:40,864	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Okay so I grew up at a time
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:45,472	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	When a lot of people genuinely saw America differently than they do now
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:48,544	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	This is the 70s and 80s Carter Reagan years

EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:53,920	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	America was special
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:55,456	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Exceptional
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:58,016	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	We held the world to a higher standard

EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:13,376	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	About that
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:20,544	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	What was that is that higher calling that's somehow For Better or Worse embedded in the idea of being American is
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:26,944	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	That stupidly wrongheaded and arrogant or is there something in that that we still

EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:33,919	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And there he set up a clinic to give Medical Care to the poor indigenous
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:38,271	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Farmers in that area 47000 people
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:44,415	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	He was the only doctor in a lot of cities that became kind of like a patron saint of the countryside
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:51,327	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Not only would give the medical treatment but when they came in he would tell them go vote rise above your station
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:53,887	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And as you can imagine as word got out

EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:27,167	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	What part of this like big network of dictators
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:31,007	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	All across Latin America and it was called Operation Condor
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:32,543	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Operation Condor
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:37,663	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Was a network that link together military dictatorships of Latin America so

EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:43,807	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Bolivia Uruguay Paraguay
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:46,623	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Renee said the Operation Condor was a lot like a spider web

EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:57,119	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Super militaristic dictatorships
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:06:02,495	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	They banded together to pretty much trap communism in Cuba out of South America
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:07,359	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Remember this is a cold war in America really wanted to keep communism out of the continent to
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:09,407	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	So it's really likely that the
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:10,175	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The CIA was involved
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:14,527	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The result was a network of state-sponsored Terror

EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:51,007	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And this is a transgression
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:52,799	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	A laughable scam
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:55,359	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Which is kind of

EDL	00:19:57,055	00:19:58,079	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And the

EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:01,151	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Agreed

EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:05,759	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	That's ridiculous
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:07,039	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	All that
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:08,063	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Causes France to say
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:09,087	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	You know what

EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:17,023	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Maybe we can't take this brand new country seriously
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:19,071	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Give me some land of no law
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:28,287	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Huge thing and you got to keep in mind at that time United States was a third world nation
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:33,151	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	We were weak France had been our buddy during the revolution
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:34,175	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And the feeling was
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:38,015	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	We desperately needed the help of other countries
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:44,159	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Because it reduces baby little country by the way the Dutch Ambassador was Furious to because he said
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:45,439	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	If you don't
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:46,975	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Punished long jobs
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:48,255	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	I'm leaving the state
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:50,303	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	He actually threatened to leave
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:51,071	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	State
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:52,607	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	It really created
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:53,119	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Problems
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:54,911	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	So we had to do some
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:56,959	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	But the question was
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:59,263	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	What the national government
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:01,567	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Had no Authority whatsoever
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:03,871	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	To deal with or punish
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:04,895	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	A person like lingerie
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:08,735	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Because it wasn't a crime to just say I will dishonor you
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:10,527	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And even if it were
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:14,623	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The incident happened at what was essentially the French Embassy
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:15,903	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Samovar you
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:16,928	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	That that made it
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:20,000	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	This is a situation outside of the United
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:23,328	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	States so I step in there and I'm also the only under the rules
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:24,864	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Yeah that's the argue
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:27,424	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	YouTube did we have jurisdiction over that space
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:31,520	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	My point is that the new US Government they were just powerless
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:32,544	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	I didn't know what to do
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:34,336	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	What happened
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:35,872	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Well the case goes to court
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:39,456	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And the judge in that case
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:41,248	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Figure out what to do
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:42,016	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Really badly

EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:03,680	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	This french guy in Philadelphia

EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:09,312	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	We're going to solve this is
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:10,080	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	By saying that

EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:12,640	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	He's a little bit like a pirate

EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:57,184	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Protected the Dutch Ambassador doesn't leave he stays but more importantly
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:57,952	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Our story
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:24:01,536	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	In 79 Congress passed some of their very first laws
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:03,072	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	There's like this one big Bill about
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:04,864	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Courts and in there
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:07,424	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Is this thing called the alien tort
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:07,936	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Statute
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:11,008	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The only force that shoot
EDL	00:24:11,008	00:24:14,592	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	You know it was written into law to deal with this kind of situation
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:15,104	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	You are a diplomat
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:16,384	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Insulted
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:21,760	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	But more generally it was meant to connect us law
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:22,272	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	To internet
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:27,136	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Simplifying with a bunch but it basically says like
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:30,208	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Somebody violates International norms
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:31,232	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	You know like a
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:33,024	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Crime against the whole world
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:34,816	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	They can be sued in US Civil Court
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:37,376	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	But you're saying there's a law
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:40,192	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	From the beginning that allows and non us
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:42,752	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Sue each other for non us crime
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:44,032	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	In US courts
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:45,056	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Yeah
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:46,592	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	So weird
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:51,456	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	But like the thing is this is this is Kelli again when it comes to this law
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:52,992	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Forever no one actually used it
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:56,320	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	It was barely mentioned for 200 years
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:57,856	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Why
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:59,136	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Why wouldn't it come up
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:01,696	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	If you think about it kind of makes sense it wasn't used
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:02,208	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Because
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:08,352	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	It was a super specific LOL this is a weird circumstance in which we really needed to bring international law
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:10,144	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And use it inside our borders
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:12,192	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	But that kind of thing like
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:12,960	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Diplomatic
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:15,520	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Bite that didn't happen very often
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:17,312	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And more generally
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:19,872	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The prevailing idea at the time was that
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:21,920	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Internationally we should
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:24,992	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Kind of Stan are laying like if you're going to come into our country
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:28,832	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And that's what are citizens of gal we're going to do something about that but
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:31,904	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	If you want to do something to your own citizens
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:35,744	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	That's not my business
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:40,608	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	There's an old idea that in every country The Government Can
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:47,008	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Due to its people whatever it wants and a nobody in any foreign country no foreign government has any biz
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:48,032	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Business telling them what to do
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:51,616	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	This is Eric Posner the University of
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:54,944	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The reason that the alien tort statute was
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:58,272	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Pretty much ignored is because of this idea
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:05,184	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	That we're not going to tell you what to do in your borders so don't you come into our country and tell us what to do
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:08,768	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Don't know this but there was actually a humanitarian basis for this
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:10,304	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Harsh sounding princip
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:12,864	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Came about in the 17th century
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:17,472	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The problem back in the 17th century were religious wars
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:23,616	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Protestants and Catholics Catholics and the Protestants endless strife and so the idea was
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:25,408	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Let's simplify things
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:31,808	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And just understand that in foreign countries people have different values and ideas and it just not
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:33,344	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Decorah good in the long run if
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:34,368	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	If we try to
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:36,672	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Tell people in foreign countries how they should behave
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:38,976	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And this was the dominant
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:39,744	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	View
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:40,768	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Hundreds of years
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:43,072	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Until World War II really
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:48,704	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	But the Hulk has changed everything
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:53,312	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	At one of the defenses that Nazis
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:59,456	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Gave to the specific charge of massacring Jews is that they're protected by the principal siren
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:06,112	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	That was you know considered unacceptable argument and countries around the world basically agreed
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:08,928	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	That limits had to be put on sovereignty
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:11,488	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And those limits would be known as human rights
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:20,192	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And a few years later in 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:28,128	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	On which they are organized in suddenly
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:31,456	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	All eyes turn to human rights

EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:44,000	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Want to bring human rights to the world now
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:53,472	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And the human rights movement was very exciting you know there were rock concerts in
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:59,872	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	You know it's Joan Baez and a lot
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:01,920	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	You know rock stars on

EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:01,120	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The judge ruled against them
EDL	00:31:02,144	00:31:04,960	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	But they appeal to the second circuit
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:05,984	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And ultimately
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:10,848	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	A judge orders Kenya to pay 10 million dollars to Dolly and her family
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:12,896	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	What they want

EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:24,672	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	In the Florida case
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:30,816	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	They convinced the second circuit that the alien tort statute

EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:39,776	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	They say look I'm torture is now like piracy
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:46,176	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	That's all an explosion of cases that mean in 1984

EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:26,368	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Flooding into American Court
EDL	00:32:26,368	00:32:30,464	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The reason this statute is so important is it at its American law
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:34,816	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	It gives American lawyers who want to use their legal training
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:36,352	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Something to do with part of this
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:39,168	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Lawyers can save the world

EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:48,384	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	It's hard to underestimate just how much impacted
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:55,808	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	This is Katherine Gallagher also from the center for constitutional rights

EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:18,080	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Could do
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:19,360	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	There were a lot of folks
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:25,760	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Especially in the American legal system who felt like America had never been a greater force for good in the

EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:33,952	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	But

EDL	00:33:36,256	00:33:37,024	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Wasn't so sure

EDL	00:34:15,936	00:34:19,008	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	American human rights lawyers are feeling really good about themselves
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:20,544	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	But

EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:38,464	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	As the legal advice with the state department that
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:41,024	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	They thought that the alien tort statute
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:42,560	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Was in fact itself
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:45,376	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	A violation of international law
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:46,400	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Because
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:48,448	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	It allowed
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:49,472	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Us judges
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:52,288	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	To have jurisdiction over

EDL	00:34:57,920	00:34:59,456	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Instead of dialing it back
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:01,248	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Human rights lawyers decided
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:03,040	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Why not push it
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:04,064	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Even further
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:09,952	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Surrounding 25
EDL	00:35:09,952	00:35:13,280	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Give me the big leap they decided that instead of just going after
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:15,328	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Individuals with foreign government officials
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:19,168	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	They were going to use this law to go after foreign corporations
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:24,032	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	When the first alien tort statute cases were filed against corporations
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:28,128	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	These cases were really seeing as
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:30,432	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Is slightly crazy
EDL	00:35:30,432	00:35:34,528	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	How can you do this these are corporations these are not government
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:36,064	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	These are not dictators
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:38,368	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	How can you see them under this law

EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:48,608	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	What better example of pirates do we have nowadays
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:50,400	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The multinational corporation
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:53,728	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	If you want to go all the way you could say
EDL	00:35:53,728	00:35:54,752	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Babies big
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:36:01,152	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Massive entities that just can reach out the chemicals into any countries between jurisdiction move from one

EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:10,112	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	When you try and pin them down like when you want to hold them accountable
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:12,672	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Banish
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:15,744	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	So yeah
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:16,768	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	All that sounds
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:18,304	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Really
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:18,816	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Abstract
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:21,888	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	For me it didn't really register like

EDL	00:42:02,623	00:42:03,903	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And therefore
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:05,951	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Could be tried in American courts
EDL	00:42:05,951	00:42:06,719	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Yeah
EDL	00:42:06,719	00:42:08,767	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And as you can imagine they got pushed back
EDL	00:42:08,767	00:42:09,791	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	In this case.
EDL	00:42:09,791	00:42:10,303	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Challenged
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:12,351	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	All the way up to the Supreme Court
EDL	00:42:12,863	00:42:19,263	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Ruger argument first this morning in case 10 1491 kiobel vs Royal Dutch petroleum
EDL	00:42:19,263	00:42:23,103	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	This case was actually argued twice but we're combining them here for Simplicity
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:26,431	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	So the basic issue in this case seems really simple at first
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:28,991	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Can you use this law against Corporation
EDL	00:42:29,759	00:42:33,343	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Like if you read the full article decisions
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:36,159	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Like the pirate and slave trader before him
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:37,951	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	An enemy of all mankind
EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:44,351	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	This is Justice Kagan actually reading from the Florida decision and saying you know we
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:48,447	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The Court decide this is okay
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:49,983	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The word today's Pirates
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:53,567	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	So the question was are corporations in that category
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:55,615	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Baby considered today's Pirates
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:57,919	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The principal issue before this court
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:43:00,991	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Is whether a corporation can ever be held liable
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:07,391	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	For violating fundamental human rights Norms under the alien tort statute
EDL	00:43:07,391	00:43:08,671	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Nigerians bringing the case
EDL	00:43:08,671	00:43:11,231	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And it won't let me start by saying that

EDL	00:44:42,879	00:44:49,023	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	We thought the argument went extremely well and we really did not see how
EDL	00:44:49,535	00:44:50,559	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	We should lose
EDL	00:44:51,071	00:44:51,839	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	But then
EDL	00:44:51,839	00:44:54,143	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	It was shells turn trouble is that
EDL	00:44:54,143	00:44:56,191	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The choice to pursue corporations
EDL	00:44:56,703	00:45:00,031	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Santiam on again the goose that laid the golden egg
EDL	00:45:00,031	00:45:01,311	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Because on the one hand
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:03,615	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	It makes sense to shift

EDL	00:45:09,503	00:45:11,551	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	To hire the best lawyers they can buy
EDL	00:45:12,063	00:45:13,087	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Where is like

EDL	00:45:17,183	00:45:20,767	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Kathleen Sullivan got up there she and the defense team basically
EDL	00:45:20,767	00:45:23,839	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Sidestep the whole issue of whether corporations
EDL	00:45:23,839	00:45:28,447	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Should or should not be considered Pirates whether this law should or should not be applied to corporations

EDL	00:45:30,495	00:45:31,007	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Bigger
EDL	00:45:32,031	00:45:37,407	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	They started talking about all the reasons why I actually use in the 80s for non-american crimes
EDL	00:45:37,407	00:45:38,943	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	I feel really bad idea
EDL	00:45:39,711	00:45:40,479	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	For anyone
EDL	00:45:40,991	00:45:43,039	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	I came down to three main points
EDL	00:45:43,551	00:45:44,319	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	1
EDL	00:45:44,319	00:45:46,879	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Reciprocity
EDL	00:45:46,879	00:45:52,255	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Battle United States Court
EDL	00:45:52,255	00:45:55,583	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Anywhere in the world regardless of the place of the conduct
EDL	00:45:55,583	00:45:57,375	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The other nations of the world 19
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:46:02,495	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	To do the same to us basically if we can take people from other countries and try them in our courts
EDL	00:46:03,007	00:46:09,407	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	What's stopping them from doing that to us
EDL	00:46:09,407	00:46:15,807	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	To the principal against International friction is at its highest
EDL	00:46:15,807	00:46:22,207	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Nightmare you're basically saying other countries that you didn't elect win like them either frankly I didn't vote for them
EDL	00:46:22,207	00:46:23,999	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	You didn't vote for them they were appointed
EDL	00:46:25,023	00:46:26,047	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And now
EDL	00:46:26,047	00:46:32,447	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	They're going to be patrolling international law are we really comfortable with that and I want to stress that
EDL	00:46:32,447	00:46:35,007	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The point is that the u.s. is projecting here
EDL	00:46:35,007	00:46:37,567	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Our law on to foreign countries
EDL	00:46:37,567	00:46:38,335	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And finally
EDL	00:46:41,407	00:46:42,175	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	On the most
EDL	00:46:42,687	00:46:44,735	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Basic level
EDL	00:46:45,503	00:46:49,599	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	What distance does the kids like that have in the course of the United States
EDL	00:46:49,599	00:46:52,159	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	How is any of our business
EDL	00:46:52,671	00:46:58,559	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	To the United States what's the weather at the point that really jive with Justice Alito
EDL	00:46:58,559	00:47:02,655	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The United States has nothing to do
EDL	00:47:02,655	00:47:03,423	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	In a way
EDL	00:47:04,447	00:47:05,215	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	In that moment
EDL	00:47:06,495	00:47:08,287	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	He's captured how
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:09,311	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	America hits
EDL	00:47:09,311	00:47:09,823	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Shifted
EDL	00:47:10,591	00:47:13,919	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	We didn't want to pretend to be that shining City on the hill anymore
EDL	00:47:14,943	00:47:15,711	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	That was over
EDL	00:47:17,503	00:47:21,855	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	For the court in case number 10 1491
EDL	00:47:21,855	00:47:25,951	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Kiobel and others vs Royal Dutch petroleum company and others
EDL	00:47:25,951	00:47:31,583	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Indian the court decided to rule in favor of shell and Royal Dutch petroleum
EDL	00:47:31,583	00:47:35,679	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Wrote the decision in 1822
EDL	00:47:35,679	00:47:41,567	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	But no nation has ever yet pretended to be the Customs moron of the whole world the guardian of morals
EDL	00:47:41,567	00:47:42,335	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The whole world
EDL	00:47:43,359	00:47:49,759	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	It's just a matter of common sense that when Congress passes a law it is passing a law that applies in the United States
EDL	00:47:49,759	00:47:51,039	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	You're not some other country
EDL	00:47:51,039	00:47:51,807	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Unless
EDL	00:47:51,807	00:47:53,087	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The law tells us otherwise
EDL	00:47:54,623	00:47:56,927	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Regulating conduct abroad
EDL	00:47:56,927	00:47:59,487	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Serious foreign-policy consequences
EDL	00:47:59,487	00:48:03,839	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And courts are and should be reluctant to invite such consequences
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:06,655	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Unless that is was Congress clearly intended
EDL	00:48:07,679	00:48:13,823	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The wasting no reason is that the extraterritorial conduct conduct that's outside the United States
EDL	00:48:14,591	00:48:16,383	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Isn't going to count
EDL	00:48:16,383	00:48:18,687	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	It had there has to be some relationship
EDL	00:48:18,687	00:48:19,711	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	To the United States
EDL	00:48:20,223	00:48:23,295	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Basically they took the 80s and they clipped its wings
EDL	00:48:23,295	00:48:24,575	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Do you feel like Z
EDL	00:48:27,391	00:48:31,231	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	I'll tell you the read that they start bringing my mind and I'm wondering if you would agree or you
EDL	00:48:31,231	00:48:33,023	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Stupid
EDL	00:48:33,535	00:48:36,863	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The sense that I have with the ATS is that
EDL	00:48:38,143	00:48:40,703	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	It came about in the moment great idealism and Hope
EDL	00:48:41,727	00:48:44,287	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And now after the fog has cleared so to speak
EDL	00:48:45,311	00:48:47,359	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	It seems to represent not
EDL	00:48:47,359	00:48:49,151	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Hope it knife day
EDL	00:48:49,151	00:48:50,687	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The fact that we think
EDL	00:48:50,687	00:48:51,711	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	We can change the world
EDL	00:48:52,479	00:48:53,759	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	It's that easy
EDL	00:48:54,783	00:48:59,135	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The 80s and that it's falling out of favor somehow represents in a way that way in which we fall
EDL	00:48:59,647	00:49:01,695	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And had a kind of sober Awakening
EDL	00:49:02,463	00:49:04,511	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	I wonder do you feel like human rights
EDL	00:49:06,559	00:49:08,607	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	In the way we understood it is dead
EDL	00:49:08,607	00:49:09,375	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Now it's
EDL	00:49:09,375	00:49:11,935	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	I think it's transformed our idealism
EDL	00:49:12,447	00:49:13,727	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	But maybe
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:18,079	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The disaster in kiobel was a moment of kind of stepping back
EDL	00:49:18,591	00:49:20,127	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	To think a bit more broadly
EDL	00:49:20,127	00:49:21,919	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Play about how we can make the world a better
EDL	00:49:22,943	00:49:26,527	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And Samuel moyn says we do need to rethink some things
EDL	00:49:26,527	00:49:29,087	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Maybe frankly it's a little dishonest to judge
EDL	00:49:29,087	00:49:32,927	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Pretend the America brings Justice to the world
EDL	00:49:32,927	00:49:35,231	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	America was founded on the idea of
EDL	00:49:35,231	00:49:37,279	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Human right now which was the first nation in the hist
EDL	00:49:37,279	00:49:40,863	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	For the world to be found it explicitly on such an idea which is
EDL	00:49:40,863	00:49:44,703	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	It's not really true nns Dave presented their cases
EDL	00:49:45,215	00:49:48,031	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The human rights movement leaves out how much
EDL	00:49:48,031	00:49:52,895	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	The United States has often been involved in the evil they're portraying in court
EDL	00:49:52,895	00:49:56,479	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	So at the very least he says that what this decision shows us is that
EDL	00:49:56,991	00:49:59,039	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Before we run around judging other countries
EDL	00:49:59,551	00:50:01,599	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	To take a hard look at ourselves
EDL	00:50:02,111	00:50:07,231	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	More importantly and we can avoid the question what's the best bang for our buck
EDL	00:50:07,743	00:50:09,279	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	It's just not
EDL	00:50:09,279	00:50:11,327	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Proven yet that 80s is it
EDL	00:50:11,327	00:50:12,863	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	He said all you really had was
EDL	00:50:12,863	00:50:16,959	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	A few individuals who won cases and by the way most of them never got any money
EDL	00:50:17,727	00:50:18,239	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Really
EDL	00:50:18,751	00:50:19,519	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Yeah
EDL	00:50:19,519	00:50:21,055	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Dali didn't get paid
EDL	00:50:21,567	00:50:23,103	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	You know after she won
EDL	00:50:23,103	00:50:24,127	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Kenya flag
EDL	00:50:24,127	00:50:24,895	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Again
EDL	00:50:24,895	00:50:29,759	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	And so in a way that the alien tort statute didn't have far to fall to begin with
EDL	00:50:30,271	00:50:32,063	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Symbolic victory
EDL	00:50:32,063	00:50:33,599	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	You could definitely see it that way
EDL	00:50:34,879	00:50:36,927	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Do you feel like you got Justice
EDL	00:50:36,927	00:50:38,207	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Did what did you get here today
EDL	00:50:39,999	00:50:41,023	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Badali Florida good
EDL	00:50:41,535	00:50:42,303	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Doesn't
EDL	00:50:42,303	00:50:43,583	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	You didn't get
EDL	00:50:43,583	00:50:45,119	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Any money back correct
EDL	00:50:45,119	00:50:48,447	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Yeah but it never was for important for the money
EDL	00:50:48,447	00:50:50,751	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Indecent the money won't pay
EDL	00:50:50,751	00:50:53,055	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Don't blame me rafelito
EDL	00:50:53,567	00:50:54,847	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	A fine
EDL	00:50:56,127	00:50:57,151	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Jacalito
EDL	00:50:58,431	00:50:59,967	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	Not normal you live album
EDL	00:51:01,247	00:51:03,807	| moreperfect102417_enemyofmankind |	I know how to say that they need some time but
