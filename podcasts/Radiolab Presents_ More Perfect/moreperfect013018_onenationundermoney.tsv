EDL	00:00:25,344	00:00:26,880	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	At the very beginning
EDL	00:00:26,880	00:00:27,648	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Of more perfect
EDL	00:00:28,672	00:00:29,184	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Several years ago
EDL	00:00:30,208	00:00:32,512	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	I started to show it was out of a very
EDL	00:00:33,024	00:00:33,792	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Basic
EDL	00:00:33,792	00:00:39,168	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Desire to understand some things that I knew nothing about people talk about something I knew nothing about
EDL	00:00:40,192	00:00:43,008	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	In one of the very first questions it I bumped into
EDL	00:00:43,520	00:00:44,544	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	As a supreme court idiot
EDL	00:00:46,336	00:00:52,736	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Was it why does everybody keep talking about this thing called Commerce Clause
EDL	00:00:52,736	00:00:59,136	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	What was the Commerce Clause what the hell is it
EDL	00:00:59,136	00:01:02,208	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Section 8 Clause 3 of The Constitution 16 words

EDL	00:01:12,704	00:01:19,104	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	The four nations and among the several States and with the Indian tribes there are no more sexier words in the English language
EDL	00:01:19,104	00:01:21,920	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Better words for when we're never written

EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:54,944	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	The experience I had learning by the Commerce Clause was a little bit like watching the X-Men movies
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:02:01,856	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Initially it was like my name is Magneto why is Magneto the head of the bad guys

EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:40,256	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Pointing at it and then hit you up
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:43,072	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	He has the best power
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:50,240	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Because the whole world is made of metal she can control the world
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:56,384	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	If we build the world a different way baby not but

EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:16,000	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Something like the Commerce Clause exists
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:20,607	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Split a dollar bill issued by
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:21,887	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	A central bank

EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:31,359	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	That is James Chen professor of law at Michigan State University now the
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:36,479	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Sing about a dollar bill the awesome obvious thing is that you can
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:39,039	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Take that dollar bill and buy
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:41,855	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Some Sour Patch Kids or whatever dollar buys these days
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:43,391	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Anywhere in America
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:49,023	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	But in the late 18th century backed all the way through to the 20th century
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:53,375	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Wasn't like that no no no no no all the states have their own Banks
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:59,775	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And their own bills different sizes colors example there's a moment when South Carolina has is pretty little green South
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:01,823	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	South Carolina Bill same time Rhode Island

EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:08,991	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Square thing and if you are a South Carolinian in Rhode Island trying to buy some
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:16,159	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Carrots and potatoes let's say you hand them your South Carolina bill
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:19,231	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Well the Rhode Islanders would look at that and say why don't know what this is
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:23,839	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Who's the trust this bank right and so they would discount
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:24,863	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	No
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:30,751	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Based on the distance from their own home they would discount the note based on
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:33,055	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	How it looks how professionally drawn up it was
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:35,871	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	They might look at that $10 and say
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:38,175	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	That's only worth 8 to me
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:38,687	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Felidae
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:40,479	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Horrible way to do business
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:43,295	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Socks for the person holding the note right
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:48,159	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	So what the government decided to do is to say 8 words can use one bill
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:49,439	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Swindell
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:50,719	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	To be so much easier
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:53,535	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	This is one of the ways God was going to pull all these
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:54,815	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Different states
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:57,631	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Together they're going to regulate the currency
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:06:00,191	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And not just the currency itself they were going to regulate
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:00,959	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	The flow
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:02,495	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Of that kind
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:05,567	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And this is where the Commerce Clause comes in
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:11,199	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	This is Jamie Floyd
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:13,247	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Journalist
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:16,319	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Host of all things considered here I come
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:19,903	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	It's early in the Republican Howard 1820s
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:22,975	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Now just to hit pause for 1 second to the Commerce Clause with
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:28,607	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	The pre-existing thing in the US Constitution
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:34,751	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Thought about her or where where is it in the minds of people a day to nowhere
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:38,847	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	No we're not other people
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:46,271	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	She says 1824 to Steamboat operators get into a thing it's a business going back and forth
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:51,391	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Newark New Jersey the East think they should be the only one allowed to do that and it makes its way as we say
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:54,975	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	All the way to the US Supreme Court
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:07:00,607	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And who's sitting up there with a big bad dude named John Marshall
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:07,519	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Marshall is the sort of Rambo
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:09,055	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Of the course
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:13,151	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	He look at those 16 word Congress shall have the power to regulate
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:19,295	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Commerce with foreign Nations and among the several states he looks at those 16 words and a couple of, xandy.
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:21,599	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Pretty much for the first time
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:24,415	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Did those words give Congress the power
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:25,439	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	To regulate
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:26,719	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Commerce
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:28,255	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Between and among states
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:30,815	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	This boat is going from one state to the other
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:32,607	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	The only way to resolve that
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:34,911	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Is for the federal government to come in
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:36,703	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And controller
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:40,543	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Again the idea is it this is the only way for the country
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:43,359	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	To function as a unified thing
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:47,967	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	John Marshall's decision he says
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:50,527	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	You look we have United States of America
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:57,439	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	We don't have a divided States of America or independent States of America or New Jersey in
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:58,975	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	New York existing
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:02,303	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Separately we decided to organize
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,583	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	As a United States
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:05,119	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And so what
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:07,423	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	John Marshall says it's because of that
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:14,079	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	There has to be a power to regulate trade between those days in amongst those days when there are dispute
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,175	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Otherwise it's all going to fall apart
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:26,367	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	He was at that point that the Commerce Clause
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:28,415	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Gant glow
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:31,231	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Womb very faintly
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:37,631	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	For the next hundred years the government experiment with the Commerce Clause in cases involving
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:42,239	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Trade with Native American tribes or navigation but if you want to talk about power
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,775	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	The real power

EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:30,111	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	At this point we're talking about 1941-42 good looking
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:31,391	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Sturdy
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:37,279	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Fiercely independent I never worked for another man in my life
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:43,679	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Apparently that was his motto he would tell me that many times over the years if you had to put like Captain
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:45,215	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	In America with a pitchfork
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:47,519	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	This is
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:55,455	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	So Roscoe's got this far more than a hundred cows on it he would male cows until both of these are
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:10:00,063	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Farms went practically no catch chickens 2000s
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:06,463	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And a we had a very big Garden he would plant things you know light string beans lima beans
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:12,863	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Sweet corn potato carrots radishes different kinds of apples
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:19,263	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Trees are strawberries and raspberries
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:21,055	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And of course
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:22,335	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Sweet sweet
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:26,431	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Okay set up out of the way here's what happened
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:28,735	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	It's 1941
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:30,527	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Roscoe
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:34,111	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Senior my dad was out in the field I think on his tractor
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:38,207	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	That day he was plowing the weed or something and
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:42,303	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Apparently must have been some guy
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:45,119	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	From the
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:48,447	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Department of Agriculture Local 8
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:52,799	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	I guess going around to various farmers in our community
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:58,431	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Wanting the farmers to answer several pages I think of questions
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:04,063	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And this particular date this government gentleman came out into the field
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:04,831	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	He looked around
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:08,159	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And he said Roscoe
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:11,999	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Oceans you got 22 Acres of wheat
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:12,511	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Lesoir
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:14,047	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	You're over
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:15,071	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Your quota
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:18,911	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	He was 11.1 Acres over what was permitted
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:20,959	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And so the guy tells him he have to pay a fine
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:24,543	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	A really big fine
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:32,735	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	My dad looked over and he was just as sober as a judge in a courtroom on a murder case
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:37,343	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And what happened next would change the country forever
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:40,671	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	In ways that we are still literally living with
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:42,975	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	But Mitch's Surf fill in the gaps here
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:46,047	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Tell you what you need to know about why they're they were even having this conversation
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:54,239	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And to help me with that my name is Ari savitski and I'm an attorney friend of the show man of law
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:12:01,151	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	An important thing to understand is that you know when our story starts with Roscoe filburn agriculture
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:07,551	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Pictures of huge Returns the economy the Great Depression is happening abundant
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:13,951	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And the Dust Bowl 1930s
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:20,351	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And so you have a lot of people who rely on selling crops and buying crops and so wheat prices to matter of life
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:25,215	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Millions of Americans asking for action
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:31,615	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Ionic from now till 1938 Congress enact
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:38,015	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	What's called the agricultural adjustment act to reboot the economy so the 1938
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:41,599	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Cultural adjustment act got the federal government into the business
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:43,391	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Regulating
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:49,279	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Busy with the government did was they said to the farmers America we are going to give you essentially alone we're going to
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:52,607	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Guarantee you a certain minimum price
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:57,215	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	We're going to give you X number of dollars per bushel or whatever it is
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:13:00,031	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	That will help lift you out of poverty
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:01,567	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	In exchange for that
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:02,847	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	You have to
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:03,615	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Promises
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:06,687	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	To only grow a certain amount
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:08,991	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	It's in the big fear was that they grew too much
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:10,015	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	There be the
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:13,855	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Flood of Supply on the wheat market prices would crash
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:20,255	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And that would be bad for everyone you know we is sort of a collective action problem right everyone's going to sell as much weed as they can
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:22,303	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	But that means prices go down and everyone makes less
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:23,839	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	So with the government
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:29,215	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Decide to do in addition to giving out loans is that they placed a cap on how much wheat a person could grow
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:31,519	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	So quote a straight-up quota
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:37,663	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	That way you ensure the supply of wheat is steady and you ensured that that the prices don't cry
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:42,783	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And whole reason the government could do this regulate the entire wheat Market
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:46,879	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	What's by hendricken on the Commerce Clause has 16 words
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:47,903	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Basically said
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:53,791	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	That when something like wheat is bought and sold and moved from one place to another one state to another cross state lines
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:57,887	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Well that's Interstate Commerce and that's something that Congress can regulate
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:06,079	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	So my father having the back to Roscoe filburn without inspector
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:07,103	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	On his farm
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:07,871	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Spectra says
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:14,783	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Look Roscoe you've grown too much weed my dad looked over and he was just as sober as a judge in a courtroom
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:16,063	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Romano murder case
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:22,463	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And what do you think he says back he says wait a minute I'm going to show you exactly how I feel about that
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:23,231	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	No
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:29,375	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	That's how I feel know you government might have been a family guy she says I don't get it
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:33,215	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	I'm not I'm not have nothing to do with interstate commerce
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:33,983	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:35,263	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	This is the key
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:40,639	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Explain to the inspector that yes
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:46,527	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	According to the government quota I'm only supposed to grow about 11 acres a week and I am growing 23
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:48,575	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	But then extra 12
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:50,879	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	I'm not selling it to anybody
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:52,159	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	He doesn't sell the Wii
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:53,439	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	He doesn't trade the way
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:58,047	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	What's he doing with this week he uses all the wheat to feed his animals
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:15:00,607	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Feeding it to the farm animals the weight
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:04,191	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	He said the sum of the week to the stairs I
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:10,591	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	I was just keeping it on the farm well yeah so it's in a completely internal Operation Ivy
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:16,991	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	I mean I feel like the poor guy gets kind of dragged into a national case
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:21,599	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Who was interstate commerce to feed my cows I'm on my phone I'm doing my business
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:24,671	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Big Brother leave me alone but
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:26,463	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Big brother does not leave me alone
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:28,255	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	The inspector
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:31,071	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Says we're the government that's the law
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:32,095	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Please uphold it
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:33,631	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Pay
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:34,655	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	The fine
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:35,423	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	50 Cent
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:36,959	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	For every
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:38,495	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Access bushel I think it is
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:44,895	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Are 239 excess bushels of wheat for which she was unifying about 117 bucks
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:46,687	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	In today's dollars
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:48,223	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	It's about two grand
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:49,247	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	2 Grand
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:53,343	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	My my father
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:58,719	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Apparently he wasn't real crazy about that and I guess he didn't like that too much
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:16:01,279	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	If I have been 20 or 25 years old
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:07,423	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	I would have probably advised my father not to do what he did but I guess they sue the federal government
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:07,935	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Huh
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:14,591	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	His army was like look I'm just trying to feed my cows come on I guess it went to
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:16,895	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Are Court in Dayton Ohio
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:18,687	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	That was the first stop and I believe
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:25,855	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	That he was rambling to Roscoe the Ohio court agreed there's no
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:32,255	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Commerce of any kind going on your unlike the original case with the boat price I believe I even remember
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:38,655	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	My sister telling me that the he came home and he was just
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:40,703	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Delighted that he did win
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:41,727	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	But then
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:45,567	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Governor pills the case and
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:49,919	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	The poorest when it got to the Supreme Court of the United States
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:53,247	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	He he he lost
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:57,855	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Key lost
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:59,903	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	In a decision that I think it's fair to say
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:01,183	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Still
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:04,767	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Drives conservatives and Libertarians bonkers
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:07,327	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And I'm neither one of those things but I get it
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:09,631	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	What does Supreme Court set
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:15,007	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Is it Roscoe filburn growing that extra weed and not selling it still
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:17,567	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Counts as interstate commerce
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:20,383	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Could have that extra week causes him to not
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:21,407	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Buy it
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:23,455	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	On the market
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:30,111	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	He needs less wheat from the market in all the farmers of America did that
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:36,511	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And that be really bad for the market the idea is that if you need more wheat than the quota you go on
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:38,047	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	On the market and buy it
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:39,583	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Even though you can grow it yourself
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:45,215	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Got to buy it because if everyone can produce their quota and then whatever extra they need
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:47,263	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And pretty soon the regulation breaks
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:51,615	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Which means that the government intervention in the wheat Market will have failed
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:58,527	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	You will have to feed it or attempt to regulate this Market therefore we have to regulate even things you don't do
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:05,695	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	That is so weird it's such a mine frankly it's like
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:12,095	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	He's not doing anything we can Hartwell on Behavior this is this is Obamacare
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:12,607	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Like the health care
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:19,775	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Getting heated over Health Care the individual mandate
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:26,175	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Just explain that's a reference to Barack Obama's healthcare plan hotly-debated couple years ago
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:26,943	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Still hotly debated
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:31,807	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	What are the key ideas without plan is it in order for health care to be affordable for everyone
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:33,855	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Everyone should have to buy it
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:35,647	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	So we're going to require people
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:36,927	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	To buy insurance
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:38,207	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	What else you pay a penalty
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:44,607	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Which made a lot of people mad cuz they're like hey the government's force me to buy something I don't want my decision not to get Healthcare
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:45,375	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Is not
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:47,167	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Participation in interstate commerce
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:48,959	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	It's not even economic activity
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:51,263	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	I'm sitting here on my couch not buying
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:53,055	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	You sitting here
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:58,175	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	From the individual perspective that makes perfect sense but if you can out
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:59,967	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And Justice Kagan said this in court
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:03,807	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	It's not so simple as uninsured people
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:05,087	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Are increasing
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:10,719	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Normal family premium Congress
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:15,839	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Sitar
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:21,215	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	The price that everybody
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:27,615	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Obamacare makes sense to me so it's a way of getting back to Roscoe
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:28,383	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Things you're not
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:32,223	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Because you know farmers and Island this is the case
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:33,759	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	In which
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:38,367	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Congress receives a tremendous amount of power from the US Supreme Court
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:39,903	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Essentially this case
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:42,975	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	It says that Congress can regulate
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:46,303	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Almost anything
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:47,583	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And that is
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:50,655	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	The single most significant precedent
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:57,311	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	In the area of the Commerce Clause the Big Bang
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:10,367	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Did anyone try to raise their hand in them
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:14,975	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Will this be like whoa if you can regulate the non behavior of this American Farmer
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:21,887	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Then that's not even a slippery slope that's like a cliff that goes right down like there's no say hello to that
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:25,471	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Editorial from November 13 1942
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:30,335	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Set if the farmer who grows feed for consumption on his own Farm competes with Commerce
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:36,479	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Would not the housewife who makes herself address do so equally the net of the ruling in short seems to be
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:41,087	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Did Congress can regulate every form of economic activity if it's soda size
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:43,903	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Would not the housewife who makes herself address
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:46,975	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	You so eager like said yeah it's like yeah
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:53,375	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	If you make something with shoot I've my wife and I with our kids made these little like a miniature stuffed animals for them to play with the other day
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:55,167	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Are we then in violation of some
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:58,751	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Oh my God
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:05,919	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	After the Roscoe filburn case those 16 words in the whole definition
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:07,199	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Commerce
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:12,575	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Expand because now Commerce wasn't just the buying and selling of things it was the knot
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:13,343	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Buying and selling apps
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:15,135	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And that expansion
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:19,488	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	That would go Way Beyond we it would go into Realms much much deeper
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:21,792	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Much deeper in US
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:35,616	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	That's after the break
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:41,760	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	I'm Jared I'm Rod this is my perfect will continue in a moment
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:54,304	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Is more perfect time Chatham rod
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:58,912	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	So we had the big bang of the Commerce Clause in that Wheatfield
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:00,704	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Where Commerce
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:01,216	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Scats
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:04,800	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	We find not just what you're buying and selling but also what you're not
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:06,592	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Buying selling your negative Commerce
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:08,384	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	But at this point
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:10,688	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Sum 41 we're still talking about
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:17,856	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Markets were still talking about Commodities there comes a point when the use of the Commerce Clause goes woo
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:18,368	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Beyond that
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:20,672	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Where it gets into matters of the heart
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:22,464	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	You might say this is the moment
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:24,256	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	When the Commerce Clause gets
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:25,536	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Weaponized

EDL	00:24:56,832	00:25:03,232	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	We have this thing called the Fourteenth Amendment says no State shall deprive any person

EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:19,360	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Things like segregation
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:26,272	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Corseted work we have another 80 plus years of Jim Crow and the reason for that is it the Supreme
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:28,832	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	In court shortly after the 14th amendment was passed
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:32,928	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Kind of neutered it not kind of they did
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:39,328	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	1 ways they did was by insisting that we read the 14th Amendment as being targeted
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:45,728	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Only at States if you look at that sentence the second since the Fourteenth Amendment says no State no State shall
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:52,128	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Deprive any person of life liberty or property without depressive problem is is when
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:58,528	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	A restaurant owner like Ali McClung the nice service to Black patrons it's not

EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:40,320	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Potentially
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:40,832	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Harmful
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:45,696	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Restaurant businesses make you would miss all your way customers is that what you worried about
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:47,744	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	I mean that was a possibility
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:49,024	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:51,584	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Somebody ought to do something
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:54,656	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	So we
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:55,680	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Coming up being
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:56,448	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Once
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:28:56,960	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Do something
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:28:58,752	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	I fall asleep
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:00,544	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Today filed the suit
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:05,408	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Basically saying to the federal government you have no right to barge into our
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:06,176	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Small
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:06,944	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Independent
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:08,480	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Local business
EDL	00:29:08,480	00:29:09,248	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Start was
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:11,296	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	They can't really
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:17,440	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Tell us what to do because we're not an interstate business and that's all that the federal government regulates and
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:20,000	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Up until that point that was all they had regulator
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:24,352	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	The case went to the US District Court for the Northern District
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:27,424	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Of Alabama at the lower court level 3 Jersey special
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:28,192	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Panel
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:29,984	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	We had a unanimous
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:31,264	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Decision
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:31,776	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Our favor
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:33,824	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	The Alabama Court agreed
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:36,896	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	There was no interstate commerce happening year
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:38,176	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And that
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:39,200	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Ollie's did not have to
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:41,248	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Desegregate they could sell their ribs to whoever they want
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:42,016	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And we were
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:43,296	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Optimistic about that
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:44,832	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Government in appeals
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:47,136	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And the case
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:49,184	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	They say it goes all the way to the Supreme Court
EDL	00:29:54,304	00:30:00,704	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Right let me know explain to you how the government made this argument cuz they made it in court
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:07,104	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	October 5th 1964 General Archibald Cox
EDL	00:30:07,104	00:30:13,504	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Why the government should be allowed to use the Commerce Clause of all things to desegregate
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:19,904	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Ablaze operate a restaurant in Birmingham Alabama specializing in
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:26,304	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Barbecued Meats this is a business that sells and buys a lot of meat
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:32,704	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	July 1 1964
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:39,104	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	$69,683 to be exact and
EDL	00:30:39,104	00:30:42,432	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Birmingham Alabama to plant
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:48,576	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Song that that plan came from other states so they've moved in
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:57,536	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	In other words you think you're a local business but you're not meat is sourced from places other than Alabama
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:31:03,936	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	What about ketchup ecstatically
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:05,472	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Not minding Alabama soul
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:11,872	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	You know we bought it from a local vendor that local vendor probably bought it from somebody who bought it from somebody that got it from out of state
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:18,272	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Reaching beyond what it ever been done before basically was basically telling them the same thing they told
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:18,784	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Roscoe filburn
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:20,832	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	You are not an island
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:27,744	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And that was only the government's first argument they had another art
EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:32,864	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	That is a second then still more directly it was even more
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:34,144	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Radical
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:36,448	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Swaying racial discrimination in restaurant
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:37,728	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Interstate
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:41,312	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Which is caused by the artificial narrowing
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:42,336	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Supermarket
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:44,128	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Resulting from the eggs
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:47,456	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	So here's the argument
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:52,320	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	If you deny black people access to restaurants and hotels
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:55,904	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	You are effectively shutting down interstate travel by them
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:32:00,256	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Imports of the country where this practice is commonplace
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:01,024	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Entire
EDL	00:32:01,536	00:32:05,888	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Deep South you're limiting their ability to cross state lines and
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:08,192	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	The central argument
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:09,472	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Suggestion is that
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:12,032	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	When you discriminate against someone
EDL	00:32:13,056	00:32:14,336	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	You create
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:16,384	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Downstream
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:17,920	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Negative
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:18,944	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Commercial effects
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:21,504	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Like you create a chilling effect
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:22,784	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Because
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:27,648	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	The person you're discriminating against is then less likely to travel across state lines
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:29,184	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Send money
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:30,208	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	So in effect you are
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:34,048	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Depressing their future interstate commerce
EDL	00:32:34,048	00:32:34,816	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	If you ask
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:36,608	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Black people
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:37,888	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	With this experience
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:40,192	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	From this time.
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:42,752	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	They were universally say
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:46,080	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	We never left home unless
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:48,384	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Every Tire
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:49,408	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Was triple-check
EDL	00:32:49,920	00:32:52,480	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Every belt was triple checked in the car
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:55,040	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Because we did not want
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:58,624	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	To have a car breakdown in a hostile southern town
EDL	00:32:59,648	00:33:00,416	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And get lunch.
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:01,696	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Right right
EDL	00:33:02,208	00:33:02,976	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	It is
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:05,024	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	An entire system

EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:12,448	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Essentially the argument was discrimination is bad for business
EDL	00:33:12,960	00:33:13,472	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Expensive
EDL	00:33:13,984	00:33:14,496	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:18,080	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Ultimately in a unanimous decision
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:18,848	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	The Supreme Court
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:23,456	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Same court that 100 years earlier had basically gutted the 14th Amendment this

EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:25,760	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Agreed
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:30,624	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	That discrimination in restaurants pose significant burdens on the quote
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:34,208	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Interstate flow of food and upon the movement of products generally

EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:47,008	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	You and your dad
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:49,312	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Process that decision

EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:53,920	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Certain one who came in after that
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:33:56,224	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And they were

EDL	00:33:57,760	00:34:00,576	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	There was a group of local law civil rights leaders

EDL	00:34:02,880	00:34:04,672	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	I knew some of them by

EDL	00:34:32,064	00:34:32,576	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	No
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:36,416	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Ellen the waitress who was why you no one was

EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:44,096	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	It was now but she was
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:47,936	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Like most my employees been there a very long time
EDL	00:34:47,936	00:34:48,704	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Panda
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:50,240	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Have never
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:51,776	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Served other black folks
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:54,592	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	In a sit-down situation and
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:56,128	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And
EDL	00:34:56,128	00:34:56,640	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Of course
EDL	00:34:57,408	00:34:58,176	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	It was
EDL	00:34:58,176	00:34:58,688	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Little bit
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:02,272	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Upsetting but
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:04,832	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Different cute little hesitant at first I
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:07,648	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Answers to right hand side women
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:09,440	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	She didn't we didn't
EDL	00:35:10,208	00:35:11,232	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	That was not a problem
EDL	00:35:12,512	00:35:16,608	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	After the ruling it's not as if a lot of Black customers 70/30 coming into Ali's Barber
EDL	00:35:16,608	00:35:17,120	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Q they didn't
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:20,448	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Chris how a guy named Nathan Turner Jr.
EDL	00:35:20,960	00:35:23,008	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	2014 he was interviewed
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:24,288	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Turn into herpes
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:26,080	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	He grew up nearby Ali
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:28,640	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Just the fact that I've always pushed it that far
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:30,688	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	To take it to the Supreme Court
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:32,992	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	It left a bad taste
EDL	00:35:33,504	00:35:34,528	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Pun intended
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:37,600	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	In the miles of a lot of black
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:38,368	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	People in Birmingham
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:42,208	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	In-N-Out 53 years later
EDL	00:35:43,744	00:35:45,536	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	How do you think about that Supreme Court decision
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:48,096	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Well
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:52,448	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	You're at if you're asking about segregation that's one thing we ask about Spring Court and
EDL	00:35:53,216	00:35:56,800	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Seasoning on the Commerce Clause I still disagree with the
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:35:59,616	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Let me put it real
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:00,640	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Real succinctly
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:02,688	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	I think
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:04,992	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	What you had
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:05,760	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And that
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:06,272	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Decision
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:08,576	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Was it rather than
EDL	00:36:09,856	00:36:10,624	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Civicsource
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:12,160	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Correct but I don't know
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:15,744	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	It rather than three-quarters of the Congress
EDL	00:36:17,024	00:36:20,352	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And 3/5 of the states I believe it is having two
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:22,656	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Or maybe 2/3 Carlos whichever it is
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:23,936	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Having two
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:25,216	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Vote to
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:26,752	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Repeal an amendment
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:27,520	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	The Constitution
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:31,360	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	You had basically 9 appointees who
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:32,128	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Repeal the 10th
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:33,408	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Amendment to the Constitution
EDL	00:36:34,176	00:36:36,992	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	10th Amendment basically says that the powers not given to the feds
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:38,528	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Are reserved for
EDL	00:36:38,528	00:36:39,296	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	For the states
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:40,064	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	For the people
EDL	00:36:40,064	00:36:42,112	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	That's about as succinct as I can say it
EDL	00:36:42,880	00:36:45,184	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	But you understand how this is going to sound to a lot of our listeners
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:47,488	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	I mean that you are making a
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:48,768	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	States rights argument
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:52,352	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	As a not-so-veiled way to continue to discriminate
EDL	00:36:52,864	00:36:54,656	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	They're really in the end this is not about stay
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:56,960	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	States rights I think that's going to I was going to sound to a lot of pee
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:37:00,032	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Well it may very well but it's not the case
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:02,848	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Was there segregation
EDL	00:37:02,848	00:37:03,360	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Yes
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:07,200	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Where we going to voluntarily
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:09,504	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And that
EDL	00:37:10,016	00:37:10,784	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Probably not
EDL	00:37:11,552	00:37:14,880	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Would we go back and reinstate if we could no absolutely not
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:16,928	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	But the
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:20,000	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Issue that you're talkin about with
EDL	00:37:21,792	00:37:22,816	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Commerce Clause in the
EDL	00:37:23,328	00:37:24,096	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Constitutional
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:25,376	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Issue
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:26,912	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	You're still just what I said
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:33,824	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	So you still believe 53 years later that the Supreme Court got it wrong that they should have never
EDL	00:37:34,848	00:37:37,920	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Use the Commerce Clause to make you desegregate Ollie's
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:39,712	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Yep that is correct
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:41,504	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	But
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:44,064	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Don't hear me say that I don't want to go back to have segregation
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:48,672	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	That's a separate issue but is it separate I guess is my question you know
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:49,696	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	My God grant you
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:51,488	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	If you think of it in the abstract
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:54,816	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Federal government being able to regulate
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:56,608	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Commerce across
EDL	00:37:56,608	00:37:57,376	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	All
EDL	00:37:57,376	00:37:57,888	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Boundaries
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:37:59,936	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Is an enormous power
EDL	00:38:00,704	00:38:04,288	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And he could be a scary power so I grant you that at the same time
EDL	00:38:05,056	00:38:06,336	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	You have a Civil Rights Act
EDL	00:38:07,104	00:38:07,872	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	That
EDL	00:38:08,384	00:38:10,688	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	It speaks to a different amendment in the Constitution
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:15,552	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Ryan that you and your father will not willing to follow so how is the government going to get you to
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:17,088	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	To pay attention
EDL	00:38:17,088	00:38:17,600	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And to get in line
EDL	00:38:18,368	00:38:19,904	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	They've got to use the Commerce Clause
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:21,696	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	So on some level isn't it
EDL	00:38:22,464	00:38:24,000	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Isn't the power
EDL	00:38:24,000	00:38:24,512	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Present
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:26,816	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Because the other principles
EDL	00:38:27,328	00:38:29,632	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	They would otherwise regulate your Behaviour
EDL	00:38:29,632	00:38:30,400	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Just aren't working
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:33,216	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	What that's that's the point
EDL	00:38:34,240	00:38:35,264	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Choose which
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:37,824	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Which is the priority
EDL	00:38:38,592	00:38:39,104	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Basically
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:43,200	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	I understand you were which is the priority
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:44,736	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	I will
EDL	00:38:44,736	00:38:46,528	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Which is the priority of
EDL	00:38:47,552	00:38:49,088	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Those amendments

EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:03,936	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Well
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:08,032	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	The 10th Amendment
EDL	00:39:09,056	00:39:10,080	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Left that to the state

EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:23,040	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Was it in achieving desegregation that way
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:24,832	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	By the way

EDL	00:40:30,720	00:40:32,512	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	By doing it that way
EDL	00:40:32,512	00:40:33,536	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	He says with the Commerce Clause
EDL	00:40:35,072	00:40:36,608	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Something was sacrificed
EDL	00:40:36,608	00:40:37,888	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	He calls it a zero
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:39,168	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	I wouldn't call it that
EDL	00:40:39,168	00:40:39,936	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	I don't think most
EDL	00:40:40,448	00:40:40,960	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	We call it that
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:45,312	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Treating people with dignity and equality is a net win

EDL	00:40:50,176	00:40:50,688	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	But
EDL	00:40:51,456	00:40:52,992	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	It is legitimately strange
EDL	00:40:55,040	00:40:57,856	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Did the government had to take such a roundabout
EDL	00:40:57,856	00:40:59,392	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Ass backward way
EDL	00:40:59,904	00:41:00,928	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	To fix this
EDL	00:41:01,952	00:41:06,304	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	To fix this grave Injustice what you would think would be the obvious
EDL	00:41:06,304	00:41:08,864	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	That you would go right to those civil rights
EDL	00:41:09,376	00:41:11,424	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Parts of the Constitution
EDL	00:41:11,424	00:41:16,800	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	It was like, that's what's weird is it we have the 14th Amendment and yet we go to
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:18,592	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	The Commerce Clause or something
EDL	00:41:19,104	00:41:19,872	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	That is
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:24,736	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	So clearly stated in one of the Amendments lawyers are very tricky
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:28,576	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Search Jamie Floyd Again by the way
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:31,392	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	The lawyers in those cases
EDL	00:41:31,392	00:41:33,184	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Is that what they wanted to win
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:37,792	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	They wanted to win more than they wanted to make a social statement about
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:42,400	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Equal justice equal rights the 14th Amendment I mean those things mattered
EDL	00:41:42,400	00:41:44,960	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Most of all they wanted to win
EDL	00:41:44,960	00:41:47,520	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	They wanted to shut down discrimination
EDL	00:41:47,520	00:41:49,056	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	At those lunch counters
EDL	00:41:49,056	00:41:54,943	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And if Congress could shut them down or require them to open their doors to all Americans using
EDL	00:41:55,455	00:41:56,735	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Those 16 words
EDL	00:41:57,503	00:41:58,271	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	I'm okay with that
EDL	00:41:58,783	00:41:59,551	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Yeah
EDL	00:41:59,551	00:42:00,319	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Yeah
EDL	00:42:00,319	00:42:03,903	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	No I mean obviously the if the ends do justify the means in that case
EDL	00:42:04,415	00:42:09,535	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	But it does make you if you were to put that case and the weak case in your mind as a kind of split screen you
EDL	00:42:11,071	00:42:11,583	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	It's
EDL	00:42:12,095	00:42:14,143	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	It's a little strange because I do think
EDL	00:42:14,143	00:42:14,911	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Okay we have
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:19,263	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	I didn't mean to I said hopefully we're Americans with principles that matter
EDL	00:42:19,263	00:42:22,079	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	You know that we believe in equality believe in racial Justice
EDL	00:42:23,359	00:42:24,639	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	But really we just believe in money
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:28,991	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And we can do all the other stuff by bootstrapping it
EDL	00:42:29,759	00:42:30,271	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	E-commerce
EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:32,831	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	But somehow as as pure principles
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:39,743	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Play what don't have teeth while it's deeply troubling that we have to use Commerce to achieve our higher
EDL	00:42:39,743	00:42:40,255	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Are values
EDL	00:42:41,023	00:42:42,815	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	That is weird to me that is
EDL	00:42:42,815	00:42:43,839	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Fundamentally weird to me
EDL	00:42:44,607	00:42:46,911	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	It's kind of cynical
EDL	00:42:46,911	00:42:47,679	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	I mean
EDL	00:42:47,679	00:42:48,191	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	I
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:49,983	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	You are right we are
EDL	00:42:50,495	00:42:52,799	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	At least in large part about
EDL	00:42:52,799	00:42:53,311	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Commerce Center
EDL	00:42:54,079	00:42:55,871	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	But if that's who we are
EDL	00:42:56,383	00:42:59,967	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Then we should embrace it and use it to our advantage
EDL	00:43:00,735	00:43:06,367	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And if we can use it to our advantage perhaps it does take us to our higher principle
EDL	00:43:07,135	00:43:09,951	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	How to understand why it's not all bad
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:17,375	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	One of Jamie's .22 hadn't actually thought it was that
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:18,399	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Legislating morality
EDL	00:43:19,679	00:43:21,471	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Fletchling what is good and what is bad
EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:23,263	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Doesn't always go well
EDL	00:43:24,543	00:43:26,591	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Cuz we very often don't agree
EDL	00:43:28,383	00:43:32,223	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Galaxy there been times where people kept slaves and thought that was just fine
EDL	00:43:32,991	00:43:35,551	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	That was right
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:40,415	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	400 years you had the 14th amendment in place but it couldn't solve all these Barbie
EDL	00:43:41,695	00:43:42,975	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And here was a way
EDL	00:43:43,999	00:43:49,375	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	For the government without going at the moral questions head-on
EDL	00:43:49,887	00:43:56,287	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Government budget and all the way into the barbecue joints in the hotels in the restaurants and the houses and now the cake shops of Amer
EDL	00:43:56,287	00:44:00,127	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Erica and all the way down into the local
EDL	00:44:01,919	00:44:05,503	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And it was because of this increasingly expansive idea of Commerce
EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:09,343	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	That was now no longer the buying and selling of things or the knot
EDL	00:44:09,855	00:44:11,903	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Buying and selling of things it was now
EDL	00:44:11,903	00:44:13,439	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Any Behavior
EDL	00:44:14,463	00:44:16,511	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	They could create a kind of butterfly fish
EDL	00:44:18,559	00:44:19,839	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	That might one
EDL	00:44:20,607	00:44:22,399	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Day many steps Downstream
EDL	00:44:22,911	00:44:24,447	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Have a future effect
EDL	00:44:25,471	00:44:27,007	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	On the buying selling things
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:32,895	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Was right his case that was a massive shift
EDL	00:44:35,455	00:44:41,855	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	It shifted totally the federal government's role Beyond business even if you
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:43,391	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	I think it's good then that's fine
EDL	00:44:44,415	00:44:45,951	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And it's for the better but
EDL	00:44:45,951	00:44:47,999	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Just asked me realize that it was a
EDL	00:44:48,511	00:44:50,303	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	MasterChef from

EDL	00:44:53,119	00:44:54,655	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Up before that time

EDL	00:45:07,967	00:45:14,367	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Pretty much went wild yeah there was just no real limit
EDL	00:45:14,367	00:45:20,767	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Begin wave those 16 word sort of like a magic want to pass laws on everything from Fair labor standards

EDL	00:45:46,367	00:45:48,671	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	To make the argument itself
EDL	00:45:48,671	00:45:50,975	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	What's the government even has to defend itself
EDL	00:45:50,975	00:45:57,375	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	James Chen says there were times when the government would pass a law it get taken to court and the government would basically
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:45:58,143	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	We not show up

EDL	00:48:05,631	00:48:11,519	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Will your argument now number 99 5 Christy brzonkala vs Antonio Morrison

EDL	00:48:35,071	00:48:39,167	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Gender-based violence and the fear of that discriminatory violence

EDL	00:48:50,431	00:48:55,039	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	And again the court was given tons of evidence about the economic effects
EDL	00:48:55,039	00:48:56,575	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Congress heard from women

EDL	00:49:08,095	00:49:14,495	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	She dropped out if you ever get it right it's not just her it's everyone else who similarly situated
EDL	00:49:14,495	00:49:17,055	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	But in this case
EDL	00:49:18,335	00:49:21,663	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Yarygin what's happening in a very different time in the country very different mood
EDL	00:49:22,431	00:49:25,503	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	In front of an increasingly conservative Supreme core
EDL	00:49:27,807	00:49:34,207	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	It just wasn't buying it anymore and Arbors on Carla's complaint alleges that she was the victim of a

EDL	00:49:47,007	00:49:53,407	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	The phrase economic activity
EDL	00:49:53,407	00:49:59,807	| moreperfect013018_onenationundermoney |	Another word for very sorry for what may have happened to Christine bronkala but this is not Commerce
