EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:39,328	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I asked the entire team at Radiolab to look at the docket for that year pick a case make a few calls with sword
EDL	00:01:39,328	00:01:40,096	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Experiment

EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:45,216	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	About a little girl
EDL	00:01:46,240	00:01:47,008	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Becomes
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:48,800	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The center of a very big
EDL	00:01:50,336	00:01:51,872	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	This is the story that got us hooked
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:53,152	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I'm thinking about this
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:55,200	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And in many ways
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:57,248	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	It inspired us to
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:01:58,528	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Make more perfect
EDL	00:02:00,576	00:02:02,112	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Houston so I first
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:05,440	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I first heard about this story I saw it listed on the
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:06,720	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Supreme Court DACA
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:07,488	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Different cases
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:09,280	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Is that they were going to be hearing
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:10,048	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	This spring
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:12,608	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Well the name of the cases baby girl versus adoptive couple
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:15,168	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Actually in strict legal parlance
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:17,216	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Is called adoptive couple V baby girl
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:23,616	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That's not a particularly catchy name
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:28,224	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Associate professor of law at the University of South Carolina
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:29,760	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Stood out to me because
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:33,600	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	At first that this would even be a Supreme Court case
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:36,672	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	It seemed more like a straightforward custody case
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:37,184	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Right
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:38,464	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	But
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:40,512	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	When you dig in
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:47,424	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	There's a lot going on here text messages
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:50,496	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And it is not straightforward
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:52,032	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	At all fairly not
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:54,080	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	So let me walk you through it the way that I learned about
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:56,640	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The Story begins with a couple
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:58,944	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Matt and Melanie capobianco
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:05,344	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	They are a couple who live down here in South Carolina he's a technician at Boeing she's a developmental psychology
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:06,624	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Just nice middle-class
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:09,184	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Why couple they're in their late 30s
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:12,512	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	You really wanted to have a kid they had gone through
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:15,584	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Infertility problems it wasn't working out
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:16,608	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	So
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:18,912	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Eventually they decide to adopt
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:21,728	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Enter a woman named Christy Maldonado
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:23,264	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	She lives about a thousand miles away
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:26,848	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I believe she's in Oklahoma she's in her twenties already has a couple kids
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:28,128	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	She's pregnant
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:29,920	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And decides that she wants to give
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:31,456	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The baby up for adoption
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:32,224	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:33,760	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Apex the capobiancos
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:35,552	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:41,952	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Everyone seems happier capobiancos get the baby and the name are Veronica
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:44,512	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Almost that time of our family called it at
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:46,560	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Boss ladies is everybody around
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:48,352	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	This is Matt and Melanie capobianco
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:50,400	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	But you were happy to do whatever she told you
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:55,520	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Poster child for a proud father you know
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:03:59,872	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	It's just gone
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:01,664	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That's wrong as it could have possibly gone
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:08,832	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	This basic layout on folded on TV news
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:15,232	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Young child ripped from the arms of the only parents she's ever known and turned over to the Native Americans
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:21,631	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Logical father she is never met a man Veronica had never even met what happens when Veronica was too
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:28,031	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Biological dad turned up seemingly out of nowhere and according to these clips had been around for two years had abandoned
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:30,335	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Child and now he's asking for custody
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:36,479	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	In a court is making them stand by and just let it happen
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:42,879	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Well it's mainly because of this walk in child welfare at the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:43,903	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Dustin the dad
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:49,535	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	He's Cherokee you support the Cherokee Nation that makes his daughter Veronica eligible to be Cherokee
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:56,191	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	In the laws designed to keep Indian families together preference to Indian kids staying with Indian parents
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:59,263	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	So even though he actually sign papers
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:00,031	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Green to the adoption
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:02,079	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	He was able to invoke this lot
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:03,871	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And get custody of Veronica
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:05,919	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Side is Cassidy way
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:06,943	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Ben
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:08,735	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Uses cherry kienast
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,015	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Reverse
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:14,111	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The rights he signed away to hang on is all going to make sense
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:15,391	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Okay but you text Elliott
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:16,415	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Yeah
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:19,999	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	New Year's Eve 2011
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:21,279	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	With cameras rolling
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:23,583	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Dustin Brown drives his pickup truck
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:24,607	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Charleston
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:31,519	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Matt and Melanie capobianco flush to two-year-old Veronica could possibly be the last time
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:37,919	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Hyundai hold their baby as her mom and dad and that evening Veronica is transferred to Dustin
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:44,063	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And she like we had enough time for her to be Not Afraid when she
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:53,535	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Assassin gets into the truck
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:56,607	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Holding his two-year-old daughter for the first time
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:58,399	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The reporter asks him
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:05:59,679	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Do you think this is in her best interest
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:01,727	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And this is all you hear from
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:06,079	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I think so we need to give her a call
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:08,127	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Have you ever seen the child support
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:11,967	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	They declined any further comment on camera
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:14,015	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	He gets into the truck with Veronica
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:16,319	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And they drive away
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:17,087	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Back to Oklahoma
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:22,463	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Can I do can I ask you what was it when was the last time that you spoke with Veronica
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:25,023	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The day after
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:28,095	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The day after
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:34,751	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Yeah
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:36,287	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Spoke to her for about two men
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:41,407	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Totally love Darren
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:43,455	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I love you Mommy and I love

EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:47,295	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Just few minutes
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:51,903	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Able
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:52,415	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	InTouch
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:54,207	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And that was 16 months
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:57,791	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	How long was Veronica with him again before this have
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:06:58,815	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	About two years
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:00,607	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Oh man that's
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:01,375	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	It's hard
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:04,703	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And you know when I first heard about this case
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:07,263	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That's basically the
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:10,591	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The only way I thought of it you know it's just
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:12,639	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That's a crazy Injustice
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:15,199	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That's basically all I
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:15,967	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Saw
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:18,271	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And for someone with no background in this
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:20,319	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Then you see a case like the baby Veronica case
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:24,159	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Where's this coming from how can this possibly be okay
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:29,279	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Does Marshalls drug again in her article for slate kind of caught me off guard because the title was
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:31,583	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Doing what's best for the tribe
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:34,911	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	2 year old Veronica was ripped from the only home she's ever known
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:37,727	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The court made the right decision
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:38,239	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Yeah
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:42,591	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	So I called up Tasker like what do you mean by that
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:44,895	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	But I think important to realize is that
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:47,455	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The problems
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:47,967	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	But
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:52,319	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Equi was intended to address didn't stop happening

EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:08,447	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The only way you can begin to wrap your mind around
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:11,263	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	What's right and what's wrong in this story is
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:13,311	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Go back to the six

EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:29,183	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I was on the staff of the association on American Indian Affairs
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:32,511	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Sort of a legal advocacy group for American Indians

EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:36,351	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:37,119	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	One day
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:39,935	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Where he gets a phone call from this guy Lewis good house

EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:10,399	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Neglect because what because grandma wasn't
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:17,311	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Wasn't around no actually bird says that the social workers were looking for that classic nuclear family allowed
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,079	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Magical mother
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:20,383	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Biological father children
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:24,223	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	So when they saw him with an older relative but no Mom or Dad they thought
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:28,575	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And they took him away the tribal council was
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:29,087	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Really
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:30,879	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Upset by
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:33,439	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	They wanted to
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:33,951	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Fight a battle
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:40,607	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Took the case but in court in that case by the way this is Alex Forney she got Ivan back
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:41,887	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	After
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:43,167	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Somewhat protracted battle
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:44,191	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	But
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:46,751	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	He began to wonder how widespread is this
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:51,615	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	2.67 to the end of 68 into 69
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,639	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The tribe after tribe
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,407	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Doing interview
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:55,455	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And he says that everywhere he went
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:57,503	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	He would hear these stories
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:59,039	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I remember it vividly
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:00,575	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	This is Deb Wells
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:03,391	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	She's a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:08,255	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	When she was 10 years old A car pulled into her driveway
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,023	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Social workers
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:11,071	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And I got out of car
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:13,631	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I told my brothers and sisters I said go high
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:15,423	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:19,263	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	They had to drag this out from underneath the bed got around and got in the house
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:21,567	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Then I caucus to Scottsbluff
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:23,871	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And Patricia foster home
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:25,663	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	It looks horrible
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:26,431	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	This was
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:27,455	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Just part of
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:30,783	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Every native families history
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:33,343	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	She grew up on the Pine Ridge reservation in South
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:36,927	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Dakota I remember when I was young we go to one of the Border towns
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:37,951	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And my grandma
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,487	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Would say
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:40,511	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Stay in the car
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:42,047	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Lock yourself in
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:45,119	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Don't get out of the car I'm going into the Trading Post

EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:48,447	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Really yeah
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:49,983	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	What we found
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:56,383	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Is that not every reservation
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:58,431	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Photos of Standing Rock reservation
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:00,479	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	You couldn't not find the family
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:03,039	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That didn't know of a child in placement
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:05,343	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Social Services
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,927	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And told my
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:13,023	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Mother and dad that they were taking a bridge for physical check-up
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:14,559	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And Alice pack
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:18,399	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Michael says that his dad spent the next
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,167	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	30 years looking for
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:23,519	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	People that he was interviewing
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:26,847	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	What reason did the social workers give you for taking the child
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:29,151	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	An answer that he got ran the gamut
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:30,687	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Conditions of poverty
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:31,455	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Alcohol
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:34,527	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Overcrowding maybe they don't have adequate
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:40,927	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Ventilation in the house no indoor plumbing but in most cases he says the reasons would have stood up in court
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:42,975	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	They would put papers in front of them and they would sign
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:45,791	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	It was signing some families
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:48,863	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	If they could they tried to fight it but they usually couldn't afford to
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:51,167	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Book the tribal people of poor
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:53,727	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	So we began to do with
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:55,007	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Statistical collection
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:55,775	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Of data
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:56,799	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	State-by-state
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:59,359	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Asking how many Indian kids are in foster care
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:02,175	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Respite care adoptive placement and institutional place
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:06,015	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Juvenile facilities money arrived at the end of that analysis
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:10,367	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Is a pretty shocking number
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:12,671	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	About one-third
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:17,023	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Of Indian children wear in out-of-home placements in non-indian setting
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:18,559	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	1/3
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:22,143	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	25 to 35% of Indian children Nationwide
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:23,935	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Where in out-of-home placement
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:28,799	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That's a real number that is a real number that's the number you see sighted again and again
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:30,847	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Nobody connected the dots
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:32,639	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Everybody thought
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:35,455	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That it was their own
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,223	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Personal
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:37,503	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Tragedy
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:39,039	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Nobody realized
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:41,087	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That this was a pattern and a
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:43,647	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That was decimating these cry
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:46,719	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	How would this happen on this scale
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:51,071	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I mean like with the supposition a bunch of social workers making the same decision in the
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:51,839	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Dependently
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:52,607	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Where is Italy
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:55,679	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Policy well at this is basically the social workers
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:57,983	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Very much acting in the spirit of the day
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:01,311	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Because you have to keep in mind that in the fifties and sixties
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:05,919	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	You have all these government policies that are put in place
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:06,687	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Who's
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:08,735	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Entire purpose is basically two
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:10,527	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Tried it once and for all solve this
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:13,087	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Indian problem that's going on and on
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:18,207	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	You got this guy 1953 is a senator from Utah starts basically trying to terminate the tribe
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:20,511	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	You mean like take away their sovereignty
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:24,351	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Yeah he goes tribe to tribe trying to convince them or force them
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:27,167	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Tell them they have no there's no way out of it
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:27,935	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	He argues
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:33,567	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That this will be best for all of them
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:36,639	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	To integrate them
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:37,663	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Yeah the whole
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:40,991	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	They will melt into the wider culture that's what we'll save them
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:42,015	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Part of this was
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:44,831	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Part of the social workers that were working that.
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:46,879	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	They were working under the auspice
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:48,159	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Pictures of a thing called the Indian adoption
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:49,695	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Which
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:50,719	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Was very much about
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:51,999	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That ideas
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:54,559	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	You take these kids from their poor condition
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:56,607	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And you connect them directly
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:58,399	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Two white families that are looking
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:13:59,167	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	How to adopt
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:01,983	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	So far this is definitely top down very much
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:04,031	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	In any case
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:07,359	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The end result of this is that a third of these kids are being taken away
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:11,199	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	There were literally communities where there were no children
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:12,991	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That's Terry cross
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:17,087	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	He's executive director of the national Indian Child Welfare Association
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:18,879	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	In Minnesota there were community
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:20,159	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	It's where there were no children
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:21,183	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	In flask
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:23,487	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	There were communities where there were no children
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:24,767	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I mean what is
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:26,047	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	What is a culture except
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:28,351	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Healthy ideas and
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:30,143	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Traditions that you pass on to your kids
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:33,471	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That's Marsha's ugh again if you are hemorrhaging your children
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:35,775	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Then you're going to disappear
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:37,055	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	So what would you do
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:40,895	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Well it's to mass of a problem if you trying to fight
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:44,991	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	All these removals of kids on a case-by-case basis fugetaboutit
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:50,367	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	A national laws needed so Bert spent years Walking The Halls of Congress literally
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:57,023	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Endless lobbying Congressional hearings until finally
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:01,631	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	So it does a lot but basically when it comes to adoptions
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:02,655	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	They will have placement preferen
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:05,471	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	So the first preference would be
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:06,239	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	With the immediate
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:08,543	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	So you removed from Mom your
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:09,567	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Place with Dad
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:13,407	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Maybe with Grandmother they say no second preference would be
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:14,175	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Someone else in the tribe
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:15,711	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	+ 1/3
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:17,247	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Is any other American Indian
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:21,087	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Any other and then after that
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:22,879	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Other than the child could be placed with
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:24,671	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Another family
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:26,975	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Well so if you're white
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:28,255	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And you're trying to adopt Indian
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:30,559	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Yeah yeah a lot of rope
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:31,839	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Yes
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:32,351	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	But
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:33,887	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	By and large
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:35,423	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Most of us think that echoes
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:36,191	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Probably
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:37,471	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:40,031	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Best Federal Indian law ever
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:42,847	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Did the most to
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:44,639	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Help Indian tribes
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:47,199	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Respect tribal sovereignty
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:48,735	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And really fulfill the United
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:50,015	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	This is trust relationship
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:50,783	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	With America
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:54,367	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	But now because of this case
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:16:00,511	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That law may be in jeopardy
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:07,679	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Will continue in a moment
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:18,943	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Tom Chatham Rod this is more perfect run the middle of a story that was
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:21,247	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Our first attempt at
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:22,015	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Supreme Court Reporting
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:24,319	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:25,343	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Reporter Tim Howard
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:32,255	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	So in April I went to this conference in Tulsa
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:34,303	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Big room there are 700 people there
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:40,447	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Muslim work in child welfare organizations in Indian communities around the country
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:44,543	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	There was some traditional Cherokee drumming their films Workshop
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:50,431	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	All anybody could talk about but this case there is no issue
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:52,735	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	How the baby Veronica case may
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:59,135	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Fact the Indian child welfare act so please please do keep
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:01,695	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Baby Veronica and her family in your prayers
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:04,767	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Everybody was on it really worried
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:10,399	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	In this situation this is Terry cross again he's one of the organizers and
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:11,423	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	He told me that
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:12,191	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Look
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:13,471	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The capobiancos
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:14,751	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I feel for them
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:18,335	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	But in what world is it okay for one family
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:25,247	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Who feels they were damaged by a law to put thousands of other children at Jeopardy
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:30,367	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	For their own hurt I can't imagine a world where that's okay
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:33,951	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Well I mean it's hard
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:35,487	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	For us to say that because
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:38,047	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	You know that's not what motivated us
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:39,839	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Our daughters what's motivating us
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:42,399	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Well how we feel we just feel that in
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:44,191	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And this case is it was a
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:47,519	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Beautiful law that was put into place to prevent the breakup of families
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:49,311	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Indian families
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:52,127	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I just think it wasn't
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:54,943	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Really supposed to be applied to situation like ours
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:58,271	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	They say but we get it there's a huge
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:17:59,295	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Storical wrong here
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:01,599	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	What does that have to do with us
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:04,671	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Reminds me of arguments it happened over affirmative action
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:06,975	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Ridley definitely but hear the details are
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:09,279	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Are are so different you know they say
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:11,327	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	This is a law that was
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:15,679	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Created to protect Indian families right
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:19,519	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	You got a white couple and then you got it Dad was out of the picture so
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:24,127	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	You're not actually protecting Indian family you are forcibly creating a new one
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:29,759	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Absolutely I mean the process you're breaking up a loving home and I don't think that was the Ben 10 of the law ever
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:32,319	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I asked my personal opinion is that
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:36,159	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Aqua has outlived its usefulness
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:37,695	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	What causes more problems then
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,207	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That's awesome
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:39,999	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	This is Mark Fiddler
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:46,399	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I want to see Chinese for Matt and Melanie capobianco he also happens to be Native American himself
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:52,543	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Enrolled member of the turtle Mountain band of Chippewa Indians that's a reservation up in North Dakota right on the boardwalk
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:59,967	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And I was right kind of fell off foot into culture so to speak I go back to the Rasmus summer and Mark actually used to argue the other
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:00,991	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Other side
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:02,271	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The most important thing was to
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,807	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Keep Indian families together
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:06,111	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Annette Indian kids score place
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:07,647	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And on Indian homes
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:09,695	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Experience emotional
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:10,975	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Psychological harm by
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:12,255	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Being raised outside of the culture
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:15,071	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	But then I got a case in
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:16,351	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Bus 94
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:17,375	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Which gave him pause
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:19,167	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Boy
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:20,703	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That's a good word
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:28,127	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	With a K sandwiches Young American Indian girl at Sierra wanted to be adopted by this white couple
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:29,151	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And Mark
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:31,711	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Opposed it in my heart of hearts I knew it was
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:33,247	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Probably
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:35,295	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Not the right thing for the child
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:37,087	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	He won the case
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:38,623	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	She was removed from the couple's home
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:42,975	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Sierra would tell you herself she had the
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:44,767	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	She had a pretty rough life
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:49,631	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	She bounced in and out of more than 20 foster homes
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:51,167	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Runaway many many times
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:53,471	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And got into serious trouble with the law
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:55,775	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	It always nag me
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:58,079	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Mark says even though the tribes
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:19:58,847	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Suffered
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:20:00,383	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That doesn't change the fact that if you
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:02,175	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Take a kid out of a loving home
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:03,711	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	You're going to cause her real
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:04,223	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Harm
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:06,015	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And he says that's why he took
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:08,575	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Because the capobiancos know they are
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:12,159	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Among the most loving people I know
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:15,487	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	He said they did everything you could ask her just amazing people
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:18,559	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Emmett the birth mother Christine Maldonado when she was pregnant
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:20,095	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	They got to know her she
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:21,887	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Tell the connection to them
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:25,215	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That's Lori Miguel's she's represented Christy since last year
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:28,543	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And they were also willing to have an open adoption
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:31,103	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Yeah we still have a relationship with Kris TV
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:34,687	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	We love her to death and Crissy give birth to Veronica they were there
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:36,479	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	With her in the delivery room
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:39,807	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The day she was born a cut the cord
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:40,575	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Matt
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:41,599	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Capobianco cut the
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:45,951	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Umbilical cord so that's such a degree of intimacy that I
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:49,279	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I know I mean having given birth twice myself
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:52,863	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Did anyone other than my husband would be
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:53,631	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	In the rooms
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:57,215	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	It's kind of scary but that it gives you some idea of how she felt about the
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:57,727	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Capobianco
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:21:01,311	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Now as for Dustin Brown Veronica's biological dad
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:04,127	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	A couple months before she was born Christy the birth mom
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:07,199	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Send him a text message asking him
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:09,247	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Pay child support or
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:10,783	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	He wants to waive his rights
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:11,551	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And he replied
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:13,087	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I waive my right
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:13,855	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Rather than pay
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:15,647	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	A dime in child support
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:19,488	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Well there's a contrast
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:23,584	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	So the beginning it sounds like he did not want to be a dad a few months later
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:25,120	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Key
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:29,472	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Things to make it even more official by signing a form agreeing to the adopt
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:32,800	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And then he changes his mind yeah you know
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:35,360	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Obviously I was wondering what was he thinking
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:39,968	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Cuz you can't avoid the fact that how you feel about this guy
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:45,344	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Is going to influence how you feel about this law and so I was trying to get in touch with him I was
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:51,232	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Pestering his lawyers will he do an interview this one on for weeks and and they were basically like
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:53,280	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	He doesn't want to do interviews
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:54,816	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	He doesn't want to talk
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:57,632	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Yeah yeah he said he didn't get him
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:07,360	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Shortly before we're going to wrap this story
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:09,664	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I got an email saying come to Oklahoma
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:16,832	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	He lives in this one story house on this tree line block

EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:46,432	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Basically he and Christy Maldonado the birth mom we've known each other since we were 16
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:48,480	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	We've dated off and on

EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:55,904	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Panda Christmas time that year
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:57,440	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	He basically says
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:58,720	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Let's Get Serious
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:02,048	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Got down on one knee and proposed to her said hey
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:03,584	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I want to bring into my life
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:06,400	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	She said okay that's just great
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:07,168	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:08,192	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Almost a month later
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:11,776	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	She send me a message saying that she was pregnant and
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:13,568	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I was excited
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:14,336	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I mean
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:16,384	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I have children with her was
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:18,944	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Was one of the things I wanted at that time
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:22,528	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Told her I can move you and your kids up to the base
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:25,088	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Housing was going to be free on base
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:27,392	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	There was schools for her kids she could
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:29,696	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Get a job right there on base you know
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:32,768	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Everything was taken care of me and everything was going great now
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:33,536	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And then
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:35,840	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Pretty quickly the whole thing just sour
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:40,704	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	It's impossible to know exactly what happened but Christie says that Dustin
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:42,240	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Just simply didn't offer any
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:43,008	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Support
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:44,288	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	He says that he
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:46,336	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Did Harry tried to at least
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:49,408	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	But shortly after she got pregnant she basically just shut them out
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:51,200	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Stop taking his calls
EDL	00:24:51,200	00:24:57,600	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I didn't get no phone calls no text message nothing from Riley blue and on the cycle what's going on he says that he tried to get in touch with
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:24:59,392	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Trying to call her
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:00,672	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Still no answer
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:06,304	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	A couple times that I've went back to the bars and went to her house though there's 4 hours from the base
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:08,096	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Knocked on her door I can hear
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:09,888	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	You know voices in the house
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:13,728	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I sound like her and the kids they wouldn't answer the door for me
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:15,776	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Then one day he says
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:16,800	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	She sent me a
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:18,080	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Message saying
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:19,872	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I don't want to be with you no more
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:21,920	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	+ 3 weeks after that she's like
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:24,224	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I want you to sign your rights over
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:28,832	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	His parental rights
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:30,112	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Would you sign your rights over
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:32,416	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	You guys are texting this we talkin
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:34,976	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Show the whole time we're text messaging this
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:37,792	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Because she wouldn't talk to me what did you think it meant
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:39,328	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	To me I just
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:41,888	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Does she wanted me to sign my rights over to her
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:42,400	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And I'm like
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:44,960	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	This summer I really don't want to do
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:45,472	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	He says
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:47,520	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	She kept texting him that question
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:50,336	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And looming in his mind was
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:53,664	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The fact that he just learned so we're going to be going to Iraq to
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:58,528	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The radar Mission so he starts to wonder what's the right thing to do here
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:02,112	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	There was one of chances I was going to come back I want to make the right choice and
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:02,880	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	But the mother
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:04,672	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	BSO parent he says
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:09,280	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That he's holding out hope that if he does make it back will get back together and she'll just change your mind
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:12,864	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Finally told her I was like alright I'm signing rights over
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:14,656	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Months go by
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:19,008	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Christy has a baby peace as he doesn't know exactly when because they weren't speaking
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:21,568	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	But then six days before
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:23,616	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I had to go to the port of Iraq
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:25,920	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I get a phone call from
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:29,248	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Some guy in Washington County the process server
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:30,272	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Said hey
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:32,320	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	We need you to sign some papers so you sign your
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:35,904	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Restaurants over by directed him to an office right near the base
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:36,672	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Went there
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:39,744	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Sign the paper and what did you think that man
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:42,048	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The whole time I thought I was just
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:45,376	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	You know the paperwork for me sign customized to her
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:45,888	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	But
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:48,448	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	When I got done sign the guy said
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:51,520	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	You just sign your rights away instead of the biological mother
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:54,336	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	There's been up for adoption and she's been living in South Carolina
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:54,848	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	4 months
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:27:03,040	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Dustin says this is the first moment that he realized what was actually happening
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:05,088	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That the baby was up for adoption
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:09,184	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And he says that he had no idea he had just legally can send it to it
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:11,232	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I should have had a lawyer there with me
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:17,888	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	At that point I might grab the paper and the guy looked at me and said if you going to rip that up he said
EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:21,472	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	It's not good to do that
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:25,056	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That he could be arrested and also what do I got to do
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:29,408	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	He said you get a lawyer which he immediately did
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:34,016	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That's why the courts have ruled in his favor because they say that from that moment
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:38,112	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	He's clearly demonstrated that he wants to be her dad I mean I never
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:39,648	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Never once
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:43,488	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	They don't want to give up on my daughter never once that I want to give her up
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:45,792	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I mean everybody says that I gave her up
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:47,328	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Never wanted to
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:49,888	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Mark and Lori say that
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:51,424	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	If this were any other guy
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:55,520	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Any other man of any other race whose story would be over right about it
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:57,056	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	It's too late
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:59,872	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	He wouldn't have any rights at all under every State's laws
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:02,944	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Too late under the Federal Constitution too late
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:03,968	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	He rejected
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:06,528	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That opportunity to become a father
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:08,576	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	He has one thing in his favor
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:09,088	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Teslore
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:10,880	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	He happens to be Cherokee
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:14,976	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And because of that fact not only can distort of man
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:19,584	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	But he gets an automatic transfer of custody to him
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:23,168	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Mark and Lori see that as basically the worst kind of preferential
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:25,728	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Treatment and that is unbelievable
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:31,104	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	This is John John Nichols this is Shannon Shannon Jen's Dustin's lawyers
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:34,176	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And John says okay there's preferential treatment
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:41,088	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	But think about why all the protections of iqua are there he's Roblox what they are for a reason we went over this earlier but
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:43,648	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	You know basically people are being manipulated out of their kids
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:50,560	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Emoji might like to think that that's ancient history now fast forward to 2010
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:52,096	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The same thing is happening in this
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:54,400	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	We have a registered member
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:55,424	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Of the Cherokee Nation
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:57,984	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	We have his child
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:29:00,544	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Being given up for adoption without his knowledge
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:02,592	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And without his consent
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:05,408	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And they kept this adoption from him for months
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:06,944	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And then spring it on him six
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:09,248	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Days before he leaves the country
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:15,648	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	It looks to us like it was engineered to make sure he got served but not enough time to where he could put
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:18,720	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Put up a fight I believe it was absolutely intentional
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:20,000	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Enchanted suggest
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:22,816	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That they knew about Equity new would apply
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:24,096	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And they were trying to sidestep
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:30,496	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Are so many errors
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:33,056	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	There's one important form where Shannon says
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:35,104	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That they went out of their way
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:40,480	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	To make it look like Veronica is not Native American
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:41,760	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That's just dumb
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:47,392	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	It's a Preposterous argument another for Mark and Lori say the reason that nobody puts Cherokee
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:49,184	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And big bright flaming letters
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:50,464	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Simple
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:52,512	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Chrissy herself is predominantly Hispanic
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:55,072	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Dustin is predominantly
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:57,888	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Caucasian and is approximately 2% Cherokee
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:29:59,680	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	What
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:01,216	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Did you say 2%
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:05,056	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Yai Veronica herself a b a little bit over one person
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:08,896	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Wait this whole thing is happening because he's only 2%
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:10,688	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Well you look at changes things come out
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:12,480	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Well yeah but you have to keep in mind that
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:13,504	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Cherokee Nation
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:18,112	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Doesn't care about the percentage of Cherokee in your blood that's not how they determine their members
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:20,416	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Being a member of the Cherokee Nation
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:24,256	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Is like being a member of the United States you are a
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:25,792	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Citizen of the nation
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:26,560	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	You know if
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:28,352	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	If your parents are US citizen
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:33,472	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	You're automatically a citizen Assistant Attorney General for Cherokee Nation
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:38,080	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	If your parents are Cherokee citizen you're automatically a citizen but you can automatically apply
EDL	00:30:38,080	00:30:40,128	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	So it's based on Direct lineage
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:41,664	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	But still
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:45,248	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	You're right because this is the argument that is most troubling
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:45,760	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	To the tribe
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:50,112	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Both Chrissi Nimmo and marshes ugh told me that
EDL	00:30:50,112	00:30:51,392	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	If the Supreme Court
EDL	00:30:51,392	00:30:52,672	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Ends up deciding
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:59,072	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Equi is unconstitutional because it really is race-based unconstitutional cuz it's race-based preference
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:02,400	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	It calls into question every single federal Indian law
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:04,704	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	There goes Indian law
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:08,544	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	This is a case that they could use to do that
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:15,200	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	If iqua falls because it's unconstitutional
EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:16,736	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	You could have a crazy domino effect
EDL	00:31:17,504	00:31:18,528	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Every single
EDL	00:31:18,528	00:31:19,552	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Federal Indian law
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:20,832	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Is premise
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:21,600	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	On
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:23,648	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Giving some sort of special treatment Indian
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:30,304	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	What would that mean concretely if
EDL	00:31:30,304	00:31:36,704	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Indian Longwood to go away it means that their policing the court system education anything to do as a
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:39,264	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The Sovereign Nation all of that just evaporates
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:43,872	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	A tribe would just become another group of people
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:45,408	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	On
EDL	00:31:45,408	00:31:45,920	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Summerland
EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:48,992	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That said
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:50,784	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	This is not
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:52,064	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The likely outcome
EDL	00:31:53,600	00:31:54,368	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	No
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:58,976	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The Supreme Court will probably rule as narrowly as they possibly can
EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:01,280	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And as far as the tribes are concerned
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:05,120	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	They can do a lot of damage to the law without calling it unconstitutional
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:07,424	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	You know they could allow for
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:08,192	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	This
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:10,240	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Certain kind of exception to iqua
EDL	00:32:10,752	00:32:14,336	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Which would make it a lot easier for people like the capobianco is to adopt
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:15,872	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	So they can roll any number of
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:17,152	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Yeah
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:18,176	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And the thing is that
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:19,712	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	It's all
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:20,992	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Strangely connected
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:21,504	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	To this
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:24,576	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I figured maybe three year old girl
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:26,880	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	No signs of this I'm thinking I'm just going to
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:27,392	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Suncoast
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:30,464	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	So when when she finally showed up
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:32,768	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Halfway through my interview with Dustin
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:33,280	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Hello
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:35,584	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Hi
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:37,632	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	It was kind of surreal
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:40,960	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Date my daughter Veronica though Daddy
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:42,752	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Hey Veronica on Tim
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:47,616	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	She's got dark curly hair she's a ball of energy
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:50,688	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	This definitely bullheaded
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:53,760	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Within a minute
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:55,040	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	She's giving me a tour of
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:57,344	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Every single object in her room
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:32:58,112	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And this
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:33:00,416	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I mean everything
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:01,440	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Gummy bear
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:01,952	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Army bear
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:04,512	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Marijuana daddy dog tags on it
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:07,584	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	She was a very very proud
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:08,608	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Cool host
EDL	00:33:11,168	00:33:13,472	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Few minutes later if she wanted to show me her
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:18,336	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I don't think I've seen geese in a long time
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:23,456	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Desert desert real
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:29,600	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Yeah she feed them out of her hand
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:37,792	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Liberty
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:44,192	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Thomas the Train so
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:47,776	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Happened to her but if the Supreme Court said
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:50,848	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Dustin Brown shouldn't have qualified
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:51,616	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	As father
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:55,968	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	What they do is they would send it back down to a South Carolina
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:59,808	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And then they would have this new best interest evaluation
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:02,880	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Basically like what's the best thing for her at this point
EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:05,184	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	She's been with him now for
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:06,464	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	About a year-and-a-half
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:08,000	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Cancel that actually
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:10,304	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Might really change the calculation
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:13,120	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	10 mm
EDL	00:34:15,424	00:34:16,192	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Honestly
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:17,472	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Hanging out with
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:19,776	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Her and Dustin
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:20,800	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	In the backyard
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:23,872	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Is really easy to forget
EDL	00:34:24,384	00:34:27,200	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	All these people whose lives are just
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:31,040	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Completely Tangled Up In This scene
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:37,184	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Christy Maldonado the birth mom
EDL	00:34:37,184	00:34:43,328	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	She intended to give Veronica life has been going on for
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:51,264	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	We've kind of been in a holding pattern for like well forever is waiting and waiting waiting
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:56,896	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Of course that the hundreds of tribes are just worried about their own kids
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:35:04,320	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Pretty cool are you a good swimmer
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:10,720	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Bad summer

EDL	00:35:17,120	00:35:23,264	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Anima vestra marry you just Miller
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:26,080	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Yeah
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:34,272	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	So the Supreme Court came to a decision on this ruling about a month after we first air this podcast
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:35,296	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And hit here
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:36,064	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	What they say
EDL	00:35:36,064	00:35:38,624	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Okay so the Supreme Court ruled
EDL	00:35:39,136	00:35:39,904	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Five four
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:42,720	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	In favor of the adoptive couple
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:44,256	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Which is to say against the birth
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:45,792	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	To Dustin Brown the dab
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:48,096	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	It was like a 60-page
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:49,888	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Ruling and
EDL	00:35:50,656	00:35:51,424	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Not being
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:54,240	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Totally confident with all the ramifications were
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:56,800	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I just made some calls
EDL	00:35:59,360	00:36:00,384	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Hi how are you
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:01,408	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I'm doing great how are
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:03,456	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	For example I Skype
EDL	00:36:03,456	00:36:04,736	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	With Marcia Zug
EDL	00:36:04,736	00:36:06,784	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Who you remember from the pieces
EDL	00:36:06,784	00:36:10,112	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	She's a law professor at the University of South Carolina
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:12,416	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Can you walk me through what this opinion means
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:15,744	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Well in terms of
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:16,768	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Veronica's placement
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:19,072	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	How to come out the other way
EDL	00:36:19,840	00:36:23,936	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Then it would be over she would stay with Dustin Brown her biological father
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:24,704	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	End of story
EDL	00:36:24,704	00:36:26,496	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	What we have now
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:28,544	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Is the court of holding
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:29,824	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The termination of his parental rights
EDL	00:36:30,336	00:36:36,480	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	So basically the Supreme Court ruled that Dustin Brown shouldn't have been allowed to invoke the Indian Child Welfare Act
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:40,576	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Because he didn't have what's called continuing custody of Veronica
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:42,112	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Continuing custody
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:48,512	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Right there argue that this other about preventing the breakup of Indian families and there was no Indian fam
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:51,840	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Only here because they didn't live together dad and a daughter to write
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:55,424	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	So they don't scrap the Indian Child Welfare Act
EDL	00:36:55,424	00:36:57,728	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	They just say that it shouldn't applied in case like this
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:37:00,800	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	So basically according to Tim it was
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:01,824	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Is pretty narrow ruling
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:03,104	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	What then
EDL	00:37:03,616	00:37:06,944	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Is it the Supreme Court kick the case down to a lower court
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:09,760	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	South Carolina and that lower court ultimately
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:12,832	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Awarded custody of Veronica to the Kappa Beyond
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:15,392	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Dustin Brown try to fight it
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:16,672	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	There are lots of lawsuits
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:18,464	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	It's flying back and forth in both directions
EDL	00:37:18,976	00:37:19,744	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	But in the end
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:21,024	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Veronica
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:22,048	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Did end up
EDL	00:37:22,048	00:37:22,560	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Going to the
EDL	00:37:24,352	00:37:27,680	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Send two and a half weeks since our daughter Veronica
EDL	00:37:27,680	00:37:29,728	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Peppermint Malachi Bianca
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:32,800	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And on October 10th 2013 Dustin Brown called The Press
EDL	00:37:33,568	00:37:36,128	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	It was a love for my daughter that kept
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:37,408	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Me going all this time
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:39,968	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That is it was also
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:42,272	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The love for my daughter
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:45,088	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Dude that finally gave me the strength
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:49,440	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Things that are Beyond My Control
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:52,768	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The time has come
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:56,096	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	For me to let Veronica live a normal childhood
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:37:58,656	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Never so desperately needed
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:37:59,168	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And deserve
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:02,496	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Dustin Brown then announced that he would be stopping his
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:04,544	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Forget
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:05,824	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Santa Veronica

EDL	00:38:24,000	00:38:27,328	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I thought for you

EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:24,672	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	One more thing
EDL	00:39:25,952	00:39:27,488	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	In our story we talked
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:28,512	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	A lot about
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:31,072	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The possibilities are the larger possibility
EDL	00:39:31,584	00:39:33,632	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Effective this case could be
EDL	00:39:33,632	00:39:34,144	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Used as a
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:35,680	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	First step
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:38,496	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	To basically declare
EDL	00:39:39,520	00:39:40,544	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Indian Liza
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:41,568	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The race-based situation
EDL	00:39:42,336	00:39:43,104	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Could then be negated
EDL	00:39:44,640	00:39:45,664	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	That didn't happen it is
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:47,200	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	But
EDL	00:39:47,200	00:39:49,504	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	There is a sense that they they kind of
EDL	00:39:49,504	00:39:51,040	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Planted a seed
EDL	00:39:51,040	00:39:51,808	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	For example
EDL	00:39:52,320	00:39:54,368	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Justice Alito who wrote the ruling
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:58,208	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	He started off with mention of Veronica being
EDL	00:39:58,720	00:39:59,744	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	1.2
EDL	00:40:00,256	00:40:00,768	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Cherokee
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:02,304	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Which
EDL	00:40:02,816	00:40:09,216	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Is interesting cuz it sounds like he's about to make an argument for why this is a race-based preference and whites of
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:11,008	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Violation of equal protection
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:12,288	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	But then he doesn't make that are gay
EDL	00:40:12,800	00:40:13,312	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	He pulls back
EDL	00:40:14,080	00:40:14,848	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	So the question is
EDL	00:40:15,872	00:40:17,408	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Why did he start the ruling that way
EDL	00:40:17,920	00:40:19,968	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	She trying to send a message of some kind
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:20,480	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I asked
EDL	00:40:20,992	00:40:21,760	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Marsha
EDL	00:40:21,760	00:40:22,272	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	What you thought about
EDL	00:40:23,040	00:40:24,832	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Why you think they started it off that way
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:26,880	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I've been thinking about
EDL	00:40:31,488	00:40:32,768	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	It clearly
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:39,680	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Sat wrong with at least some members of the court I mean when listening to the oral arguments you could tell that
EDL	00:40:39,680	00:40:41,984	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	And Robert's parked on it as well
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:44,288	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	I think it's an indication that at least some members
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:44,800	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Court
EDL	00:40:45,568	00:40:46,592	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Have serious
EDL	00:40:47,104	00:40:48,896	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Reservations about Indian law
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:52,736	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Because they just don't see Veronica is an Indian Child
EDL	00:40:53,504	00:40:54,528	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	To them
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:55,808	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Indian is a race
EDL	00:40:58,112	00:40:59,904	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	She doesn't have enough blood to be of that race
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:01,952	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Hey there's a possible
EDL	00:41:02,464	00:41:03,744	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Indication of
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:07,584	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Where future Indian law cases are going to go
EDL	00:41:17,824	00:41:23,456	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Since then the Supreme Court has seen a handful of Indian law cases in the biggest development so far
EDL	00:41:23,968	00:41:27,040	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Is it the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the federal government
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:29,088	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Change
EDL	00:41:29,088	00:41:35,488	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The rules surrounding the Indian Child Welfare act were there about you the new rule changes are going to go into effect December twenty
EDL	00:41:35,488	00:41:39,328	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	What you mean is that when a child like Veronica is put up for adoption
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:45,472	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	The state would have to ask whether or not she was an Indian Child the father would have to have been asked whether or not
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:48,288	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	She's an Indian Child in the state would not be able to consider
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:52,128	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	What percentage Indian blood she has in determining if she is an Indian
EDL	00:41:53,151	00:41:54,431	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	How to say the hope is that
EDL	00:41:54,943	00:41:57,247	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	Future veronika's will not have to go through
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:41:58,783	| moreperfect061716_adoptivecouple |	What does fraud
