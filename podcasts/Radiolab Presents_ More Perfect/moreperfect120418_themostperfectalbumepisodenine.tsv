EDL	00:00:17,408	00:00:18,688	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Who is we are taking
EDL	00:00:18,688	00:00:21,248	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	The 27 amendments to the US Constitution
EDL	00:00:21,248	00:00:22,784	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Stodgy words that are
EDL	00:00:22,784	00:00:23,296	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Are so important
EDL	00:00:24,064	00:00:25,856	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Define our rights as American
EDL	00:00:25,856	00:00:26,880	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	But they're so large
EDL	00:00:26,880	00:00:28,672	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	They are
EDL	00:00:28,672	00:00:29,184	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	We didn't
EDL	00:00:29,952	00:00:32,256	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Even us who have been reporting on court cases
EDL	00:00:32,256	00:00:32,768	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	3 years
EDL	00:00:33,536	00:00:34,560	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	I had never read
EDL	00:00:35,584	00:00:38,912	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Amendment 23 I just hadn't I hate I couldn't have told you what it is
EDL	00:00:39,936	00:00:43,008	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	So make a long story short we decided to put together an album
EDL	00:00:43,776	00:00:45,056	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	To reanimate
EDL	00:00:45,056	00:00:45,824	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	These
EDL	00:00:45,824	00:00:49,664	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Crucially important words through the power of music and in the podcast
EDL	00:00:50,432	00:00:51,712	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Raw from the liner notes
EDL	00:00:51,712	00:00:54,016	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	List of the songs were telling stories about these amendments about
EDL	00:00:54,528	00:00:55,552	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Where they came from
EDL	00:00:55,552	00:00:57,088	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	What they mean to us now and we have
EDL	00:00:57,088	00:00:58,112	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	2 amendments left
EDL	00:00:58,880	00:00:59,904	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Two songs
EDL	00:00:59,904	00:01:01,440	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	To go with each of those two amendments
EDL	00:01:01,952	00:01:04,000	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	And we will begin this final episode
EDL	00:01:04,768	00:01:06,048	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	With one I just mentioned
EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:06,816	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	23rd Amendment
EDL	00:01:07,328	00:01:09,376	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Presidential vote for DC
EDL	00:01:14,240	00:01:17,312	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	The district constituting the seat of government of the United States
EDL	00:01:18,336	00:01:20,640	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Shall appoint in such manner is Congress made a wreck
EDL	00:01:21,408	00:01:24,224	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	The number of electors of President and Vice President
EDL	00:01:24,224	00:01:30,624	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Equal to the whole number of Senators and representatives in Congress to which the district would be entitled if it were state
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:31,648	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	If it were state
EDL	00:01:31,648	00:01:32,416	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	David worst day
EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:37,536	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Okay we arrive at Amendment 23 all those words
EDL	00:01:37,536	00:01:39,328	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Just a second ago with the amount due is simply this
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:41,120	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	23rd Amendment
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:43,424	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Gives the citizens of
EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:46,752	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	The District of Columbia the citizens of DC the right
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:47,520	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	To vote
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:48,288	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	For president
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:49,056	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Which for me
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:50,592	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Begs the question
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:53,664	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	DC didn't have the right to vote for president what
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:57,248	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	The White House is in DC for god sakes
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:02:01,856	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	How to take a 23 amendments to give the citizens of DC the right to vote for
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:06,976	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Why Julie Longoria why and why don't they have that right in the first place
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:08,768	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	It was kind of an act
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:09,280	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Didn't
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:13,376	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Reason why this ended up happening is
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:14,912	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	The founders
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:16,448	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Wanted to
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:17,728	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Put the White House
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:19,264	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	In a neutral place
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:22,592	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	They wanted it to be outside of State politics
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:24,896	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	So you wouldn't run into a situation where like
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:29,760	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	The Civil War breaks out in the White House is in Alabama like what
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:32,320	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	What would Abraham Lincoln have done in that situation
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:33,600	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	We wanted to make sure
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:36,928	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	The capital would operate from a peaceful place of neutrality
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:43,584	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	So the founders took corners of Maryland and Virginia and created a city that would be controls
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:44,096	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Buy conch
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:49,472	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	I don't think anyone meant to disenfranchise
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:51,008	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	All of the nearly
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:53,824	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	700000 citizens that live in DC
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:56,384	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	But that's what ended up happening
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:58,688	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Because DC is not a state
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:01,248	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	The Constitution didn't really address it
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:02,528	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Princeton
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:04,832	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	It didn't have electors in the Electoral College
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:12,000	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Alexander Hamilton. Eventually we fix the representation problem in DC but that didn't come until
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:13,792	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	1961
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:15,584	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Which amendment number 23
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:17,376	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Crazy to that long
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:23,008	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	I did actually fix the problem in the end no actually all the 23rd Amendment did
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:25,824	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Is give the citizens of DC the right to vote for
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:26,336	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	President
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:28,128	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Which you know
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:29,920	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Is no small thing but
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:31,968	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	It left many things on answer
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:35,808	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	It didn't really clarify what DC is
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:38,624	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Constitutionally like is it a city is it a state
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:40,160	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	The way our system of government work
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:43,744	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	You got to be part of a state to have senators
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:46,560	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	You got to be part of the state to have a vote in the house
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:49,376	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	DC is simultaneously
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:50,656	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Not a state
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:51,424	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Eat and not
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:52,448	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Part of a bigger state
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:54,240	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	So it's
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:55,264	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Definitely a thing
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:59,872	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	But it's like not enough of a thing to get it full representation in Congress
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:01,664	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	You don't have
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:03,712	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	A full democracy unless you treated equally
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:07,296	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	And a district is not treated equally because
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:09,600	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	We're the only jurisdiction
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:11,648	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	The pay federal taxes
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:14,464	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	I know whose member cannot vote
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:16,768	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	And whose member has no senator
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:19,583	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	And that's that's you you can't vote right
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:20,607	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	That's me
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:26,495	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	This is congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton and I represent the District of Columbia Nations Cafe
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:30,591	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	She kind of sits at the center of the blind spot of
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:31,871	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	The 23rd Amendment
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:32,639	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	She's
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:34,431	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	The non-voting delegate
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:38,015	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	From Washington DC I'm called a delegate I'm
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:39,039	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Just like my
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:44,927	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Pearson called delegates so sorry at what what is a non-voting delegate what is that
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:46,719	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Kind of what it sounds like like it
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:50,559	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	A congress person who represents their constituents in Congress
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:55,167	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	They have an office in Congress does all the things that normal Congress people do
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:58,495	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	But when it comes time for the final vote on the floor
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:00,031	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	They don't have it
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:02,079	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	They don't have a vote
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:05,919	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Why isn't the whole reason you elected Congress person so they can go to DC and vote on bills
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:06,687	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Yeah
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:08,479	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Over the years there have been
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:14,367	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Over 150 proposals to change this ideally Eleanor wants
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:17,439	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	To solve it by making DC the 51st state of the United
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:19,487	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	But it's become like this
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:20,767	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Political thing where like
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:22,815	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	DC is
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,351	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Berry Blue as a city
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:31,263	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	It's also 47% African-American what's happened over the years is that some Republicans have found ways to block
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:32,799	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Eleanor Holmes Norton zafords
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:34,079	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	To get representation
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,359	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Some people say
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:37,151	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	It would be unconstitutional
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:43,807	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	A huge disappointment to me but very frankly I'm used to uphill battle so you can get yourself together

EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:16,031	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Talk to two members of the Senate and and it kept coming up
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:22,431	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	She kept harping on that point my job is no different than I do what everybody else says if you want to get a bill passed

EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:26,783	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	She got really upset with us
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:35,231	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Because we made the mistake of comparing the situation of DC to the territory

EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:55,199	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Accept not having the final vote on the house floor

EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:45,375	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Whether to vote on the rule on something else
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:49,983	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	So that is supposed to Signal like that your butt over there kind of thing
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:52,799	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	It does mean that

EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:37,599	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	And then insisting in these moments

EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:56,703	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	But it is very important.
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:13:02,079	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Powerful myth

EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:35,359	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	For those who believe in God

EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:54,559	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Is in a very real sense
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:59,167	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	When there was nothing but racism
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:02,751	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	They believe those words

EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:54,207	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	In some ways I think
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:55,487	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Eleanor Holmes Norton
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:56,767	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	China stands in 4D

EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:14,687	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	If we ever succumb to our powerlessness gave up
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:15,711	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	It would all be over
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:20,831	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	But if Eleanor Holmes Norton keeps believing in the Constitution
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:25,695	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Believing in the myth that it tells us the myth of her own power despite the odds
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:28,767	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Despite even the reality of her situation
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:30,303	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Maybe
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:31,839	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	She can make her reality
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:32,863	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Match the myth
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:41,823	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	I mean hey we got the 23rd Amendment didn't we

EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:27,711	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	When we started this project
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:29,503	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Most of us hear more perfect
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:31,295	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Didn't know
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:32,063	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	How many amendments
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:34,111	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Exactly
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:35,391	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	What each of the men
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:36,415	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Now we do
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:38,975	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	More importantly
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:41,279	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	We picked the name
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:43,583	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	2017 clue the number in the name
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:45,631	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	27 most perfect album
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:48,447	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Because while we were making it we realized this project
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:50,495	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Is a kind of time
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:53,055	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Right now there are 27 Amendments
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:54,591	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	One day
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:56,895	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	They'll be 28
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:00,735	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	1029
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:07,903	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Because clearly we have not yet gotten to that more perfect union and each one of these amendments represents a Time
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:10,207	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	We try to fix something in ourselves
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:12,255	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	This project is a testament
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:14,559	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	A love letter really

EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:40,927	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Short it's really about that
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:44,767	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Kevin Devine the artist who wrote about the 27th Amendment for us

EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:54,239	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	To ratify an amendment
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:57,823	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	It had been written almost 200 years earlier
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:00,895	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	So I got the 27th Amendment
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:03,455	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	For this project 27th Amendment

EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:20,607	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	GZA sound sensible thing
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:27,519	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Apparently brought forth in the 1789 and then not ratified until 1992 which is by
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:30,591	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	190 years or something the longest margin
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:38,783	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	And the story the people I was interested in where this college kid in the early 80s you write some papers
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:39,551	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	Saying that
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:42,367	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	She believes that they could still be ratified
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:44,415	| moreperfect120418_themostperfectalbumepisodenine |	And his teacher gives him a seat
