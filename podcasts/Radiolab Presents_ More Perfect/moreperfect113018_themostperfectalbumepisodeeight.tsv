EDL	00:00:35,328	00:00:36,608	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Times in history when
EDL	00:00:37,120	00:00:39,424	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Collectively we decided to
EDL	00:00:39,424	00:00:39,936	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Make
EDL	00:00:40,704	00:00:41,728	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Would seem like

EDL	00:01:02,208	00:01:05,536	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	We're going to start with number 12
EDL	00:01:05,536	00:01:07,840	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Probably not the man that you've ever thought about but
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:09,632	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Producer Rachel Cusick has
EDL	00:01:10,400	00:01:11,680	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	And she brings you this
EDL	00:01:11,680	00:01:12,192	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Lighter now
EDL	00:01:12,704	00:01:14,240	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Imagine a world where
EDL	00:01:15,008	00:01:18,592	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Ladies and gentlemen the Republican nominee for president people
EDL	00:01:18,592	00:01:19,872	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Donald J Trump
EDL	00:01:19,872	00:01:24,992	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	And the Democratic nominee for president Hillary Clinton Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton
EDL	00:01:25,760	00:01:27,296	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Both run for president of the United State

EDL	00:01:31,392	00:01:32,928	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	But instead of bowing out
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:35,488	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Hillary Clinton becomes Trump's Vice
EDL	00:01:36,000	00:01:38,304	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Let me respond to that because that's
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:39,072	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Horrifying
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:43,680	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Different kinds of campaigns there and it's a crazy thought
EDL	00:01:44,192	00:01:46,752	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Donald Trump's ideas
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:47,520	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Aren't just different
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:51,104	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	They are dangerously incoherent
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:57,504	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	She has no natural talents people attacked each other's character do we want his finger

EDL	00:02:00,576	00:02:06,976	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	She's one of the worst secretaries of State in the history of their mental stability
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:08,256	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	The psychiatrist

EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:11,840	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	But you were
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:13,376	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Totally out of control
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:14,912	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	I said there's a person
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:16,960	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	With a temperament that's got a problem
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:17,728	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Their voters
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:23,104	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Half of trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:24,896	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	They're not deplorable
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:30,016	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	The racist sexist homophobic xenophobic
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:35,648	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Islamophobic you-name-it lock her up is right
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:40,000	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	How do you lie to the FBI
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:42,304	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	And now you're running for president
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:43,584	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	How does that happen
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:49,728	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	I'm in no world would you pair these two people up and then expect them to coleta Country
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:53,568	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	But
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:57,152	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	For the first few years of our country
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:03:03,552	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	That's how elections worked a bunch of people ran for office person with the most votes became president and the person with you roast beef
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:04,576	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Vice president
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:07,136	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Very quickly things went South
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:14,816	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	1800 Thomas Jefferson squares off against John Adams Jefferson side basically called Adams a hideous for Mac
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:20,704	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Adam Sandler's back saying that Jefferson was the son of a half-breed Indian Squaw
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:26,848	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	And everybody jumps to the conclusion that there is no way that you guys can serve together
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:29,408	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	That our country needs a better way of doing us
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:31,968	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	And that way was
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:32,736	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	At 12.
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:34,784	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	12
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:36,320	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Election of President and Vice Pres

EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:43,488	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	And vote by ballot for President and Vice President
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:44,768	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	One of them
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:45,536	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	At least
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:48,352	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,656	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	They shall name in their ballots
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:52,704	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	The person voted for as president
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:54,240	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	And in distinct ballots
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:56,032	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	The person voted for as Vice Pres
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:04:02,432	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	From then on one person from each party would run with a chosen psychic and as long as they weren't from the same state elections
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:05,760	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Could carry on as normal without any Force Partnerships
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:08,320	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	I can't help but Wonder though if
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:10,368	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Maybe
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:16,000	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	In some small way this amendment fueled some of the hostility from the 2016 election
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:20,095	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Take away the pressure to be civilized
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:37,247	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Rachel Cusick
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:41,855	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	That lineup for the 12th Amendment another band that tackled the 12th
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:43,391	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	On was buried album
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:46,207	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Happens to be one of my favorite bands
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:50,559	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	I've been listening this guy for like 10 years from the band octopus project
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:52,351	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Guichos
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,631	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	The 12th Amendment for a track
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:55,679	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Without knowing too much about the amendment itself
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:59,519	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Unlike the more famous amendments like the first of the second
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:00,287	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	The 12th is
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:02,079	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Is pretty dry and mostly deals with
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:05,151	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Procedural details rather than describing
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:06,431	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Specific individual rights
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:07,455	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	So we weren't
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:09,247	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Completely sure how to approach it
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:12,575	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	When researching the amendment a little more
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:16,671	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Especially in the NSA we found called who's afraid of the 12th Amendment
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:17,951	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	It became clear that
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:21,023	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	The dryness and procedural language was
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:21,535	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	The point
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:23,071	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	That the Federalists
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:25,119	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Believe that an intricate structure of
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:27,935	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Checks and balances was a more effective deterrent
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:30,495	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	To a tyrannical government
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:32,543	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Van enumeration of specific rights
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:33,823	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Or parts
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:35,103	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Barriers as they called that approach
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:37,663	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Can I say something
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:40,223	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Really interesting to us about the concept
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:41,247	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	The series of
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:47,391	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Dispassionate systems and mechanisms being as much a defender of Liberty as some of the more
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:48,415	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Dramatic
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:50,975	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Flaming sword amendments in the Bill of Rights
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:03,263	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	The looping mechanical clacking sound in the track
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:07,871	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Connects with that image for us
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:15,551	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	And I really like how the interlocking rhythms of
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:22,975	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	The drums and the clacking sound provide the basis for the more dramatic
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:29,375	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Sense and Thurman's to enter on top of to continue the musical metaphor
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:35,775	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Four of the different approaches in the different amendments
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:38,079	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	I hope you and racetrack

EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:18,943	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	You can hear that full-song from the ox

EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:35,327	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	That's okay so we're going to skip right ahead from 12 to 20
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:38,911	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Because they both came about around the same time they both deal with the

EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:57,855	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Well
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:17:00,159	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	What did the 20th Amendment solve
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:01,183	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Lame duck problems
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:02,975	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	So we still have a legacy

EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:23,711	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	And that gets criticized because that old Congress if it loses power will suddenly confirm about
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:30,111	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Bunch of Judges or pass a bunch of laws or the president will issue a bunch of Pardons or or dual hose

EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:40,351	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	That wasn't changed by the 20th Amendment because the 20th Amendment itself like everything else in the mirror

EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:53,600	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	It's an idea.

EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:15,872	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	The state was in the middle of a special election to replace their senator
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:21,248	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	As I spoke to these people the number one thing that came through
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:23,040	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Was that they felt
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:23,552	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	As though
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:25,088	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Federal government
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:26,880	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Did not represent them
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:29,952	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	And did not represent their values and that they had no voice
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:33,280	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	They felt like American democracy was being rigged
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:34,048	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Bye

EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:40,960	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	At the time there was one candidate who spoke directly to that feeling
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:41,984	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	His big message
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:47,360	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	I do care about you I am like you I will represent you and not the special interests
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:50,944	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	That control Washington when he put it like that it sounds
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:52,224	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Kind of

EDL	00:24:58,624	00:25:02,720	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	And until you end up with candidates like Roy Moore

EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:23,200	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	That
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:23,968	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	That

EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:40,864	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	And this is something here a lot these days
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:43,168	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Maybe democracy
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:44,448	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Is not all it's cracked up to

EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:16,256	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	You know senators were essentially being
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:20,352	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Bought and sold now money-in-politics obviously
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:21,120	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Still an issue
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:22,144	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	It's not uncheck
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:26,240	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	The way that it really was I believe prior to the Seventeenth Amendment
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:29,056	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	So that's one reality
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:33,152	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Balanced against that you have
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:34,944	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	The current
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:35,968	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Where you get
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:37,504	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	The Roy Moore's of the world
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:45,184	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	And it seems like we the people have this tendency sometimes to take out the proverbial gun
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:45,952	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Polish it
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:48,000	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	When it right down at our foot
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:53,632	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	I think that is a problem but for me it's the lesser of two evils
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:57,728	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Nancy thinks back to those Progressive lawmaker
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:28:58,496	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Curse who
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:29:00,288	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	First made the 17th Amendment happen
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:01,312	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Bear moment
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:02,848	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Was this
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:04,128	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Real belief
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:05,664	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	In the power of the people
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:12,064	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	It's progressives you don't love these people were being with live during the Civil War they remembered Abraham Lincoln they really
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:12,576	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Believe
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:14,112	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	That you could trust
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:17,440	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	The people in power them and they would use that power
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:17,952	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	For good
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:26,400	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	That says a lot about their moment and I think the idea of repealing it now says a certain
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:27,680	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Amount about our moment
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:28,704	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	There are risks
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:29,472	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	In democracy
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:35,104	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	I just don't think that we have the right to expect that everything is going to be simple or it's going to be perfect
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:37,408	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	The deeply
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:39,200	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	Frustrating thing about democracy
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:42,784	| moreperfect113018_themostperfectalbumepisodeeight |	But also the deeply beautiful thing about it
