EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:20,032	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Nearby convenience store it was only two or three blocks from his house he needed some orange juice
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:22,080	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Because he was

EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:28,224	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Soda Thorn Hopkins from car
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:32,576	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	They drove over to the convenience store to store and got out of bottle of orange juice
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:34,112	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Got to the checkout counter but
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:35,392	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	There's a line there
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:39,488	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	So it puts the bottle down and hurries out get back in
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:40,512	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Find car by takeoff
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:42,304	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Now
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:44,096	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	This is where the problems
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:45,376	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Started
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:52,032	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	10. At the same time all that's happening there's actually an officer who was African-American
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:58,432	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Sitting in his squad car and what that officer observed was a man hurrying out of the store jump
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:03:02,016	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Tapping into a waiting car and quickly driving off
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:04,064	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	So you started to hail
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:06,624	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	The Thorn is friend but after a couple of blocks
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:10,208	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Hold him over just to determine what was going on there
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:14,048	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	So he goes up to the driver side presumably gets to Thorns buddies driver's
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:15,840	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Goes back to his squad car
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:20,960	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Start radioing to get ahold of the convenience store to see if anything that happened
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:27,616	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	And it's right around that moment that the soreness in the passenger seat of the car suddenly opened his
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:29,152	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Store got out of the car

EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:08,735	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Ask the officer to pull the wallet out of his back pocket
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:09,503	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	And
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:10,783	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	One of the officers
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:11,551	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Sad

EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:18,719	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Pretty nasty
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:19,487	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	A scuffle ensued
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:26,911	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	According to what is known as kasodus at the storm was resisting the officers and apparently officers slammed his head into his room

EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:31,263	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	He suffered head and shoulder injuries he also ended up with a broken foot cut his wrist
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:33,311	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	And eventually
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:37,919	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	The officers pick him up one on each arm one on each leg and just
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:38,687	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Throw him into
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:39,967	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	The back of a squad car
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:48,415	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	While this was going on a few people gathered around and how long after that the officers learned
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:50,719	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	That nothing at all had happened at
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:54,815	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	The convenience store there was no crime there was no robbery there was no shoplifting
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:57,375	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	So he drove them back to his house still in handcuffs
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,399	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Hold amount of
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:05:59,167	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	EPPICard

EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:04,031	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Lay them out in his
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:06,847	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Front yard took the handcuffs off and then just drive away
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,943	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Was there an apology

EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:18,111	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Now what came out of that day in Charlotte
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:21,439	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Would end up becoming one of the most important
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:23,231	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Supreme Court cases

EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:31,167	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	That
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:33,215	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Something so seemingly small
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:40,127	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Would eventually become tied to this end
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:46,527	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	All the shootings we've seen in past years mostly of young black men every time we hear one of these shootings ever

EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:46,847	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Big part of it that was about
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:50,175	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Police brutality
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:56,575	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Los Angeles
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:09:02,975	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Also what was the long hot summer of 1967
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:09,375	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	150 race riots across the country
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:14,495	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Police station keeping teeth in
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:16,799	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	I will not accept
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:23,199	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Charges against policeman I will not accept charges against policeman
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:29,599	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	This is a job not some wild-eyed cracker that made the statement although there might not be any difference
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:31,391	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Not be any difference if you can think on that
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:32,927	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	You understand that
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:39,327	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	If we cannot bring charges against the policeman who have murdered us and destroyed our homes and businesses where were we
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:40,863	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	We go where will we go
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:45,983	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	She didn't want him to have to experience
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:47,263	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	All that
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:47,775	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	All that matters
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:51,359	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	So ended up I think he ended up going to Fayetteville State
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:53,663	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Black college in North Carolina
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:56,479	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Amanda Sorensen graduated one of the first jobs
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:10:00,575	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	They had he work for an employer call Dell Precision Springs
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:06,975	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	It was a steel company that specialize in making Springs but at a certain point you actually suing the company discriminate
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:09,791	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Nation based on how they were treating
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:16,191	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	You know people of color so after that day with the officers and Charlotte one thing I do remember Dad saying was that
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:16,703	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	It wasn't right
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:18,239	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Difference going to fight
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:23,871	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Right and that is how he ends up walking into Woody's office on crutches in 1985
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:30,783	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	He tells what he I wanna sue the Charlotte Police Department so we went ahead and just filed a lawsuit in federal court
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:35,647	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Woody takes it to trial and basically is ours going to the police but
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,671	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Excessive force
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:39,743	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	That was totally unnecessary under the circumstances
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:43,071	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Like they wrapped up a diabetic who is telling them that he was a diabetic
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:45,119	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Eventually the judge
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:47,679	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Ruled that
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:48,191	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	No
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:55,615	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	These officers did not use excessive force and if you were going to claim that they did what he had to show
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:11:01,247	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Police officers had acted maliciously for the purpose of causing harm
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:05,855	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Hot today they had to prove that the officers X cement
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:06,367	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Darden
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:07,903	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Yeah that
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:10,975	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Woody and the thorn had to prove that the officers
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:13,791	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Had it out for the thorn and we simply couldn't do that
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:16,863	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	If it seems like a really hard thing to prove
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:19,423	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	It's an almost impossible standard to me
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:21,471	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	I think it's important to zoom in on this
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:24,287	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Stop. For a second because it's really kind of like the
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:25,055	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Crux of the story
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:30,175	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	If the question is what should the standard be for holding a cop
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:30,687	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Accountable
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:31,967	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Portuguese
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:32,735	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Force 10
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:33,503	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	In the mid-eighties
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:37,599	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Malicious intent was sort of the prevailing standard
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:43,743	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	If you're going to claim that a police officer use excessive force against you and the standard was that you had to prove
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:46,303	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	But the officer did so
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,327	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	With malice
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:48,095	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	In their heart
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:50,143	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Why was that the standard
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:56,287	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	This is kind of hard to explain. I don't have the 14th amendment in front of me but it essentially
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:12:00,895	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	All you really need to know is that it was connected the Fourteenth Amendment to a particular clause
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:04,735	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	In the Fourteenth Amendment and this is why would he in the thorn lost that case
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:09,343	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Okay alright so loses a federal court lose it Federal makes its way up to before it starts
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:09,855	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Court of Appeals
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:14,719	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	That went nowhere the court of appeals ruled against us
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:15,743	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Same thing same thing
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:21,631	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Then nothing after that ruling what are you get the phone call and you hear me
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:25,471	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	From Jerry Beaver unknown civil rights lawyer
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:31,871	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	In the area in Fayetteville North Carolina Gerald was older and wiser than me that's your wording not mine
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:38,271	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Mary had caught wind of the circuit decision you should not have to require that the police
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:39,039	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Softer
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:39,807	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Got it in for you
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:43,647	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	I just wanted to beat the crap out of you just cuz it made him feel better
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:48,255	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	So I called Woody and said are you guys planning on taking this case
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:50,559	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	To the Supreme Court
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:58,495	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	McClain can't really afford that I said tell him he doesn't have to worry about that we will be glad to take it on pro bono
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:13:00,799	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Oh and see if we can get this ruling overturned
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:03,103	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Wechat drawer

EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:18,207	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Different standard well of Glee season 4 cases
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:24,607	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Pulling up in the court that you had lawyers trying out all these different ideas now most of the courts were using the fort
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:31,007	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Malicious intent standard that appearing would have been like then there was also in the number of cases
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:37,407	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	What's the eighth unusual punishment punishment

EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:55,071	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	The wonders of the amendment that some of the courts were you seen that
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:57,887	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Woody and Jerry look to as they're sort of like

EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:01,471	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	4th amendment
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:07,615	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	The Fourth Amendment which is which is the government cannot subject citizens to unreasonable search and seizure
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:09,663	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	I have it on my legal pad
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:12,223	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	The fourth amendment is the right of the people to be
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:15,295	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Secure in their persons houses papers and effects
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:16,575	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Against

EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:20,159	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Shall not be violated
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:23,487	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	It is seizure just another word for force
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:24,767	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Like I have the right not to eat

EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:33,727	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Entering so much about the fourth amendment is that in there
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:35,007	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Is this one
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:36,287	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Important word
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:39,615	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Unreasonable reasonable reasonable
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:41,663	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	The concept of reasonable
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:44,991	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	What is reasonable and what is not reasonable
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:48,575	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	In-law reasonable is it supposed to be
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:49,343	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Objective
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:53,695	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	You look at the case from the facts of the case
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:54,975	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Not the wire
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:58,047	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Correct then you ask was this person's Behavior reasonable
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:01,631	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Or not they have to act with objective reasonableness
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:05,471	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Wait a second reasonableness is a slippery thing
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:07,263	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	What you find reasonable would I find reasonable
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:10,079	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Today will be different be completely different yes or no
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:16,223	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	It can feel slippery but legally the whole concept of reasonableness have hundreds of years of
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:17,247	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Precedent
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:24,159	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	I mean I I find this very fascinating and I don't know if you want me to give you like a little bit of

EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:32,351	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	To give me a little bit of black stuff in it if it's interesting how it came to be and how popular it is
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:38,751	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Take me to take me on the ride okay alright so we go back to the 1830s Andrew Jackson

EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:23,295	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	So bad
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:25,599	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	But Kelly was one of these astronomers who knew you could use
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:27,647	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Asset statistics difficulty settings
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:33,791	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	You could take an average of all the different measurements and average of the meteorological data and I can help you pinpoint
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:38,655	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	We're stars were actually going to be in the sky so that they can make predictions

EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:16,607	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	This reasonable person
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:19,423	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	It's one of the longest established
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:25,823	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Fictional characters that exist in what is known as like the legal village where you have these other little characters like it starts with the reasonable person
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:28,895	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	And then you start you get like a slew of these other
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:32,735	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	These other characters that come out of that which is I have a little list there's

EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:59,615	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Where there's this is being done or you have the ability within your craft harm somebody
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:02,943	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Legally it became very useful to have an average
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:04,479	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Archetypal person
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,247	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Doing that crap
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:07,295	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	So that the jury or the judge
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:11,391	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Would have something to use as a measurement when rendering
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:14,207	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	It's interesting so like in the hairdresser example
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:17,279	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Whatever it was that led to that
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:19,839	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Ray's probably was a Cadillac
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:21,119	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Survey
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:23,167	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	And imagine one of hairdresser Behavior
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:27,007	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Yeah lake lake maybe you went in to get a haircut and you walked out and
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:33,407	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Half years gone right and you're just like we're to have my year ago and then it's just you go to Courtney like any reasonable hair dress
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:34,943	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	I would not have made that cut
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:35,711	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Right
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:37,247	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Switch success starts with a C
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:38,783	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Stronger and ends up with this
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:42,367	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Village of reasonableness the funny thing about the village
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:47,231	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Please this is pretty sure Kelly Prime in English law
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:53,375	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Like Matt said there's like this Village of people but in England at the time they had this idea that it wasn't like
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:56,191	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	A village it was people on a bus
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:58,751	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Call the man on the Clapham omnibus
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:05,151	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Switches are roughly I looked up London bus route 88
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:11,039	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	I don't know they just ride the all day those people just waiting for the case to come up and do a hair dresser
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:14,623	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	In the next. Concept moved in like Australia
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:20,768	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	I was like okay we should use that until one part called that the man on the Bondi tram and another Park called at the man on the Burke Street tram
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:22,560	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Hong Kong got it
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:24,352	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	And they said it's a man on the
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:27,680	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Shang-chi one tram
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:28,704	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	It went to the bus
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:31,776	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Convenient vessel to hold all these reasonable people
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:34,592	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	England said all these people are on a bus
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:35,616	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Because
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:37,408	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	You didn't want someone who's like
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:40,224	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	So slowly
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:44,064	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	That they are like they're not riding the bus really cold up in a cave somewhere or someone that is like
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:50,976	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	IHOP on their Castle it's like the Common Man exactly so it said it was described as reasonably educated intelligent but
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:51,488	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Nondescript
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:54,304	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	I think like what what Woody
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:55,072	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	And Jerry
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:56,864	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Bring it all the way back
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:22:02,496	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	We're simply trying to do is to say we need to use the Fourth Amendment and his idea of unreasonable search and seizure
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:04,800	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	To create a reasonable officer
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:09,408	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	So we need to add a reasonable officer to the Village
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:10,176	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Where the bus
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:10,688	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	So

EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:24,512	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	His case went before The Supreme Court
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:27,072	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Dethorne Graham vs enes Kanter
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:31,168	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Now it's almost there for the argument was there as a spectator

EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:18,144	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Me to say a few words for contact police officers have dangerous
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:22,240	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	I think we can all agree and on occasion they do have to use Force
EDL	00:35:22,752	00:35:27,104	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	And we should say that the majority of the people who are killed by police every year
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:27,616	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Are white
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:31,968	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	But if you look at the number of black people were killed and you balance that against
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:35,296	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Fact that black people only make up about
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:37,088	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	12% of the overall population
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:38,880	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	What you end up with
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:40,416	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Is
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:42,208	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	That an unarmed black man is
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:45,536	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Roughly about seven times more likely to
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:46,304	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	To be
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:48,608	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Killed by police in an unarmed white man

EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:51,168	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Add these numbers
EDL	00:35:51,168	00:35:51,936	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Are very
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:54,240	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Disputed and argued about but what is clear
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:35:58,848	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Is most police officers who use deadly force whenever charged
EDL	00:35:58,848	00:36:00,384	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Even smaller

EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:04,224	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	You actually let me just ask you
EDL	00:36:04,736	00:36:06,272	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	All the cases we heard about
EDL	00:36:06,272	00:36:07,808	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Before the break that Litany of cases
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:11,136	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	In the past few years in every single one of those
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:14,976	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	The jury was asked did this officer behave like a reasonable offer
EDL	00:36:14,976	00:36:15,744	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	It should
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:18,048	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	And every single one the jury said yes
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:19,584	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:20,352	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Why
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:22,144	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Well that's it because
EDL	00:36:22,144	00:36:23,680	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	The reasonable officer standard
EDL	00:36:23,680	00:36:26,240	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Like from from the moment that it was created
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:29,312	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	I was actually kind of it was constrained
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:31,360	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	If you very important ways
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:35,200	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Pure the
EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:36,992	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	The jury instruction
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:38,016	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	From the 9th circuit
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:39,808	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	And this is what dreams members are
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:46,208	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	I told to think about when they have to assess this kind of use of force

EDL	00:36:50,304	00:36:51,072	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Yeah
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:57,472	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	It says under the Fourth Amendment a police officer may use only such Force as objectively reasonable
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:37:01,312	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	You must judge the reasonableness of a particular use of force from
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:04,384	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	The perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:06,944	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	And not with 20/20 vision of hindsight
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:08,480	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Those those are
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:10,272	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	A couple really crucial

EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:20,000	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	An officer on the scene so you have to look at it through the eyes of the officer on the scene and then
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:24,096	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	You can't look at it through the 20/20 vision of hindsight difficult yourself

EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:44,320	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	The reason why this particular use of force must be judged

EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:49,696	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Rather than with the

EDL	00:37:55,072	00:37:56,608	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	And this is extremely important
EDL	00:37:56,608	00:37:58,912	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	The police officers are often forced to make

EDL	00:45:46,623	00:45:47,647	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	What was the call
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:50,463	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	However you see this
EDL	00:45:50,975	00:45:51,999	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Start moving up or down

EDL	00:45:55,327	00:45:56,095	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Pull something out
EDL	00:45:59,423	00:46:01,727	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	And so

EDL	00:46:14,783	00:46:18,367	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	For him he's just like over and over and over stresses
EDL	00:46:18,367	00:46:21,951	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	What would a reasonable police officer do

EDL	00:51:25,823	00:51:26,847	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Ie

EDL	00:51:49,631	00:51:51,167	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	What pace he was coming at you
EDL	00:51:52,959	00:51:55,007	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	At first it was a pretty rapid pace

EDL	00:52:19,327	00:52:21,375	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	This is a huge question

EDL	00:53:08,991	00:53:12,063	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Which at the time I thought was had that work
EDL	00:53:12,063	00:53:13,855	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	I thought the taser had struck him
EDL	00:53:13,855	00:53:14,879	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Make contact
EDL	00:53:16,159	00:53:18,975	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	I had absolutely no idea if he had a weapon on him or not
EDL	00:53:18,975	00:53:21,791	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	And was he at first it was the suspect ever still

EDL	00:53:35,103	00:53:37,663	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	And anyway anyway I didn't think my gun was working
EDL	00:53:39,199	00:53:40,223	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Thought I was going to die
EDL	00:53:41,247	00:53:43,039	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	There's nothing I would do to stop it
EDL	00:53:43,551	00:53:46,111	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	What was the reason that you continue to fire your weapon
EDL	00:53:46,623	00:53:48,159	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Because he wouldn't stop
EDL	00:53:48,927	00:53:50,463	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	People trying to get to my gun

EDL	00:57:07,839	00:57:09,119	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Standard like what
EDL	00:57:09,119	00:57:11,679	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Understand is that it was an attempt to really
EDL	00:57:15,007	00:57:17,311	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Look at these situations these shootings
EDL	00:57:17,311	00:57:18,847	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Uses of force cases
EDL	00:57:19,359	00:57:21,663	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Through this sort of objective lens
EDL	00:57:21,663	00:57:24,223	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Swear you're just looking at all the fat on the ground
EDL	00:57:25,759	00:57:29,087	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	And yet he says don't seem to be tied that like any sort of objectivity
EDL	00:57:29,087	00:57:32,927	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Yeah hearing Moses where you're like oh that's actually like
EDL	00:57:33,951	00:57:34,719	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	That feels like a
EDL	00:57:34,719	00:57:36,255	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Pure sort of objectivity
EDL	00:57:37,023	00:57:37,791	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Like what what
EDL	00:57:37,791	00:57:39,327	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	What has this guy done yet
EDL	00:57:39,839	00:57:41,119	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Actually done anything
EDL	00:57:41,119	00:57:42,655	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	He ran it a buddy
EDL	00:57:42,655	00:57:43,679	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Maybe
EDL	00:57:43,679	00:57:44,191	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	But that was
EDL	00:57:44,703	00:57:45,471	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	It
EDL	00:57:45,471	00:57:45,983	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	And
EDL	00:57:48,543	00:57:51,359	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Like if you're white
EDL	00:57:53,407	00:57:58,271	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Are you more likely to say yes that was reasonable because he's white and he was afraid of a black man
EDL	00:57:58,783	00:58:00,831	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Like that is the question
EDL	00:58:03,135	00:58:06,719	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Given the history of our country I'd say many cases that's not even
EDL	00:58:09,023	00:58:10,815	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Thanks Christian I'm actually left with is
EDL	00:58:12,351	00:58:15,167	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	If this is where the reasonableness standard has lettuce
EDL	00:58:15,935	00:58:17,727	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Is there another standard
EDL	00:58:17,727	00:58:19,007	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	I think that's right
EDL	00:58:19,007	00:58:23,103	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	This is what he can at again he represented the phonogram in that original case
EDL	00:58:23,103	00:58:25,663	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	When you say it applied you wonder
EDL	00:58:26,687	00:58:30,271	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Whether or not this is the best standard or there might be something better
EDL	00:58:31,039	00:58:33,599	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	I just don't have an answer to that
EDL	00:58:34,111	00:58:36,415	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	I would I would suggest the whole more erratic
EDL	00:58:37,439	00:58:38,975	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Is Elie mystal more proof
EDL	00:58:38,975	00:58:42,303	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Next legal editor we ended up talking with him about this
EDL	00:58:44,351	00:58:47,167	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Shortly after the philando Castile verdict came out so he was
EDL	00:58:48,191	00:58:50,751	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Well that was a tough pill for him and many people
EDL	00:58:50,751	00:58:53,311	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Swallow I would suggest that they have to be
EDL	00:58:53,823	00:58:55,615	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	The cops have to be right in fact
EDL	00:58:56,127	00:59:02,015	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Which is something we usually do not apply for what does that mean like it from in the scenario of a police person woohoo
EDL	00:59:03,039	00:59:07,903	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Is that mean like I need to be right that you don't have a toy gun that that's
EDL	00:59:07,903	00:59:10,719	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	So if you shoot me because you think I have a gun I had best Havoc
EDL	00:59:11,487	00:59:14,047	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	And if I don't have a gun your ass is going to jail
EDL	00:59:14,047	00:59:15,071	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Cuz you were wrong
EDL	00:59:15,071	00:59:16,351	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	I don't care if you lie thoughts
EDL	00:59:16,351	00:59:18,143	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	If I was telling you I had a gun
EDL	00:59:18,143	00:59:21,727	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	If you are not right in fact than you
EDL	00:59:21,727	00:59:22,751	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Have to go to jail
EDL	00:59:22,751	00:59:25,055	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	I think that is that would be a standard
EDL	00:59:25,055	00:59:26,591	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Several hours to prosecute
EDL	00:59:27,103	00:59:27,615	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Beast Boy socks
EDL	00:59:28,127	00:59:32,991	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Cinepolis person's going to just going to argue that like you don't understand the pressures that are under its

EDL	00:59:40,671	00:59:41,951	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	I would say screw you

EDL	01:00:24,191	01:00:25,215	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Probably not real
EDL	01:00:26,495	01:00:30,079	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Given that most Americans according to polls respectively
EDL	01:00:30,079	01:00:34,175	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Confidence mclees Percy please to be the enforcers

EDL	01:00:46,975	01:00:48,255	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Could actually
EDL	01:00:48,767	01:00:50,047	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Also be hiding in there
EDL	01:00:50,815	01:00:51,839	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	What do you mean
EDL	01:00:51,839	01:00:53,375	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Okay so you know how
EDL	01:00:53,887	01:00:57,471	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Chief justice rehnquist when he wrote the decision in 89
EDL	01:00:57,471	01:01:03,615	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	He put in all these phrases that took the idea of a regional officer and unconstrained it bro
EDL	01:01:04,127	01:01:07,455	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	These were like it's been trained only
EDL	01:01:07,455	01:01:13,599	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	To this little moment in time it's been trained to the perspective of the officers or constrained that there's no 20-20 hindsight
EDL	01:01:13,599	01:01:14,367	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	All that
EDL	01:01:14,367	01:01:18,463	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	What in the decision he also you slipped in this other phrase
EDL	01:01:18,975	01:01:21,535	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	He was actually calling back to an earlier today
EDL	01:01:21,535	01:01:23,583	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	And what he wrote was
EDL	01:01:25,375	01:01:31,775	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	The question is whether the totality of circumstances justifies a particular sort of seizure
EDL	01:01:31,775	01:01:33,055	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Tality of circumcised
EDL	01:01:33,055	01:01:34,847	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Totality of circumstances
EDL	01:01:34,847	01:01:37,151	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	It seems to be at odds with
EDL	01:01:37,151	01:01:38,431	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	All of the other stuff
EDL	01:01:39,455	01:01:45,855	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Right which is all about like little slivers and moment
EDL	01:01:45,855	01:01:50,207	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Detecting that this is like this is the whole thing
EDL	01:01:50,207	01:01:56,607	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Both both ideas and their wants right now you see the lower courts are arguing
EDL	01:01:56,607	01:02:02,495	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	About what displays actually means until half of the circuits are saying kind of like everything that we've already talked about
EDL	01:02:02,495	01:02:05,823	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Which is that all the totality circumstances means is that
EDL	01:02:06,335	01:02:12,735	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	You look at everything to answer the question was the officer's scared you look at everything that the officer would have known
EDL	01:02:12,735	01:02:18,623	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Turn everything the officer would have seen received and then you ask okay knowing all that was it reasonable for the awesome music
EDL	01:02:19,903	01:02:21,439	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	The other half of the circuit say
EDL	01:02:21,439	01:02:23,743	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Natalia circumstances
EDL	01:02:23,743	01:02:28,095	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Isn't just about what the officer knew what the officer saw and how it answers the moment
EDL	01:02:28,607	01:02:30,143	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Fatality means like totality
EDL	01:02:31,167	01:02:32,959	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Like what did the officer
EDL	01:02:32,959	01:02:33,727	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Do
EDL	01:02:33,727	01:02:34,751	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Leading up to the mall
EDL	01:02:34,751	01:02:35,775	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Did the officer
EDL	01:02:35,775	01:02:40,639	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Try to get a search warrant to the officer try to deescalate the situation before
EDL	01:02:40,639	01:02:44,479	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Are using force to be officer try to subdue the person before using deadly force
EDL	01:02:44,479	01:02:48,063	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Assembly all those things that usually kept out of the frame
EDL	01:02:48,575	01:02:49,855	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Maybe
EDL	01:02:49,855	01:02:53,695	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Can be let back in
EDL	01:02:54,719	01:02:59,327	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Supreme Court so far has shown no interest in ruling on this in trying to sort this out
EDL	01:03:00,095	01:03:00,863	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	But they might
EDL	01:03:01,887	01:03:04,703	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Because the argument is happening in the lower courts
EDL	01:03:05,983	01:03:12,383	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	So in a way we're kind of looking at a time very much like 1984 when does Lauren Graham got pulled over at
EDL	01:03:12,383	01:03:13,919	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Outside a convenience store in Charlotte
EDL	01:03:15,199	01:03:18,271	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Waiting to see whether it matters that the thorn Graham
EDL	01:03:18,271	01:03:19,551	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Wasn't trying to steal anything
EDL	01:03:20,319	01:03:21,599	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Maybe just a diabetic
EDL	01:03:22,879	01:03:23,647	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Try to get some orange juice
EDL	01:03:31,327	01:03:33,119	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Did what happen your dad affect how you
EDL	01:03:33,631	01:03:34,399	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Thought of
EDL	01:03:34,399	01:03:35,423	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Police how you thought police
EDL	01:03:35,935	01:03:37,215	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Bean bean black man
EDL	01:03:37,215	01:03:37,727	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Well
EDL	01:03:38,239	01:03:39,775	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	You'll believe it or not
EDL	01:03:41,055	01:03:41,823	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	It didn't
EDL	01:03:43,359	01:03:43,871	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	What's up
EDL	01:03:44,639	01:03:45,919	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	I like the base my
EDL	01:03:47,455	01:03:48,479	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Opinion
EDL	01:03:48,479	01:03:49,759	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	It's based on my own
EDL	01:03:50,783	01:03:51,551	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Experiences
EDL	01:03:52,575	01:03:54,367	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	My dad and I can say this Kelly
EDL	01:03:55,647	01:03:58,719	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	I can remember my dad telling me stories of
EDL	01:03:59,487	01:04:02,047	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Where he grew up in eastern North Carolina
EDL	01:04:02,815	01:04:03,839	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	On a tobacco farm
EDL	01:04:04,351	01:04:05,375	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	In that small town
EDL	01:04:05,375	01:04:07,679	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	I can remember him telling me a story of
EDL	01:04:08,191	01:04:09,215	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	A black man
EDL	01:04:10,239	01:04:11,263	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Who have been accused
EDL	01:04:14,591	01:04:16,127	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Being inappropriate with a white woman
EDL	01:04:17,151	01:04:18,431	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	And how the white
EDL	01:04:18,943	01:04:20,223	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Got them in broad daylight
EDL	01:04:20,735	01:04:22,015	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Castrated him in broad daylight
EDL	01:04:24,319	01:04:26,367	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	And I say that
EDL	01:04:26,367	01:04:27,135	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	In saying that
EDL	01:04:27,903	01:04:30,975	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Although he experienced all that stuff growing up
EDL	01:04:31,487	01:04:33,535	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	And the racism that he experienced growing up
EDL	01:04:34,559	01:04:36,095	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	He didn't teach that
EDL	01:04:36,095	01:04:38,143	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	You didn't teach that does he told us
EDL	01:04:38,911	01:04:39,679	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	To love people
EDL	01:04:41,215	01:04:41,727	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	So
EDL	01:04:42,239	01:04:43,519	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Even now myself
EDL	01:04:44,287	01:04:46,079	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	I base my experience over
EDL	01:04:46,079	01:04:46,847	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Four-person
EDL	01:04:46,847	01:04:48,383	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	I base my experience of the police
EDL	01:04:49,407	01:04:50,175	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Based on
EDL	01:04:50,175	01:04:50,943	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	My dealings with
EDL	01:04:51,455	01:04:53,247	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	In and not that I want
EDL	01:04:53,247	01:04:54,527	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	But I have yet

EDL	01:04:55,807	01:04:59,391	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	A police officer who's been mean to me who's been rude to me
EDL	01:04:59,391	01:05:00,671	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Who's mistreated me
EDL	01:05:01,183	01:05:02,975	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	And that's the God's honest truth
EDL	01:05:02,975	01:05:03,743	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Without
EDL	01:05:03,743	01:05:05,535	| moreperfect113017_mrgraham |	Button and being completely honest
