EDL	00:00:23,296	00:00:26,880	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Supreme Court chief justice Earl Warren is retiring or a Warren of
EDL	00:00:26,880	00:00:27,904	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	The Warren Court
EDL	00:00:27,904	00:00:29,184	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Isn't that a big word
EDL	00:00:29,952	00:00:34,560	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Yeah that's what I think of you think of legendary

EDL	00:00:41,728	00:00:45,568	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Rights that he's retiring he's been on the court for 16 years
EDL	00:00:46,080	00:00:48,128	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And he's in an interview and he's asked
EDL	00:00:48,128	00:00:54,272	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	How would you list Mister Chief Justice of the Supreme Court's most important decision you're 16 years here
EDL	00:00:55,296	00:01:01,696	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He's kind of astounding
EDL	00:01:01,696	00:01:02,976	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Before you hear the answer
EDL	00:01:04,000	00:01:08,096	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Think that you need to know that he could have said all kinds of cases
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:09,632	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Is he was the chief justice
EDL	00:01:10,144	00:01:10,912	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	During
EDL	00:01:11,424	00:01:17,568	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Miranda

EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:36,768	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Sad when I know that one
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:37,792	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He doesn't say any of those
EDL	00:01:39,328	00:01:40,352	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Was he say
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:42,912	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He says this little case called
EDL	00:01:42,912	00:01:44,704	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	The Baker vs. Carr case
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:46,752	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Baker vs. Carr
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:50,848	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	The back case
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:53,408	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Is perhaps the most important case that believe that
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:55,200	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Since I've been on the court
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:02:00,320	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He thought that case whatever it is is more important than the case that desegregated schools
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:00,832	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	You did
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:02,624	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	So what the hell is it
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:03,648	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Exactly
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:05,440	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	No really what is it
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:08,768	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	It's this case that was so dramatic and
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:09,792	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	So traumatic
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:12,352	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	It apparently broke to Justice
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:14,656	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	There was an instance
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:15,936	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	In which my
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:19,008	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Brother found my father going upstairs
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:19,520	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	To get a shot
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:28,736	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Supreme Court of the United States
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:42,816	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	United States
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:47,168	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	United States and this honorable Court
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:10,720	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Is this more perfect miniseries about the Supreme Court just a frame the story we're about to hear for
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:11,488	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Second
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:13,280	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	As we were putting the show together
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:16,096	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	We hosted a panel discussion
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:19,680	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Best one stage and a woman in the audience asked the following question
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:21,472	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Yes could you
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:24,032	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Address what I see is the
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:26,592	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Increasing politicization
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:29,152	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Of the Court the apotheosis of which I guess was
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:32,224	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	You know voting
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:35,552	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Electing Bush to be a hour
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:36,576	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	President
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:42,976	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Difficult always been this way is this just my perception that it's becoming more popular size
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:46,048	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	See this turns out to be really interesting question turns out
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:50,144	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	I didn't know this until City started looking into it that there was a moment
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:52,704	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	When the Pandora's Box
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:53,984	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Just got ripped open
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:58,848	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	So I think they understand that moment and this story you have to get to know 3 characters
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:05,248	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	These aren't necessarily the three most important justices of all time because at that time you had chief justice Earl
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:09,088	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Warren and William Brennan on the court and he's our kind of giants
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:11,904	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	But for this story
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:13,184	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	These three guys are
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:16,000	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	One of them is on the right one of them is on the left
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:17,791	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And one of them is
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:19,071	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Stuck right in the middle
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:20,863	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Tragically in the middle
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:22,655	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Air on the conservative side
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:25,471	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	What difference does it make when it's in the Constitution
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:28,543	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Any other expression or action by the state
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:30,591	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	You had a guy named Felix Frankfurter
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:32,639	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Did Justice Frankfurter was one of the most
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:34,943	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Latest really it name is really Frankfurter
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:35,967	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	One of the most
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:37,503	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Influential Justice
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:42,367	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Of all time I bet taragrove she teaches constitutional law at William and Mary Law School
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:43,135	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	I'm here
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:46,719	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	A very influential scholar at Harvard Law School before
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:47,231	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He became address
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:52,095	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	With a close adviser to Franklin Delano Roosevelt he was extremely smart
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:53,119	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Towering figure
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:54,655	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	But as a person
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:55,935	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Justice
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:57,727	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Justice Frankfurter
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:01,055	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He wasn't necessarily
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:02,591	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	The nicest person
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:03,615	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	I heard that from everyone
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:06,175	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	I always call him a Bantam rooster
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:09,759	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He was a difficult Krusty figure who is short
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:11,295	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	A little bit of a pouch
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:14,879	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Was one of the most
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:15,647	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	What Justice is
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:20,255	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He was a tough customer when a clerk would come to the US
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:23,839	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Supreme Court Chambers to deliver a message in the person of the door
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:26,655	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Tried to hand Justice Frankfurter the paper
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:29,727	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Frankfurter would inevitably Let It Drop to the ground
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:33,055	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	So the person had to bend down and pick it up
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,079	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Two handed to him again
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:35,615	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Dude that's a
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:45,087	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And by the way the voices you heard besides Tara Grover professors Mike seidman Georgetown University

EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:59,935	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Okay so Frankfurter is on one side of the aisle and his Nemesis is a gentleman on the other side of the aisle
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:06,335	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Illiberal named William O Douglas
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:12,735	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He was Justice Douglas now in the Supreme Court Chambers recording from the 1950s
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:14,271	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	7 interview with Justice Douglas
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:20,671	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Looks very well as faces 10 rugged his eyes sparkle
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:21,951	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Mountain climbing environmentalist
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:28,351	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Big on civil liberties
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:31,679	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Music by generation was like Justice Frankfurter
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:34,751	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Douglas was a prick
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:37,311	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	But everybody around him everybody hated him
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:41,663	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	All those same adjective
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:42,943	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Applied
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,223	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Here's how the New York Times
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:50,367	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Scriptum Douglas was married four times
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:07:01,119	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	This is footage from his last marriage to his wife Kathleen
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:03,167	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He was 67
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:03,935	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	She was 23
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:07,263	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	So
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:09,567	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Yes yes that it that is William Douglas
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:12,895	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	They have these two guys Frankfurter the Bantam rooster Douglas
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:15,455	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	The prick and as you can imagine big hater
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:15,967	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Charter
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:18,527	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Despise
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:25,951	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	So Frankfurter had this habit of monologuing and while he would go on and on Douglas with just pull out a book right in front of them
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:32,863	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Start reading you know he was just opening his the same for Frankfurter I actually found a series of interviews that word
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:35,935	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Donald Douglas in the early sixties where he basically calls Frankfurter names
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:52,831	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Wow
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:54,111	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Why they hate each other so much
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:57,951	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	According to Mike seidman some of that comes from
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:58,975	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Maybe there
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:00,511	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Difference in background
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:02,047	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Frankfurter was
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:03,071	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	A Jewish
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:04,863	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Immigrant from Austria
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:07,167	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	A Douglas was a Westerner
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,959	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	But according to him
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:11,007	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Or of their hatred
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:13,823	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Actually was ideological reflected
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:16,383	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	I really important split
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:19,711	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Over how powerful the court should be

EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:40,959	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	That growth should be reflected in the number of Congress people that are representing them but at that time
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:47,359	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Tennessee Hennessy hadn't changed its legislative district
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:53,759	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Since 1901 which was 60 years earlier will this create a big problem
EDL	00:16:53,759	00:17:00,159	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Sims 4 urban areas like Memphis because in those 60 years people have moved to the cities in
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:02,975	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Gross and rural areas were getting smaller
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:09,375	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	But the Tennessee State Legislature had refused to update account and it was still giving more representation to those real
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:09,887	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Rural areas
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:11,935	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	In Tennessee
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:13,983	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	The figure was
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:15,007	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	23 to 1
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:19,359	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	NYU Law Professor Sam is that girl that for people that don't understand how does it actually dilute

EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:20,895	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	This is very
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:23,199	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	You have one District that has
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:27,039	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	One person in it and you have another District
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:27,807	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	It has 20
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:28,319	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	T3 people
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:31,647	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	The district that has one person gives all the
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:32,159	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	The power to that
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:33,951	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	The district
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:35,231	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	It has 23 people
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:38,047	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Spread it out over Altamont
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:41,375	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	What I think of it this way
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:44,703	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	At that time a person in the city in Tennessee
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:50,847	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Had one 23rd as much of a voice in the legislature as a person living in the countryside and
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:51,871	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Cheers
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:53,919	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Sword of the Insidious underbelly of that
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:57,247	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	It just so happened that the people living in the countryside
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:57,759	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Are mostly White
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:01,343	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And a large percentage of the people living in the city were black
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:05,183	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Underline all of the reapportionment litigation leasing South was
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:06,207	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	White supremacy
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:11,327	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	That's Doug Smith historian and the author of on the market
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:17,215	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Your doorstep this is deeply tied to white supremacy in the maintenance of Jim Crow was a method of making sure that rural
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:20,799	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	A white legislators continue to control the power structure
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:28,223	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	So you had the situation he says we're a small minority was choking the majority
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:34,623	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Suburban areas from any sort of any sorts of funds cities couldn't get the money they needed for Rhodes education social services so
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:36,671	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	So the question at the Supreme Court was
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:38,719	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And it actually tackle this in two separate things
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:40,255	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	What should I do about this
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:52,799	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And here's where you get to the ideological Smackdown liberals on the court like Douglas basically agreed with the plaintiff when they are
EDL	00:19:05,855	00:19:12,255	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Liberal
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:15,583	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Yeah this is clearly an injustice people in the cities are getting screwed
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:22,495	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Their voting rights have been diluted in the basement
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:23,519	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Yes
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:25,823	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	People are getting hurt but we're not going to do any
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:32,735	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	We can't Frankfurter
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:39,135	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Zipper sleeve said we cannot get involved that as bad as it says it was not an issue that the court should get involved in right now
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:45,535	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Well
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:51,935	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	How to wear the salute during the fact that this is a unique situation
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:58,335	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Tennessee situation if we end up doing this in Tennessee pretty soon we'll be intervening in California South Carolina
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:20:04,735	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Jason will be rewriting the entire us legislative map
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:05,759	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Tennessee
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:08,063	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	This is the United States not Tennessee
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:13,439	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Yes so basically he felt like this would force the courts to get involved in politics
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:18,303	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And he really believe that the court should never ever get involved in politics
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:19,583	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	This is a
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:23,679	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	This is an idea that goes way back to something called
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:25,471	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Political question.
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:27,263	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	The political question Doctrine says
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:31,615	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	No federal court can decide this issue at all
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:34,431	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	E-courts simply had no business
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:35,967	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Getting into it work
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:40,831	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Consider to be fundamentally political questions and what could be more fun in my life political than the makeup of the legislature
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:47,231	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	It's a philosophy rooted in the notion that unelected lifetime judges should not
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:49,535	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Happy substituting their will
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:52,607	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	For the will of the people's elected representatives
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:59,775	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Frankfurter feel like even if you have a terrible political situation if the justices stepped in and overruled the legislature
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:01,567	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	That would be worse than doing nothing at all
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:04,127	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Because it would be fundamentally undemocratic
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:05,407	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	I'm he viewed
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:07,455	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Give you the political question Doctrine
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:11,039	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Is a crucial limitation on the Federal Judicial power
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:15,391	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And he wasn't alone the courts at follow this guideline for about a hundred and fifty years
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:20,000	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And even with the current case in Tennessee federal court that first heard the case
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:21,792	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Recognized
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:28,192	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	The situation actually referred to it as in evil
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:28,960	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Play info
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:32,032	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	But this is that this is a political question
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:33,568	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Malapportionment
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:38,176	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	The political question and only the political branches can handle this
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:41,504	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Protecting and enforcing
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:42,784	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Voting rights
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:46,112	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	So
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:52,768	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Ventana school when the lawyer for Tennessee got up there
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:59,168	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Didn't try to defend her Tennessee was counting or not counting its people he basically said yeah what we're doing is bad
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:01,472	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	But it's nobody's job but hours to fix
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:03,264	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Is it worth
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:06,080	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	The legislature of Tennessee
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:07,616	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Not
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:08,640	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Terraria potions
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:11,712	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Warriors

EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:25,024	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He basically said if you step in you're going to screw up the balance of power in America
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:27,072	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Power America comes from We the People
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:33,472	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Not the courts so this matter should be left up to the people of Tennessee and their elected representatives
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:36,032	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	If the whole problem is that you don't have a voice in the ledge
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:38,080	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Glacier then how can you suddenly
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:39,104	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	To have a voice
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:39,872	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	In legislature
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:44,992	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	I mean either way to change it would be SC legislature itself where to give up power and why would they do that
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:46,272	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Can of course
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:50,112	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Once elected officials are in power they have a vested interest
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:53,184	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And keeping their districts exactly as they are because
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:55,232	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Those are the districts that elected them
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:56,768	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And fundamentally
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:23:01,888	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Electoral Representatives knew that if they redrew the lines and they would be
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:05,728	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Voting themselves out of a little
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:06,496	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Copower

EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:11,872	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Not to do anything
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:17,760	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	So for the Liberals on the court they felt like this was a fundamental flaw in our democracy that needed to be fixed
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:19,552	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And nobody was going to fix it if they didn't
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:26,720	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Frankfurter he's like if you think of this one you can have to fix that one and that one and that one and that one and where is it going to stop
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:27,744	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	If you do this
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:34,912	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	There is no way out the Court's going to get stuck and what he called political Thicket

EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:19,456	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Are the justices head into conference that's a meeting with just the nine

EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:09,888	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	90 + straight minutes
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:13,216	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Darting around the room pulling books off the shelves
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:15,008	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Pulling books off the shelf
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:18,848	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Reading from prior cases gesticulating wildly
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:19,872	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	To make its point
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:22,432	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And the whole time looking directly at Whitaker
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:28,832	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	There was one account that I heard where Frankfurter went on for 4 hours
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:35,232	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	4 hours really lecturing Whitaker really really belittling him
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:37,280	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Yes it was it was horribly intimidate
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:40,608	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	At one point
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:42,656	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	One of the justices on the liberal side
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:43,680	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Justice Hugo Black
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:47,776	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He took Whittaker side was trying to make him feel better
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:52,896	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And black said to Charles Whitaker just remember we're all boys grown tall
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:57,504	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	We're not the gods who sit on high and dispense Justice
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:02,624	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	But it's very difficult not to see yourself in that role
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:07,488	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Particularly if your vote might be the vote that decides everything
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:10,816	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	This started a weigh heavily on Whitaker's mind
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:17,984	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He was disturbed by the by having the weight of Spring Court on his shoulders
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:24,896	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	According to his family Kate and Kent my mother tells me that he
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:25,920	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	At that time
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:27,712	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Was under a lot of stress
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:33,088	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And spoke as though he were dictating spoke his punctuation
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:40,256	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Hello Judas, it's very nice to meet you could clearly thinking about everything that he
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:44,096	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Might say being recorded I remember his
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:45,888	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Stating that he felt like
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:51,776	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	All the words that he ordered were being chiseled in stone as a result of Leaky Shed
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:53,056	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	You don't talk much
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:05,344	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	So after they heard the case the first time wudaokou couldn't make up his mind
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:09,184	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And actually incidentally there is another Justice Justice Stewart
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:13,536	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Who was the other Swing Vote in the case also couldn't make up his mind
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:17,376	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	The court decided to hear the case again in the fall
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:19,424	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Just cuz they needed more time
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:26,336	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And over the summer remain deeply divided that he actually
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:28,896	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Written memos on both sides of the issue
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:33,504	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Doug Smith says Whitaker wrote both and opinion for intervening in Baker vs. Carr
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:36,832	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And a dissent against intervening in Baker versus car
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:43,744	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	At the same time as he circulates
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:50,144	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	60 page memo explaining how this was a political question that should not be decided by the chords
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:50,912	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Please God
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:52,448	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	You know a fire in his belly
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:53,984	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He's not going to let
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:54,496	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	This one go
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:56,032	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Number 6
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:59,104	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Charles W Baker at Alice Cullen
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:02,944	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Monday October 9th 1961
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:05,760	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	It's 10 a.m. and the court is back in session
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:11,392	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Lawyer arguing the case against the Tennessee legislature begin to talk
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:12,928	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Federal courts
EDL	00:28:12,928	00:28:13,440	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Action
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:15,488	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Frankfurter sit quietly for about
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:16,512	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	5 minutes listening
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:18,048	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Without the light
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:19,584	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And then
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:21,120	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	You don't need them
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:26,752	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	I know right
EDL	00:28:47,488	00:28:50,304	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Frankfurter hammers the attorneys with questions
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:52,608	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	During the course of oral arguments
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:57,984	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He speaks approximately 170 * 170 + 70
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:28:59,520	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Charles Whitaker
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:01,056	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Have some
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:03,616	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	For the allocation
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:05,920	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Amish legislatures to dispatch
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:07,712	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	17 *
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:08,224	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Well
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:13,344	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	After nearly four hours of oral arguments
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:17,952	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	The justice is recess and going to conference
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:19,744	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Frankfurter needed
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:20,256	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Desperate
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:21,792	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He had a good war
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:24,096	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And he would tip
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:24,864	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	After him
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:26,656	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Like a
EDL	00:29:27,168	00:29:28,704	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Dog after a bone
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:30,240	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Trying to persuade
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:31,776	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And that
EDL	00:29:31,776	00:29:32,544	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Harassing
EDL	00:29:32,544	00:29:34,080	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Me. I have to make a point here
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:37,152	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	It was a nightmare
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:38,944	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And I saw the night
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:44,320	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	How so describe it to me
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:45,088	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Well
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:46,112	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He was
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:51,232	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	A nervous wreck
EDL	00:29:51,232	00:29:53,280	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And like a Cat on a Hot Tin Roof
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:56,608	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	I found out I don't know if he told me or his wife told me
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:57,632	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He was on tranquilizer
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:29:59,424	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Overcome
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:00,960	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	What he thought
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:01,984	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Was just work related
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:03,520	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Stress will clearly
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:04,800	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Something
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:06,080	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Was taking hold of him
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:08,640	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Who had trouble concentrating
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:11,712	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Highly fraught I would characterize
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:13,248	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He is eventual breakdown
EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:16,064	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	It's something of a slow descent
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:19,648	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	By the early spring
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:21,696	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	After the cord has return from its winter
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:22,720	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Recess
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:25,792	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Whitaker was absent from
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:26,304	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Court
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:32,192	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	You mean like he just didn't either getting show for work one day
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:33,216	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Apparently so
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:34,496	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Clerks didn't know where he
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:35,264	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He was
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:37,312	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	The other justices
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:39,104	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Didn't know his whereabouts
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:40,896	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He just disappeared
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:42,432	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Really in the
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:42,944	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Little
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:45,760	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Of what's going to become one of the
EDL	00:30:46,272	00:30:48,832	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Monumental decisions of the 20th century
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:50,624	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He disappears
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:52,672	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	She had to
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:53,184	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Escape
EDL	00:30:54,464	00:30:54,976	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Where'd you go
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:56,256	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Well
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:31:00,096	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He went to really what would be a cabin in the woods
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:02,144	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	In the middle of Wisconsin
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:07,264	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He called up one of his former Los Associates in Kansas City.
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:08,032	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Come up and join him
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:10,080	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And according to Craig Smith
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:13,408	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He in the sky whose name was Sam Milby
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:15,712	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	They would just
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:16,224	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Set there
EDL	00:31:17,504	00:31:18,528	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	On the bank of the lake
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:21,088	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	In silence
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:35,936	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	They would sit for hours on end not talking to each other
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:45,664	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Just waiting for the Justice to speak
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:32:02,304	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	We have no way of knowing what he was thinking at that moment but
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:04,096	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	I imagine he was just
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:07,680	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Sitting there and he was thinking about these two realities that could unfold like
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:10,752	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	On the one hand if the court stepped into politics
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:15,872	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	They can protect people
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:25,856	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	But on the other hand
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:29,184	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	President with the set
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:33,024	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Would it make the court too powerful
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:36,352	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	How much case
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:37,888	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Do it protect the people
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:39,424	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Has received
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:47,104	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Images mine went back and forth and back and forth
EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:50,176	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Kurt decided he really had to get back to work than this
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:51,968	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Protege would say to him
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:55,296	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	No just relax
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:58,880	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Did you just take it easy and
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:32:59,648	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Get yourself
EDL	00:32:59,648	00:33:01,696	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Together before you decide to go back
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:08,608	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	After three weeks Justice Whitaker returns to DC
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:09,376	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Back to Washington
EDL	00:33:10,656	00:33:12,192	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	For a few days
EDL	00:33:12,704	00:33:13,984	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	But can't again his son
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:17,568	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	We found my father to be

EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:27,808	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	When you said that he was suicidal what do you mean
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:32,416	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	There was an instance in which my
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:36,000	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Brother found my father going upstairs to get a shot
EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:45,472	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	A few days later
EDL	00:33:46,240	00:33:48,544	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Charles Whitaker check himself into a hospital
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:49,056	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	There is
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:53,920	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Some evidence that it was really Justice Douglas Who convinced Whitaker
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:33:55,712	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Go to the hospital
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:03,648	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	That's Justice William Douglas again
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:42,304	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	A few weeks later March 29th 1962

EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:54,592	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	It is with extreme regret
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:56,128	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	That I announce the
EDL	00:34:56,128	00:34:57,920	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Retirement of associate Justice of the Supreme

EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:14,560	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Reasons of disability
EDL	00:35:15,584	00:35:17,120	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	I know that the bench in the Box
EDL	00:35:17,888	00:35:18,656	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Of the entire nation
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:21,472	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Join me in commending this to just
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:21,984	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Aquatica
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:24,032	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	First devoted service to his country
EDL	00:35:25,056	00:35:26,592	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	During a critical period and its history
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:30,944	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Text I want to take this opportunity to
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:31,968	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Distress again the in Fort
EDL	00:35:32,480	00:35:34,272	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	The tax bill now before the house representative
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:35,808	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Wow
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:38,880	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Whatever happened with the case with Bakery card
EDL	00:35:39,392	00:35:41,696	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Whitaker didn't vote on Baker vs. Carr
EDL	00:35:42,208	00:35:44,256	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	So you could say that this case that
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:45,792	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Essentially broken
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:46,816	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	His vote didn't count
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:53,984	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Around the time that he was in the hospital there was sort of this liberal coup at the court where Frankfurter lost a couple of other vote
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:58,080	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	So in the end the decision actually wasn't very close at all
EDL	00:35:58,080	00:36:00,896	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	What was it it was 6 to
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:05,248	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And Brennan wrote the majority opinion and he says that this whole
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:07,552	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Kind of cluster that we've been fighting over
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:10,112	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Apostates in Tennessee counter voters
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:13,184	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	But this is something the court can and should look at
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:15,488	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	So another words I decided to
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:17,280	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Blow their horns and go into the thicket
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:19,328	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Oh yeah they did
EDL	00:36:19,840	00:36:23,424	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And just one or two final questions of what happened to Justice Frankfurter
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:25,728	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	The thing that I find
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:27,264	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Crabs most extraordinary
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:29,056	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Is it less than 2 weeks
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:31,616	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	After decision in Baker versus car came down
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:35,200	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Felix Frankfurter was working at his desk at the Supreme
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:36,224	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Concord and
EDL	00:36:36,736	00:36:38,528	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Frankfurter secretary found him
EDL	00:36:39,040	00:36:40,576	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Sprawled on the floor of his office
EDL	00:36:41,088	00:36:41,856	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	From a stroke
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:43,904	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He suffered a massive stroke
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:46,464	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And the never return to service
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:50,304	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And while he was in the hospital solicitor-general Archer
EDL	00:36:50,304	00:36:50,816	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Ballcock
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:52,352	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Visit a Frankfurter
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:54,400	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And Frankfurter
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:55,680	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	She was in a wheelchair
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:56,448	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Could barely speak
EDL	00:36:56,960	00:36:57,984	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	But he
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:36:59,776	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Apparently conveyed Archibald
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:03,616	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	That the decision maker versus
EDL	00:37:03,616	00:37:04,896	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Skarhead essentially
EDL	00:37:04,896	00:37:05,408	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Caused his
EDL	00:37:10,016	00:37:10,784	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	He felt
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:11,808	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	So passionately
EDL	00:37:12,576	00:37:14,112	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	That the court should stay out of
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:14,624	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	The case
EDL	00:37:15,136	00:37:15,904	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	That Keef
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:16,416	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Physically
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:18,208	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Physically deteriorated
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:20,256	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	After the court had gone the other way
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:41,248	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	After Baker vs. Carr President Kennedy essentially had to Supreme Court vacancies to fill
EDL	00:37:41,248	00:37:44,576	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Now Whitaker seat he filled with a guy who turned out to be a moderate
EDL	00:37:45,088	00:37:47,904	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Frankfurters vacancy that second vacancy
EDL	00:37:47,904	00:37:48,928	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	That vacant
EDL	00:37:48,928	00:37:49,440	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Can see
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:54,560	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	That will lead to the appointment of a man named Arthur Goldberg
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:57,632	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	That is the fifth vote
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:37:59,424	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	That
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:38:01,216	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	The four liberals
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:04,800	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	What are regarded as the four liberals that becomes the fifth vote that they need
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:07,360	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Really to create what has
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:10,432	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Come to be regarded as the Warren Court Revolution
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:20,928	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	This is when the Supreme Court basically became an agent for social change
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:22,720	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	With the 1962 term
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:29,120	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	That's the revolution that is going to change
EDL	00:38:29,120	00:38:35,520	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Are political boundaries prosecutor confession
EDL	00:38:35,520	00:38:41,920	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Criminal justice the way we treat 1st Amendment
EDL	00:38:41,920	00:38:48,320	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Religious and obscenity issues that's the Warren court that people remain
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:49,344	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Remember
EDL	00:38:49,344	00:38:54,464	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And that's the court that came into existence when Felix Frankfurter left
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:39:02,656	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	I'm so just thinking about that question that that woman asked all the way at the beginning of the story
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:05,984	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Could you address what I see is the
EDL	00:39:06,496	00:39:08,544	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Increasing politicization
EDL	00:39:09,056	00:39:11,616	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Of the Court the apotheosis of which I guess was
EDL	00:39:13,152	00:39:14,688	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Yoona voting
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:16,224	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	OLX in Bush
EDL	00:39:16,224	00:39:17,248	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	To be a hour
EDL	00:39:17,760	00:39:19,552	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	President you can
EDL	00:39:19,552	00:39:23,136	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Kind of draw a line from this moment in Baker versus car
EDL	00:39:23,648	00:39:26,208	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	All the way to December 9th 2000
EDL	00:39:27,744	00:39:32,608	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Holes in six new states have just closed and the lead story at this hour is
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:33,376	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	The state
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:34,400	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Florida
EDL	00:39:34,400	00:39:34,912	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Is 2
EDL	00:39:35,424	00:39:35,936	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Close
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:38,752	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	I think Felix Frankfurter would have said
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:39,520	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	See
EDL	00:39:41,312	00:39:43,872	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	That's what I told you that's what would happen
EDL	00:39:43,872	00:39:48,480	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Is that eventually you will you will be deciding a partisan
EDL	00:39:48,480	00:39:49,760	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Which
EDL	00:39:49,760	00:39:51,552	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Presidential candidate
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:54,112	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Essentially received the most votes
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:57,952	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	For those who help themselves on the losing side of bush V Gore
EDL	00:39:58,720	00:39:59,488	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	This was
EDL	00:39:59,488	00:40:00,512	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Justice Frankfurter
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:05,888	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	This was the moment
EDL	00:40:05,888	00:40:06,912	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Bad
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:07,936	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Baker V Carr
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:09,728	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:11,520	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	When I teach this to
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:12,032	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Students
EDL	00:40:13,056	00:40:15,104	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Particularly in the decade
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:15,872	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	After Bush V Gore
EDL	00:40:18,176	00:40:18,944	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Sent sent
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:20,480	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Sentiments about the
EDL	00:40:20,480	00:40:21,504	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	This was still quite Raw
EDL	00:40:22,272	00:40:23,808	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	I would say to them well
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:24,832	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Is this
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:26,112	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Was Frankfurter right
EDL	00:40:26,624	00:40:29,440	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	And I remember a student in the mid
EDL	00:40:29,440	00:40:29,952	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Mm
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:31,232	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Who said
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:33,536	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	In class I never thought I would
EDL	00:40:33,536	00:40:34,304	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Say this
EDL	00:40:34,304	00:40:34,816	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	But
EDL	00:40:35,584	00:40:36,864	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	I hated the outcome of bush
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:37,888	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Precor I was so angry
EDL	00:40:38,912	00:40:39,424	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Proceeded
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:41,216	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	But if
EDL	00:40:41,216	00:40:43,264	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Bush V Gore is the price we have to
EDL	00:40:43,264	00:40:44,288	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	To pay for
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:46,080	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	The courts making the overall
EDL	00:40:47,104	00:40:47,872	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	System
EDL	00:40:47,872	00:40:48,640	| moreperfect061016_episode2 |	Work
