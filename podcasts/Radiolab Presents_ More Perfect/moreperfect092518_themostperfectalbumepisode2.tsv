EDL	00:00:20,992	00:00:27,392	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	And when I first heard about this project I was hanging out with my mom and Seattle and I
EDL	00:00:27,392	00:00:30,976	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Started talking to her about how I would approach
EDL	00:00:31,744	00:00:35,072	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	The idea of writing a song about a constitutional amendment
EDL	00:00:36,608	00:00:39,168	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	We started talking about some different amendments and then
EDL	00:00:39,680	00:00:46,080	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Started focusing on the 4th amendment
EDL	00:00:46,080	00:00:50,432	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	I thought of doing some research and I ended up finding
EDL	00:00:50,432	00:00:53,504	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	A legal term associated with the Fourth Amendment
EDL	00:00:53,504	00:00:56,064	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Poem fruit of the poisonous tree
EDL	00:01:09,120	00:01:12,192	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	I named my son after
EDL	00:01:12,192	00:01:18,592	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	It means that evidence found by being searched illegally is being tainted evidence
EDL	00:01:18,592	00:01:20,384	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Cannot be used against someone in court
EDL	00:01:20,896	00:01:27,296	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	I had a realization that the fourth amendment is basically about having consent in the way
EDL	00:01:27,296	00:01:33,696	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Play retreated by the government and so my song references that by way of romantic consent
EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:39,840	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	At the parallel
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:18,496	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	The first lyrics I wrote for the song where when you take
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:24,640	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Take what you took for me
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:49,984	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	That was Briana marela with her song fruit of the poisonous tree
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:51,264	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Inspired by the Fourth Amendment

EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:40,799	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	And I almost think
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:43,103	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Because
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:48,991	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Although he was about to go to prison for a crime that he didn't commit

EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:40,607	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	And we started off the Epic

EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:22,464	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	I was excited to write a song about the 7th Amendment 7th Amendment
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:24,768	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Jury trial in civil lawsuit
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:30,656	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Because even though it's a part of the Bill of Rights very few people know what it does
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:37,824	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	I can see this time using an analytical frame known as racial capitalism

EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:57,024	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	What are rights

EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:27,744	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Band based in Athens Georgia
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:29,536	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	That included a couple members of

EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:52,576	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Because
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:56,160	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	I thought it's just so obviously already sounded like song lyrics
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:24:01,792	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Excessive bail shall not require words that define disposed

EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:35,840	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Stop the idea of Mercy tucked in there the idea of what is just
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:37,376	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Punishment
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:38,144	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Something there
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:40,448	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	We the people are supposed to be protected from punishment
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:42,752	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	That are cruel and unusual but those words
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:44,800	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	What is cool
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:46,848	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	What is a usual
EDL	00:24:47,360	00:24:49,920	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	What if a punishment is cruel but not unusual
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:52,224	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Are we protected from that
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:57,856	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	These are the kind of questions people ask
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:24:59,136	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	About The Jacka
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:00,672	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Which is what
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:01,952	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Jessica says the band was
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:04,768	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Thinking about when they wrote the song over 17000
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:05,536	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	People have an X
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:06,304	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Cuted
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:07,328	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Bolin death row
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:10,912	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	And 32 states still have the death penalty
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:13,216	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Which is why I am just
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:16,032	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	My mind is boggled with the idea that these inmates
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:17,568	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	The last bit of freedom
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:19,872	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Is the freedom to choose how they're going to die
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:21,664	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	And I
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:25,504	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Can't imagine being the captain of your own soul and being forced to decide
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:29,856	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Tire going to travel into the next world
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:36,000	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	I wanted the song to have
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:42,400	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Eerie haunting creepy
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:48,288	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Stick with you by like a siren song luring you into the field Melody
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:51,616	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	And then building to this redoubt the realization that
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:58,016	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Did this amendment is so important hitting and involves so many people that have two

EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:00,832	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Weight and burden of death
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:06,976	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	I think that's why I was most drawn to the 8th Amendment and why this song
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:12,608	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Kind of a little bit different sound for me and for my band high waisted
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:15,936	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Usually tend to write in the normal pop and this
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:20,800	| moreperfect092518_themostperfectalbumepisode2 |	Song lured me into writing this sort of
