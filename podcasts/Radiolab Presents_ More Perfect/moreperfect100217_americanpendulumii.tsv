EDL	00:01:01,184	00:01:02,720	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	In an attempt
EDL	00:01:03,488	00:01:06,816	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	160 years after the fact in a Hilton hotel Ballroom
EDL	00:01:08,352	00:01:09,376	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	To finally say it right
EDL	00:01:17,312	00:01:20,384	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Can you tell me about the Constitution
EDL	00:01:22,176	00:01:26,528	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	This is a case that split the United States into
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:31,136	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Civil case in question is the Dred Scott case
EDL	00:01:32,416	00:01:38,816	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Which if you ask people I was wondering if you've ever heard of the Dred Scott court case
EDL	00:01:38,816	00:01:45,216	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Scott sounds familiar doesn't go well
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:51,360	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Teacher would be really mad at me right now
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:55,456	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Civil rights thing
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:02:01,600	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Earworm I'm more like the name has some familiarity yes yes
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:09,536	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	What is that mean
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:22,592	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	So what happens a lot of times that people don't actually understand why they're free so Dred Scott
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:28,992	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	That is one of those fundamental decisions that is that lays the groundwork for the reasons why
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:31,552	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	We can live in a Multicultural Society
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:33,600	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	This is Elie mystal
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:36,416	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	More perfect legal editor really understand the case
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:38,976	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	You've got to go to a place called Fort Snelling
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:47,680	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	It's a small army base about 15 minutes north of the Minneapolis Airport
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:54,080	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Go freshly laid on the ground and our producer Julie Longoria took over here
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:03:00,480	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Number to Josie manager program here at the Minnesota Historical Society gave her tour
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:06,880	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	DC right now is the space that we think you know it's probably weird
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:09,952	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Dred and Harriet Scott you know where they live
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:15,584	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Before we go into distress set up when in time are we what's happening the 1830s worth
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:21,216	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	30 years out from the Civil War about half the states in the union have slavery about half dome
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:27,616	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	So it's this question that's kind of still unanswered like should we be a free Nation or should we be a slave Nation
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:33,504	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Real tension here and there is a real understanding here that
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:39,904	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	This might not work and just as we're about to reach this Breaking Point Army doctor named John
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:43,488	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	John Emerson slave owner
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:44,768	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Steps into free territory
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:47,584	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	And arrived here
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:50,400	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Do this
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:52,192	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Army base
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:53,984	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	On a hill
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:56,800	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	And he brings with him his one slave
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:04:02,944	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Dred Scott and now we're actually inside the Fortress if you will and
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:08,832	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	You know all of the stone all the weld windows
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:09,600	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	It's
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:11,136	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	I don't like
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:13,440	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Whenever I come here I have this kind of cold feeling
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:15,488	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Even if it's hot outside
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:22,655	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	He walks up to the back of this one squat building on the far end of the base
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:35,711	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Can you describe the through I think we're probably looking at a
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:37,759	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Epsom and 1/2 foot ceiling
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:42,879	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Wood grain floor wood clapboard floor
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:44,415	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Stone walls
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:47,231	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	The tiny room little bigger than a king bed
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:51,327	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Is a fireplace little tables and Redwood cabinets
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:55,679	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Is the home kitchen is a laundry places
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:57,215	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	You know you're One Stop Shop
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:05,151	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	And the reason this room is so important is because Dred Scott
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:06,943	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Living in this room
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:10,783	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	For the first time in his life he got a taste
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:13,855	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	At what it might be like
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:18,719	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	To be free I mean obviously he was still a slave but
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:23,839	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Dr. Emerson would leave the fort for months at a time and have him work for other people
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:28,959	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Autonomy and Harriet and red met here
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:35,871	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	When he was here he met a girl 36-7 they met here he likes to stay
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:40,223	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Stand here and imagine just how that money went down I can imagine
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:42,527	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	You know Harriet you know haven't been here
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:45,087	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	And and red being over by the store
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:49,183	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	And I'm having a conversation with someone of the other black guy that was here
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:52,511	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	And I imagine him saying
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:54,559	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Here she comes walking by
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:56,607	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Jim who is that
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:00,191	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	I'm going to make her mine
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:03,775	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	I can imagine
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:04,799	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Him saying that
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:08,639	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Over the next few years Dred and Harriet had
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:09,407	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Two kids
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:10,687	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Both of them girls
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:13,759	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	And I personally I think that that what happened was
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:15,551	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Children seeing change everything
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:20,671	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	So what ends up happening is that
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:21,951	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Dr. Emerson
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:24,255	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Moves Dred Scott and his family
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:25,535	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Back to
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:26,559	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Missouri
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:27,583	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	They're back in the slave state
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:30,655	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	And dr. Emerson ends up passing away
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:37,055	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	And it seems like his wife is going to maybe sell Dred Scott's daughters
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:40,895	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	So what Dred and Harriet Scott end up
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:44,735	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Deciding to do the whole reason we know Dred Scott's name
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:46,527	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Is that they
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:48,831	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Decide to sue for their own freedom
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:55,231	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	That's a lawsuit that Dred Scott had every right to believe that he would win
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:58,303	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	A Doctrine called once free always free
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:07:04,703	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	That the minute your foot landed in the snow of the north the minute to you and your owner walked
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:10,335	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Mean to free territory you were free and you could not be returned
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:11,359	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	2 estate of bond
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:13,151	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	This was a well-known
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:19,551	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Legal argument and impact Dred Scott one at a lower court so it goes all the way up to the Supreme Court
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:22,111	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	And the Supreme Court says
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:26,207	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	You're still property
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:31,327	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	And the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Roger Taney
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:32,607	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	The black man
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:37,983	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Has no rights that the white man is bound to respect Tawny
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:41,311	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Amazingly broad decision
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:43,871	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Not only slammed the door on Dred Scott
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:46,431	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	He slams the door
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:47,711	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	On the potential
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:49,759	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	For any African-American
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:51,295	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Free or not free
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:52,575	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	To ever have
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:54,111	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Full citizenship
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:54,879	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	In this country
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:59,743	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	And at that point at I'm at the highest court of the land to make that decision
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:03,839	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	That was putting a. On sort of this overarching
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:09,471	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Battle between the North and the South before slavery and abolition is and so
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:11,775	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	When this happens
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:20,223	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Now you start seeing Civil War popping off
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:26,623	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Now as far as Dred Scott the case
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:28,415	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Is concerned speaking legally
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:35,327	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	The thirteenth and fourteenth amendments to come along and overturn it but like that lie like the black man has no rights
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:40,191	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	That a white man is bound to respect like you can't overturn that line and these days
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:46,591	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	As the pendulum swings and we see a rise in blatant
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:47,103	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Overt
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:54,015	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	White nationalism and violence over statues
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:59,903	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	That line still hovers above at all
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:08,607	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	What's a pose
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:15,519	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	You're a direct descendant of that case of that history supposed to name is Scott who last name is

EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,335	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	What do you do with that
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:26,783	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Tickling now like what do you do with that history do you ignore it is it not your problem or do you have
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:29,343	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Address it if you do how

EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:02,399	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	One of the most striking things I learned from Dred Scott Jr Jr Jr
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:07,263	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	And also from his sister Barbara I'm Barber mcgregory I'm Dred Scott's great-great-granddaughter
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:10,335	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Is that the Dred Scott history was actually something that was kind of
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:11,871	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	From them it was
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:12,895	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Oshkosh weather
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:14,175	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Because

EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:21,599	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	That that was the last straw that sparked the Civil War my dad
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:23,647	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	When they were growing up they had deaths
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:25,695	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	They couldn't tell anybody who they were
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:26,463	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Related to
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:32,863	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Your dad. Generation this was like a hundred years after the decision that generation a secret
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:33,631	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	That's his great-grandfather
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:36,191	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	His grandmother was Dred Scott's daughter
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:39,775	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Dread junior junior told me that
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:40,543	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	His dad
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:45,407	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Was actually partially raised by Dred Scott's daughters
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:46,943	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Whose name was Lucy
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:49,247	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Try to hide the fact in fact who told me she was
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:51,039	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	She might have been kind of mad when
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:52,063	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Maya
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:55,647	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Grandfather grandmother name my father Dred Scott because she was in hiding
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:57,695	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	You got to remember when she was
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:16:00,511	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	6 years old they would have hiding for 5 year
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:02,815	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	During the trial
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:03,327	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Gardner sister
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:06,655	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Is the whole basis a trial was
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:07,935	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	He didn't want his family split up
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:13,055	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	So when you lost the second appeal he sent the girls in the hiding
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:14,847	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Because Steven want them towed away
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:16,383	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	So
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:19,199	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Lizzy stayed pretty much Undercover
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:21,503	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	She lived in off a little
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:24,319	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	The room but she always had that the shades closed
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:31,487	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	So Jordan Barbara told me their parents never talked about Dred Scott I never had a picture up in the house
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:33,535	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Never even knew what he looked like
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:36,607	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	In fact
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:40,447	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	As we were standing there in the lobby of the Hilton
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:42,239	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Dread pulled out his phone
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:44,287	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Photos of Dred Scott
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:47,871	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Pictures of Dred Scott and he brings up
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:54,271	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	The photo on Google
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:17:00,671	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Things like this
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:01,695	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Dark eyes
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:04,767	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	He's wearing a suit
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:08,863	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Like he was impressed I think like you wouldn't expect to
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:15,007	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Slave to be dressed so nice. The first time you seen the picture Dred Scott
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:21,407	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	But it seemed like he was noticing things in it for the first time looks really dignified and stirred in that
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:21,919	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	A picture
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:26,015	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	But he looks looks like a man who's going through it is ready to go to some more
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:54,687	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Okay so at the end of the night I end up at the hotel bar with another sentence

EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:42,367	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Sitting there it was pretty clear that Charlie Tawny was
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:47,743	| moreperfect100217_americanpendulumii |	Kind of like Dred Scott Madison he also had some mixed feelings still having red having red
