EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:06,784	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	But the thought is that maybe he was jealous of whatever was going on in the apartment and he decided he wanted to get the

EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:21,695	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And then you try to make a podcast about the law
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:23,487	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Is it
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:30,143	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	There's often disconnect like laws are these things that float above us all these beautiful abstractions
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:33,471	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And yet if you want to challenge LOL you got to find a person

EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:53,951	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And I wasn't too aware of before catheter
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:57,535	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The Second Story actually touches on a recurrent case

EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:11,935	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The most recent example here in Houston is better described as a vicious

EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:41,119	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The next day it's so happen
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:42,143	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	That
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:44,959	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Because of the location of John Lawrence as a partner
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:47,775	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The case landed in a Justice of the

EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:52,895	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The report was sent to that court for processing
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:54,175	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Now this court is

EDL	00:09:58,271	00:10:00,831	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	But there happens to be this clerk in the court

EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:27,103	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	If you don't have
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:28,639	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	A case
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:32,479	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	People in the Texas legislature have been trying to remove this law from the book
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:38,623	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Books for years according to Dale Carpenter every time someone would introduce a proposal to repeal the law it would
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:41,951	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Snickers and catcalls in the state legislature
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:43,743	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	It just wasn't really going anywhere
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:49,375	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	So activist who decided the only way to get this done is to bypass the legislature and go straight to the Core

EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:04,543	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Can do it the idea that they would be Networks
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:10,943	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Of sanctuaries in places where we could come and out of which we would be able to move and organize and change things across
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:11,455	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The country
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:13,759	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	So I told him a little bit about that history in
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:16,831	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	How far we've come and how far we had to go
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:18,367	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And that
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:19,391	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Bad enough
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:20,415	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	How to change that
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:25,023	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	So I told him
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:25,791	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	I said
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:27,583	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	I'll be able to protect you
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:29,887	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	For maybe the first year or two
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:31,935	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	But there's going to come a time when
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:34,239	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	I will no longer be about you
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:36,799	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	It'll be about some
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:38,079	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Much much bigger
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:39,615	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	So
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:42,175	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	They agreed
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:44,991	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Tyrone's attitude was okay
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:47,551	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	What do you need me to do
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:50,879	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	John was much more indignant
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:53,439	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	They took the wrong person
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:55,231	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Golden song
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:57,535	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	It was a ridiculous law
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:14:59,327	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	But
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:01,887	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Texas loves to keep Samantha
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:02,911	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Quiet things around
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:03,679	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	He was mad
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:05,215	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	He was angry
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:06,751	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Here's where the story gets
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:07,519	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Complicated
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:09,055	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Because
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:11,359	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	At one point according to Lane Lewis
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:16,479	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	They were having this conversation and John was ranting you know about how he been treated and
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:19,551	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	He said you know what the worst part is we won't even
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:22,623	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	He wanted. He said
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:24,671	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	That they were not having sex
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:27,231	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Wait what that they were not having sex that they were
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:29,791	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Sitting in their underwear on the couch
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:31,583	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Watching the late-night news
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:37,471	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	They say they were sitting there doing nothing and the cops just burst in and started pushing them around and
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:39,007	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	That they were never even having sex
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:41,823	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Wave it is in this whole case about them having sex
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:45,407	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Sir sing the thing that this case is supposed to be about
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:46,431	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Might not be true
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:48,479	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Right so I interviewed
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:50,015	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Three of the four police officers
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:53,087	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Joe Carpenter says when he talked to the police officer
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:55,903	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	He did find that their stories were sort of all over the
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:58,463	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The place one guy said it was anal sex seesaw
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:16:01,023	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	One day later said he thought it might have been oral
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:02,815	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The other two officers said they never saw anything
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:05,119	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Fidel says he believes John story
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:07,167	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	There probably was actually no sex
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:13,567	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	You think what might have happened is that the cops walked in and saw some gaytard on the wall and some gay magazines lying around
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:15,103	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Feeling that really set off the office
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:21,503	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And they said well we know they're homosexuals they probably engaged in homosexual conduct at some point and that's illegal in Texas
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:25,855	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	There was no no no doubt about it I mean I have no
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:29,183	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	No reason to live Quinn to this day
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:31,743	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Still insist that he walked in on them
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:38,143	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Copulating he says he saw what he saw and he just did his job
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:41,471	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	That's fine I don't agree with your lifestyle but that's
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:43,519	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	My opinion that's what it is
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:47,103	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	So there's no way to know what actually happened obviously but
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:49,407	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	In a way it doesn't matter
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:53,503	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Because when John said that Tulane that they weren't even having sex
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:55,039	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Message on don't ever say that again
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:59,135	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Don't ever say that to anybody
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:00,927	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Again
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:03,231	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Because we could have people know that
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:05,279	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	We couldn't have people find that out
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:07,839	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Is it going to go forward to this we were scared that
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:10,911	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Another case would get screwed up at that point
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:12,703	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And potentially
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:19,359	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The da dropping the charges
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:20,895	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	You had to preserve the LIE
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:22,175	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Correct correct
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:22,943	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Dumb question
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:26,271	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	You can just do that you can just preserve a lie to keep a case going
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:29,855	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Is that that's okay keep in mind it wasn't our job
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:31,391	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	2
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:33,951	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Prove or disprove the LIE
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:38,815	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The thing that mattered was not what did or didn't happen that night the thing that mattered
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:40,351	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Was what the arrest report
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:42,399	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Set but if what the arrest reports said
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:43,935	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Potentially didn't happen
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:45,471	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Should that matter
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:46,751	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Well
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:48,031	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	No no one
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:51,359	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Our legal system is not designed to bring out the truth this is a misc
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:52,639	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Conception does not bring out the
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:56,479	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Ezio Carpenter against people who play their roles
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:57,247	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And pursuing
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:59,551	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Whatever they think their best interests are
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:01,343	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	That's exactly what happened
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:06,207	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	So
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:09,279	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	For the first few years my job was to keep the boys out of the out of the news
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:11,327	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And why was that
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:12,863	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Well they had a tendency to drink
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:13,887	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And get rowdy
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:14,399	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And fight
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:20,031	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And they like to go to CD hotels and rent rooms and get really really
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:21,567	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Hi drunk whatever
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:23,871	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And inevitably they would start fighting with each other
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:25,407	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And so
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:28,479	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	What I did what I would do without wood
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:30,015	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	I knew the difference
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:35,903	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Places they stay busy would go to the city hotels and talk to the clerk's give him a business card tell him
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:39,231	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	If these boys come and check in they cause problems
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:39,999	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Call me first
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:44,351	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Fan on more than one occasion that happened I'd get a call at 2 in the morning
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:51,007	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Your guys are here they're causing trouble I'm going to have to call the cops how would jump out of bed put on my clothes cuz we couldn't have them
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:53,567	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	You know they're already on the front page of the used
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:56,127	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The chronicle we could not have our defendants
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:58,943	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Doing a perp walk for drugs and alcohol
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:02,271	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	So I would drive down there and I would figure out
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:04,319	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Which one was causing the most problems
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,599	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Put them in my car
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:08,415	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And I would drive them somewhere else I would separate them out
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:10,719	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	That happened more than once
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:12,255	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	More than once
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:14,815	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Celine city of the spear that
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:18,911	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	John and Tyrone wood would start talking to the media and let something slip
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:19,423	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	About
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:21,471	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Their version of the story
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:26,591	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	So get them these little cards small little sentence basically said
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:28,383	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Thank you for contacting me
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:31,199	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Please refer to line Lewis and had my phone number in my ear
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:34,271	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And I said so anytime the media contacts you
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:35,807	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Don't think about what you say
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:38,367	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Right that's what you get screwed up when you start
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:41,695	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Thinking about what you want to say to the media pull this out of your wallet
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:42,207	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Read it
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:45,791	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Even though there were these close calls
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:48,607	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	As a case wound its way through the court system
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:50,399	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Mitchell katine told me about this
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:51,679	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	One time there was this
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:52,703	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Press conference
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:55,519	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And we came outside to the normal media
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:57,311	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Group that was out there wanting
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:20:01,407	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Quotes and talk to us and they didn't want to hear from the lawyers they wanted to hear from the clients
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:02,687	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	He was like all right
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:03,967	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Just this once

EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:36,223	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Nothing wrong

EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:35,168	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Super contacts it wasn't totally clear how this case was going
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:40,544	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Come out because 17 years earlier there's been a case called

EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:45,664	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And then they had ruled that sodomy laws were fine
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:49,248	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And I would suggest to the court that there is no constitutional
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:49,760	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Conclusion
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:52,832	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	But there should be a fundamental right to engage
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:54,624	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Homosexual sodomy
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:57,696	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The Supreme Court almost never will sings order that recent

EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:10,752	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The tension starts building
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:15,360	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And then finally he got
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:16,896	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	To the moment where he said
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:22,272	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And it's not correct today
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:29,696	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And at the point Justice Kennedy said that there were
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:30,976	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	People sobbing
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:46,848	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Rallies Across the Nation gay rights Advocates celebrated their legal Victory a ruling so brought it surprised even many of

EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:53,408	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Should be made you need to go talk to your fellow citizens
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:55,200	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And convince them that this
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:56,480	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	La needs to check
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:59,296	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Coming to us and asking us to bypass
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:02,880	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	What your fellow citizens seem to want that is
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:03,648	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	It's not how
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:06,720	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	What persuaded citizens
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:10,560	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And imposing one's views in absence of democratic
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:12,864	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Is something else
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:14,912	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	He sees this as a
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:17,984	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Small minority imposing their views
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:19,008	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	On everybody

EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:25,408	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Dismantle

EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:31,296	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	That has permitted a distinction to be made

EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:34,880	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And homosexuality
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:37,696	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	But this decision would open the floodgates
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:40,512	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And that it would only be a matter of time
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:42,048	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Before the court was being asked
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:43,840	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	To decide on gay marriage
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:52,032	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And he was right when Kennedy read the marriage decision in 2015

EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:05,856	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Maybe a step forward
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:08,672	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	So what happened to
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:10,464	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Garner and Lawrence

EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:08,640	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	So after this Supreme Court decision did Texas immediately go and repeal the law

EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:28,160	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Now the University of Texas has a policy where the top 10% of every High School class automatically get in but for everybody else
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:32,256	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	They will consider factors like race in the question was

EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:37,376	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Couple days ago the court decided
EDL	00:32:37,376	00:32:38,656	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Barely
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:44,288	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	But yes it is okay the Supreme Court has upheld the affirmative action program at the University of Texas
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:48,128	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Affirmative action and higher education is constitutional
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:54,528	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Now the case was brought by a young white woman named Abigail Fisher

EDL	00:37:34,080	00:37:35,616	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The Neo cons

EDL	00:37:41,760	00:37:45,600	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And this was around the time that the neocon movement was really hitting its stride

EDL	00:37:54,816	00:37:55,328	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Question
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:37:56,864	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The wisdom
EDL	00:37:57,376	00:37:58,400	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Obvious liberal
EDL	00:37:58,400	00:37:59,168	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Policies
EDL	00:37:59,168	00:37:59,936	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And he says
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:00,960	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Slowly slowly
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:03,008	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Overtime very
EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:04,288	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Gradually
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:05,056	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	He became one of those
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:13,248	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Fast forward a little bit he's living in Houston garden-variety existence
EDL	00:38:13,248	00:38:16,832	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And something happens that sends him on this entirely new
EDL	00:38:17,856	00:38:20,160	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Basically he and his wife moved to a new neighborhood
EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:22,976	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	They move from the suburbs into the downtown area
EDL	00:38:22,976	00:38:24,512	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Urban and
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:25,792	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	In 1990
EDL	00:38:27,328	00:38:28,608	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	We went to vote
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:30,656	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	For the first time in our new neighborhood
EDL	00:38:32,192	00:38:33,216	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	I realized
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:36,544	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	That the Republican Party had not fielded
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:37,056	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Candidate
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:40,384	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	To oppose the Democratic incumbent
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:41,664	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Running for congress
EDL	00:38:41,664	00:38:42,944	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	This is a district
EDL	00:38:42,944	00:38:46,016	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	It has almost 600 thousand people
EDL	00:38:47,552	00:38:51,904	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	You don't have a choice you've only got one person running
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:53,440	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Decided to run
EDL	00:38:53,440	00:38:54,976	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Himself a lost item
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:57,536	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	No great surprise to anyone
EDL	00:38:57,536	00:38:58,560	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	He actually lost by 32
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:38:59,840	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	But
EDL	00:38:59,840	00:39:00,864	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Along the way
EDL	00:39:00,864	00:39:02,656	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	What is something really unusual happy
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:09,824	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	During my campaign he and his wife Lark piano they decided they were going to go meet voters and their disc
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:16,224	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	They got a giant print out of all the addresses in the 18th congressional district
EDL	00:39:16,224	00:39:20,064	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Call daywalking list and they just started going door-to-door meeting people
EDL	00:39:20,064	00:39:24,416	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Handing out literature
EDL	00:39:24,416	00:39:25,184	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Take
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:26,976	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The even side of
EDL	00:39:26,976	00:39:27,744	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Oak Street
EDL	00:39:28,256	00:39:32,608	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And my wife would take the odd-numbered side of Oak
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:33,376	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Street
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:35,680	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And we would start to walk
EDL	00:39:35,680	00:39:36,448	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And
EDL	00:39:36,448	00:39:37,216	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Reese's
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:40,032	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Very quickly they realized that
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:41,056	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The district
EDL	00:39:41,056	00:39:41,568	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Shape
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:42,592	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Was funny
EDL	00:39:43,360	00:39:47,456	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Some houses on one side of the street would be in the district in the house is on the other side
EDL	00:39:47,456	00:39:49,248	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Sometimes the district would
EDL	00:39:49,248	00:39:51,808	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	McDonough Highway caption apartment
EDL	00:39:51,808	00:39:53,344	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Text comeback it just
EDL	00:39:53,344	00:39:54,368	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Didn't make sense
EDL	00:39:54,880	00:40:01,280	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	This is like Bloom wife of Edward Bloom peculiar because we had Maps we had to
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:02,048	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Follow
EDL	00:40:02,048	00:40:03,072	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And it was
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:05,632	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Very odd the Wade some streets were
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:07,680	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	In the districts in somewhere
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:11,008	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Took a while for it all to really sinking as to how this
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:13,824	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Could happen I guess about a week of this
EDL	00:40:13,824	00:40:18,944	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	We realized that neighbors had been separate
EDL	00:40:20,224	00:40:24,320	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Almost house by house because of their race
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:30,464	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	He comes to believe that the reason this was done was
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:33,024	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	For the explicit purpose to create a majority after
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:33,536	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	American desk
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:38,144	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	This is an untrue
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:46,336	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Clothes from a clear and simple wrong part of the reason this was done was the Voting Rights Act of 1960
EDL	00:40:47,616	00:40:49,920	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Of Americans are denied
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:55,296	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The right to vote because of their color
EDL	00:40:55,296	00:40:56,832	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Giant
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:40:58,624	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Step forward in civil rights
EDL	00:40:58,624	00:41:04,512	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	One of the primary things that day it is eliminate barriers to voting like poll taxes and literacy tests
EDL	00:41:04,512	00:41:06,816	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Strategies that have been used to keep minorities
EDL	00:41:07,840	00:41:09,376	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And then this other thing it did
EDL	00:41:09,376	00:41:13,984	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Sort of in a roundabout way through a series of interpretations is
EDL	00:41:13,984	00:41:18,080	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	It encouraged the creation of districts where the majority of Voters
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:20,384	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Were minorities and that's because
EDL	00:41:20,384	00:41:22,432	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	You know one of the strategies that have been used
EDL	00:41:22,432	00:41:23,712	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Use previously to
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:29,088	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Dilute the minority was to take minority communities and
EDL	00:41:29,600	00:41:30,880	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	They called it cracking they
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:32,672	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	They said it split them apart and too many
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:34,976	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	So that they were never
EDL	00:41:35,488	00:41:38,304	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	In the majority enough to elect a representative
EDL	00:41:38,304	00:41:40,352	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Voting Rights Act tried to
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:40,864	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	You correct that
EDL	00:41:42,400	00:41:44,192	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	18th congressional district
EDL	00:41:44,192	00:41:46,240	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Was one of these majority-minority just
EDL	00:41:46,752	00:41:47,264	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The district
EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:49,312	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Drawn by the text
EDL	00:41:50,592	00:41:51,872	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	But you have a slight
EDL	00:41:51,872	00:41:53,663	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	African American majority
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:55,199	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	I think about 51%
EDL	00:41:56,479	00:41:58,527	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	But this was the problem according to bloom
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:42:00,063	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The way they got to that
EDL	00:42:00,063	00:42:05,439	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	African American majority was bite creating this District that's zigzagged all over the city and cut through neighborhood
EDL	00:42:05,439	00:42:07,231	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	I could not understand

EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:21,567	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Seemed
EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:22,847	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	So wrong
EDL	00:42:23,359	00:42:24,895	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	In his mind
EDL	00:42:24,895	00:42:27,199	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	This law was actually
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:30,271	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Not limiting discrimination but actually perpetuating
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:38,207	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	I don't know what the average person upon realizing this would have done but
EDL	00:42:38,207	00:42:39,231	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	I decided
EDL	00:42:39,743	00:42:41,279	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	File a lawsuit
EDL	00:42:42,559	00:42:45,375	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Decided to sue the state of Texas
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:47,167	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Called a few friends
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:48,703	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Who lived in the 18th District

EDL	00:42:53,311	00:42:59,711	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Looking and looking and looking until I found a lawyer that I can afford $7,000 a month

EDL	00:43:08,415	00:43:13,535	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	But now it was being used as this excuse to segregate people into racially polarized District
EDL	00:43:14,559	00:43:17,375	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Worked its way through the lower courts and

EDL	00:43:51,167	00:43:52,447	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Y'all we have to put
EDL	00:43:52,447	00:43:53,727	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	People together by race
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:56,287	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The Texas legislature has the obligation

EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:05,247	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Like remember the Voting Rights Act we're trying to make sure that there are enough minorities in this
EDL	00:44:05,247	00:44:06,015	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	District
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:08,831	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	So that they have a chance to elect a representative
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:11,647	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Then our advocate
EDL	00:44:12,159	00:44:14,207	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Made his arguments
EDL	00:44:14,719	00:44:17,023	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	That was just being made
EDL	00:44:17,023	00:44:18,303	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Basically said
EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:19,583	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	But look at the map
EDL	00:44:19,583	00:44:20,863	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The map is
EDL	00:44:20,863	00:44:22,143	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Bizarre
EDL	00:44:22,143	00:44:24,191	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And the only reason
EDL	00:44:24,191	00:44:25,215	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	It could have gotten this way as
EDL	00:44:25,727	00:44:27,007	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Because you're only thinking about race
EDL	00:44:27,519	00:44:28,287	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Only race
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:33,407	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Think about it that seems messed up isn't that messed up it doesn't matter what your ultimate goal is
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:34,687	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	You cannot use
EDL	00:44:34,687	00:44:41,087	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Forbidden tools rate is forbidden by the 14th Amendment to be used as a tool
EDL	00:44:41,087	00:44:47,231	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	A very tense situation
EDL	00:45:01,567	00:45:05,919	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Let me explain
EDL	00:45:05,919	00:45:07,711	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	So in the end
EDL	00:45:08,223	00:45:13,087	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Supreme Court
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:14,879	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Hair-splitting decision
EDL	00:45:15,391	00:45:17,951	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	But I think it's at this deeper question that
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:21,023	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	In our society
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:23,839	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Discourse we just haven't figured out how to talk about anyway
EDL	00:45:24,351	00:45:27,679	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	You don't look if you're defining race
EDL	00:45:27,679	00:45:29,727	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Just the color of someone's skin
EDL	00:45:29,727	00:45:36,127	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The government cannot use that in any way that's against the constitution on the other hand if you take
EDL	00:45:36,127	00:45:42,527	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Take this wider View and you look at race in the context of History social context
EDL	00:45:42,527	00:45:47,391	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	How can the government address discrimination without taking race into account do they have to
EDL	00:45:47,391	00:45:49,183	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	So it's just typical balance
EDL	00:45:49,695	00:45:50,719	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	You can't look at race
EDL	00:45:50,719	00:45:51,487	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	But you have to look
EDL	00:45:51,487	00:45:51,999	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Grace
EDL	00:45:52,511	00:45:53,535	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And
EDL	00:45:53,535	00:45:55,583	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The Supreme Court says to Texas look
EDL	00:45:56,095	00:45:59,423	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	All you're doing in this case is sorting People based on how they're labeled on a saint
EDL	00:46:00,191	00:46:04,799	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	You're not looking at that wider context you're not looking at if these communities with next to each other
EDL	00:46:04,799	00:46:06,079	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Fisher common interest
EDL	00:46:06,079	00:46:07,615	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	You're just sorting them based on
EDL	00:46:08,127	00:46:10,175	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Race alone and that's not good enough
EDL	00:46:10,175	00:46:11,199	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	You can't do that
EDL	00:46:11,199	00:46:11,967	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	When the
EDL	00:46:11,967	00:46:13,759	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Opinion came down
EDL	00:46:13,759	00:46:16,063	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The Supreme Court ruled in our favor
EDL	00:46:16,063	00:46:16,831	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	For 5 to 4
EDL	00:46:17,343	00:46:18,623	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	That was
EDL	00:46:18,623	00:46:19,135	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Quite
EDL	00:46:19,903	00:46:20,671	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	A day

EDL	00:50:28,479	00:50:29,247	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Exceeded why
EDL	00:50:30,015	00:50:31,295	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	In terms of
EDL	00:50:31,807	00:50:33,343	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Electoral opportunities
EDL	00:50:33,855	00:50:35,135	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	We have
EDL	00:50:35,135	00:50:35,647	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Come
EDL	00:50:36,159	00:50:37,951	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	180 degrees
EDL	00:50:38,463	00:50:38,975	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	From
EDL	00:50:39,487	00:50:45,887	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	1960s degrees because of the law which you helped overturn an instant we don't know
EDL	00:50:45,887	00:50:49,727	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	YouTube what degree that is the psychology of America changing or the fact that we had a law that
EDL	00:50:50,495	00:50:51,775	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Cat people online
EDL	00:50:51,775	00:50:53,055	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And now that love has gone
EDL	00:50:53,055	00:50:59,455	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And now we see voter ID laws coming back into play which I think any like sane person would admit is it is it is
EDL	00:50:59,455	00:51:01,759	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Is it is an attempt a blatant attempt to disenfranchise
EDL	00:51:01,759	00:51:06,111	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Just people so it feels a little bit strange that two I mean I completely agree with your things have gotten better
EDL	00:51:06,623	00:51:07,391	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Same time I think
EDL	00:51:07,903	00:51:10,463	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Well that was because of the law that's now gone
EDL	00:51:10,975	00:51:12,511	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Look laws
EDL	00:51:12,511	00:51:14,559	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Change laws
EDL	00:51:14,559	00:51:15,583	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Evolve
EDL	00:51:15,583	00:51:17,631	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	+ and at some point
EDL	00:51:18,399	00:51:19,935	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	They need to come to an end
EDL	00:51:28,639	00:51:29,151	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Okay
EDL	00:51:29,919	00:51:31,199	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	So just to jump back in
EDL	00:51:31,711	00:51:35,039	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Something we haven't actually talked about yet is
EDL	00:51:35,551	00:51:39,135	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Original question how how does this actually happened how does it work
EDL	00:51:39,135	00:51:40,927	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	How is one person
EDL	00:51:42,463	00:51:47,327	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Able to be so effective to do this work if you need a computer a printer
EDL	00:51:47,327	00:51:48,095	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	A cell phone
EDL	00:51:50,399	00:51:51,423	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Really about it
EDL	00:51:52,191	00:51:53,727	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Play who pays for the lawyer fees
EDL	00:51:53,727	00:51:58,335	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Who do you go to individuals that know of my work
EDL	00:51:58,335	00:52:00,127	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	There are foundations
EDL	00:52:00,127	00:52:04,991	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Okay so he's a 501 c 3 like the NAACP and Lambda legal that funded
EDL	00:52:04,991	00:52:05,759	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Lawrenceville
EDL	00:52:05,759	00:52:06,527	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The Texas case
EDL	00:52:06,527	00:52:12,159	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And if you're a 501 c 3 public charity as he has you don't have to reveal your donors to the
EDL	00:52:12,671	00:52:15,999	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	We do know a couple of his donors though and they're
EDL	00:52:15,999	00:52:17,535	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Wealthy very conservative
EDL	00:52:18,303	00:52:20,095	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	So in the end what he does
EDL	00:52:20,095	00:52:20,863	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Is 2
EDL	00:52:20,863	00:52:21,375	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Just sort of a
EDL	00:52:21,887	00:52:22,911	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	More
EDL	00:52:22,911	00:52:27,519	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Maybe a more strategic or sophisticated version of what Lane Lewis did in the first story
EDL	00:52:28,287	00:52:29,055	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Like
EDL	00:52:29,055	00:52:31,103	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	In this case that he just lost last week
EDL	00:52:31,103	00:52:34,175	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	He wanted to challenge affirmative action so
EDL	00:52:34,175	00:52:36,479	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The first thing you did was sort of do a casting
EDL	00:52:36,991	00:52:39,551	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	He said to find the perfect White
EDL	00:52:39,551	00:52:45,951	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Set up a website called UT not fair. Org
EDL	00:52:45,951	00:52:51,327	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Race as a factor in the admissions policy pretty budget it's just him looking at the camera
EDL	00:52:51,327	00:52:54,399	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	In front of a poster that says UT not fair
EDL	00:52:54,399	00:52:57,215	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	All high school students have been rejected from UT

EDL	00:53:03,359	00:53:05,407	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And then he started talking to the people who responded
EDL	00:53:05,407	00:53:06,431	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	I think I ended up
EDL	00:53:06,943	00:53:08,735	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	170
EDL	00:53:08,735	00:53:10,527	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	5 responses
EDL	00:53:10,527	00:53:13,343	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Of those about a hundred were
EDL	00:53:13,855	00:53:14,623	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Viable
EDL	00:53:14,623	00:53:16,415	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	With a 75 you throughout just fly
EDL	00:53:16,927	00:53:21,535	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Oakland teacher didn't think they would be
EDL	00:53:21,535	00:53:22,303	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Sympathetic
EDL	00:53:22,815	00:53:29,215	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Whittled the hundred down to seven that he thought would be sympathetic 7 or 2
EDL	00:53:29,215	00:53:29,983	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Did not
EDL	00:53:30,495	00:53:32,799	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Really want to go forward like I don't want that
EDL	00:53:32,799	00:53:34,079	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Attention they were fearful
EDL	00:53:35,359	00:53:35,871	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The backlash
EDL	00:53:36,383	00:53:37,151	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Anyway
EDL	00:53:37,151	00:53:42,015	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	To make a long story short he ended up finding Abby Fisher because a friend of his called and said
EDL	00:53:42,015	00:53:43,551	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Hey my daughter just got

EDL	00:53:46,623	00:53:47,903	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	I think I'm a very
EDL	00:53:47,903	00:53:51,999	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Like a very like introverted person so I feel
EDL	00:53:52,767	00:53:55,583	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Like sometimes is a lot of pressure
EDL	00:53:56,607	00:54:01,983	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	I think it's in the end it's totally worth it and and to be able to tap a voice
EDL	00:54:01,983	00:54:06,335	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	In this into know that my voice is making a difference is really rewarding
EDL	00:54:06,335	00:54:07,871	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	She seemed like the perfect planet
EDL	00:54:08,383	00:54:09,919	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Strawberry blonde hair
EDL	00:54:09,919	00:54:12,735	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	She's kind of shy in front of the camera in a good way
EDL	00:54:13,247	00:54:14,271	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	But last week
EDL	00:54:15,295	00:54:15,807	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	They lost
EDL	00:54:16,831	00:54:22,975	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Sweet talk to him before all this happened so we weren't able to get a reaction from him but he did tell an Austin news
EDL	00:54:22,975	00:54:23,743	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Paper that
EDL	00:54:24,255	00:54:26,559	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The night after the decision came down

EDL	00:55:51,551	00:55:52,063	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Story
EDL	00:55:52,575	00:55:57,439	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	If we go back to remember this case there's a famous case called Plessy versus Ferguson
EDL	00:55:57,439	00:56:01,279	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Sir no not really a good example
EDL	00:56:03,071	00:56:06,911	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	This is Susan Carr law professor at American University Washington
EDL	00:56:06,911	00:56:07,679	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	10 College of Law
EDL	00:56:08,191	00:56:12,031	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Plessy versus Ferguson 1892 that was a case
EDL	00:56:12,031	00:56:16,383	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Where are the state of Louisiana
EDL	00:56:16,383	00:56:17,151	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	La witch
EDL	00:56:17,151	00:56:18,943	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Said that people of color
EDL	00:56:18,943	00:56:21,759	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And white people could not ride in the same train cars
EDL	00:56:21,759	00:56:24,063	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	If you heard the story
EDL	00:56:24,063	00:56:24,831	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	This is how it goes
EDL	00:56:24,831	00:56:31,231	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Somebody named Homer Plessy black man sits down in a white car he is arrested and decides to sue
EDL	00:56:31,231	00:56:32,511	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Annie's case goes all the way to the surf
EDL	00:56:34,303	00:56:35,327	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The thing about that case
EDL	00:56:35,839	00:56:37,631	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Is that it was a total setup
EDL	00:56:38,655	00:56:39,167	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Flaming
EDL	00:56:39,679	00:56:46,079	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	So we go back when Louisiana passed that law requiring separate cars early civil rights groups were obvious
EDL	00:56:46,079	00:56:47,615	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Horrified by this but
EDL	00:56:48,127	00:56:49,151	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The railroad tie
EDL	00:56:49,151	00:56:50,175	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Companies were actually
EDL	00:56:50,175	00:56:54,271	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Mad about this too because they thought it would be much more expensive to run the trains
EDL	00:56:54,271	00:56:59,135	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	If they had to have add additional training so they have white cars in Cars of color
EDL	00:56:59,135	00:57:01,439	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And so rights activist
EDL	00:57:01,439	00:57:03,487	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Companies
EDL	00:57:03,487	00:57:06,047	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	They recruited somebody named Homer Plessy
EDL	00:57:06,047	00:57:07,071	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Who was
EDL	00:57:07,071	00:57:08,095	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	7/8
EDL	00:57:08,095	00:57:09,631	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	White 1/8 Africa
EDL	00:57:10,399	00:57:13,471	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And they sent him to go sit in a white car
EDL	00:57:13,471	00:57:15,519	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	On a train that he got into a
EDL	00:57:16,287	00:57:17,567	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	First class
EDL	00:57:17,567	00:57:18,335	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	People's car
EDL	00:57:18,847	00:57:22,431	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And they sent somebody to go arrest him
EDL	00:57:22,431	00:57:26,271	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Got a off duty police officers
EDL	00:57:26,783	00:57:30,367	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	You could do that at the time that you can hire a private detective to make
EDL	00:57:30,367	00:57:31,135	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Pinterest
EDL	00:57:31,135	00:57:33,695	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And today they hired that person to
EDL	00:57:33,695	00:57:34,463	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	So
EDL	00:57:34,463	00:57:36,511	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Plus he gets onto the train
EDL	00:57:37,023	00:57:39,839	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The conductor comes by and plessis Lake
EDL	00:57:40,351	00:57:42,911	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Just thought I should let you know I'm actually in a black
EDL	00:57:42,911	00:57:46,495	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And the conductor says well in that case you're going to need to be on the other
EDL	00:57:46,495	00:57:49,055	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Car in the strain the Homer Plessy says
EDL	00:57:49,055	00:57:51,871	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	I'm good actually I I'm going to be staying right here
EDL	00:57:51,871	00:57:57,759	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And the conductor says that you have to move and Homer Plessy you says no really not going to
EDL	00:57:58,783	00:58:02,879	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Things get heated and eventually this detective that they've hired comes in and wrestling
EDL	00:58:05,183	00:58:07,743	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And they brought a lawsuit
EDL	00:58:07,743	00:58:10,303	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	That's amazing the whole thing is cooked starting with
EDL	00:58:10,303	00:58:15,423	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The arrest challenge the separate cars law and they were able to get it up to the US Supreme Court
EDL	00:58:15,423	00:58:16,703	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And they were hoping
EDL	00:58:16,703	00:58:20,031	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	That they would be able to establish that
EDL	00:58:20,031	00:58:22,591	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The idea of separating the races with uncut
EDL	00:58:22,591	00:58:23,359	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Sensational
EDL	00:58:23,359	00:58:25,151	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	But unfortunately they miss
EDL	00:58:25,151	00:58:27,455	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Calculated in the Court ruled that the law
EDL	00:58:27,967	00:58:28,735	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Was Kant
EDL	00:58:29,247	00:58:31,295	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And what they got instead was
EDL	00:58:31,295	00:58:32,319	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Separate but equal
EDL	00:58:32,319	00:58:33,599	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Totally backfired
EDL	00:58:34,367	00:58:34,879	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	But
EDL	00:58:35,903	00:58:39,231	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	It was this early example of this other way
EDL	00:58:39,231	00:58:40,255	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	You know if you can
EDL	00:58:40,767	00:58:43,327	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Find a plaintiff for create a plaintiff
EDL	00:58:43,327	00:58:47,679	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	You might be able to bypass the legislature and go to the Supreme Court instead
EDL	00:58:47,679	00:58:49,983	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	The n-double-acp later picked up on this
EDL	00:58:49,983	00:58:51,263	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Today weather true
EDL	00:58:51,775	00:58:52,799	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Geniuses
EDL	00:58:52,799	00:58:59,199	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	They perfected it and they perfected it under circumstances where victories were highly unlikely
EDL	00:58:59,199	00:59:05,599	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Play example in the early 1900s they do things like send a black guy and a white guy all over New York City
EDL	00:59:05,599	00:59:06,879	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Segregated theaters
EDL	00:59:08,415	00:59:11,999	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And see if one of them was prevented from being seated
EDL	00:59:12,511	00:59:13,535	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And if they were
EDL	00:59:13,535	00:59:15,327	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	They would sue those theaters
EDL	00:59:16,351	00:59:22,751	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And when victories that way then there was this other law in Louisville Kentucky that said nobody
EDL	00:59:22,751	00:59:24,031	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	I could buy a house
EDL	00:59:24,031	00:59:29,919	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Or live on a block in with white people lives if they were African American
EDL	00:59:29,919	00:59:36,319	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	So they recruited a white guy to sell a house to a black guy and then they had the black guy refused to take the house so the white guy could say
EDL	00:59:36,319	00:59:39,647	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	You said you would buy the house but
EDL	00:59:40,671	00:59:46,047	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	I'm not buying the house because I can't live there white guys who's the black guy that was a manufactured case
EDL	00:59:46,559	00:59:48,351	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	It was one of the NAACP
EDL	00:59:48,863	00:59:49,887	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	First victory
EDL	00:59:49,887	00:59:54,751	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And that's the case we're just as Homestead and it said that he ended up not publishing
EDL	00:59:54,751	00:59:56,799	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Hey wait a minute this isn't even a real case
EDL	01:00:00,127	01:00:01,151	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	What's the time
EDL	01:00:01,151	01:00:05,759	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Anything that involves manufacturing a case or fomenting litigation
EDL	01:00:05,759	01:00:07,295	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	All of those things were
EDL	01:00:07,295	01:00:08,063	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Illegal
EDL	01:00:08,063	01:00:10,111	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	It's not just unethical but actually illegal
EDL	01:00:10,111	01:00:10,623	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Yes
EDL	01:00:11,135	01:00:11,903	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Criminally illegal
EDL	01:00:12,415	01:00:14,207	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Sienna's
EDL	01:00:14,207	01:00:20,351	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Something like that we see ambulance-chasing today the lawyers for the n-double-acp were very aware of AC
EDL	01:00:21,119	01:00:22,911	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And this came to a head in the 19th
EDL	01:00:23,679	01:00:25,471	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Britton The Voice EP
EDL	01:00:25,471	01:00:28,287	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Wanted to get the court to end segregated
EDL	01:00:28,799	01:00:30,591	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Basically they wanted to overturn
EDL	01:00:30,591	01:00:31,359	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Plessy versus Ferguson
EDL	01:00:32,127	01:00:34,175	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	And the way they were doing this
EDL	01:00:34,175	01:00:38,015	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	You know they needed the plaintiff so the way they were looking for plaintiffs is going to
EDL	01:00:38,015	01:00:39,807	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Meetings with parents and sort of
EDL	01:00:41,087	01:00:43,391	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Quietly you know subtly trying to ask
EDL	01:00:44,159	01:00:45,439	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	Parents if they wanted to
EDL	01:00:45,439	01:00:46,207	| moreperfect062816_imperfectplantiffs |	To be the face
