EDL	00:00:54,784	00:00:55,808	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Did the United States Consul
EDL	00:00:59,648	00:01:01,184	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	This season we're going to focus
EDL	00:01:01,184	00:01:02,464	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	On those words
EDL	00:01:05,024	00:01:05,792	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Explain why
EDL	00:01:11,936	00:01:14,496	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	First of all the name Moore
EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:15,264	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	The name of this podcast
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:16,544	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Comes of course
EDL	00:01:17,568	00:01:19,872	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	From the preamble to the Constitution
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:21,920	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	In the reason we chose that name
EDL	00:01:24,736	00:01:27,296	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	A couple reasons me first of all it's a weird phrase
EDL	00:01:27,296	00:01:29,344	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Can't really have something be more
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:30,112	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Perfect
EDL	00:01:30,112	00:01:31,648	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Because Perfect Isn't absolute
EDL	00:01:31,648	00:01:32,672	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	But beyond that
EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:37,536	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	The phrase sort of gesture that this idea that America is
EDL	00:01:37,536	00:01:38,560	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Constantly evolving
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:41,376	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	It's never done
EDL	00:01:42,656	00:01:45,728	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	They were always in the process of trying to drag ourselves out of the mud
EDL	00:01:46,240	00:01:48,288	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	And get to those higher ideals
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:49,056	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Make ourselves
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:50,080	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Moorpark

EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:53,664	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Very often we don't make
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:55,968	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Marriott
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:01:58,272	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	We're always
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:01,088	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Trying and that is embodied in our founding
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:03,648	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	I mean we wrote this thing called the Constitution
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:05,440	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	And then we kept changing
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:10,816	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Mending it adding a new rights filling in Holes
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:12,608	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Where we fail so that we don't fail again
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:15,424	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	So far we've done that 27 times
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:20,032	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	The season were going to look at all 27 what do they mean why are they important
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:21,824	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	How do they hold us together
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:23,872	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	In these turbulent
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:26,432	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	* but the thing is when you read these amendments
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:31,296	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	The words themselves can feel very abstract very musty very far away
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:34,112	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	So
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:36,160	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	We decided to make an album
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:43,840	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Actual album
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:56,896	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	In the spirit of Schoolhouse Rock

EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:16,096	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	No idea this was going to work
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:17,120	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	But we put out some calls

EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:11,200	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	To that question
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:14,272	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	In the first part of the sentence you get a well regulated militia
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:17,344	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	What answer which is that the militia
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:18,880	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Has the right
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:19,392	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	To bear arms
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:22,976	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	The case then maybe only the people in the militia
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:24,000	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Have the right to bear arms
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:27,840	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	So okay people in the Army can have a gun but the rest of us
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:29,632	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Don't necessarily have that right
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:31,936	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	If you just look up
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:34,240	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	The first Clause you might come to that conclusion
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:35,776	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	But then later
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:37,312	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	You got the second clause
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:39,360	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	The right of the people to keep and bear arms

EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:51,392	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Are the people

EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:57,792	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Then

EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:28,192	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Professor Tom Bell is kind of a hipster of constitutional law

EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:35,104	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Scared I would pass the first and second figuring other smarter more knowledgeable
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:38,176	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	People to cover those I got to the third though and I realized after

EDL	00:29:57,120	00:29:59,936	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	All of the 3rd Amendment really says is that
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:01,984	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Soldiers are not allowed
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:06,336	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	To barge into your house the way I just didn't your story you're not allowed to do it

EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:14,784	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Right which might sound to a snail like yeah why would we need a rule saying that
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:17,344	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	But people who wrote the third amendment were worried about this
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:18,880	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Because it happened
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:21,184	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	During the Revolutionary War
EDL	00:30:21,184	00:30:27,584	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	British soldiers have basically treated the people like a Boston like Hotel owners accept without paying they barged
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:29,632	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	Listen to their homes they stayed in their homes
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:32,448	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	While they fought the War the people of Boston were not happy
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:34,240	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	And so the founders wrote
EDL	00:30:34,240	00:30:38,848	| moreperfect091818_themostperfectalbumepisode1 |	The 3rd Amendment no Soldier shall in time of peace be quartered in any house
