EDL	00:00:28,928	00:00:30,208	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	About America and guns
EDL	00:00:32,000	00:00:33,536	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	What is it that makes it so unique
EDL	00:00:34,560	00:00:35,328	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	When it comes to guns
EDL	00:00:36,352	00:00:37,120	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Complicated question
EDL	00:00:37,632	00:00:38,656	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Different answers I'm sure
EDL	00:00:38,656	00:00:39,168	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Part of it
EDL	00:00:39,680	00:00:40,192	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The obvious
EDL	00:00:41,472	00:00:43,264	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Is it we have these words baked
EDL	00:00:43,264	00:00:44,288	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Into our founding
EDL	00:00:46,336	00:00:47,616	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Today we're going to tell you
EDL	00:00:48,896	00:00:49,664	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Really surprised
EDL	00:00:49,664	00:00:50,432	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Story of how those work
EDL	00:00:52,224	00:00:53,760	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But how we came to read them the weight
EDL	00:00:53,760	00:00:54,272	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Do we do now

EDL	00:00:58,880	00:01:00,416	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I think we should start with one of the most
EDL	00:01:00,416	00:01:04,000	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Confusing sentences in the constitution in the Bill of Rights not We the People
EDL	00:01:04,512	00:01:05,792	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Not that one I got a different one
EDL	00:01:06,304	00:01:07,840	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	A well regulated militia
EDL	00:01:08,352	00:01:08,864	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	,
EDL	00:01:09,632	00:01:11,936	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Being necessary to the security
EDL	00:01:11,936	00:01:13,216	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Of a free state
EDL	00:01:13,984	00:01:14,496	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	,
EDL	00:01:15,008	00:01:16,288	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The right of the people
EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:18,080	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Keep and bear arms
EDL	00:01:18,080	00:01:18,592	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	,
EDL	00:01:19,872	00:01:20,640	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Shall not being
EDL	00:01:21,664	00:01:24,736	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Say one more time and do it do it with the comments
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:27,808	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Sure a well regulated militia
EDL	00:01:27,808	00:01:31,392	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	, being necessary to the security
EDL	00:01:31,392	00:01:32,672	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Of a free state
EDL	00:01:33,184	00:01:37,536	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Oh, the right of the people to keep and bear arms
EDL	00:01:37,536	00:01:39,840	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Totally unnecessary,
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:41,376	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Shall not be in
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:44,192	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Is that the one that's about guns
EDL	00:01:44,192	00:01:45,728	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Adam Winkler who wrote the book
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:48,800	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	On the 2nd Amendment end of book is called gunfight he's a journal
EDL	00:01:48,800	00:01:51,616	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	He's a professor of law at UCLA
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:58,016	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	He said it's almost as a James Madison the author of the amendment I just discovered this wonderful new thing the, and why
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:01:59,552	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Wanted to put it in there as many times
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:01,856	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Which is like
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:04,160	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Nrt professorial joke
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:06,208	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But like seriously what is it in like
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:12,608	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	It has to be this one couldn't have been the amendment about like quartering soldiers in your house that was really confusing
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:13,376	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	They made like Jess
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:15,168	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Indecipherable
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:15,936	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And ever since
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:18,240	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Generations of Americans have been confused
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:19,520	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	By the language of the Second Amendment
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:23,104	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	So when the singers written we had just fought this war with the British
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:25,152	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	This Revolutionary War
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:27,456	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And they try to win it right from the get-go
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:29,248	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Coming for our guns
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:32,832	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	So these new states are looking at this new federal government they're going
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:34,624	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	We don't know we want to trust you quite yet
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:36,160	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	So does the Second Amendment says
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:37,696	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	You guys can fight back
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:40,256	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Like the feds aren't going to disarm you you can your malicious can keep you
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:41,536	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Stats
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:42,304	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I think we agree on
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:45,632	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But then after that you just look at the sentence
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:47,936	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	That is not just a commas that are confusing
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:49,728	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	If you look at the sentence as a whole
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:51,520	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Pieces don't seem to
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:52,288	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Get together
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,056	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	There's some noun
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:54,592	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I mean
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:58,432	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	It's obvious that the sentence is about someone's right to bear arms but who
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:02:59,968	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Who get that right
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:02,016	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	At the beginning of the sentence
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:04,064	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	You got a well regulated
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:04,832	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Militia
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:05,344	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Demolition
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:07,392	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	States have a right to form militias
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:08,416	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	What's to assemble
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:10,976	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Groups of people and those people got to have their guns
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:12,000	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	That's easy enough
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:13,280	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But then later in the sentence
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:15,584	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	There's, the right of the people to
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:16,608	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	To keep and bear arms
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:18,656	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	, shall not be infringed
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:19,424	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The people
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:21,728	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Which people
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,520	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Those people over there in the militia
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:24,800	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	All people
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,336	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	If you mean all people
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:28,128	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Why'd you say militia
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:28,896	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	It's like
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:30,176	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The first quasi
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:32,480	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The point of some sort of collective right to bear arms
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:34,528	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And the second clause
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:39,904	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Seems to point to some individual right to bear arms supposed to be a popularly ratified document
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:42,464	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	It's actually not that easy to read
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:46,048	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And it's not it wasn't that easy to read then
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:48,864	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	This is Jill Lepore staff writer at the New Yorker magazine
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:51,168	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	She's also a professor of American history
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:52,448	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I studied 18th century
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:57,568	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I'm really trying to the 17th and 18th century American political story
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,616	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And Jill says
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:03,968	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	From the beginning when people thought about the Second Amendment they tended to just focus
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:07,552	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	On the first part that the primary motivation for the amendment is
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:10,112	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	About militia well-regulated
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:10,880	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Militia
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:12,672	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But this confusing sentence was
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:14,208	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Widely read as the
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:15,232	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	This Collective
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:21,631	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Militia right not an individual one truth that the Second Amendment fact guarantees the right of a
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:25,215	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	An individual to bear arms and that the government federal government
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:26,239	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	In any fashion
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:28,287	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Juices that just didn't exist
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:34,431	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I disagree with the way you characterize that
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:40,575	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Although what you said is stated in the media frequently the Stephen halbrook he's represented the NRA in several
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:43,903	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Okay so I've written several books on Second Amendment issues
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:44,927	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	He actually thinks
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:46,719	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Hey the sentence is just
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:49,791	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Fine as is I don't think it's complicated at all
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:55,935	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The framers were thinking about an individual right to bear arms 2nd Amendment refers to the right of the people to
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:05:00,543	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	First Amendment refers to the right of the people peaceably to assemble
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:06,175	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I mean who is that it it's individuals are not some kind of collective that doesn't exist in reality
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,711	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	So which
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:08,479	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Which was it
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:10,783	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	That that's a really good question to add I mean
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:14,111	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	If it's complicated 1/2 what I can tell you is that
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:16,159	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	No people I spoke to for the story said
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:17,183	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	At least in the
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:19,231	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	20th century when the when the second amendment was
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:20,511	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Taught in law schools
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:21,279	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	It was taught this
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:22,815	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	It was taught as a sort of
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:23,583	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Antiquated
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:25,119	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Outdated
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:27,935	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Thing that has to do with malicious not so much
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:28,959	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Individual rights
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:29,983	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:33,823	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Tulip or Stephen halbrook and their respective side something they can both agree on
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,359	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Is that this
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:39,199	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Super sacred Second Amendment the third rail
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:41,247	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Of our American politics today
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:42,527	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	That just was not
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:43,295	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I think
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:47,647	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	It was not like that it was utterly ignored ignored
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:50,207	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	This amendment When I Was An undergraduate
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:52,511	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Undergrad at Florida State University
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:58,399	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	When did the Florida Supreme Court and start looking up law review articles on constitutional law issues and I found that
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:01,983	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	There was hardly anything written about the Second Amendment
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:06,335	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Except for the third amendment the zoo there was no amendment that was less written about less
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:07,871	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Legislated less
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:08,639	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Activated
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:12,479	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Lessa subject of Supreme Court conversation
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:16,575	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And the Second Amendment this is not to say people didn't think about guns
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:21,439	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	People had guns States regulated guns but for most of our history the Second Amendment
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:22,463	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	It was like
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:28,863	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Heavenly sword of the runt of the Bill of Rights literally like no one argued about it it's a striking thing to think about
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:31,423	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	There was no fight no fight how surprising that is
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:32,959	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Is giving its centrality to our
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:33,471	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Political compass
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:35,519	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	What is
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:36,799	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Extraordinary transfer
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:39,103	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Because there was this
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:40,639	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Window of time where
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:41,663	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	All of this
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:43,711	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Changes that the script
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:44,223	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Just flip
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:46,015	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	There's two hundred years
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:47,807	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Of everything being chill
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:49,599	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And then suddenly
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:50,623	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	You got
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:51,903	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	This
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:53,439	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I want say those fighting words
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:55,743	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	From my cold
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:06,751	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	So basically in
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:09,823	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The Flash the Second Amendment goes from being
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:13,919	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Ignored to being you
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:20,319	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Supposed to be Radioactive
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:26,719	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And in the process we start to read the thing totally differently all of a sudden this is hot
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:30,815	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Leave the beta thing that's got nothing to do with that first part and everything
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:31,583	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	To do
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:33,631	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	What II
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:38,751	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Nothing you can do folks
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:39,519	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And me
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:44,127	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	What are the Second Amendment people maybe there is I don't know
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:46,431	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And what I want to know is how did that happen
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:51,551	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	How do we start reading the Second Amendment the way we do now
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:55,135	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And and what I found out is that
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:58,207	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	In the modern history of the gun rights movement
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:08:00,511	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And how we read the second amendment can be boiled down to these
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:02,047	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	3
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:02,815	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Totally

EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:17,471	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	So this transition from the militia to the individual my right to bear arms
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:19,263	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	You could argue that
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:22,591	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	That whole individual gun rights movement started
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:23,871	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	In the 1960
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:25,663	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Cities with the Black Panthers

EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:31,551	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	It's an unlikely and got a surprise in origin for what's known as individual rights interpretation of the

EDL	00:10:54,079	00:11:00,479	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And in particular major tension between
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:06,879	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Black community and the police
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:13,023	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The late 60s there were several high-profile incidents of Officer shooting unarmed black man

EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:19,679	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	What we did is that yet we took a position
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,519	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	October 1966

EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:40,415	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And

EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:45,279	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Think about Malcolm X
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:47,071	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Thinking about what you can do in Oakland
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:48,095	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And it hits
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:51,423	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The Second Amendment of the Constitution guarantees
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:55,007	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The citizen's right to bear arms on public property
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:57,311	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But they can argue
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:59,615	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	That the Second Amendment gave them a right
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:00,383	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Have a gun
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:06,783	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	He said pass a constitutional Democratic civil human right
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:07,551	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	In those who
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:10,367	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Claim that the second amendment protects an individual right
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:13,951	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Right to bear arms says people who argued that were in the minority
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:15,743	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	They want taken too seriously
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:19,583	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Play this is one of the first times that the individual rights reading was forced
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:21,631	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Into the mainstream because
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:28,799	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	We have a right to bear arms we individuals then
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:31,871	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	We control the police observe the police
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:34,943	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Tell him that we I see you talk about controlling police
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:39,551	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	What do eagles do you in law school so what legal status do we have
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:44,159	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Second half of the Second Amendment right of the people to bear arms
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:49,023	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Possessing bear arms okay he also pointed to a California state law
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:52,351	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	It said you could carry a gun as long as it wasn't concealed
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:54,911	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	If the gun is not concealed is not illegal
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:58,495	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	So the Black Panthers started policing the police
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:12:59,263	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	We did
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:06,943	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	It would go out an armed patrols and follow police cars on 7th Street

EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:21,727	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Particularly after Huey Newton shooting happened at 5 a.m.
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:28,127	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Later that same year was arrested for shooting and killing a cop marks the spot

EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:33,247	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:38,111	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	What seems clear is that the Black Panthers decision to use the Second Amendment
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:39,391	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	On themselves
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:40,671	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	To show up armed
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:43,487	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	At the state capitol in California inspired
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:44,511	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Vigorous backlash
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:52,959	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	FBI director J Edgar Hoover today asserted that the Black Panthers represent the greatest internal threat to the nation

EDL	00:19:57,311	00:20:01,919	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	This led to a whole new wave of gun control laws in California but also

EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:04,735	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Seemed
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:10,879	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	To be targeted towards African-Americans rather than just reducing gun violence
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:13,439	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	We've got to get guns off the street
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:15,487	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But the irony was

EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:24,447	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Many white rural conservatives

EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:32,383	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But government was going to take their guns next

EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:20,768	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	They create some gun control
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:24,096	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Then there's even more gun control even federal gun control
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:26,912	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And a lot of people are sitting home watching this
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:28,448	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And they start to get very
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:28,960	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Upset
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:31,264	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Which brings is to chapter 2
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:32,288	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The revolt
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:38,176	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	You know we can't allow this to happen
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:41,248	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I can buy the damn pistol that I wanted
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:45,600	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	These two guys John aquilino live in Rockport Texas

EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:51,744	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And they've both been in the guns pretty much their entire life
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:53,792	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	My father was

EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:08,640	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Little things that moved in the shooting gallery but neither one of them
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:12,480	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Totally hardcore about their gum police until around the time
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:13,248	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The Black Panthers
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:18,368	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The fact that here bunch of people who were
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:20,416	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Slightly darker
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:22,464	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Complected then New England
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:26,048	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Ivy league grads running around with firearms
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:28,096	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Did that scare people
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:29,120	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Hell yes
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:32,192	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Did it scare you didn't scare me I didn't
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:38,592	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	John told me Joe is well that it wasn't the Panthers themselves that was a problem I don't like anybody to tell
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:42,432	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Tells me I can't do something it's all the gun control laws that came
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:42,944	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	In the wake
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:45,504	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	When the gun control Act
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:46,016	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	First pass
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:50,112	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Today we begin to disarm the criminal
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:51,648	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Caroline
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:53,184	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And then say
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:55,488	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	A lot of things just appeared that I had been used
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:59,072	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Joe said he starts the gun shops in his neighborhood close
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:02,656	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Like the furniture store in Buffalo that used to have shotguns
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:04,448	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	$5 think they stop selling them
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:07,008	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And he says that is really bothered him because
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:10,848	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The reason you have a gun is for protection
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:12,896	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	It's like another form of insurance
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:17,248	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Which wasn't an abstract idea for him buffalo in the 60s and 70s
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:19,808	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Not the safest place in the world
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:20,576	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	His house
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:21,600	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Was even broken into
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:23,136	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I could only
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:23,904	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Describe
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:24,672	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Home invasion
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:26,464	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	These guys actually
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:27,232	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Better
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:27,744	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Their way
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:29,280	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	2 Doors
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:33,376	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Joseph seen his wife and his dog huddled in one room with a gun
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:35,680	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Wally's two guys storm through his house
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:36,704	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Andrada
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:38,752	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I didn't take care of my wife
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:39,264	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Purse
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:40,800	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Some other money
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:42,592	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And they are
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:45,152	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I mean by the time the police got there
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:46,176	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Devon
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:53,088	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Joe's whole relationship with Firearms is there a predicated upon that this idea that is for self-defense and
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:54,112	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Hear he's got
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:55,648	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	People breaking into his house
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:56,928	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	He's got
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:24:02,304	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The cops not being there for him he's got the government trying to take his gun away so what do you do
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:04,096	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	You join
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:05,120	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The end
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:06,400	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Ra
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:08,192	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Fight this gun control
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:10,240	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:13,056	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	This came at a moment where the NRA was at this
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:15,360	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Crossroads unlike
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:16,896	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Any edit seen before
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:17,920	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Orson
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:24,320	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Back when Joe joined in the early 70s the NRA
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:27,392	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Was not the die-hard supporter of gun rights
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:28,672	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Let me know today
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:30,464	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Because according to Adam Winkler
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:34,304	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	It was never meant to be the idea behind the NRA
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:35,072	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Continue
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:36,096	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Fundamental right down to
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:42,240	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Today was to increase Civilian Marksmanship training so that the next time there's a war Americans would be
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:43,264	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Capable of fighting
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:45,824	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	You know you don't hear much about the NRA's founders
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:52,480	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But the NRA was formed in the 1870s right after the Civil War by a reporter for the New York Times
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:59,648	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Who thought that the Union Soldiers had been so ineffective in the Civil War because they were not familiar with
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:00,416	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	With firearms
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:01,696	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Really yeah
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:03,744	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But a hundred years their main focus was
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:06,560	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Like teaching Boy Scouts how to shoot straight not
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:07,584	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Second Amendment
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:11,680	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And apparently if you go back through issues of American Rifleman
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:12,960	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	In the forties
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:13,728	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	50s
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:16,288	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The Vietnamese version of Playboy guns inside a girl
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:17,312	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	You'll be amazed
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:20,384	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	That you can't find a single mention of the Second Amendment
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:21,664	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Anywhere in those magazine
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:24,480	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The NRA at that point was
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:26,784	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Sort of like a gun trade group they work
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:28,576	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Not super political and
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:31,136	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And the people who ran it they were Hunters
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:31,904	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Joan Hunter
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:36,000	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	They were just like these wealthy businessmen who like to hunt
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:38,304	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	According to John Rich guys who
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:39,840	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	They were hobbyist
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:41,632	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But you had all these people coming in
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:46,496	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Like Joe and like John who were convinced that guns weren't about
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:48,800	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Shooting ducks they were about self-defense
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:51,104	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Protecting yourself against criminals
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:55,712	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	In a time of starkly Rising crime rates this would lead to this straight up
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:56,736	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Head on collision
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:58,016	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	At the NRA
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:00,576	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Now
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:02,880	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Joe and John join the NRA
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:05,696	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The organization had just for the first time
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:07,488	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Sort of set-up this lobbying
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:11,328	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Yeah it was the brand new Institute for legislative action
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:15,168	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	John actually got hired to work there in 1976
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:18,240	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And this true for legislative action
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:20,032	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Supposed to fight for gun rights
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:22,080	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Capitol Hill that's what they both wanted it
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:22,592	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Today
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:24,128	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Let's put it this way
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:25,664	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	We were the

EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:27,872	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	That if you'll pardon the expression

EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:44,256	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The NRA took a very hard line on gun control
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:50,656	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And became an irrepressible political force in America
EDL	00:35:50,656	00:35:51,936	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Scare congressman
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:56,544	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Lies in its ability to mobilize its members in any congressional district
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:35:58,848	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	At the touch of a computer button
EDL	00:35:58,848	00:36:02,688	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	They start pouring millions of dollars into lobbying and just
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:04,736	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	A few years after that Cincinnati revolt
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:07,040	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The NRA endorses its first

EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:10,880	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The Constitution does not say
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:12,928	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The government shall decree
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:15,232	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The right to keep and bear arms

EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:29,056	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	At this point everyone and their Uncle leaves out the militia part of the Second Amendment
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:31,104	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Which is why Americans eventually starts
EDL	00:36:31,104	00:36:31,872	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Don't forget that
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:34,944	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The militia clause or whatever you want to call it even exist
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:37,504	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I wish I could save that instead of the last
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:42,368	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Winter things that most surprised me when I was doing some research
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:43,648	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	This is Jill Lepore
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:46,976	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	By the 1990s the new interpretation of the Second Amendment
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:48,256	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Had so penetrated
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:50,048	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Popular opinion
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:53,888	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	That people were more familiar with the Second Amendment then with the first
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:54,656	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	1991
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:56,960	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The First Amendment
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:36:59,776	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	That Eclipse really
EDL	00:36:59,776	00:37:00,288	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Kind of shocks
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:06,688	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But even if you did the Panthers and the president in the American people are all down to sort of forget about this militia
EDL	00:37:07,200	00:37:08,992	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Clause of the 2nd Amendment
EDL	00:37:08,992	00:37:10,528	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	It didn't mean a lot without the
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:11,040	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The courts
EDL	00:37:11,552	00:37:12,064	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And of course

EDL	00:37:21,792	00:37:25,376	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I think you saw me giving a television interview and he says that this new interpretation is it
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:26,656	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Second amendment was
EDL	00:37:26,656	00:37:28,192	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The greatest pieces of
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:32,032	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	One of the greatest pieces of fraud I repeat the word fraud
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:34,336	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	On the American public
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:36,128	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Do I have ever seen in my lifetime

EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:48,160	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Yeah so the Supreme Court obviously not dying to have this conversation at the moment
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:51,488	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But it's not just the Supreme Court if you look at the federal courts the entire
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:52,256	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Federal court
EDL	00:37:52,256	00:37:53,536	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	System in America

EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:13,728	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Here's what's going on in America
EDL	00:41:13,728	00:41:15,776	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Amendment have become
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:17,824	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	One of those issues that can get you elected
EDL	00:41:18,336	00:41:22,176	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Academics have begun to have a vigorous debate about its meaning
EDL	00:41:22,688	00:41:25,248	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But the Supreme Court is still staying out of it
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:26,784	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	They're leaving this up to the states
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:29,856	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Which already have all sorts of gun laws of their own to deal with
EDL	00:41:30,368	00:41:31,904	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But then December 12
EDL	00:41:32,416	00:41:33,184	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Mm
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:36,256	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Republican George W Bush become president elect
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:39,840	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	After divided US Supreme Court has effectively halted

EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:49,312	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And he likes that
EDL	00:41:50,080	00:41:51,616	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Protecting the Second Amendment
EDL	00:41:51,616	00:41:52,640	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	To the United States
EDL	00:41:52,640	00:41:53,151	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Constitution
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:42:00,063	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And in 2001 the Bush Administration declared that the Second Amendment protected an individual right to own

EDL	00:42:03,135	00:42:06,207	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Right that was not limited as most courts have held
EDL	00:42:06,207	00:42:07,487	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The service in the militia
EDL	00:42:07,487	00:42:12,351	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	It almost right after he gets into office Bush's Attorney General John Ashcroft
EDL	00:42:12,351	00:42:16,959	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Put out a letter this public letter to the NRA announcing that the Department of Justice
EDL	00:42:17,727	00:42:20,799	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Adopted a new interpretation of the Second Amendment
EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:24,895	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And then right around the same time as the Bush Administration memo came out
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:27,199	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Court in
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:27,967	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Texas
EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:28,991	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Rule.
EDL	00:42:28,991	00:42:31,295	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The Second Amendment did protect an individual right
EDL	00:42:31,295	00:42:32,063	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Bear arms
EDL	00:42:32,063	00:42:32,831	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And that was a
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:36,159	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The big deal before this all the decisions and kind of
EDL	00:42:36,671	00:42:42,303	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Beard in the other direction and because of that Court ruling and John Ashcroft letter
EDL	00:42:42,303	00:42:44,607	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	List three libertarian lawyers
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:46,399	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Alan gura
EDL	00:42:46,399	00:42:50,751	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Constitutional attorney Bob Levy a chair the board at the Cato Institute
EDL	00:42:50,751	00:42:56,895	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Clark neily thought the timing was right we thought it was a good time for some litigation
EDL	00:42:56,895	00:43:00,223	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And one thing you need to know about these guys is that they weren't necessarily doing it
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:04,575	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The guns they had no association with the NRA or the gun rights movement
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:05,599	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Then it was
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:10,975	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	More about getting the government to back off in our country when the government wants to restrict our Liberty
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:16,607	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	It isn't coming on the government to make the case for it as income in the government to say here's why you shouldn't be permitted
EDL	00:43:16,607	00:43:18,911	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	To exercise that right so that was their rank
EDL	00:43:18,911	00:43:21,727	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I've always wondered why the gun rights movement has
EDL	00:43:21,727	00:43:24,287	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Becomes a proxy war for like anti-government
EDL	00:43:24,799	00:43:27,615	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Is Mmm Yeah well I mean if you think about it
EDL	00:43:27,615	00:43:29,151	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The something professor
EDL	00:43:29,151	00:43:30,943	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Sandy Levinson told me
EDL	00:43:30,943	00:43:31,711	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Is that
EDL	00:43:31,711	00:43:33,759	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Embedded in this amendment
EDL	00:43:34,271	00:43:38,367	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Is the very idea that you can take up arms
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:39,903	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Against the government
EDL	00:43:39,903	00:43:41,439	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	To protect yourself
EDL	00:43:41,439	00:43:44,255	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And your fellow man from tyranny on the far right
EDL	00:43:45,023	00:43:47,071	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Or occasionally on the far left
EDL	00:43:47,583	00:43:49,887	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	You find people who are willing
EDL	00:43:49,887	00:43:50,655	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	2
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:52,447	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Say this that this is really what
EDL	00:43:52,447	00:43:52,959	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Terrific
EDL	00:43:53,471	00:43:54,239	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The Second Amendment
EDL	00:43:54,751	00:43:58,079	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But mainstream conservatives in mainstream liberals
EDL	00:43:58,591	00:43:59,615	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Arnott
EDL	00:43:59,615	00:44:03,199	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Very happy with those arguments they are embarrassed by them
EDL	00:44:03,711	00:44:06,527	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And so mainstream conservatives
EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:07,551	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Want to talk
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:09,343	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	About self defense against
EDL	00:44:09,855	00:44:10,623	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Burglars
EDL	00:44:11,135	00:44:13,183	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And mainstream liberals
EDL	00:44:13,695	00:44:14,719	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Want to talk
EDL	00:44:14,719	00:44:15,487	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	About
EDL	00:44:15,999	00:44:16,767	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	How
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:20,351	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The second amendment protects State organized militias
EDL	00:44:20,863	00:44:22,911	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And almost nothing else
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:28,287	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Hey we're getting back to the story these three libertarian lawyers they decide
EDL	00:44:28,287	00:44:29,311	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Put together case
EDL	00:44:29,311	00:44:31,103	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And their idea was to Target this
EDL	00:44:31,103	00:44:32,895	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Really restrictive gun law
EDL	00:44:32,895	00:44:33,663	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	NDC
EDL	00:44:33,663	00:44:40,063	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	All handguns were banned you could own a shotgun or rifle but the law specifically made it illegal to ever put a round in the chamber
EDL	00:44:40,063	00:44:41,855	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Even in self-defense or there was
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:44,415	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	There's really funky we described it as a
EDL	00:44:44,415	00:44:46,207	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Ban on all functional firearms
EDL	00:44:46,207	00:44:49,791	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But in order to challenge that law they needed to find a plaintiff
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:50,815	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Interesting how do you
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:51,583	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Find a plane
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:53,631	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	You look for somebody who
EDL	00:44:53,631	00:44:55,167	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Got robbed what do you do
EDL	00:44:55,167	00:44:57,215	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Well we can actually instigate
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:44:59,263	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Litigation and we can take out a
EDL	00:44:59,263	00:45:05,407	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Full page ad in the New York Times saying you want to vindicate your second amendment rights give us a ring Bridge of central got the word out talk to
EDL	00:45:06,431	00:45:07,967	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I would say between
EDL	00:45:07,967	00:45:09,247	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	2 and 3 dozen
EDL	00:45:09,247	00:45:13,855	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	People they all had really interesting stories they found a guy who was
EDL	00:45:13,855	00:45:20,255	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Gay gentleman named Tom Palmer previously been assaulted when he lived in California because he
EDL	00:45:20,255	00:45:23,327	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	He was gay was almost murdered by a skinhead mahbuba phobic
EDL	00:45:23,327	00:45:24,863	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Subs and he wanted to go
EDL	00:45:24,863	00:45:29,727	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	To protect himself. Our lead plaintiff was an African American women named Shelly Parker
EDL	00:45:29,727	00:45:31,775	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	She was trying to protect yourself against
EDL	00:45:31,775	00:45:35,615	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Local drug dealers and the cops actually told her she should get a gun
EDL	00:45:35,615	00:45:36,639	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Which was a legal
EDL	00:45:37,407	00:45:42,015	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Weird so they have this whole group so we ended up with three men and three women the 20s
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:45,599	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	2D early 60s formal way to America America
EDL	00:45:45,599	00:45:47,647	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And the problem they ran into
EDL	00:45:47,647	00:45:50,719	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Was that all these super sympathetic plaintiff
EDL	00:45:50,719	00:45:52,511	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Didn't have the Sperrys
EDL	00:45:52,511	00:45:53,791	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Special thing they needed
EDL	00:45:53,791	00:45:54,815	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	To bring a case
EDL	00:45:54,815	00:45:55,583	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Standing
EDL	00:45:55,583	00:46:01,983	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Standing with your sister legal term meaning they didn't have a sufficient grievance to be in court like if you can bring a case you have to show that you
EDL	00:46:01,983	00:46:03,263	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Cuban actually harmed
EDL	00:46:03,263	00:46:04,287	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Bye
EDL	00:46:04,287	00:46:08,127	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Not being able to get a gun you have to show some physical concrete proof
EDL	00:46:08,639	00:46:09,663	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The harm has been done
EDL	00:46:09,663	00:46:10,687	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But you've been
EDL	00:46:10,687	00:46:11,455	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Denied a gun
EDL	00:46:11,967	00:46:13,247	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And none of the plaintiffs had the
EDL	00:46:18,111	00:46:20,159	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Except for one.
EDL	00:46:20,671	00:46:21,183	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Dick

EDL	00:48:06,655	00:48:11,263	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The more power government has the less Freedom you have the closer you get the ball and chain

EDL	00:48:32,767	00:48:34,815	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Like John and Joe
EDL	00:48:34,815	00:48:36,095	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Began pretty casually
EDL	00:48:36,607	00:48:37,887	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Flight 1976
EDL	00:48:37,887	00:48:39,679	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Is living in DC
EDL	00:48:39,679	00:48:42,239	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And one day he's sitting at home
EDL	00:48:42,239	00:48:43,519	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I was watching
EDL	00:48:43,519	00:48:46,079	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	My hero Matt Dillon
EDL	00:48:46,079	00:48:47,103	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Gunsmoke
EDL	00:48:48,895	00:48:50,687	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Different Matt Dillon
EDL	00:48:51,455	00:48:55,039	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And he had this long-barreled handgun
EDL	00:48:56,831	00:48:58,623	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I was about 30 years old
EDL	00:48:59,135	00:49:00,415	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And I figured ghali
EDL	00:49:00,415	00:49:03,743	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I should own my first gun so when I went and bought
EDL	00:49:03,743	00:49:06,303	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	My what I call my Matt Dillon special
EDL	00:49:06,303	00:49:09,887	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Hi standard 22 revolver Matt Dillon Buntline
EDL	00:49:10,655	00:49:11,423	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And it was just
EDL	00:49:11,935	00:49:13,215	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I live in America
EDL	00:49:13,215	00:49:14,751	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	We're Cowboys Society
EDL	00:49:14,751	00:49:16,543	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I should have a cowboy gun and weave
EDL	00:49:18,079	00:49:20,383	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Nothing no really deep thought to it
EDL	00:49:20,383	00:49:23,967	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But then just a few months after he got that gun in Ark
EDL	00:49:23,967	00:49:26,015	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	October 1976
EDL	00:49:26,015	00:49:28,063	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	A trend that started with the Mulford Act
EDL	00:49:28,063	00:49:30,367	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And the Black Panthers back in Sacramento
EDL	00:49:30,367	00:49:34,975	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Hits Washington DC DC gun control regulations outlawed
EDL	00:49:34,975	00:49:40,863	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Firearms ownership get that gun law which outlawed all hang out so I had some choices
EDL	00:49:40,863	00:49:41,631	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I could
EDL	00:49:41,631	00:49:43,167	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Turn it into the government
EDL	00:49:43,167	00:49:44,447	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Not going to happen
EDL	00:49:44,447	00:49:46,751	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I can throw it in the Dipsy dumpster
EDL	00:49:46,751	00:49:47,775	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Not going to happen
EDL	00:49:48,543	00:49:49,567	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Or
EDL	00:49:49,567	00:49:51,615	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	There was another option I could go to jail
EDL	00:49:52,383	00:49:55,455	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Not going to happen eventually he decides on option D
EDL	00:49:55,967	00:50:00,319	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Give the gun to his brother my brother lived in Maryland so that made it very convenient
EDL	00:50:01,087	00:50:03,391	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Did you just go visit your gun in Maryland what are you
EDL	00:50:03,391	00:50:04,927	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I yes I would go visit
EDL	00:50:05,439	00:50:06,975	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And caress and use my gun
EDL	00:50:07,999	00:50:08,511	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	What did you use it for
EDL	00:50:09,023	00:50:10,303	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Target practice of course
EDL	00:50:11,583	00:50:12,351	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Take me to
EDL	00:50:12,351	00:50:15,167	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Gun visitation situation sound functional but
EDL	00:50:15,679	00:50:22,079	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I think like any long-distance relationship they mostly sucked because more and more he didn't feel safe where he lived
EDL	00:50:22,079	00:50:25,919	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	About 10 blocks from the Capitol building right across the street from
EDL	00:50:26,431	00:50:28,735	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The number one most infamous
EDL	00:50:28,735	00:50:32,063	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Drug dealer Den in the city
EDL	00:50:32,063	00:50:33,599	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Cold Kentucky courts
EDL	00:50:34,111	00:50:35,647	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Every night at 2 a.m.
EDL	00:50:36,415	00:50:39,999	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The chief drug dealer would fire a 9 mm
EDL	00:50:39,999	00:50:41,791	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Into the air empty the clip
EDL	00:50:42,303	00:50:43,583	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And that was the signal
EDL	00:50:43,583	00:50:45,375	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Every night at 2
EDL	00:50:45,375	00:50:47,167	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Drug dealing was over
EDL	00:50:47,167	00:50:47,679	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	For the day
EDL	00:50:49,727	00:50:53,055	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	It's clear that living through the crack epidemic in DC really
EDL	00:50:53,823	00:50:55,615	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Shaped a lot of dicks views on guns
EDL	00:50:57,407	00:50:57,919	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	So
EDL	00:51:00,223	00:51:02,015	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	In the years after the handgun ban
EDL	00:51:02,527	00:51:08,159	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Dick starts the very long process of finding a way to get his gun back to DC and he eventually even quits his desk job
EDL	00:51:08,671	00:51:11,231	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	To pursue getting his gun back full time
EDL	00:51:11,231	00:51:13,023	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I'm all over Capitol Hill
EDL	00:51:13,023	00:51:14,047	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And I see
EDL	00:51:15,327	00:51:17,119	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Security guards have guns
EDL	00:51:18,143	00:51:18,655	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Well
EDL	00:51:19,679	00:51:20,191	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Going
EDL	00:51:20,959	00:51:22,495	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Why can't I be a security guard
EDL	00:51:23,263	00:51:23,775	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Golly
EDL	00:51:24,543	00:51:26,079	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Maybe that would help me
EDL	00:51:26,079	00:51:27,103	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Have a gun
EDL	00:51:27,103	00:51:28,639	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But I can't have on my own
EDL	00:51:29,151	00:51:32,479	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Let's see how easy or not easy this is
EDL	00:51:33,247	00:51:33,759	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Dali
EDL	00:51:34,271	00:51:35,039	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	One step
EDL	00:51:35,039	00:51:36,575	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Leads to another
EDL	00:51:36,575	00:51:37,343	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Just like that
EDL	00:51:37,855	00:51:41,439	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Dick was able to have a gun in DC but only during the day
EDL	00:51:41,439	00:51:42,975	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And only while he was working
EDL	00:51:42,975	00:51:44,255	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Like Barney Fife
EDL	00:51:44,255	00:51:47,583	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	At the end of my shift I have to turn in my gun and my bullets
EDL	00:51:48,095	00:51:49,375	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And they kept it there
EDL	00:51:49,375	00:51:50,655	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And they kept it on site in the sea
EDL	00:51:51,423	00:51:53,215	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	You finally starts looking for some help
EDL	00:51:53,727	00:51:54,495	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Illegal
EDL	00:51:54,495	00:51:57,823	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I knew Washington cuz I lived here and I'd gone to something tank
EDL	00:51:58,335	00:51:59,615	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Cato and Heritage
EDL	00:51:59,615	00:52:03,455	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Some others I knew they existed out there looking for some help
EDL	00:52:04,223	00:52:06,527	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Turns out these lawyers are out there looking for some dick
EDL	00:52:08,319	00:52:09,343	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	No no
EDL	00:52:10,367	00:52:12,671	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Wasn't there ideal sympathetic guy
EDL	00:52:12,671	00:52:15,487	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I was told repeatedly and it was in print
EDL	00:52:15,487	00:52:16,767	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But I was the worst
EDL	00:52:16,767	00:52:18,559	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Choice less-than-optimal
EDL	00:52:18,559	00:52:21,375	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Because of that Plantation thing you said or
EDL	00:52:21,375	00:52:23,679	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	He was always talk smack about
EDL	00:52:23,679	00:52:25,215	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Federal government and interviews
EDL	00:52:25,215	00:52:30,847	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	One day Clark neily put a note in my hand and said dick Heller this is what you say
EDL	00:52:30,847	00:52:32,639	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I just wanted a gun
EDL	00:52:32,639	00:52:34,175	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	To protect my house
EDL	00:52:34,687	00:52:35,455	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Shut up
EDL	00:52:36,991	00:52:38,783	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Play it wasn't their favorite plaintiff
EDL	00:52:38,783	00:52:41,855	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But the one thing that no one else has done
EDL	00:52:41,855	00:52:43,647	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Which is besides just wanting
EDL	00:52:43,647	00:52:47,231	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	An illegal handgun in DC he actually fill out an apple
EDL	00:52:47,231	00:52:47,999	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Occasion
EDL	00:52:47,999	00:52:51,583	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	To register a gun that you already possess a gun in Virginia
EDL	00:52:51,583	00:52:55,935	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And had that application denied and he had this denial slip or whatever it's called
EDL	00:52:55,935	00:52:57,727	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	You like literally had this physical proof
EDL	00:52:58,751	00:52:59,775	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	All of his grievance
EDL	00:53:00,287	00:53:05,151	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And simple technical arbitrary little stupid piece of paper gave him
EDL	00:53:05,151	00:53:11,551	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	What's known as standing to bring the case stick Heller ended up being kind of Last Man Standing that was nothing to do with that was not our
EDL	00:53:11,551	00:53:12,319	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Choice regardless
EDL	00:53:12,831	00:53:17,183	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Became their guy and these three lawyers they take the case of the DC Court
EDL	00:53:17,183	00:53:18,207	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And the judge
EDL	00:53:18,207	00:53:19,231	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	After
EDL	00:53:19,743	00:53:22,303	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Inspecting it said the case can go forward
EDL	00:53:23,839	00:53:24,863	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Magic Moment
EDL	00:53:40,479	00:53:44,319	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The Supreme Court is entering the debate over the Second Amendment right to bear arms
EDL	00:53:44,831	00:53:50,463	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Today's cases roster huge interest among citizens and politicians alike and it is divided even the president
EDL	00:53:50,463	00:53:51,487	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And vice president
EDL	00:53:53,791	00:53:54,559	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Chapter 3

EDL	00:55:24,671	00:55:27,231	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Essential question
EDL	00:55:27,231	00:55:32,095	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	What was James Madison thinking when he wrote the super confusing sentence like 200 years ago was he

EDL	00:55:39,519	00:55:41,567	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The first text to consider
EDL	00:55:42,335	00:55:44,895	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Is the phrase protecting a right to
EDL	00:55:44,895	00:55:45,919	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Keep and bear
EDL	00:55:46,943	00:55:53,343	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	If you look at the phrase the phrase keep and bear arms how it was used at the time
EDL	00:55:53,343	00:55:53,855	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Bear arms
EDL	00:55:54,367	00:55:56,415	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Used to refer to the use of arms
EDL	00:55:56,927	00:55:59,487	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	In connection with militia service
EDL	00:55:59,487	00:56:04,351	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Madison's rough drafts of the Second Amendment it's pretty clear that
EDL	00:56:04,351	00:56:05,119	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	When he says
EDL	00:56:05,119	00:56:06,911	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	People have a right to bear arms
EDL	00:56:07,423	00:56:08,959	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	All he really means is

EDL	00:56:19,455	00:56:24,831	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	It's a mystery
EDL	00:56:24,831	00:56:26,367	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Why would they say the right of the people
EDL	00:56:26,879	00:56:30,463	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	To keep arms just the people in the state militias

EDL	00:56:43,519	00:56:45,567	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The phrase the people are the militia
EDL	00:56:50,943	00:56:52,479	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Includes all the people

EDL	00:57:07,839	00:57:10,911	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Who were the people he was talking about
EDL	00:57:11,423	00:57:17,823	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	What those words meant was the people just the militia or everyone all the people what is the

EDL	01:01:52,767	01:01:54,047	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The answer is yes Justice
EDL	01:01:56,351	01:01:59,423	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And actually feels any standard of review that might be offered under Section
EDL	01:01:59,935	01:02:00,447	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Instructions
EDL	01:02:03,775	01:02:06,335	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The oral arguments last 90s
EDL	01:02:06,335	01:02:07,359	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	7 minutes
EDL	01:02:07,359	01:02:09,151	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Far longer than most other cases
EDL	01:02:09,151	01:02:10,943	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And going into the arguments
EDL	01:02:10,943	01:02:12,479	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Many Supreme Court Watchers
EDL	01:02:12,991	01:02:14,783	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Figured the case would be a close
EDL	01:02:14,783	01:02:16,063	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	5-4 decision
EDL	01:02:16,063	01:02:17,343	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And it could go either way
EDL	01:02:18,111	01:02:18,879	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And as with
EDL	01:02:19,391	01:02:21,183	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	All of these clothes cases
EDL	01:02:21,183	01:02:23,231	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Question was what would Anthony Kennedy

EDL	01:02:24,255	01:02:24,767	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Do
EDL	01:02:25,791	01:02:27,839	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	As in so many issues in America
EDL	01:02:28,351	01:02:30,655	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Comes down to what does Anthony Kennedy believe
EDL	01:02:32,703	01:02:37,567	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	So at the oral argument and I had the Good Fortune to be at the oral argument in the Heller case
EDL	01:02:37,567	01:02:39,359	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Everyone was looking
EDL	01:02:39,359	01:02:41,919	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	To hear what would he say about the Second Amendment
EDL	01:02:41,919	01:02:45,759	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	His was really the vote that counted in the very first comment he made
EDL	01:02:50,623	01:02:52,671	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Remote set learn to defend
EDL	01:02:52,671	01:02:55,231	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Himself and his family against hostile Indian tribes
EDL	01:02:55,743	01:02:56,767	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Outlaws
EDL	01:02:56,767	01:02:58,815	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Wolves and bears and grizzly something like that
EDL	01:02:59,839	01:03:01,887	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	One of the first things he said was
EDL	01:03:01,887	01:03:02,655	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	About bears
EDL	01:03:04,191	01:03:05,471	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Bear arms but
EDL	01:03:05,471	01:03:05,983	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Grizzly bears
EDL	01:03:07,519	01:03:09,311	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The Pointe candy was trying to make with clear
EDL	01:03:10,335	01:03:14,431	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Don't you think the framers had other reasons that they wanted people to have guns
EDL	01:03:14,943	01:03:16,479	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Other than just being a militia
EDL	01:03:16,991	01:03:18,015	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	What about
EDL	01:03:18,015	01:03:19,039	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	People being in their homes
EDL	01:03:19,551	01:03:20,831	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And is meeting to defend
EDL	01:03:22,623	01:03:24,415	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And that's when I silently
EDL	01:03:24,415	01:03:28,767	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Scream at the top of my lungs so nobody could hear me yes we win
EDL	01:03:29,535	01:03:30,559	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	...
EDL	01:03:30,559	01:03:31,327	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Something
EDL	01:03:45,407	01:03:51,807	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Will you turn out to be historic Supreme Court decision handed down this morning
EDL	01:03:51,807	01:03:55,135	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	07 to 90 District of Columbia vs. Heller
EDL	01:03:57,183	01:04:02,815	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	We hold that the second amendment guarantees an individual right to have
EDL	01:04:03,327	01:04:07,935	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And that the district's handgun ban as well as its requirement to firearms in the home
EDL	01:04:07,935	01:04:09,471	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Be rendered inoperative
EDL	01:04:09,471	01:04:10,239	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Violate
EDL	01:04:10,751	01:04:11,519	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	It was
EDL	01:04:11,519	01:04:14,591	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	A groundbreaking reading of the Second Amendment
EDL	01:04:18,175	01:04:21,247	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Scalia minimize that Clause referring to
EDL	01:04:21,247	01:04:26,623	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	A well regulated militia and put the stress on the second Clause that refer to the right of the people
EDL	01:04:26,623	01:04:28,415	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The people will not be deprived of
EDL	01:04:28,415	01:04:29,439	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The right to keep and bear arms
EDL	01:04:29,951	01:04:31,999	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	This was Edgar zakat for him
EDL	01:04:31,999	01:04:32,767	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	On the bench
EDL	01:04:32,767	01:04:33,535	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I think so
EDL	01:04:34,303	01:04:38,399	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Rip the militia Clause December 15th 1791
EDL	01:04:38,399	01:04:40,447	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The June 26 2008
EDL	01:04:40,959	01:04:42,495	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	A pretty good run if I'm being honest
EDL	01:04:44,287	01:04:47,103	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	For the first time in the history of these United States
EDL	01:04:47,615	01:04:49,663	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The courts definitively declared
EDL	01:04:49,663	01:04:50,943	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	That the Second Amendment
EDL	01:04:50,943	01:04:52,735	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Give every American
EDL	01:04:52,735	01:04:59,135	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The right to a gun for self-defense it was it was a great day for freedom in America was a great day for the Constitution
EDL	01:04:59,135	01:05:00,415	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Great day for citizens
EDL	01:05:00,927	01:05:04,511	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	It's a great day for gun owners it was great day for fearful people
EDL	01:05:06,303	01:05:07,071	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Of course
EDL	01:05:07,071	01:05:08,351	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Not everyone agreed
EDL	01:05:08,351	01:05:09,887	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I mean to me that's a travesty
EDL	01:05:11,679	01:05:12,703	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	This is Jack Rico
EDL	01:05:13,215	01:05:16,543	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Professor of history and political science at Stanford University
EDL	01:05:16,543	01:05:18,335	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	He filed a brief for the court and
EDL	01:05:18,335	01:05:21,151	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	He said scalia's reading of the history is just
EDL	01:05:21,151	01:05:21,919	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Wrong
EDL	01:05:21,919	01:05:26,527	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The Second Amendment is not about individual right that we shouldn't even be talking
EDL	01:05:26,527	01:05:27,295	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	About history
EDL	01:05:27,295	01:05:33,183	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Because the nature of firearms has changed so radically for the 18th century to our own time and that ultimately
EDL	01:05:33,183	01:05:38,559	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And here you go just as Stevens in his descent the court has decided to end
EDL	01:05:38,559	01:05:39,839	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Political Thicket
EDL	01:05:39,839	01:05:40,863	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Southern-style politics
EDL	01:05:41,887	01:05:42,655	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	To be honest
EDL	01:05:42,655	01:05:45,983	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Let Me Ride That really believe in constitutional law anymore
EDL	01:05:46,495	01:05:48,287	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I think I social laws of fiction
EDL	01:05:49,311	01:05:51,103	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Pedro has become so highly politicized
EDL	01:05:51,871	01:05:53,151	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	In so many areas
EDL	01:05:53,919	01:05:55,455	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I think I socialize
EDL	01:05:55,455	01:05:56,223	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Is bunk
EDL	01:05:56,223	01:06:00,319	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Wow I just destroyed I'm not a lawyer so that I don't have any professional steak
EDL	01:06:00,319	01:06:02,111	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Interfering the Judiciary
EDL	01:06:04,671	01:06:05,439	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But
EDL	01:06:05,439	01:06:06,975	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	There's a very big
EDL	01:06:07,487	01:06:12,351	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But he did have a major caveat section of our opinion points out that like most rights
EDL	01:06:12,351	01:06:13,375	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	What's the Second Amendment right
EDL	01:06:13,887	01:06:14,655	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Unlimited
EDL	01:06:14,655	01:06:16,191	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	He said like all right
EDL	01:06:16,703	01:06:22,335	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	It's not absolutely the right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever
EDL	01:06:22,335	01:06:23,615	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	And for whatever purpose
EDL	01:06:23,615	01:06:27,455	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Which is very important to keep in mind
EDL	01:06:28,223	01:06:29,503	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Long-standing
EDL	01:06:30,015	01:06:31,039	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Possession of firearm
EDL	01:06:32,319	01:06:32,831	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Mentally ill
EDL	01:06:33,343	01:06:35,647	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms
EDL	01:06:35,647	01:06:36,415	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Sesame Place
EDL	01:06:38,463	01:06:41,023	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	This is another thing that we tend to forget
EDL	01:06:41,023	01:06:42,303	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The decision says
EDL	01:06:42,303	01:06:44,607	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Every individual has the right to bear arms
EDL	01:06:44,607	01:06:47,167	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The most interesting lie like the decision also says
EDL	01:06:47,167	01:06:49,471	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Of course we need gun control
EDL	01:06:50,751	01:06:51,775	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	The word Heller
EDL	01:06:52,287	01:06:53,311	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Come to represent
EDL	01:06:53,823	01:06:54,335	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Like
EDL	01:06:55,103	01:06:55,871	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	2nd Amendment rights
EDL	01:06:56,383	01:07:00,735	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Are you against Heller even though being for Heller
EDL	01:07:00,735	01:07:02,271	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Is being for gun control
EDL	01:07:03,295	01:07:04,575	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Fusing yeah it is
EDL	01:07:05,087	01:07:07,903	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	I mean after all this time it's still just
EDL	01:07:07,903	01:07:08,927	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Totally confused
EDL	01:07:09,951	01:07:10,975	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	You have a right to a gun
EDL	01:07:11,487	01:07:13,023	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But the government has a right to regulate it
EDL	01:07:13,791	01:07:15,839	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Decal gets his gun back in DC
EDL	01:07:16,351	01:07:19,679	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	But PC still also has all sorts of gun regulation
EDL	01:07:21,215	01:07:23,775	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	You see the same pattern all over the country some states are lenient
EDL	01:07:24,287	01:07:25,567	| moreperfect101217_thegunshow |	Summer super strict
