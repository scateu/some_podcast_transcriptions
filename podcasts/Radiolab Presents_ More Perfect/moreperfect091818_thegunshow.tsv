EDL	00:00:40,448	00:00:46,080	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I think we should start with one of the most confusing sentences in the constitution in the Bill of Rights not We the People
EDL	00:00:46,080	00:00:47,360	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Not that one I got

EDL	00:00:49,920	00:00:50,432	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	,
EDL	00:00:51,200	00:00:52,480	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Being necessary

EDL	00:00:55,552	00:00:56,064	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	,
EDL	00:00:56,576	00:00:58,112	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The right of the people to
EDL	00:00:58,112	00:00:59,392	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Keep and bear arms

EDL	00:01:06,816	00:01:09,376	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Sure a well regulated militia
EDL	00:01:09,376	00:01:13,216	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	, being necessary to the security
EDL	00:01:13,216	00:01:14,496	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Of a free state
EDL	00:01:15,008	00:01:19,104	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Oh, the right of the people to keep and bear arms
EDL	00:01:19,104	00:01:21,664	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Totally unnecessary,
EDL	00:01:22,432	00:01:23,200	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Shall not be infringed
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:25,760	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Is that the one that's about guns
EDL	00:01:25,760	00:01:30,624	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Adam Winkler who wrote the book on on the 2nd Amendment end of book is called gunfight he's a journalist
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:33,184	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	He's a professor of law at UCLA
EDL	00:01:33,184	00:01:37,024	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	He said it's almost as if James Madison the author of the amendment I just
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:39,328	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Discovered this wonderful new thing the,
EDL	00:01:39,328	00:01:41,120	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And wanted to put it in there as many times
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:43,936	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Which is like
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:45,728	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	A nerdy professorial joke
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:47,776	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	But like seriously what is it in like
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:54,176	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	It had to be this one come to the Bendy Amendment about like quartering soldiers in your house that was really confusing
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:55,200	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Guns that they made like chest
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:57,504	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Indecipherable and ever since
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:59,808	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Generations of Americans have been confused
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:01,088	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	By the language of the Second Amendment
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:04,672	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	So when the song was written we had just fought this war with the British
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:06,720	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Is Revolutionary War
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:08,768	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And they try to win it right from the get-go
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:10,816	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Bike coming for our guns
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:14,400	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	So these new states are looking at this new federal government they're going
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:17,984	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	We don't know we want to trust you quite yet so there's the second amendment that says
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:19,264	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	You guys can fight back
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:21,568	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Like the feds are going to disarm you you can your malicious
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:23,104	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	That's
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:24,384	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I think what we agree on
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:27,200	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	But then after that you just look at the sentence
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:28,224	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	That is not just a
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:29,504	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Comments that are confusing
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:30,784	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	If you look at the sentence
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:31,808	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	As a whole
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:33,088	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Pieces don't seem to
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:33,856	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Get together
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:34,880	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	There's some noun confusion
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:36,160	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I mean
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:40,000	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	It's obvious that the sentence is about someone's right to bear arms but who
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:41,536	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Who get that right
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:43,840	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	At the beginning of the sentence
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:45,888	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	You got a well regulated militia
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:46,912	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Demolition
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:48,960	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	States have a right to form militias
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:49,984	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Jets to assemble
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:52,544	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Groups of people and those people got to have their guns
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:53,568	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	That's easy enough
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:55,616	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	But then later the sentence there's
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:57,152	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Oh, the right of the people
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:58,176	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	To keep and bear arms
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:02:58,944	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	,
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:02:59,968	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Shall not be infringed
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:01,248	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The people
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:03,296	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Which people
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:05,600	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Those people over there in the militia
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:06,368	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	All people
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:08,416	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	If you mean all people
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:09,696	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Why'd you say militia
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:10,464	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	It's like
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:14,560	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The first Clause seems to point to some sort of collective right to bear arms
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:15,840	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And the second clause
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:19,168	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Seems to point to some individual right to bear arms
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:21,472	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Life is supposed to be a popularly ratified document
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:25,568	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	It's actually not that easy to read
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:27,360	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	But it's not it wasn't that easy to read then
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:28,896	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	This is Jill Lepore
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:30,176	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Staff writer at the New Yorker magazine
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:32,736	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	She's also a professor of American
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:34,272	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I studied 18th century
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:38,880	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I'm really trying in the seventeenth and eighteenth century American political
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:41,184	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And Jill says
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:44,512	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	From the beginning when people thought about the Second Amendment they tend to
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:45,536	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	To just focus
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:46,560	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	On the first part
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:48,864	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	That the primary motivation for the amendment is
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:51,936	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	About militia well-regulated militia
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:55,776	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	But this confusing sentence was widely read as
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:56,800	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	This Collective
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:58,080	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Melissa Wright
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:04:00,640	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Not an individual one truth
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:02,176	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Did the Second Amendment facts
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:03,968	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Guarantees the right of an individual to
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:06,784	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	To bear arms in that the government federal government
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:07,808	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	In any fashion
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:08,576	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Juices
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:09,856	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I just didn't exist
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:15,488	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I disagree with the way you characterize
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:17,536	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	That although what you said is
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:21,887	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Stated in the media frequently Stephen halbrook he's represented the NRA in several
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:25,471	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I've written several books on Second Amendment issues
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:27,263	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	He actually thinks a
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:28,287	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The sentence is just
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:34,687	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Is fine as is I don't think it's complicated at all the framers were thinking about an individual right
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:37,503	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The Second Amendment refers to the right of the people to
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:42,367	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	First Amendment refers to the right of the people peaceably to assemble
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:47,743	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I mean who is that it did this individuals or not some kind of collected that doesn't exist in reality
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:50,047	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	So which was it
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:52,351	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	That that's a really good question to add I mean
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:55,679	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	It's complicated 1/2 what I can tell you is that
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:56,959	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	No people I spoke to for the
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:57,471	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The story said
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:05:02,079	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	At least in the 20th century when the when the second amendment was taught in law schools
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:03,359	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	It was taught this
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:05,151	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	It was taught as a sort of antiquated
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:06,687	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Outdated
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:08,735	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Thing that have to do with malicious
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:10,527	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	It's not so much individual rights
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:11,551	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	But
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:15,647	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Stephen halbrook and their respective side something they can both agree on
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:16,927	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Is that this
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:21,023	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Super sacred Second Amendment the third rail
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:22,303	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Of our American pilot

EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:28,959	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	It was not like that it was utterly ignored ignored
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:30,239	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	This amendment
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:31,775	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	When I Was An undergraduate
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:35,103	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Undergrad at Florida State University went to the forest
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:39,967	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Supreme Court and start looking up law review articles on constitutional law issues and I found that

EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:04,031	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	It was like
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:10,431	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Luxardo runt of the Bill of Rights glitter like no one argued about it it's a striking thing to eat to think about

EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:21,439	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Because there was this window
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:22,207	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Time work
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:23,743	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	All of this
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:25,279	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Changes that the script

EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:31,167	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And then suddenly
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:32,191	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	You got
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:33,471	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	This
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:35,263	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I want say those fighting words

EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:48,575	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Gabriel So basically in
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:49,855	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The Flash
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:51,903	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The Second Amendment goes from being
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:52,927	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Ignored
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:55,487	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	To be

EDL	00:06:57,535	00:07:03,935	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And in the process
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:10,335	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	We start to read the thing totally differently all of a sudden this is hotly debated thing that's got nothing to do with
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:11,103	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	That first part
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:12,383	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And everything
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:13,151	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	To do
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:15,455	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	What II

EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:25,695	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	What are the Second Amendment people maybe there is that
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:28,255	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	But what I want to know is how did that happen
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:33,119	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	How do we start reading the Second Amendment the way we do now
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:36,703	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And and what I found out is that
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:40,031	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	In the modern history of the gun rights movement and
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:42,591	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And how we read the second amendment can be boiled down to these
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:43,615	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	3
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:44,383	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Totally

EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:59,039	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Yeah so this transition from the militia to the individual my right to bear arms
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:00,831	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	You could argue that
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:03,647	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	That whole individual gun rights movements
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:04,415	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Started
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,183	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	In the
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:06,975	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	With the Black Panthers
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:13,887	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	In Oakland it's an unlikely and kind of surprising origin for what's known as the individual rights interpretation of the Second Amendment
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:20,287	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	We would different breathe well read guys we do you know I history
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:21,823	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Context is 1966
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:23,103	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	It's been
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:27,455	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	An exceptionally bad time for race relations all over the country
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:31,551	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	More than 1500 people were in the
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:35,647	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Attack dogs and hoses
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:42,047	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And in particular the tension between

EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:52,031	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	60s high profile incidents

EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:58,175	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	You know and
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:59,455	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	What we did
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:01,247	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Is that yet we took a position
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:05,087	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	October 1966
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:11,999	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Bicillin is friend Huey P Newton they start this organization called the black panthers black panther party for self-defense
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:12,511	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Defense
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:17,631	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Fue Bobby's co-founder was 2 years in law school
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:21,471	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	You was going to the University of San Francisco School of Law
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:25,823	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And one day he's sitting there as as you do law school thinking about the law
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:28,639	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Think about Malcolm X thinking about what he can do in Oakland
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:29,663	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And it hits
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:32,735	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The Second Amendment of the Constitution guarantees
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:35,295	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The citizen's right to bear arms
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:36,831	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	On public property
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:41,183	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	But they can argue that the Second Amendment gave them a right
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:47,583	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Have a gun he said that's a constitutional Democratic civil human right
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:49,887	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	There's always been those who claim that
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:50,655	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Second Amendment
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:55,519	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Protecting an individual right to bear arms who argued that were in the minority
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:56,799	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	They want taken
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:12:00,639	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Too seriously this was one of the first times that the individual rights reading was
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:02,175	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Forced into
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:03,199	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The mainstream because
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:08,319	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	We have a right to bear arms
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,599	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	We individuals
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:10,367	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Then
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:12,159	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	We can control the police
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:13,439	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Observe the police
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:16,767	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Tell him that we control the police
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:21,375	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	What do eagles do you in law school so what legal status do we have
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:25,727	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	That second half of the Second Amendment right to bear arms
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:30,335	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Possessing bear arms okay he also pointed to a California state law
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:36,735	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	It said you could carry a gun as long as it wasn't concealed the gun is not concealed is not illegal
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:40,063	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	So the Black Panthers started policing the police
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:40,831	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	We did
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:48,511	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	It would go out in arms patrols and follow police car on 7th Street
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:54,911	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	West Oakland California nightlife District police officer pulled over

EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:58,751	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And the crowds are together
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:05,151	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And if you holding a gun yes he's holding a shotgun shotgun that I bought him
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:11,295	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	What's a high standard going to cost 89 or $79 I bought the damn gun Isis here Huey

EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:54,048	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Until around the time
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:54,816	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The Black Panther

EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:19,904	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	It wasn't the Panthers themselves that were the problem I don't like anybody
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:24,000	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	That tells me I can't do something is all the gun control laws that came
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:24,512	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	In the wake
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:27,328	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	When the gun control Act
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:27,840	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Repasts

EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:34,752	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And then say
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:40,128	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	A lot of things just appeared that I had been used to Joe said he starts the gun shops in his neighborhood
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:40,896	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Close
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:44,224	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Like the furniture store in Buffalo that used to have shotgun
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:46,016	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	$5 think they stop selling them
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:48,576	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And he says that is really bothered him because
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:50,880	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The reason you have a gun
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:54,208	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Is for protection another form of insurance
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:59,328	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Which wasn't an abstract idea for him buffalo in the 60s and 70s
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:00,352	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Not the thief

EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:32,096	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Jose whole relationship with Firearms disorder predicated upon that
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:33,120	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	This idea that it's
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:34,144	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	For self-defense
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:35,680	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And here he's got
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:37,216	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	People breaking into his house
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:38,496	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	He's got
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:40,544	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The cops not being there for him
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:43,104	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	He's got the government trying to take his gun away so
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:43,872	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	What do you do
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:46,688	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	You join the n
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:47,456	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	AR
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:48,224	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Hey then I join

EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:51,808	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	But
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:54,624	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	This came at a moment where the NRA was at this
EDL	00:23:55,392	00:23:56,928	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Crossroads online
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:23:58,464	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Any edit seen before
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:23:59,488	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Orson
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:06,144	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Back when Joe joined in the early 70s the NRA
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:07,936	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Was not the diehards
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:09,216	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Supporter of gun rights
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:10,240	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Let me know today
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:12,032	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Because according to Adam Winkler
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:16,128	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	It was never meant to be the idea behind the NRA
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:17,664	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	To be fundamental right down
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:21,248	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Today was to increase Civilian Marksmanship training
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:23,808	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	So that the next time there's a war Americans would be
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:25,088	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Capable of fighting it
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:27,904	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	You know you don't hear much about the NRA's founders
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:34,048	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	But the NRA was formed in the 1870s right after the Civil War by a reporter for the New York Times
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:38,912	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Who thought that the Union Soldiers had been so ineffective
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:41,984	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	In the Civil War because they were not familiar with firearms
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:43,264	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Really yeah
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:45,312	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	But a hundred years their main focus was
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:49,152	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Like teaching Boy Scouts how to shoot straight not the Second Amendment
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:52,992	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And apparently if you go back through issues of American Rifleman
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:54,528	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	40s
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:55,296	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	50s
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:57,856	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Are the enemies version of Playboy guns instead of
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:25:03,232	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Girls you'll be amazed that you can't find a single mention of the Second Amendment anywhere in those magazine
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:06,048	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The NRA at that point was
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:08,352	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Sort of like a gun trade group they work
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:11,424	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Not super political and and the people who ran it
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:12,704	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	They were Hunters
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:13,472	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	John Hunt
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:19,872	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	They were just like these wealthy businessmen who like to hunt according to Joe guys who
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:21,408	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Yeah they were hobbyist
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:26,272	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	You had all these people coming in like Joe and like John who were convinced
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:28,064	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The guns weren't about
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:29,856	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Shooting ducks they were about Schultz
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:32,672	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Protecting yourself against criminals
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:35,232	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	In a time of starkly Rising crime rate
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:37,280	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And this would lead to this straight up
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:38,816	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Head on collision
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:39,584	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	At the NRA
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:42,144	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Now
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:44,448	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Joe and John join the NRA
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:45,984	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The organization address
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:46,752	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	For the first
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:47,264	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Time
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:49,312	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	So to set up this lobbying are
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:53,152	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Yeah it was the brand new Institute for legislative action
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:57,248	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	John actually got hired to work there in 1976
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:59,808	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And this true for legislative action
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:01,600	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Supposed to fight for gun rights
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:04,416	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Stop Chapel Hill that's what they both wanted to do but
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:05,696	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Let's put it this way
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:07,232	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	We were the
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:08,768	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	If you would the bastards
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:09,792	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Step-children
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:11,328	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	What's the National Rifle Association
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:12,608	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Really
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:15,168	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Yeah when the institute for legislative action

EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:19,968	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Is when a guy named Bob Kukla gets up to the mic he was at the time the head

EDL	00:33:12,960	00:33:15,520	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Over the course of this one nine our meeting
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:17,824	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	On a hot steamy night in Cincinnati
EDL	00:33:17,824	00:33:20,384	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Every single one of those 50 proposals
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:21,408	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Was passed

EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:30,368	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Expired the leadership just like the political savant

EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:36,768	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Absolutely took it in their shorts
EDL	00:33:37,280	00:33:40,096	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And maybe the biggest change the most important change
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:40,608	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Was that
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:43,424	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The Institute for legislative action this
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:45,728	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Political lobbying arm of the NRA

EDL	00:33:54,688	00:33:56,480	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	We won and essentially
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:57,248	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Staged
EDL	00:33:57,248	00:33:59,296	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	What are they called 1776
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:01,088	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	It's the same thing
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:03,136	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	When the sun rose the very next day
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:06,464	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The NRA have

EDL	00:34:15,936	00:34:18,240	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Almost any gun that they want and have as many of them
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:21,056	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I can take those guns
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:22,080	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Almost anyplace they want

EDL	00:34:24,384	00:34:25,664	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Literally changed overnight
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:28,224	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And just shortly after this coup
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:29,504	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The NRA
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:30,272	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Both
EDL	00:34:30,272	00:34:34,624	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	This Abridged version of the Second Amendment right on the wall front center and its head coach
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:35,904	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The Rite of

EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:39,488	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Nice clean
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:41,280	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Totally uncomplicated
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:43,840	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Conveniently left out was the
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:46,400	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The part that talked about a well regulated militia
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:47,424	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Be necessary for
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:48,192	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Security of a
EDL	00:34:48,192	00:34:48,704	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Free state
EDL	00:34:49,472	00:34:52,800	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I asked John like what about the militia part of the set
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:58,944	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Why doesn't the NRA ever talk about that now you get me back to asking you if
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:02,016	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	John I love you dearly trust me
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:03,552	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	But
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:06,880	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	It's only been in less what 30 years
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:09,440	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	That if you'll pardon the expression
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:13,792	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The b******* media has turned the militia into a four-letter word
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:16,096	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The militia is you and me Sean
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:22,496	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Post-coup
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:25,824	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The NRA took a very hard line on gun control
EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:29,152	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And became an irrepressible political force in America
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:33,504	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Grandinfo agree the NRA's power to scare congressman
EDL	00:35:33,504	00:35:38,112	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Lies and its ability to mobilize its members in any congressional district
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:40,416	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The touch of a computer button
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:44,000	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	They start pouring millions of dollars into lobbying NJ
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:46,304	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	A few years after that Cincinnati revolt
EDL	00:35:46,816	00:35:49,632	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The NRA endorses its first presidential candidate
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:52,448	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The Constitution does not say
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:55,008	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The government shall decree
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:56,800	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The right to keep and bear arms
EDL	00:35:56,800	00:35:57,568	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Reagan
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:36:03,968	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Reagan the Constitution says the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:04,480	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	French
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:09,600	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	At this point everyone and their Uncle leaves out the militia Park
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:10,624	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Of the Second Amendment
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:13,440	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Which is why Americans eventually start to forget that
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:16,512	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The militia clause or whatever you want to call it even exist
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:19,072	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I wish I could save that instead of the last
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:25,216	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	One of these at most surprised me when I was doing some research this is julep
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:26,752	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	By the 1990s
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:30,080	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The new interpretation of the Second Amendment had so penetrated
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:31,616	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Popular opinion
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:35,200	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	That people were more familiar with the Second Amendment then with the
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:36,224	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Best Buy 1990s
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:38,528	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The First Amendment
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:41,344	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	That Eclipse really
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:41,856	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Kind of shock
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:48,256	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	But even if you did the Panthers and the president in the American people are all down to sort of forget about this militia
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:50,560	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Clause of the 2nd Amendment
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:52,352	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	It didn't mean a lot without the courts
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:53,632	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And of course
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:55,936	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Particularly the Supreme Court
EDL	00:36:56,448	00:36:56,960	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Woodbine
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:37:02,336	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The US Supreme Court from 1969 to 1986
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:03,104	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Warren Burger
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:06,944	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Song giving a television interview and he says that this new interpretation is it
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:08,224	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Second amendment was
EDL	00:37:08,224	00:37:13,600	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	What are the greatest pieces of fraud I repeat the word fraud
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:15,904	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	On the American public
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:17,696	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	That I have ever seen in my life
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:21,280	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And this was a republican appointed by
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:23,072	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Richard Nixon now
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:24,096	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Yeah
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:27,424	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Yeah so the Supreme Court obviously not
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:29,728	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Dying to have this conversation at the moment
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:33,056	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	But it's not just the Supreme Court if you look at the federal courts the entire
EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:35,104	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Federal court system in America
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:39,456	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	That there's not once in our history at this point over 200 years
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:40,992	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Been a single instance
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:44,064	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Of some gun law some State local gun law
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:48,160	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Getting up to a court and the court going you know what you can't do this
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:50,976	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	It violates the second amendment that does not even happen
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:51,744	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Really
EDL	00:37:51,744	00:37:56,608	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Not even the weather like in Mammoth Smackdown anywhere in federal court this isn't this isn't a thing
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:59,168	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Current Supreme Court to weigh in on it
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:03,520	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	That doesn't even look like it could be a thing it doesn't even look like much more than a fantasy
EDL	00:38:04,032	00:38:04,544	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Until

EDL	00:40:55,296	00:40:57,088	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	2nd Amendment has become

EDL	00:41:05,280	00:41:06,304	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Is still staying out of it
EDL	00:41:06,816	00:41:08,096	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	They're leaving this up to the states
EDL	00:41:08,608	00:41:11,168	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Which already have all sorts of gun laws of their own to deal
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:13,728	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	But then December 12th

EDL	00:41:49,056	00:41:53,919	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And almost right after he gets into office Bush's Attorney General John Ashcroft
EDL	00:41:53,919	00:41:54,943	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Put out a letter
EDL	00:41:54,943	00:41:58,527	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	This public letter to the NRA announcing that the Department of Justice

EDL	00:42:02,367	00:42:06,207	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And then right around the same time as the Bush Administration memo came out
EDL	00:42:06,975	00:42:07,487	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	4
EDL	00:42:08,511	00:42:09,279	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Texas

EDL	00:42:13,631	00:42:14,399	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And that was a first
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:15,679	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The big deal
EDL	00:42:15,679	00:42:16,447	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Before this
EDL	00:42:16,447	00:42:17,983	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	All the decisions of kind of
EDL	00:42:17,983	00:42:19,263	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Beard in the other direction
EDL	00:42:19,263	00:42:21,567	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And because of that Court ruling
EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:23,359	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And John Ashcroft letter
EDL	00:42:23,871	00:42:25,407	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	List three libertarian lawyers

EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:29,247	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Constitutional attorney

EDL	00:42:31,807	00:42:38,207	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Toot and Clark neily thought the timing was right we thought it was a good time for some litigation
EDL	00:42:38,207	00:42:40,767	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I want thing you need to know about these guys is that they weren't
EDL	00:42:40,767	00:42:46,911	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Family doing it for the guns they had no association with the NRA or the gun rights movement for them it was
EDL	00:42:46,911	00:42:52,543	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	More about getting the government to back off in our country when the government wants to restrict our Liberty
EDL	00:42:52,543	00:42:57,919	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	It isn't coming on the government to make the case for it isn't coming on the government to say here's why you shouldn't be permitted
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:42:59,455	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	To exercise that right
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:00,479	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	So that was their angle
EDL	00:43:00,479	00:43:05,599	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Always wondered why the gun rights movement has become such a proxy war for like anti-government
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:06,367	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Mint
EDL	00:43:06,367	00:43:10,207	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Is Mmm Yeah well I mean if you think about this something professor
EDL	00:43:10,719	00:43:12,255	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Sandy Levinson told me
EDL	00:43:12,255	00:43:15,583	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Is that sort of embedded in this amendment
EDL	00:43:15,583	00:43:16,351	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	That is
EDL	00:43:16,351	00:43:20,959	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The very idea that you can take up arms against the governor
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:22,751	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Protect yourself
EDL	00:43:22,751	00:43:24,543	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And your fellow man from tyranny
EDL	00:43:24,543	00:43:25,823	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	On the far right
EDL	00:43:26,335	00:43:28,383	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Or occasionally on the far left
EDL	00:43:29,151	00:43:31,199	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	You find people who are willing
EDL	00:43:31,199	00:43:31,967	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	2
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:34,015	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Say this that this is really what
EDL	00:43:34,015	00:43:35,039	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Terrific about
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:35,551	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The Second Amendment
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:39,647	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	But mainstream conservatives in mainstream liberals
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:41,183	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Arnott
EDL	00:43:41,183	00:43:44,767	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Very happy with those arguments they are embarrassed by them
EDL	00:43:45,279	00:43:48,095	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And so mainstream conservatives
EDL	00:43:48,095	00:43:50,911	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Want to talk about self defense against
EDL	00:43:51,423	00:43:52,191	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Burglars
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:54,751	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And mainstream liberals
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:56,287	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Want to talk
EDL	00:43:56,287	00:43:56,799	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	About
EDL	00:43:57,311	00:43:58,335	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	How
EDL	00:43:58,335	00:44:02,175	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The second amendment protects State organized militias
EDL	00:44:02,175	00:44:03,199	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And
EDL	00:44:03,199	00:44:03,967	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Almost nothing else
EDL	00:44:05,247	00:44:06,783	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Anyway getting back to the story
EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:09,599	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	These three libertarian lawyers they decide
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:11,903	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Put together case and their idea was to
EDL	00:44:11,903	00:44:14,463	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The target this really restrictive gun law
EDL	00:44:14,463	00:44:15,231	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	In DC
EDL	00:44:15,231	00:44:21,375	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	All handguns were banned you can own a shotgun or a rifle but the law specifically made it illegal to ever put a round in the chamber
EDL	00:44:21,375	00:44:22,911	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Even in self-defense or there is
EDL	00:44:23,423	00:44:29,823	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	There's really Funk we we we described it as a ban on all functional Firearms but in order to challenge that law
EDL	00:44:29,823	00:44:30,847	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	They needed to find a plaintiff
EDL	00:44:31,359	00:44:32,895	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Interesting how do you find a
EDL	00:44:32,895	00:44:33,663	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Plaintiff
EDL	00:44:33,663	00:44:34,943	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	You look for somebody who
EDL	00:44:34,943	00:44:36,479	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Got robbed what do you do
EDL	00:44:36,479	00:44:38,527	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Well we can actually instigate
EDL	00:44:38,527	00:44:39,295	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Litigation
EDL	00:44:39,295	00:44:40,575	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	We can take out a
EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:46,975	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Full page ad in the New York Times saying you want them indicate your second amendment rights give us a ring essentially got the word out talk to
EDL	00:44:46,975	00:44:47,487	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	2
EDL	00:44:47,999	00:44:49,535	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I would say between
EDL	00:44:49,535	00:44:50,303	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	2 + 3000
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:52,095	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	People they all had
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:58,495	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Really interesting stories they found a guy who was gay gentleman named Tom Palmer could previously been
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:45:01,055	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Assaulted when he lived in California
EDL	00:45:01,055	00:45:02,079	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Because he was gay
EDL	00:45:02,079	00:45:04,639	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Was almost murdered by a skinhead mahbuba phobic
EDL	00:45:04,639	00:45:06,431	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Subs and he wanted a gun
EDL	00:45:06,431	00:45:07,455	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	To protect himself
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:11,295	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Are lead plaintiff was an African-American woman named Shelly Parker
EDL	00:45:11,295	00:45:13,087	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	She was trying to protect yourself against
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:16,671	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Local drug dealers and the cops actually told her she should get a gun
EDL	00:45:17,183	00:45:18,207	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Which was illegal
EDL	00:45:18,719	00:45:25,119	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Weird so they have this whole group so we ended up with three men and three women mid twenties to early 60s
EDL	00:45:25,119	00:45:26,655	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Former y2am rapper

EDL	00:45:28,959	00:45:31,775	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Was that all these super sympathetic plaintiff
EDL	00:45:32,287	00:45:35,359	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Didn't have this very special thing they needed
EDL	00:45:35,359	00:45:36,383	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	To bring a case
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:42,783	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Standing standing with a legal term meaning they didn't have a sufficient grievance to be in court like if you can bring a case
EDL	00:45:42,783	00:45:45,599	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Have to show that you've been actually harmed by
EDL	00:45:45,599	00:45:49,951	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Not being able to get a gun you have to show some physical concrete proof

EDL	00:48:17,919	00:48:19,455	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Like 1976
EDL	00:48:19,455	00:48:20,735	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Is living in DC
EDL	00:48:21,247	00:48:22,015	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And
EDL	00:48:22,015	00:48:23,295	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	One day he's sitting at home
EDL	00:48:23,807	00:48:24,831	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I was watching
EDL	00:48:24,831	00:48:28,671	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	My hero Matt Dillon Gunsmoke
EDL	00:48:30,463	00:48:31,231	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Different Matt Dillon
EDL	00:48:33,023	00:48:36,607	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And he had this long-barreled handgun
EDL	00:48:38,399	00:48:39,935	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I was about 30 years old
EDL	00:48:40,447	00:48:41,983	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And I figured ghali
EDL	00:48:41,983	00:48:43,775	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I should own my first gun
EDL	00:48:43,775	00:48:44,799	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	So when I went and bought
EDL	00:48:45,311	00:48:47,871	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	My when I call my Matt Dillon special
EDL	00:48:47,871	00:48:51,455	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Hi standard 22 revolver Matt Dillon Buntline
EDL	00:48:51,967	00:48:52,735	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And it was just
EDL	00:48:53,503	00:48:54,527	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I live in America
EDL	00:48:54,527	00:48:56,319	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	We're Cowboys Society
EDL	00:48:56,319	00:48:58,111	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I should have a cowboy gun and was just
EDL	00:48:59,391	00:49:01,951	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Nothing no really deep thought to it
EDL	00:49:01,951	00:49:08,351	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	But then just a few months after he got that gun in October 1976
EDL	00:49:08,351	00:49:09,119	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Started with the Mulford Act
EDL	00:49:09,631	00:49:11,679	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And the Black Panthers back in Sacramento
EDL	00:49:11,679	00:49:16,543	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Hits Washington DC DC gun control regulations outlawed
EDL	00:49:16,543	00:49:21,919	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Firearms ownership get that gun law which outlawed all hang out so I had some choices
EDL	00:49:22,431	00:49:23,199	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I could
EDL	00:49:23,199	00:49:24,735	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Turn it into the government
EDL	00:49:24,735	00:49:25,503	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Not going to happen
EDL	00:49:26,015	00:49:28,319	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I can throw it in the Dipsy dumpster
EDL	00:49:28,319	00:49:29,343	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Not going to happen
EDL	00:49:29,855	00:49:32,927	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Or there was no other option I could go to jail
EDL	00:49:33,695	00:49:37,023	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Not going to happen eventually he decides on option D
EDL	00:49:37,535	00:49:40,351	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Give the gun to his brother my brother lived in Maryland
EDL	00:49:40,351	00:49:41,887	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	So that made it very convenient
EDL	00:49:42,655	00:49:44,959	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Did you just go visit your gun in Maryland what did you do
EDL	00:49:44,959	00:49:46,751	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I yes I would go visit
EDL	00:49:46,751	00:49:48,543	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And caress and use my gun
EDL	00:49:49,311	00:49:49,823	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	What did you use it
EDL	00:49:50,591	00:49:51,615	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Target practice
EDL	00:49:51,615	00:49:52,127	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Of course
EDL	00:49:52,895	00:49:53,919	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Take me to
EDL	00:49:53,919	00:49:56,479	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Gun visitation situation sound functional but
EDL	00:49:57,247	00:50:00,575	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I think like any long-distance relationship they mostly sucked because
EDL	00:50:00,575	00:50:06,975	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	More and more he didn't feel safe where he lifts I lived about 10 blocks from the Capitol building right across the street
EDL	00:50:06,975	00:50:07,743	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	From
EDL	00:50:07,743	00:50:10,303	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The number one most infamous
EDL	00:50:10,303	00:50:11,071	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Drug
EDL	00:50:11,071	00:50:12,351	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Dealer Den
EDL	00:50:12,351	00:50:15,423	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	In the city called Kentucky courts
EDL	00:50:15,423	00:50:17,215	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Every night at 2 a.m.
EDL	00:50:17,983	00:50:21,311	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The chief drug dealer would fire a 9 mm
EDL	00:50:21,311	00:50:23,103	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Into the air empty the clip
EDL	00:50:23,615	00:50:25,151	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And that was the signal
EDL	00:50:25,151	00:50:26,431	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Every night at 2
EDL	00:50:26,943	00:50:28,223	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Drug dealing was over
EDL	00:50:28,735	00:50:29,247	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	For the day
EDL	00:50:31,295	00:50:34,623	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	It's clear that living through the crack epidemic in DC really
EDL	00:50:35,391	00:50:36,927	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Shaped a lot of dicks views on gun
EDL	00:50:38,719	00:50:39,231	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	So
EDL	00:50:41,535	00:50:43,839	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	In the years after the handgun ban
EDL	00:50:43,839	00:50:49,727	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Dick starts the very long process of finding a way to get his gun back to DC and he eventually then quits his desk job
EDL	00:50:50,239	00:50:52,031	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	To pursue getting his gun back
EDL	00:50:52,031	00:50:54,591	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Full-time I'm all over Capitol Hill
EDL	00:50:54,591	00:50:55,359	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And I see
EDL	00:50:56,895	00:50:57,919	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Security guards
EDL	00:50:57,919	00:50:58,687	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Have guns
EDL	00:50:59,711	00:51:00,223	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Well
EDL	00:51:01,247	00:51:01,759	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Going
EDL	00:51:02,271	00:51:04,063	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Why can't I be a security guard
EDL	00:51:04,831	00:51:05,343	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Golly
EDL	00:51:05,855	00:51:07,135	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Maybe that would help me
EDL	00:51:07,647	00:51:08,671	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Have a gun
EDL	00:51:08,671	00:51:10,207	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	But I can't have on my own
EDL	00:51:10,719	00:51:14,047	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Let's see how easy or not easy this is
EDL	00:51:14,559	00:51:15,071	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Dali
EDL	00:51:15,583	00:51:18,143	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	One Step leads to another
EDL	00:51:18,143	00:51:19,167	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Just like that
EDL	00:51:19,167	00:51:23,007	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Dick was able to have a gun in DC but only during the day
EDL	00:51:23,007	00:51:24,543	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And only while he was working
EDL	00:51:24,543	00:51:25,823	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Like Barney Fife
EDL	00:51:25,823	00:51:29,151	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	At the end of my shift I have to turn in my gun and my bullets
EDL	00:51:29,663	00:51:30,687	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And they kept it there
EDL	00:51:30,687	00:51:31,967	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And they kept it on sidon
EDL	00:51:32,735	00:51:34,783	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	He finally starts looking for some help
EDL	00:51:35,295	00:51:36,063	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Some legal help
EDL	00:51:36,063	00:51:39,391	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I knew Washington cuz I lived here and I've gone to something tanks
EDL	00:51:39,903	00:51:44,767	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Cato in Heritage and some others I knew they existed and right around the time out there looking for some help
EDL	00:51:45,535	00:51:47,839	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Turns out these lawyers are out there looking for some dick
EDL	00:51:49,631	00:51:50,399	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	No
EDL	00:51:50,399	00:51:50,911	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	No
EDL	00:51:51,935	00:51:58,335	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Wasn't there ideal sympathetic guy I was told repeatedly and it was in print that I was the worst
EDL	00:51:58,335	00:52:00,127	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Choice less-than-optimal
EDL	00:52:00,127	00:52:02,687	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	You know because of that Plantation thing you said or
EDL	00:52:02,687	00:52:06,783	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	He was always talk smack about the federal government and interviews
EDL	00:52:06,783	00:52:07,551	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	One day
EDL	00:52:07,551	00:52:08,319	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Clark neily
EDL	00:52:08,319	00:52:10,879	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Put a note in my hand and said dick Heller
EDL	00:52:10,879	00:52:12,415	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	This is what you say
EDL	00:52:12,415	00:52:13,951	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I just wanted a gun
EDL	00:52:14,463	00:52:15,999	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Protect my house
EDL	00:52:15,999	00:52:16,767	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Shut up
EDL	00:52:18,303	00:52:19,839	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Play it wasn't their favorite princess
EDL	00:52:20,351	00:52:23,167	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	But the one thing that no one else has done
EDL	00:52:23,167	00:52:25,215	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Which is besides just wanting
EDL	00:52:25,215	00:52:29,055	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	An illegal handgun in DC he actually fill out an application
EDL	00:52:29,567	00:52:33,151	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	To register a gun that he already possessed again in Virginia
EDL	00:52:33,151	00:52:36,991	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And had that application denied and he had this denial slip or whatever
EDL	00:52:36,991	00:52:39,295	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Call me like literally had this physical proof
EDL	00:52:40,319	00:52:41,599	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	All of his grievance
EDL	00:52:41,599	00:52:46,463	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And simple technical arbitrary little stupid piece of paper gave him
EDL	00:52:46,463	00:52:49,023	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	What's known as standing to bring the case

EDL	01:00:09,343	01:00:10,111	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Why
EDL	01:00:10,111	01:00:11,903	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Isn't a ban on handguns
EDL	01:00:13,183	01:00:13,951	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Reasonable
EDL	01:00:14,719	01:00:15,487	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Or April
EDL	01:00:15,487	01:00:15,999	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Fortunate
EDL	01:00:17,791	01:00:18,559	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	On behalf
EDL	01:00:21,375	01:00:22,655	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Because you are
EDL	01:00:22,655	01:00:24,703	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The same reason I was offered by
EDL	01:00:24,703	01:00:26,495	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Numerous Military Officers
EDL	01:00:26,495	01:00:27,263	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	At the highest levels
EDL	01:00:27,775	01:00:29,823	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Of the US military all branches
EDL	01:00:29,823	01:00:30,591	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Service
EDL	01:00:30,591	01:00:31,615	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Writing to briefs
EDL	01:00:32,127	01:00:34,687	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	They they agree with us at the handgun ban
EDL	01:00:35,199	01:00:36,991	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Search the week in America's military
EDL	01:00:36,991	01:00:39,295	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Preparedness because basically argues
EDL	01:00:39,295	01:00:41,087	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	When you take away people's guns
EDL	01:00:41,087	01:00:42,367	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	They're going to be less prepared
EDL	01:00:42,879	01:00:45,183	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	If and when they enlist in the army
EDL	01:00:45,183	01:00:45,951	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	To which Jessie
EDL	01:00:45,951	01:00:46,463	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Spires like
EDL	01:00:46,975	01:00:49,279	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	They can still practice shooting
EDL	01:00:49,279	01:00:51,583	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Rifles banned in DC
EDL	01:00:51,583	01:00:53,631	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	They can go to gun ranges I guess in neighboring
EDL	01:00:55,679	01:00:59,007	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	What does that make it unreasonable for a city
EDL	01:01:00,287	01:01:01,823	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	With a very high crime rate
EDL	01:01:03,103	01:01:04,127	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Assuming
EDL	01:01:04,127	01:01:08,223	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Objective is what the military people say to keep us ready for the draft
EDL	01:01:08,223	01:01:08,735	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	If necessary
EDL	01:01:09,503	01:01:10,783	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Is it unreasonable
EDL	01:01:10,783	01:01:12,575	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	People first city without high crime rate
EDL	01:01:13,599	01:01:14,879	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Just say no
EDL	01:01:14,879	01:01:15,391	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Handgun
EDL	01:01:15,903	01:01:16,415	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Here
EDL	01:01:19,743	01:01:23,071	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Well you want to say yes that is correct but I want to hear what
EDL	01:01:24,607	01:01:27,423	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Because it is a big crime problem I'm simply getting you to focus
EDL	01:01:28,191	01:01:31,775	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Stop by the way it was Justice Scalia telling Alan gura
EDL	01:01:31,775	01:01:33,823	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	How to answer just as Breyers
EDL	01:01:33,823	01:01:35,359	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Question
EDL	01:01:35,359	01:01:35,871	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Is Justice Scalia
EDL	01:01:37,663	01:01:41,247	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And actually feels any standard of review that might be offered under Section
EDL	01:01:41,247	01:01:41,759	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Construction
EDL	01:01:45,343	01:01:48,415	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The oral arguments last 97 minutes
EDL	01:01:48,927	01:01:53,023	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Far longer than most other cases and going into the arguments many
EDL	01:01:53,023	01:01:54,303	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Supreme Court Watchers
EDL	01:01:54,303	01:01:57,119	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Figured the case would be a close 5-4 decision
EDL	01:01:57,631	01:01:58,911	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And it could go either way
EDL	01:01:59,679	01:02:00,703	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And as with
EDL	01:02:00,703	01:02:02,751	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	All of these clothes cases
EDL	01:02:02,751	01:02:05,311	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Question was what would Anthony Kennedy the swing just
EDL	01:02:05,823	01:02:06,335	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Do
EDL	01:02:07,359	01:02:09,407	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	As in so many issues in America
EDL	01:02:09,919	01:02:12,223	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Comes down to what does Anthony Kennedy believe
EDL	01:02:14,015	01:02:18,623	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	So at the oral argument and I had the Good Fortune to be at the oral argument in the Heller case
EDL	01:02:19,135	01:02:20,927	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Everyone was looking
EDL	01:02:20,927	01:02:23,487	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Here what would he say about the Second Amendment
EDL	01:02:23,487	01:02:24,767	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	His was really devoted
EDL	01:02:24,767	01:02:27,327	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Accountant and the very first comment he made
EDL	01:02:30,399	01:02:31,679	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	They are concerned
EDL	01:02:34,239	01:02:37,055	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Himself and his family against hostile Indian tribes
EDL	01:02:38,335	01:02:40,127	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Wolves bears and grizzly something like that
EDL	01:02:41,407	01:02:44,223	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	One of the first things he said was about bears
EDL	01:02:44,735	01:02:46,783	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Like not bear arms but
EDL	01:02:46,783	01:02:47,295	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Grizzly bear
EDL	01:02:48,831	01:02:50,623	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The point County was trying to make with clear
EDL	01:02:51,903	01:02:55,743	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Don't you think the framers had other reasons that they wanted people to have guns
EDL	01:02:56,255	01:02:57,791	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Other than just being in a militia
EDL	01:02:58,559	01:03:00,863	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	What about people being in their homes
EDL	01:03:00,863	01:03:02,399	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And is meeting to defend themselves
EDL	01:03:04,191	01:03:09,055	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And that's when I silently screamed at the top of my lungs so nobody could hear me yes
EDL	01:03:09,055	01:03:10,079	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Sweet
EDL	01:03:11,103	01:03:12,127	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	...
EDL	01:03:12,127	01:03:12,639	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Something
EDL	01:03:26,719	01:03:29,023	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	We were turned out to be historic
EDL	01:03:29,023	01:03:35,423	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Supreme Court decision handed down this morning
EDL	01:03:35,423	01:03:36,703	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Columbia versus Heller
EDL	01:03:38,751	01:03:44,383	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	We hold that the second amendment guarantees an individual rights
EDL	01:03:44,895	01:03:49,503	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And that the district's handgun ban as well as its requirement that firearms in the home
EDL	01:03:49,503	01:03:50,527	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Be rendered inoperative
EDL	01:03:51,039	01:03:51,551	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Violate
EDL	01:03:52,319	01:03:53,087	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	It was
EDL	01:03:53,087	01:03:56,159	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	A groundbreaking reading of the Second Amendment
EDL	01:03:59,487	01:04:01,023	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Scalia minimize
EDL	01:04:01,023	01:04:07,423	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Steck was referring to a well regulated militia and put the stress on the second Clause that refer to the right
EDL	01:04:07,423	01:04:09,983	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Right of the people the people will not be deprived of the right
EDL	01:04:10,495	01:04:11,007	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Keep and bear arms
EDL	01:04:11,519	01:04:14,079	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	This was as good as it got for him on the bed
EDL	01:04:14,079	01:04:15,103	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I think so
EDL	01:04:15,871	01:04:17,663	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Rip the militia clause
EDL	01:04:17,663	01:04:19,711	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	December 15 1791
EDL	01:04:19,711	01:04:21,759	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The June 26 2008
EDL	01:04:22,527	01:04:24,063	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	A pretty good run if I'm being honest
EDL	01:04:25,599	01:04:28,415	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	For the first time in the history of these United States
EDL	01:04:29,183	01:04:32,767	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The courts definitively declared that the second amendment gives
EDL	01:04:32,767	01:04:34,047	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Every American
EDL	01:04:34,047	01:04:36,095	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The right to a gun for self-defense
EDL	01:04:36,095	01:04:41,727	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	It was a it was a great day for freedom in America was a great day for the Constitution great day for citizens
EDL	01:04:42,495	01:04:45,055	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The great day for gun owners it was great day for
EDL	01:04:45,055	01:04:46,079	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Fearful people
EDL	01:04:47,615	01:04:48,127	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Of course
EDL	01:04:48,639	01:04:51,455	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Not everyone agreed I mean to me that's a travesty
EDL	01:04:52,991	01:04:54,527	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	This is Jack Rico
EDL	01:04:54,527	01:04:59,903	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Professor of history and political science at Stanford University for the court and
EDL	01:04:59,903	01:05:02,719	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The history is just
EDL	01:05:02,719	01:05:03,487	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Wrong
EDL	01:05:03,487	01:05:07,839	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The Second Amendment is not about individual right argue that we shouldn't even be talking
EDL	01:05:07,839	01:05:08,351	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	About his
EDL	01:05:08,863	01:05:13,215	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Because Rachel Firearms has changed so radically for the 18th century to our own time
EDL	01:05:13,215	01:05:14,239	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And ultimately
EDL	01:05:14,751	01:05:19,871	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And hear your Echo Justice Stevens in his descent
EDL	01:05:19,871	01:05:22,175	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And what political Thicket
EDL	01:05:23,199	01:05:24,735	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	To be honest I mean
EDL	01:05:24,735	01:05:27,295	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I don't really believe in constitutional law anymore
EDL	01:05:28,063	01:05:29,855	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I think I socialize affection
EDL	01:05:30,623	01:05:32,671	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Pianos become so highly politicized
EDL	01:05:33,439	01:05:34,463	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	In so many areas
EDL	01:05:35,231	01:05:36,767	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	I think I socialize
EDL	01:05:36,767	01:05:37,535	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Is bunk
EDL	01:05:37,535	01:05:43,679	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Wow I just destroyed I'm not a lawyer so that I don't have any professional steak and defending the Judiciary
EDL	01:05:46,239	01:05:47,007	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	What
EDL	01:05:47,007	01:05:48,031	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	There's a very
EDL	01:05:48,031	01:05:48,799	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Big
EDL	01:05:48,799	01:05:53,919	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	But he did have a major caveat the next section of our opinion points out that like most rights
EDL	01:05:53,919	01:05:54,943	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The Second Amendment right is
EDL	01:05:55,455	01:05:58,015	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	He said like all right
EDL	01:05:58,015	01:06:03,903	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	It's not absolutely it is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever
EDL	01:06:03,903	01:06:04,671	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	And for whatever
EDL	01:06:04,671	01:06:06,207	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Which is very important
EDL	01:06:06,207	01:06:08,255	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	To keep in mind
EDL	01:06:08,255	01:06:09,023	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Cast doubt
EDL	01:06:11,327	01:06:12,351	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Possession of firearm
EDL	01:06:13,887	01:06:14,655	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	You
EDL	01:06:14,655	01:06:15,423	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Or lost
EDL	01:06:15,423	01:06:16,447	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Forbidding the carrying of
EDL	01:06:16,447	01:06:17,215	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The firearms
EDL	01:06:17,215	01:06:18,239	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Sensitive places touch
EDL	01:06:20,031	01:06:22,591	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	This is another thing that we tend to forget
EDL	01:06:22,591	01:06:25,919	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The decision says every individual has the right to bear arms
EDL	01:06:25,919	01:06:28,735	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	The most interesting lie like the decision also says
EDL	01:06:28,735	01:06:29,503	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Of course
EDL	01:06:29,503	01:06:31,039	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	We need gun control
EDL	01:06:32,063	01:06:33,087	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Edward Heller
EDL	01:06:33,599	01:06:35,135	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Come to represent
EDL	01:06:35,135	01:06:35,647	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Like
EDL	01:06:36,671	01:06:37,439	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	2nd Amendment rights
EDL	01:06:37,951	01:06:39,743	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Are you for or against Hillary
EDL	01:06:39,743	01:06:40,767	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Even though
EDL	01:06:40,767	01:06:41,791	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Being for Heller
EDL	01:06:42,303	01:06:43,583	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Is being for Duncan
EDL	01:06:44,607	01:06:46,143	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Fusing yeah it is
EDL	01:06:47,167	01:06:48,447	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	After all this time
EDL	01:06:48,447	01:06:48,959	| moreperfect091818_thegunshow |	Still just
