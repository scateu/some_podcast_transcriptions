EDL	00:00:33,792	00:00:34,560	| serial-s01-day02 |	In a bunch of ways
EDL	00:00:36,864	00:00:39,936	| serial-s01-day02 |	One of the things I brought up was this whole snow issue
EDL	00:00:40,448	00:00:42,752	| serial-s01-day02 |	Because remember when I
EDL	00:00:42,752	00:00:45,312	| serial-s01-day02 |	Talk to her on the phone that time you know when I
EDL	00:00:45,312	00:00:46,592	| serial-s01-day02 |	Was reporting the store and she called me
EDL	00:00:47,616	00:00:51,456	| serial-s01-day02 |	She said she remembered that day specifically January 13
EDL	00:00:51,456	00:00:57,856	| serial-s01-day02 |	1999 the day he goes missing the day he goes missing she remembered seeing and not in the library and she said to me be
EDL	00:00:57,856	00:01:02,208	| serial-s01-day02 |	Because of the snow remember that yeah yeah right yeah she was like I remember cuz it was this
EDL	00:01:02,720	00:01:05,280	| serial-s01-day02 |	The first snow of the year and there was all the snow
EDL	00:01:05,792	00:01:06,304	| serial-s01-day02 |	And
EDL	00:01:07,072	00:01:08,608	| serial-s01-day02 |	The state today
EDL	00:01:08,608	00:01:09,888	| serial-s01-day02 |	The prosecutor
EDL	00:01:10,656	00:01:11,168	| serial-s01-day02 |	Chi
EDL	00:01:11,936	00:01:12,960	| serial-s01-day02 |	Was like
EDL	00:01:12,960	00:01:19,360	| serial-s01-day02 |	Are you sure you have the right day because there wasn't snow that day was there like he should have reference what she had said
EDL	00:01:19,360	00:01:19,872	| serial-s01-day02 |	Said to me
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:21,920	| serial-s01-day02 |	And that was
EDL	00:01:21,920	00:01:26,016	| serial-s01-day02 |	That was something we had a question about 2 cuz she was very clear with you she got
EDL	00:01:26,016	00:01:28,064	| serial-s01-day02 |	Snowed in at her boyfriend's house
EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:30,624	| serial-s01-day02 |	And then the next two days were snow days
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:32,928	| serial-s01-day02 |	So she's very clear that she ties his memory
EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:33,440	| serial-s01-day02 |	I2
EDL	00:01:33,952	00:01:34,976	| serial-s01-day02 |	To the snow right
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:36,512	| serial-s01-day02 |	Oh yeah yeah
EDL	00:01:36,512	00:01:38,560	| serial-s01-day02 |	Shireen wondered about that
EDL	00:01:38,560	00:01:41,376	| serial-s01-day02 |	Yeah because we looked up the weather right and it hadn't snow
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:45,216	| serial-s01-day02 |	It hasn't snowed there was a horrible ice storm that had started
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:50,848	| serial-s01-day02 |	Like in the wee hours of the next morning but there wasn't snow it was it was it was terrible weather and it was like a
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:52,384	| serial-s01-day02 |	Big emergency in Baltimore
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:54,432	| serial-s01-day02 |	But it was an ice storm
EDL	00:01:55,200	00:01:57,504	| serial-s01-day02 |	And so she kind of
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:58,272	| serial-s01-day02 |	I mean
EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:00,832	| serial-s01-day02 |	Cheat
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:03,392	| serial-s01-day02 |	She did a fairly good job with it I mean she just said like
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:09,280	| serial-s01-day02 |	Yeah I don't know I know it was bad weather I'm not sure if it was snow or ice or whatever I just remember it was like
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:10,816	| serial-s01-day02 |	Hazardous bad weather
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:14,400	| serial-s01-day02 |	School was canceled after after that Jews like and I remember
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:20,800	| serial-s01-day02 |	I was happy about it because I had used the excuse of bad weather as a reason to stay later
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:22,080	| serial-s01-day02 |	At my boyfriend Derek's house
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:23,872	| serial-s01-day02 |	And my mom bought it
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:28,224	| serial-s01-day02 |	And then she was like and I remember it because I stayed out later I was happy that
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:28,736	| serial-s01-day02 |	Dance school is can
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:30,272	| serial-s01-day02 |	Today's
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:32,064	| serial-s01-day02 |	So it sounded pretty specific
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:34,880	| serial-s01-day02 |	.
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:39,488	| serial-s01-day02 |	I don't know but I have to say she was very cool and collected about it it wasn't
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:45,632	| serial-s01-day02 |	She didn't seem frazzled or freaked out or she was just like I don't know about it was snow ice I don't know it was bad weather huh
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:52,544	| serial-s01-day02 |	Yeah she seemed totally she seemed completely confident in her memories even when I was thinking like
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:54,592	| serial-s01-day02 |	But even when I was thinking like
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:55,616	| serial-s01-day02 |	Wait a minute
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:03:00,480	| serial-s01-day02 |	What happened
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:03,808	| serial-s01-day02 |	Yeah well so the other the main thing
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:10,720	| serial-s01-day02 |	That happened that least was new to me as a theory about Asia's alibi
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:15,840	| serial-s01-day02 |	And that made me think like wait a minute let me rethink this and in fact I
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:18,144	| serial-s01-day02 |	Asked you guys to go scrambling back to the records
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:21,472	| serial-s01-day02 |	That we have our detectives heldens this is the stuff
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:23,008	| serial-s01-day02 |	Yes that you want stuff
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:27,872	| serial-s01-day02 |	Because the prosecutor of Inuyasha went after her
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:29,920	| serial-s01-day02 |	For a long time about the second
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:30,688	| serial-s01-day02 |	Letter
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:33,504	| serial-s01-day02 |	That she wrote to Adnan right after he got so wasted
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:37,600	| serial-s01-day02 |	So we should just take a step back and explain what these letters are they that your
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:38,880	| serial-s01-day02 |	Talking about so the
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:43,232	| serial-s01-day02 |	So Asian Road Adnan to letter she wrote in the first letter
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:47,584	| serial-s01-day02 |	The day after he was arrested I think March 1st 1999
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:49,632	| serial-s01-day02 |	And Analysis
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:52,192	| serial-s01-day02 |	Does handwritten note where she started saying to him
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:54,496	| serial-s01-day02 |	I've just been to your house I'm at your parents
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:56,544	| serial-s01-day02 |	And I want to tell you that
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:04:00,640	| serial-s01-day02 |	I remember talking to you that day January 13th 1999
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:02,176	| serial-s01-day02 |	I remember seeing you in the library
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:09,344	| serial-s01-day02 |	So then the next day she she writes him another letter and this one is a little bit different it's a little bit longer it's
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:10,368	| serial-s01-day02 |	Typed up
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:11,904	| serial-s01-day02 |	She seems to be writing it in
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:13,184	| serial-s01-day02 |	Like from one of her
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:14,720	| serial-s01-day02 |	Classes at school
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:16,768	| serial-s01-day02 |	And in that one
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:22,911	| serial-s01-day02 |	She started reiterate again like I remember seeing you in the library that day so let me know
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:24,191	| serial-s01-day02 |	If you need me to
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:25,215	| serial-s01-day02 |	To speak up about that
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:26,239	| serial-s01-day02 |	All right
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:28,287	| serial-s01-day02 |	So today
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:34,687	| serial-s01-day02 |	The 2nd letter the type one was was the issue today so the state is really pressing her over and
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:35,711	| serial-s01-day02 |	Over to say
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:39,295	| serial-s01-day02 |	Are you sure you really wrote this letter on March 2nd
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:40,575	| serial-s01-day02 |	Because it's dated March
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:46,975	| serial-s01-day02 |	And infected stated on every page letter and at the bottom of each page it says March 2nd
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:49,279	| serial-s01-day02 |	And she keeps saying yes
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:50,303	| serial-s01-day02 |	Yes I am yep
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:55,167	| serial-s01-day02 |	And he's pointing to things in the letter that suggests It Was Written later maybe
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:59,519	| serial-s01-day02 |	That suggests It Was Written later because she's got all of this
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:01,055	| serial-s01-day02 |	Fairly specific
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:04,383	| serial-s01-day02 |	Information about anons case in about the
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:06,687	| serial-s01-day02 |	The crime in the way the crime unfolded
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:08,991	| serial-s01-day02 |	And he's suggesting like
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:10,783	| serial-s01-day02 |	How would you have known all this stuff
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:16,415	| serial-s01-day02 |	What were some of the things the prosecutor was pointing to the letter as like how would you know this or that
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:23,071	| serial-s01-day02 |	There were several things one was she notes that hey was found in a shallow grave
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:26,911	| serial-s01-day02 |	Another was that
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:30,751	| serial-s01-day02 |	She talks about someone else referencing
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:33,567	| serial-s01-day02 |	Fibers from Adnan on his body
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:39,199	| serial-s01-day02 |	So the prosecutor is saying like it's too soon for any of those details to have been out in
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:41,759	| serial-s01-day02 |	Republic 2 days after Adnan has been
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:44,319	| serial-s01-day02 |	Arrest right that what he's going to say
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:46,367	| serial-s01-day02 |	That's what he's
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,647	| serial-s01-day02 |	Suggesting
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:50,719	| serial-s01-day02 |	In fact he's not really correct about that because then
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:52,767	| serial-s01-day02 |	Justin Brown Adnan defense attorney
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:57,631	| serial-s01-day02 |	Stood up after that and showed exhibits of Baltimore Sun stories dated
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:05:59,935	| serial-s01-day02 |	Prior to
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:00,959	| serial-s01-day02 |	Asia's letter
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:03,007	| serial-s01-day02 |	That talk about these
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:04,799	| serial-s01-day02 |	That have these very phrases in them
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:06,847	| serial-s01-day02 |	Shallow Grave
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:08,895	| serial-s01-day02 |	Lincoln Park that you know
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:11,199	| serial-s01-day02 |	So that didn't hold up very well
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:11,967	| serial-s01-day02 |	But
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:12,735	| serial-s01-day02 |	But
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:16,063	| serial-s01-day02 |	There was this one thing that's in this is the thing that I was like
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:19,135	| serial-s01-day02 |	And that is
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:20,415	| serial-s01-day02 |	He's asking her
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:22,719	| serial-s01-day02 |	Did Adnan ever contact
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:23,999	| serial-s01-day02 |	Do you from jail
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:25,023	| serial-s01-day02 |	And she's like no
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:26,815	| serial-s01-day02 |	And he says did he ever
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:28,351	| serial-s01-day02 |	Call you know
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:31,167	| serial-s01-day02 |	Did he you know send you letters she's like nope
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:32,703	| serial-s01-day02 |	And
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:35,263	| serial-s01-day02 |	She says well how do you explain
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:37,823	| serial-s01-day02 |	Explain if Adnan never contacted
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:38,335	| serial-s01-day02 |	Video
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:40,895	| serial-s01-day02 |	How would you explain
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:42,687	| serial-s01-day02 |	Notes from
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:44,991	| serial-s01-day02 |	From a detective interview
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:46,783	| serial-s01-day02 |	With a non-friend
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:48,319	| serial-s01-day02 |	This is a kid named Joanne Gordon
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,879	| serial-s01-day02 |	And in these notes it says
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:52,927	| serial-s01-day02 |	That Juwan
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:54,207	| serial-s01-day02 |	Told the cops
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:54,719	| serial-s01-day02 |	That
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,255	| serial-s01-day02 |	Adnan
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:07:00,607	| serial-s01-day02 |	Written a letter to a girl and ask her to type it up
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:02,399	| serial-s01-day02 |	But you got the address wrong
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:05,471	| serial-s01-day02 |	NM
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:11,615	| serial-s01-day02 |	What does that mean like what does that say what does that imply I think he was trying to imply
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:12,127	| serial-s01-day02 |	That
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:15,199	| serial-s01-day02 |	Adnan hat had contact
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:17,503	| serial-s01-day02 |	Packard Asia and had asked her to
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:18,783	| serial-s01-day02 |	Type up this letter
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:19,551	| serial-s01-day02 |	In this way
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:21,343	| serial-s01-day02 |	This March 2nd letter
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:23,135	| serial-s01-day02 |	But he's implying
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:25,695	| serial-s01-day02 |	It wasn't actually written March 2nd
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:26,719	| serial-s01-day02 |	And it was written
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:27,999	| serial-s01-day02 |	Perhaps Weeks Later
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:33,887	| serial-s01-day02 |	That maybe he engineered that in that may be a nun asked her to write this
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:35,423	| serial-s01-day02 |	Type to type up this letter
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:37,471	| serial-s01-day02 |	Ha
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:38,495	| serial-s01-day02 |	Yeah
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:44,127	| serial-s01-day02 |	And I was able what does that mean does that mean she doesn't remember what she thinks she remembers or does that mean she's
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,407	| serial-s01-day02 |	Lying
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:48,223	| serial-s01-day02 |	Or whatever and Anand idrees
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:49,503	| serial-s01-day02 |	Did contact her and
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:51,551	| serial-s01-day02 |	What does that mean you know
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:52,575	| serial-s01-day02 |	And so
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:56,159	| serial-s01-day02 |	You know it started it starts to make her
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:58,207	| serial-s01-day02 |	Very pure story about being
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:07:59,999	| serial-s01-day02 |	Just
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:04,351	| serial-s01-day02 |	Potential Alibi who wanted to step forward and do the right thing to like look like some
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,375	| serial-s01-day02 |	Something slightly different
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:07,935	| serial-s01-day02 |	And so that's why I
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:10,239	| serial-s01-day02 |	Who asked you guys to look up
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:13,567	| serial-s01-day02 |	Notes from that detective interview with Juwan
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:15,103	| serial-s01-day02 |	Okay so
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,943	| serial-s01-day02 |	So I'm looking at the detective notes
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:24,063	| serial-s01-day02 |	From their interview with Chauhan on April 9th and they didn't record that
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:26,879	| serial-s01-day02 |	Interview so I've always got to these kind of like
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:27,647	| serial-s01-day02 |	Cryptic
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:28,415	| serial-s01-day02 |	Detective notes
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:32,511	| serial-s01-day02 |	I'll just read those to you and this is what they say I think this is what the pro
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:33,023	| serial-s01-day02 |	Prosecutor is
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:34,047	| serial-s01-day02 |	Referencing
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:36,095	| serial-s01-day02 |	It says
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:38,399	| serial-s01-day02 |	Adnan wrote me a letter
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:40,959	| serial-s01-day02 |	And remember at this time and on his in jail
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:45,311	| serial-s01-day02 |	So not wrote me a letter he called yesterday but I wasn't home
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:46,591	| serial-s01-day02 |	Rodenbach
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:48,895	| serial-s01-day02 |	He wrote a letter to a girl to
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:50,431	| serial-s01-day02 |	To type up with his address on it
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:51,967	| serial-s01-day02 |	She got it wrong
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:53,503	| serial-s01-day02 |	And then there's an address
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:56,063	| serial-s01-day02 |	101 East Eager Street
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:58,367	| serial-s01-day02 |	Which is the incorrect address for central booking
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:00,927	| serial-s01-day02 |	And then it says Asia
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:01,695	| serial-s01-day02 |	What's a?
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:02,975	| serial-s01-day02 |	12th grade
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:04,767	| serial-s01-day02 |	I got one just an address
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:07,327	| serial-s01-day02 |	And just an adder
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:09,631	| serial-s01-day02 |	I was a friend of Adnan zand
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:13,471	| serial-s01-day02 |	But
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:17,055	| serial-s01-day02 |	I'm just saying like those are pretty cryptic and I can also see that
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,335	| serial-s01-day02 |	Note
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:20,127	| serial-s01-day02 |	As implying that
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:24,991	| serial-s01-day02 |	Adnan ridha letter to girl and ask her could you please
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:27,039	| serial-s01-day02 |	Give my friends the address
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:29,855	| serial-s01-day02 |	So that they can write me letters
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:31,391	| serial-s01-day02 |	And that's all it mean
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:34,975	| serial-s01-day02 |	That's true that's true I mean
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:38,047	| serial-s01-day02 |	Right and then she did it wrong and it's
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:43,167	| serial-s01-day02 |	Like I can just imagine how this could play out in a totally innocent different way from what the prosecutor seems
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:43,679	| serial-s01-day02 |	To be suggesting
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:45,471	| serial-s01-day02 |	The one that stops me is
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:47,007	| serial-s01-day02 |	He wrote a letter to a girl
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:48,031	| serial-s01-day02 |	To type up
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:49,823	| serial-s01-day02 |	And I don't know
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:52,127	| serial-s01-day02 |	It's true it's not clear
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:53,919	| serial-s01-day02 |	It's not clear what this totally means
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:54,943	| serial-s01-day02 |	But
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:56,991	| serial-s01-day02 |	Here's the thing
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:10:00,575	| serial-s01-day02 |	It raises it does make you pause right
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:03,391	| serial-s01-day02 |	And that's his entire Point that's
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:05,439	| serial-s01-day02 |	That's the prosecutors entire point
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:09,535	| serial-s01-day02 |	Is that I can throw a bunch of Suspicion on Asia story
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:10,815	| serial-s01-day02 |	And all of these various ways
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:14,399	| serial-s01-day02 |	And if I can do it here before you today in this hearing
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:15,167	| serial-s01-day02 |	That means
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:18,495	| serial-s01-day02 |	The prosecutor's baky did nuns criminal trial back in
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:22,335	| serial-s01-day02 |	1999-2000 could have done the same
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:22,847	| serial-s01-day02 |	Same thing
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,895	| serial-s01-day02 |	To the state of showing
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:31,039	| serial-s01-day02 |	Look maybe she's not such an ironclad Alibi after all and if she's not such an ironclad alibi
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:32,575	| serial-s01-day02 |	Then maybe
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:35,135	| serial-s01-day02 |	Christina Gutierrez did have a very good reason
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:36,159	| serial-s01-day02 |	For not pursuing her
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:38,719	| serial-s01-day02 |	It wasn't a mistake it was a strategy
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:40,767	| serial-s01-day02 |	That's what he's trying to show
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:43,327	| serial-s01-day02 |	So what did you think did you buy that
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:46,655	| serial-s01-day02 |	Can I buy it
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:47,167	| serial-s01-day02 |	I mean
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:48,959	| serial-s01-day02 |	I would say
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:56,639	| serial-s01-day02 |	I don't think he liked proved that she didn't write the letter on March 2nd or anything like that and she seems very comfort
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:57,407	| serial-s01-day02 |	People just saying
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:11:00,223	| serial-s01-day02 |	I don't know what you want those notes about Juwan mean
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:02,271	| serial-s01-day02 |	But I wrote this letter March 2nd I never heard
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:03,295	| serial-s01-day02 |	Like she was
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:04,831	| serial-s01-day02 |	She just was right
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:05,855	| serial-s01-day02 |	Forthright about it
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:08,927	| serial-s01-day02 |	Or seemed very forthright about it I should say
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:09,951	| serial-s01-day02 |	And
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:11,743	| serial-s01-day02 |	But it did
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:14,559	| serial-s01-day02 |	You know it did make me think like
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:15,583	| serial-s01-day02 |	Well
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:17,631	| serial-s01-day02 |	It does make you wonder what
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:19,935	| serial-s01-day02 |	Could have happened a trial and whether it would have been
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:21,215	| serial-s01-day02 |	Slam dunk for a nun
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:25,567	| serial-s01-day02 |	Okay so can we talk about
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:27,359	| serial-s01-day02 |	The main event of the day which is
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:29,919	| serial-s01-day02 |	The cell phone testimony which I've been waiting patiently to get to
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:36,831	| serial-s01-day02 |	I know I so wish you were there today I was like I was like Dana would be eating this
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:42,719	| serial-s01-day02 |	I was like drooling part way through a minute it's it was hard to get was that exciting
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:49,119	| serial-s01-day02 |	So it's really important is the thing but it's
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:49,887	| serial-s01-day02 |	Just
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:56,287	| serial-s01-day02 |	It's hard to sink your teeth into in terms of emotion you know but it's
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:59,103	| serial-s01-day02 |	No it was I mean yeah it was interesting so basically
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:01,919	| serial-s01-day02 |	Today there was not a big
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:06,015	| serial-s01-day02 |	Bombshell on this issue but I think they're setting the stage for 1
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:10,367	| serial-s01-day02 |	So which turns out that the AT&T cell tower s
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:16,255	| serial-s01-day02 |	Does the AT&T cell tower expert who testified at a nun's original trial in mm
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:18,559	| serial-s01-day02 |	It turns out that
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:20,607	| serial-s01-day02 |	There was this disclaimer
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:21,375	| serial-s01-day02 |	On those records
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:23,935	| serial-s01-day02 |	Anna on a fax cover sheet
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:25,983	| serial-s01-day02 |	For those records back in 1999
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:27,007	| serial-s01-day02 |	That said
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:32,127	| serial-s01-day02 |	You can't use incoming calls they're not reliable for location
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:34,687	| serial-s01-day02 |	Status incoming calls are not reliable Four Loko
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:35,199	| serial-s01-day02 |	Kitchen status
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:36,735	| serial-s01-day02 |	And
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:40,575	| serial-s01-day02 |	Why that's important is because the two phone calls
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:43,135	| serial-s01-day02 |	That place Adnan in leakin park
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:46,975	| serial-s01-day02 |	At the time that Jay said they were burying the body
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:48,767	| serial-s01-day02 |	Are incoming calls
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:50,047	| serial-s01-day02 |	Right
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:50,815	| serial-s01-day02 |	So
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:54,399	| serial-s01-day02 |	What happened was this fall just recently
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:56,191	| serial-s01-day02 |	That same cell tower expert
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:59,519	| serial-s01-day02 |	Wrote an affidavit saying I didn't know about that disk
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:01,311	| serial-s01-day02 |	Disclaimer about not using the ink
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,079	| serial-s01-day02 |	Incoming calls for low
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:02,591	| serial-s01-day02 |	Location
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:05,919	| serial-s01-day02 |	So now he's saying I'm not sure now about
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:06,431	| serial-s01-day02 |	My testimony
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:08,223	| serial-s01-day02 |	I'm not sure I could
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:09,247	| serial-s01-day02 |	Could say that those two
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:10,271	| serial-s01-day02 |	Who calls Play Store
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:10,783	| serial-s01-day02 |	The phone in Lincoln
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:14,879	| serial-s01-day02 |	So that guy did not testify today actually
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:18,463	| serial-s01-day02 |	But the defense team brought in this other expert
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:23,071	| serial-s01-day02 |	Who's who said yes you know that disclaimer was very very important
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:29,215	| serial-s01-day02 |	And they spent a lot of the debt the afternoon arguing that the state and the defense over
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:31,519	| serial-s01-day02 |	Basically the meaning of location
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:32,543	| serial-s01-day02 |	On those cell tower record
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:34,591	| serial-s01-day02 |	How to interpret the word location
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:37,663	| serial-s01-day02 |	I'm really jealous that you get to be there for that tomorrow
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:44,831	| serial-s01-day02 |	No accident because no this is actually really important at this this like cell phone disclaimer thing is is something that
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:47,391	| serial-s01-day02 |	Bug me for really long time
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:51,231	| serial-s01-day02 |	Because it's sort of like it if if that is in fact the case that
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:55,327	| serial-s01-day02 |	You can't use incoming calls for location data
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:57,631	| serial-s01-day02 |	Then that kind of means
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:14:01,471	| serial-s01-day02 |	There's a chance that that cell phone was not in Lincoln Park
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:07,871	| serial-s01-day02 |	When the prosecution at the original trial said it was so it's no it's a real problem for the state yeah it's a real problem
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:11,967	| serial-s01-day02 |	So this might really get answer tomorrow of weather
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:16,063	| serial-s01-day02 |	Whether that's a real thing that you can't use incoming calls
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:16,831	| serial-s01-day02 |	Four location
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:19,135	| serial-s01-day02 |	That would that would
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:20,671	| serial-s01-day02 |	Make me really happy
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:21,695	| serial-s01-day02 |	I think an answer.
