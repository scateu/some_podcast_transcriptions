EDL	00:00:55,296	00:00:55,808	| serial-s01-e09 |	Talk for a while
EDL	00:00:56,320	00:00:59,392	| serial-s01-e09 |	I want to run by you some new information I've learned in the past week
EDL	00:00:59,392	00:01:00,416	| serial-s01-e09 |	Three things I've learned
EDL	00:01:01,184	00:01:01,952	| serial-s01-e09 |	First
EDL	00:01:01,952	00:01:04,768	| serial-s01-e09 |	Remember Laura the former Laura Estrada Sandoval
EDL	00:01:04,768	00:01:08,096	| serial-s01-e09 |	Well then who the f*** did it in the last episode
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:10,400	| serial-s01-e09 |	She was friends with Stephanie and with Jane with an on
EDL	00:01:10,912	00:01:15,264	| serial-s01-e09 |	I was talking to Laura on the phone the other day and she mentioned something about Best Buy
EDL	00:01:15,264	00:01:17,056	| serial-s01-e09 |	So I asked her if I could start taping
EDL	00:01:17,824	00:01:19,872	| serial-s01-e09 |	Tell me tell me again what you just told me
EDL	00:01:20,640	00:01:23,200	| serial-s01-e09 |	There's not there's never any phones at Best Buy
EDL	00:01:23,712	00:01:27,808	| serial-s01-e09 |	There were never any phones around the Best Buy no Payphone oatmeal phone this
EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:29,088	| serial-s01-e09 |	No
EDL	00:01:29,856	00:01:30,624	| serial-s01-e09 |	No
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:31,904	| serial-s01-e09 |	Thanks
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:33,184	| serial-s01-e09 |	Bones bear
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:41,376	| serial-s01-e09 |	The Payphone in question is important because Jay tells the detectives that are non called him on January 13th 1999
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:43,424	| serial-s01-e09 |	And tell Jay he killed Hae
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:45,984	| serial-s01-e09 |	Come and get me I'm at Best Buy
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:50,848	| serial-s01-e09 |	When Jake gets there he says he sees Adnan standing by the phone booth wearing red gloves
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:53,408	| serial-s01-e09 |	Draw the map for the cops
EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:55,200	| serial-s01-e09 |	Showing the location of the phone booth
EDL	00:01:55,200	00:01:59,040	| serial-s01-e09 |	If you're facing the front doors of the store his drawing shows the booth on the left
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:00,064	| serial-s01-e09 |	Outside on the sidewalk
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:02,624	| serial-s01-e09 |	We did a lot of research on this
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:06,976	| serial-s01-e09 |	Where it was whether it was and we could not account for this phone booth
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:09,792	| serial-s01-e09 |	That's because it never was
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:15,168	| serial-s01-e09 |	She said the only conceivable place for a phone at the Best Buy it would have been inside
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:16,192	| serial-s01-e09 |	In the foyer part of the
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:16,960	| serial-s01-e09 |	Play Store
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:18,240	| serial-s01-e09 |	But there was no phone they are either
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:22,848	| serial-s01-e09 |	Laura said she knows this because she's to go to that Best Buy a lot
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:25,664	| serial-s01-e09 |	From the time it open through 98 in 299
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:29,504	| serial-s01-e09 |	With her family and without her family
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:34,624	| serial-s01-e09 |	Yeah I don't know if deal CDs from there all the time so it's pretty aware
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:35,904	| serial-s01-e09 |	Like what was around
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:38,208	| serial-s01-e09 |	Shoplift
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:39,488	| serial-s01-e09 |	CDs
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:47,168	| serial-s01-e09 |	So you're saying you would have noticed
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:47,936	| serial-s01-e09 |	Thing like that
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:51,776	| serial-s01-e09 |	Cuz you were kind of because you're not paying attention
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:58,176	| serial-s01-e09 |	You go in and let you cut her more aware of your surroundings and just walking into the store at the time
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:03:00,992	| serial-s01-e09 |	I remember looking up in the ceiling and see if there was any
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:02,528	| serial-s01-e09 |	Eyes in the sky
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:05,600	| serial-s01-e09 |	Cameras you know and you know there's a whole message
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:08,416	| serial-s01-e09 |	You're very aware
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:10,720	| serial-s01-e09 |	Of like entering and who was like
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:13,536	| serial-s01-e09 |	I was there at the entrance and when you're leaving
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:16,096	| serial-s01-e09 |	You know cuz you already hardened steel in
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:18,912	| serial-s01-e09 |	Man there's a phone bear
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:25,568	| serial-s01-e09 |	Lauren i hypothesized y If there really wasn't a phone booth
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:27,104	| serial-s01-e09 |	When they have noted it
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:29,664	| serial-s01-e09 |	Laura thought maybe it wasn't a big deal to them
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:31,456	| serial-s01-e09 |	It's such a small D2
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:38,368	| serial-s01-e09 |	It's not a small detail
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:40,160	| serial-s01-e09 |	6 Cal comes from is that pay phone at best
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:46,048	| serial-s01-e09 |	Yeah I don't know why they went check it but there's no case on there man
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:48,096	| serial-s01-e09 |	You sure I'm positive
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:04:00,128	| serial-s01-e09 |	Testing one
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:03,200	| serial-s01-e09 |	I learned it also relates to this 236
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:03,968	| serial-s01-e09 |	Call
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:05,248	| serial-s01-e09 |	I talked to a woman named summer
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:07,808	| serial-s01-e09 |	She went to Woodlawn she's been listening to podcast
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:12,416	| serial-s01-e09 |	And she emailed me because when she heard this one part she said she starts shaking her head
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:17,024	| serial-s01-e09 |	She said if the state is saying Haley was dead by 2:36
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:19,071	| serial-s01-e09 |	It's impossible
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:21,119	| serial-s01-e09 |	Is impossible it I mean
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:23,423	| serial-s01-e09 |	Like I mean it's just impossible
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:24,191	| serial-s01-e09 |	It is not
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:27,007	| serial-s01-e09 |	There's no way that
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:29,055	| serial-s01-e09 |	He was at Best Buy 236
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:31,359	| serial-s01-e09 |	Summer was friends with hey
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:34,687	| serial-s01-e09 |	Not close friends but they have class together and they joke around and talked
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:40,831	| serial-s01-e09 |	I had a boyfriend who did Sports at Woodlawn and she wanted an excuse to stay after school to so she can hang around with them
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:46,463	| serial-s01-e09 |	He told her there was an opening for another manager of the boys wrestling team he was already doing that
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:47,487	| serial-s01-e09 |	Summer Joyner
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:52,095	| serial-s01-e09 |	The day he disappeared the wrestling team had a match at Randallstown High School
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:56,191	| serial-s01-e09 |	Summer remembers talking to her after school in the gym area there
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:05:00,031	| serial-s01-e09 |	The wrestlers were Milling around summer Was preparing the equipment they had to load onto the bus
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:03,615	| serial-s01-e09 |	And he came in to say I'm not getting on the bus to the match
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:04,383	| serial-s01-e09 |	But I'll see you there
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:06,687	| serial-s01-e09 |	And that wasn't welcomed used to Summer
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:08,991	| serial-s01-e09 |	She needed her by her side at the match
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:11,295	| serial-s01-e09 |	Because he was more experienced at scoring
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:13,087	| serial-s01-e09 |	Which can be tricky in wrestling if you're new at
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:16,159	| serial-s01-e09 |	You know I was giving her hell because I'm telling her like
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:18,207	| serial-s01-e09 |	I don't know what I'm doing
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:21,023	| serial-s01-e09 |	You know I needed her because you know we had to take points in
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:25,119	| serial-s01-e09 |	Things like that and she's like no no no I just have to go and
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:26,655	| serial-s01-e09 |	You know pick my little cousin up
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:29,471	| serial-s01-e09 |	Summer says it wasn't a quick conversation either
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:34,847	| serial-s01-e09 |	You know we used to tease each other cuz she really was hilarious so we would tease each other and you know go back and forth and
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:37,407	| serial-s01-e09 |	We were at least talking for lease
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:38,175	| serial-s01-e09 |	10 minutes
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:42,783	| serial-s01-e09 |	You're sure that this is the day because it's the day she didn't show up
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:44,831	| serial-s01-e09 |	I am positive
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:47,135	| serial-s01-e09 |	Very positive
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:50,975	| serial-s01-e09 |	I look for her the whole time at the away game
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:54,303	| serial-s01-e09 |	You know I was really pissed because I thought that she you know stood me up
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:58,911	| serial-s01-e09 |	Rachel Summers she would make her own way to Randallstown high for the match
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:01,471	| serial-s01-e09 |	No one but me probably remembers this now
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:04,543	| serial-s01-e09 |	Inez Butler Hendrix who worked at the school
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:07,615	| serial-s01-e09 |	Said he had told her she was playing to catch the Randallstown bus
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:10,943	| serial-s01-e09 |	However Inez initially told the cops the opposite
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:15,039	| serial-s01-e09 |	So I trust Summers memory more and summer is clear
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:17,087	| serial-s01-e09 |	He told her she was going to drive herself there
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:24,767	| serial-s01-e09 |	Summer said this conversation about hey not getting on the bus happened after the last bell and also after the reggae
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:27,071	| serial-s01-e09 |	Dealer school buses had cleared the loop in front of the school
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:30,399	| serial-s01-e09 |	She said probably around 2:30 to 45
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:33,215	| serial-s01-e09 |	Summer says she has no dog in this fight
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:35,519	| serial-s01-e09 |	She's got no opinions on an unskilled or innocent
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:37,567	| serial-s01-e09 |	She just knows what she knows
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:41,919	| serial-s01-e09 |	All of the things that I'm you know unclear about or kind of shaky about or
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:42,687	| serial-s01-e09 |	I am
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:43,455	| serial-s01-e09 |	Clear
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:43,967	| serial-s01-e09 |	On that
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:48,319	| serial-s01-e09 |	236 would not have been possible for her to even
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:49,343	| serial-s01-e09 |	Have met him
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:53,951	| serial-s01-e09 |	Whatever because I know for a fact she was probably with me during that time
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:55,743	| serial-s01-e09 |	4 at the school during that time
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:09,311	| serial-s01-e09 |	Talk to the detectives there's no mention of her in their notes which is not the only person who said they saw her after school that day
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:13,919	| serial-s01-e09 |	Becky Star right after school Debbie Warren said she talked to hey to
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:18,527	| serial-s01-e09 |	Voice note say she saw her at approximately 3 p.m. inside the school near the gym
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:20,319	| serial-s01-e09 |	Which would match Summers memory
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:22,623	| serial-s01-e09 |	So
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:24,671	| serial-s01-e09 |	Laura says no phone booth at Best Buy
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:28,511	| serial-s01-e09 |	Summer says no way no how he was at Best Buy at 2:36
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:35,679	| serial-s01-e09 |	A mind that if you want withhold information from Asia McClain who says she saw Adnan around 2:30 to 45
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:36,959	| serial-s01-e09 |	Live at the Woodland Public Library
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:44,127	| serial-s01-e09 |	Can we all agree that whatever happened to hey probably didn't involve a 2:36 p.m. call from that phone booth saying come and
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:45,151	| serial-s01-e09 |	Get me I'm at Best Buy
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:49,759	| serial-s01-e09 |	I don't know about you but I'm done considering that it's true this 236 thing
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,831	| serial-s01-e09 |	If you want to speculate with me here for
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:53,599	| serial-s01-e09 |	4 seconds
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:56,671	| serial-s01-e09 |	If we suspect there wasn't a phone booth at Best Buy
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:58,975	| serial-s01-e09 |	That means the crime maybe didn't happen there
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:04,095	| serial-s01-e09 |	Jay's friend Chris said he heard the crime happened in the parking lot of the Woodlawn Public Library
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:09,983	| serial-s01-e09 |	But I got to say if you think the Best Buy is too public a place to commit a murder you should see the library after school
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:10,751	| serial-s01-e09 |	Swarming with kids
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:15,359	| serial-s01-e09 |	And if the she said come and get me call wasn't at 2:36
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:17,663	| serial-s01-e09 |	Maybe it's the next incoming call on the log
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:18,943	| serial-s01-e09 |	At 3:15 call
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:22,271	| serial-s01-e09 |	After all no one actually testifies to the 236
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:23,295	| serial-s01-e09 |	Six timing a trial
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:25,599	| serial-s01-e09 |	This comes from the prosecutor's narrative alone
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:27,647	| serial-s01-e09 |	The problem is
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:31,743	| serial-s01-e09 |	Is the 315 call that really messes with Jays testimony
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:34,303	| serial-s01-e09 |	About where they were and what they were doing that afternoon
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:43,519	| serial-s01-e09 |	Now information
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:48,383	| serial-s01-e09 |	It's about what happened at not her real name Kathy's apartment that evening of January 13th
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:53,503	| serial-s01-e09 |	Kathy remember Dan on getting a call and reacting in an agitated way
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:54,527	| serial-s01-e09 |	Saying things like
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:56,575	| serial-s01-e09 |	What am I going to do what am I going to
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:58,111	| serial-s01-e09 |	Say they're going to come talk to me
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,903	| serial-s01-e09 |	And what am I supposed to say
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:04,255	| serial-s01-e09 |	Kathy testified a trial. This call was acting panicked
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:10,399	| serial-s01-e09 |	I think it's possible that call Kathy overheard would not from a mystery Third Man or co-conspirator
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:11,935	| serial-s01-e09 |	But from wait for it
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:14,495	| serial-s01-e09 |	He's good friend Aisha Pittman
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:17,055	| serial-s01-e09 |	Interview for a sec
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:19,615	| serial-s01-e09 |	His brother called the cops that afternoon
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:22,431	| serial-s01-e09 |	Officer Scott Adcock arise from the Baltimore County PD
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:26,015	| serial-s01-e09 |	His initial report record the time as 5:12 p.m.
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:30,367	| serial-s01-e09 |	I cop calls Aisha and Adnan asking if they seen hey
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:32,159	| serial-s01-e09 |	Here's what's new
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:35,743	| serial-s01-e09 |	I got an email recently from another friend and that Woodland magnet group
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:36,767	| serial-s01-e09 |	Krista
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:39,327	| serial-s01-e09 |	Then she talked to Aisha that evening of the 13th
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:45,983	| serial-s01-e09 |	It was around 6 p.m. that night that I talk to Aisha and she was calling around to see if anyone had heard from her
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:47,775	| serial-s01-e09 |	Curb meaning hey
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:54,175	| serial-s01-e09 |	So I checked with Aisha and she does remember speaking to a non
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:54,943	| serial-s01-e09 |	Here's what she wrote To Me
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:59,551	| serial-s01-e09 |	I do remember speaking with an on that evening but I thought he called me
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:04,927	| serial-s01-e09 |	From what I recall it was a super short conversation and he was annoyed that I told the police to check in with him
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:07,999	| serial-s01-e09 |	I thought I spoke to him after the police called him
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:13,887	| serial-s01-e09 |	She said it's possible her memory of who called him could be mistaken maybe she did call
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:17,727	| serial-s01-e09 |	There's definitely no outgoing call to Aisha on an on cell that day
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:20,031	| serial-s01-e09 |	Maybe it was before he'd spoken to the
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:21,055	| serial-s01-e09 |	The cops not after
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:23,103	| serial-s01-e09 |	She can't be sure but that's what she remembers
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:27,199	| serial-s01-e09 |	Again you've heard this information before but I'm going to review it now
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:32,575	| serial-s01-e09 |	There are three calls on the call log around this time that all ping towers near Kathy's apartment
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:34,879	| serial-s01-e09 |	607 609 and 624
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:38,207	| serial-s01-e09 |	The first few calls are for a little less than a minute
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:39,743	| serial-s01-e09 |	The third call is the longest
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:40,511	| serial-s01-e09 |	4 minutes
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,023	| serial-s01-e09 |	15 seconds
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:43,071	| serial-s01-e09 |	That was likely officer Adcock
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:48,703	| serial-s01-e09 |	You should call at 6:09 says I just talked to the police
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:49,983	| serial-s01-e09 |	I'm not going to get in touch with you too
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:52,543	| serial-s01-e09 |	Aisha says Adnan was annoyed
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:54,335	| serial-s01-e09 |	Maybe that's what Kathy interpreted
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:54,847	| serial-s01-e09 |	Hispanic
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:57,663	| serial-s01-e09 |	I think we can all stipulate that Adnan was super stoned
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:59,967	| serial-s01-e09 |	He told me he had weed in the car
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:02,271	| serial-s01-e09 |	I was worried the cops are going to find it if they came to talk to him
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:08,159	| serial-s01-e09 |	Searching for a second and says something like
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:12,255	| serial-s01-e09 |	What am I going to do what am I going to say they're going to come talk to me
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:13,535	| serial-s01-e09 |	And what am I supposed to say
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:16,863	| serial-s01-e09 |	Obviously I can't say for sure this is what happened
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:20,191	| serial-s01-e09 |	But if that's strange call Kathy remember it was actually Aisha
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:24,287	| serial-s01-e09 |	Well then for me that rearranges all the pixels and Kathy's memory
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:26,591	| serial-s01-e09 |	From suspicious to inocuos
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:27,615	| serial-s01-e09 |	If it's true
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:40,671	| serial-s01-e09 |	Okay we're caught up let's go back to our regularly scheduled program
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:43,231	| serial-s01-e09 |	Second trial
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:45,279	| serial-s01-e09 |	Are you prepared to make your election
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:49,631	| serial-s01-e09 |	Testify if you remain silent
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:53,471	| serial-s01-e09 |	Remain silent
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:56,543	| serial-s01-e09 |	What's a non not testifying
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:12:00,127	| serial-s01-e09 |	But his attorney advised against it
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:01,407	| serial-s01-e09 |	Not uncommon
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:04,479	| serial-s01-e09 |	It's a huge risk to open your client after cross-examination and impeachment
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:06,783	| serial-s01-e09 |	So there he was mute
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:08,063	| serial-s01-e09 |	True to trials
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,599	| serial-s01-e09 |	About 5 weeks total
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:11,647	| serial-s01-e09 |	Which is really hard for anyone
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:23,167	| serial-s01-e09 |	More so sitting there for so long for so many days and weeks
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:25,215	| serial-s01-e09 |	You sitting there looking at me
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:42,367	| serial-s01-e09 |	I never sometimes where it was just going to leave what was being said
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:45,439	| serial-s01-e09 |	I was just literally just scribbling on a piece of paper
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:47,231	| serial-s01-e09 |	Acting like I was taking notes
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:50,047	| serial-s01-e09 |	I didn't know what else to do and it was going off so long
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:51,839	| serial-s01-e09 |	This is so frustrating
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:56,191	| serial-s01-e09 |	Cuz you want to keep interrupting to say hold him but that's not true that's not the reason why I got a phone
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:58,751	| serial-s01-e09 |	Make a phone call if that's not you know
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:00,287	| serial-s01-e09 |	Me telling my parents I'm going to
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:06,943	| serial-s01-e09 |	Somewhere but I'm going to the club that doesn't mean that you know
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:09,247	| serial-s01-e09 |	You never get a chance
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:11,551	| serial-s01-e09 |	You never get a chance to say anything
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:13,599	| serial-s01-e09 |	What is the most frustrating thing in the world
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:16,927	| serial-s01-e09 |	I want to let a non talk now
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:19,743	| serial-s01-e09 |	Not so much about what happened the day of the crime
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:21,279	| serial-s01-e09 |	I feel like we've been over that already
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:24,607	| serial-s01-e09 |	But just about what it was like to be him throughout this case
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:27,167	| serial-s01-e09 |	What it's like now to be locked up for so long
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:31,007	| serial-s01-e09 |	10th 1999
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:32,799	| serial-s01-e09 |	Are you sure I'd broken the terrible news
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:34,591	| serial-s01-e09 |	Krista about his body being found
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:38,175	| serial-s01-e09 |	Krista Dan call Dan on who ran over twice schs
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:39,711	| serial-s01-e09 |	To the very close to a non
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:41,247	| serial-s01-e09 |	And then Krista joint in there
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:42,527	| serial-s01-e09 |	Stephanie came over to
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:45,599	| serial-s01-e09 |	They all sat there at Alicia's kitchen table
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:46,111	| serial-s01-e09 |	Crying
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:53,023	| serial-s01-e09 |	No wait
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:56,607	| serial-s01-e09 |	You know did I not I'm pretty sure they didn't even imagine that you know that
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:59,679	| serial-s01-e09 |	Turn up
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:04,543	| serial-s01-e09 |	I never ever consider that
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:08,127	| serial-s01-e09 |	Something bad happened
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:10,175	| serial-s01-e09 |	Explanation
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:11,455	| serial-s01-e09 |	Somewhere
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:13,503	| serial-s01-e09 |	Father California
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:15,295	| serial-s01-e09 |	With her new boyfriend
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:20,415	| serial-s01-e09 |	Lots of people told the cops and also told me
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:23,487	| serial-s01-e09 |	Turn on appear to be in denial when they are first heard what happened
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:26,047	| serial-s01-e09 |	But he said things like it's not her
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:28,863	| serial-s01-e09 |	They got the wrong person all Asian women look alike
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:31,167	| serial-s01-e09 |	Arrested
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:34,751	| serial-s01-e09 |	Krista Rotana chronology of everything she remembered from the previous
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:35,263	| serial-s01-e09 |	6 weeks
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:37,567	| serial-s01-e09 |	Here's what she wrote about that night at Aisha
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:43,967	| serial-s01-e09 |	We went inside and Adnan was sitting at the kitchen table crying after while he said that there had to be a mistake
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:47,551	| serial-s01-e09 |	And then he was still alive because her name was written in ayesha's agenda book
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:52,927	| serial-s01-e09 |	He wanted to call the detective O'Shea but when he called the precinct he wasn't there
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:59,327	| serial-s01-e09 |	Alarm was upset so I took the phone and talk to the woman and explain that we just wanted to get some information and she's
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:01,631	| serial-s01-e09 |	He said we would have to wait and call homicide in the morning
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:04,703	| serial-s01-e09 |	Keanu on call detective O'Shea
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:07,519	| serial-s01-e09 |	The the night that
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:09,055	| serial-s01-e09 |	We found out that she had been murdered
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:11,615	| serial-s01-e09 |	That's right
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:15,711	| serial-s01-e09 |	Adam called the Baltimore County Police Department to talk to detective O'Shea
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:19,039	| serial-s01-e09 |	You tell him they miss identify this girl whoever she was
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:21,343	| serial-s01-e09 |	Has always stayed with me
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:24,159	| serial-s01-e09 |	Is that something a distraught teenager would do
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:25,695	| serial-s01-e09 |	Or is that something a killer would do
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:30,047	| serial-s01-e09 |	The next day we went to school and it was you.
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:31,583	| serial-s01-e09 |	And
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:35,167	| serial-s01-e09 |	Coming up to me
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:36,191	| serial-s01-e09 |	Hugging me
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:39,775	| serial-s01-e09 |	So much so many people are you okay
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:41,311	| serial-s01-e09 |	What happened
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:45,919	| serial-s01-e09 |	It was just too much
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:56,415	| serial-s01-e09 |	So many people.
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:57,951	| serial-s01-e09 |	Talked about an honest reaction to his death
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:15:59,743	| serial-s01-e09 |	But he was blank
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:01,535	| serial-s01-e09 |	Orca eating waves
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:02,559	| serial-s01-e09 |	Or not at all
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:06,399	| serial-s01-e09 |	Or that he seemed normal

EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:22,432	| serial-s01-e09 |	Try to make the best of
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:22,944	| serial-s01-e09 |	The bad situation
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:25,760	| serial-s01-e09 |	Here's the guy she knew
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:27,808	| serial-s01-e09 |	June 2nd 1999
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:31,648	| serial-s01-e09 |	Did you get that really expensive prom dress you wanted and who'd you go with
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:32,928	| serial-s01-e09 |	If you don't mind me asking
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:33,696	| serial-s01-e09 |	:-)
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:36,512	| serial-s01-e09 |	Things are going with Andy
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:37,792	| serial-s01-e09 |	They've been having problems
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:39,328	| serial-s01-e09 |	He tells her stories about jail
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:40,352	| serial-s01-e09 |	June 8th
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:43,424	| serial-s01-e09 |	You should send me some pictures were allowed to get them
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:45,984	| serial-s01-e09 |	Some guys in here get some really dirty pictures
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:53,152	| serial-s01-e09 |	Do you like this I've seen more that I'd wanted to have a lot of people's wives or girlfriends the last a lifetime
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:58,528	| serial-s01-e09 |	I'm almost guys are really protective of their pictures someone's always pulling me aside to show me their latest
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:25:59,296	| serial-s01-e09 |	Flick
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:00,320	| serial-s01-e09 |	It's really kind of disgust
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:06,720	| serial-s01-e09 |	Has gotten letters from other kids from school Justin Asia Aaron
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:09,280	| serial-s01-e09 |	That's all he says about Asia by the way
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:11,584	| serial-s01-e09 |	He doesn't seem to attach any importance to her letters
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:13,120	| serial-s01-e09 |	Or note that she's a potential alibi
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:16,192	| serial-s01-e09 |	Because he doesn't know the state's timeline for the murder yet
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:21,056	| serial-s01-e09 |	With the juvenile population when he was first arrested in February
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:23,360	| serial-s01-e09 |	It makes you turn 18
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:24,896	| serial-s01-e09 |	And I moved over to be with the adults
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:28,736	| serial-s01-e09 |	I'd assume that would be awful in Myriad ways
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:30,528	| serial-s01-e09 |	Button on right sister Krista
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:34,368	| serial-s01-e09 |	It's weird when I first came here I didn't know what the heck was going on
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:36,160	| serial-s01-e09 |	Let me tell you it was pretty bad
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:39,232	| serial-s01-e09 |	Physically like no one was trying to beat me up
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:41,792	| serial-s01-e09 |	People didn't know what to think of me
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:46,400	| serial-s01-e09 |	I mean first of all everyone in here is black and always threatening to beat the hell out of someone else
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:48,960	| serial-s01-e09 |	Then you have me light-skinned and quiet
EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:51,520	| serial-s01-e09 |	I didn't say much to anyone no one said much to me
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:55,872	| serial-s01-e09 |	4 months later I can be anywhere in the entire jail
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:57,664	| serial-s01-e09 |	Seminole call Syed
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:27:01,504	| serial-s01-e09 |	People say what's up to me ask how things are and I don't even know them
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:04,832	| serial-s01-e09 |	The strange thing is so many people come to me saying
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:06,624	| serial-s01-e09 |	If anyone bothers you let me know
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:08,160	| serial-s01-e09 |	But there's no one left to bother me
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:13,024	| serial-s01-e09 |	Some of that is due to the fact that I'm a Muslim to my personality
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:16,096	| serial-s01-e09 |	You know I've been blessed in that I can make friends almost anywhere I go
EDL	00:27:16,608	00:27:18,400	| serial-s01-e09 |	Now I can really say anywhere
EDL	00:27:18,912	00:27:21,472	| serial-s01-e09 |	He tells her he's gotten elected to inmate Council
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:26,592	| serial-s01-e09 |	You can see how it not initially thinks
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:27,872	| serial-s01-e09 |	This is all temporary
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:30,432	| serial-s01-e09 |	I'll be out by graduation Maybe by Summer
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:31,712	| serial-s01-e09 |	Maybe by whenever
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:34,528	| serial-s01-e09 |	A little more the closer he gets to trial
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:38,368	| serial-s01-e09 |	Crystal would testify for the state a trial
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:43,232	| serial-s01-e09 |	She's the one who talked about hearing him ask a for a ride that afternoon which add-on said he didn't do
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:45,536	| serial-s01-e09 |	But he doesn't hold it against her
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:47,840	| serial-s01-e09 |	He's so sweet to Christen these letters
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:50,144	| serial-s01-e09 |	Ask about the dental work she got done
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:52,704	| serial-s01-e09 |	Our little sister is doing her mother's doing with
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:53,472	| serial-s01-e09 |	Car got fixed
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:57,312	| serial-s01-e09 |	He talks about his feelings they discuss religion and God
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:59,360	| serial-s01-e09 |	Problems Christian parents are divorcing
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:01,664	| serial-s01-e09 |	Intimate friends who trust each other
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:08,064	| serial-s01-e09 |	The most striking letters to me we're the ones he wrote to her immediately before and after his sentencing
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:10,624	| serial-s01-e09 |	He didn't end up facing the death penalty by the way
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:12,416	| serial-s01-e09 |	The first one
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:15,232	| serial-s01-e09 |	He writes it while he's in What's called the bullpen waiting to be sentenced
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:17,792	| serial-s01-e09 |	It's going to cut out from a magazine
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:19,584	| serial-s01-e09 |	Photo of an Asian young woman
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:20,096	| serial-s01-e09 |	Smiling
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:22,144	| serial-s01-e09 |	What's this Crystal
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:24,192	| serial-s01-e09 |	That's actually not
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:25,728	| serial-s01-e09 |	Hey it looks like her
EDL	00:28:26,496	00:28:27,008	| serial-s01-e09 |	So
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:30,080	| serial-s01-e09 |	He found this in a magazine
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:33,664	| serial-s01-e09 |	And said that it does girl look
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:35,968	| serial-s01-e09 |	It's like he found this in a magazine and it looked
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:36,736	| serial-s01-e09 |	So much
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:37,760	| serial-s01-e09 |	Like hey
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:39,808	| serial-s01-e09 |	Yes
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:45,184	| serial-s01-e09 |	Weird
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:46,976	| serial-s01-e09 |	I was looking for this Jet Magazine
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:49,536	| serial-s01-e09 |	In case you didn't know it features African-American issues
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:50,816	| serial-s01-e09 |	:-)
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:51,328	| serial-s01-e09 |	Unquote
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:54,656	| serial-s01-e09 |	He tells Christy that had been appearing in his dreams
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:57,216	| serial-s01-e09 |	The dreams like this have a certain significance in Islam
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:29:03,104	| serial-s01-e09 |	But he's looking for this Jet magazine and he does a double-take because the girl looks so much like hay
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:05,152	| serial-s01-e09 |	OverWatch looks like Haze watch
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:07,968	| serial-s01-e09 |	So take a look at it and tell me what you think
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:09,248	| serial-s01-e09 |	I hope I'm not going crazy
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:12,576	| serial-s01-e09 |	I found this perplexing
EDL	00:29:12,576	00:29:13,856	| serial-s01-e09 |	He seems relaxed in a letter
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:17,440	| serial-s01-e09 |	This is a kid who is about to be sentenced to life in prison
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:21,024	| serial-s01-e09 |	He knows that's what's about to happen it's the mandatory sentence for his conviction
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:24,352	| serial-s01-e09 |	Conviction of course was for killing
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:25,888	| serial-s01-e09 |	Hey Chris is good friend
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:29,728	| serial-s01-e09 |	And in this pregnant life-changing moment he's writing a letter to
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:33,312	| serial-s01-e09 |	To Krista about whether a photo be flipping through a magazine
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:34,080	| serial-s01-e09 |	Looks like hay
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:35,872	| serial-s01-e09 |	Is it to
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:37,408	| serial-s01-e09 |	Nonchalant or something
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:38,176	| serial-s01-e09 |	Is it creepy
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:40,992	| serial-s01-e09 |	Not explain several things about this
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:47,904	| serial-s01-e09 |	First he wasn't especially nervous right then that was about to change but at that point he says he was thinking of his sentencing at
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:49,696	| serial-s01-e09 |	The procedure he needed to get through
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:52,000	| serial-s01-e09 |	So he could immediately start the appeals process
EDL	00:29:52,768	00:29:55,072	| serial-s01-e09 |	It was a step toward the thing he wanted
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:30:02,496	| serial-s01-e09 |	Second it's not like they transport you from yourself right to the courtroom door and you're just outside straightening your tie before your big
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:03,008	| serial-s01-e09 |	Big moment
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:04,288	| serial-s01-e09 |	The opposite
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:08,128	| serial-s01-e09 |	There's an enormous collection of utter boredom and exhaustion built in
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:10,176	| serial-s01-e09 |	So you do other things
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:12,224	| serial-s01-e09 |	Read write letters whatever you can
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:15,808	| serial-s01-e09 |	It would be hard to understand like you spent hours
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:17,856	| serial-s01-e09 |	Cigna bullpens waiting
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:19,648	| serial-s01-e09 |	You know so it's like
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:23,744	| serial-s01-e09 |	If you just said if you get up at 3 in the morning
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:27,584	| serial-s01-e09 |	Did you let go downstairs in like the basement of the jail he's just sitting in the bullpen
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:30,912	| serial-s01-e09 |	Square Room
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:37,312	| serial-s01-e09 |	It's like a concrete bench built into the wall that goes around
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:41,664	| serial-s01-e09 |	And you might sit there till like that for 4 hours and you go to the court
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:48,320	| serial-s01-e09 |	I used to collect another for 5 hours until you go to court and let maybe 10:11 in the morning so after like
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:51,904	| serial-s01-e09 |	After doing this for so long it's just like you
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:53,184	| serial-s01-e09 |	Just like it numbs the mind
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:54,464	| serial-s01-e09 |	So
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:59,328	| serial-s01-e09 |	I mean I know people who took a plea deal just to not have to go to court anymore
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:03,168	| serial-s01-e09 |	I really honestly like not even exaggerating
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:08,800	| serial-s01-e09 |	The third thing is that Kristen was the only person he was in regular touch with who knew hey
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:11,104	| serial-s01-e09 |	And Krista didn't think that inanna killed her
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:14,432	| serial-s01-e09 |	You know so I can talk to her about hey it's not going to be like
EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:16,736	| serial-s01-e09 |	You know like
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:17,504	| serial-s01-e09 |	I mean
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:23,904	| serial-s01-e09 |	You know she's got to me like to talk to her about anything or writer about anything
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:26,208	| serial-s01-e09 |	A lot of times that's what it would be
EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:30,816	| serial-s01-e09 |	8 Days Later post-sentencing
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:32,352	| serial-s01-e09 |	He writes Krista another letter
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:33,888	| serial-s01-e09 |	ISO change
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:36,960	| serial-s01-e09 |	By this time he fired Christina Gutierrez
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:38,240	| serial-s01-e09 |	Asia letters
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:41,056	| serial-s01-e09 |	Public defender he doesn't really know
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:47,200	| serial-s01-e09 |	To tell the court he did not kill hay and it's going to continue to fight this to the end
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:48,992	| serial-s01-e09 |	That's what he says in his letter to Krista
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:52,576	| serial-s01-e09 |	And the guy says no no no terrible idea
EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:54,880	| serial-s01-e09 |	Don't say you're innocent it'll anger the judge
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:58,720	| serial-s01-e09 |	I don't argue with him and according to Adnan the lawyer says
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:32:01,536	| serial-s01-e09 |	Well you can do it if you want but you're just going to f*** yourself over
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:08,448	| serial-s01-e09 |	That his mother was going to speak
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:11,264	| serial-s01-e09 |	She's been to the trial everyday I say
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:13,824	| serial-s01-e09 |	Sometimes I glimpsed her in the videos
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:17,408	| serial-s01-e09 |	Keeping perfectly still or doubled over or holding on to someone
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:23,808	| serial-s01-e09 |	There's more than one bench Conference during the trial in which they talked about her mother's crying being a possible distraction to the jury
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:26,624	| serial-s01-e09 |	Her pain throughout must have been abject
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:30,464	| serial-s01-e09 |	Translator Hayes mother speak
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:32,768	| serial-s01-e09 |	She tells the court about her daughter
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:35,328	| serial-s01-e09 |	She tells the court about a Korean proverb
EDL	00:32:35,840	00:32:38,144	| serial-s01-e09 |	That says when parents die they're buried in the ground
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:41,216	| serial-s01-e09 |	But when a child dies you bury the child in your heart
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:43,264	| serial-s01-e09 |	When I die
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:45,568	| serial-s01-e09 |	When I die my daughter will die with me
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:48,640	| serial-s01-e09 |	As long as I live my daughter is buried in my heart
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:50,944	| serial-s01-e09 |	I don't know where to hear her voice
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:52,480	| serial-s01-e09 |	I don't know where to touch her hand
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:54,784	| serial-s01-e09 |	I would like to forgive Adnan Syed
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:57,600	| serial-s01-e09 |	But as of now I just don't know how to do that
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:59,392	| serial-s01-e09 |	And I just cannot do that right now
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:04,512	| serial-s01-e09 |	For many many months we tried to contact his family
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:06,304	| serial-s01-e09 |	To tell them we were doing the story
EDL	00:33:06,304	00:33:08,352	| serial-s01-e09 |	And it hopes they might want to talk to us about hey
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:12,960	| serial-s01-e09 |	In my 20-plus years of reporting I've never tried as hard to find anyone
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:16,032	| serial-s01-e09 |	Letters in English and in Korean
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:19,104	| serial-s01-e09 |	Phone calls social media Friends of Friends of Friends
EDL	00:33:19,616	00:33:20,896	| serial-s01-e09 |	Two private detectives
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:24,480	| serial-s01-e09 |	Korean speaking researchers people knocking on doors in three different states called
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:25,760	| serial-s01-e09 |	South Korea
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:27,040	| serial-s01-e09 |	We never heard back from them
EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:31,136	| serial-s01-e09 |	I learned a few days ago that they know what we're doing
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:32,672	| serial-s01-e09 |	My best guess is they want no part of it
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:33,696	| serial-s01-e09 |	Which I respect
EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:38,048	| serial-s01-e09 |	About hey I can tell you only what I've heard from non-family members
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:40,608	| serial-s01-e09 |	But she was cheerful and light and funny
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:42,656	| serial-s01-e09 |	But you love the movie Titanic
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:46,496	| serial-s01-e09 |	But she sometimes put nail polish on just so she could pick it off
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:49,312	| serial-s01-e09 |	She wasn't insecure seemingly ever
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:51,104	| serial-s01-e09 |	Sprite was her favorite soda
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:57,248	| serial-s01-e09 |	The Dallas Cowboys her favorite team not because she cared about football but because she like the colors blue and silver
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:33:59,552	| serial-s01-e09 |	That you could charm you without trying
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:01,856	| serial-s01-e09 |	That she was a good friend to her friend
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:05,952	| serial-s01-e09 |	She took in their problems and their pain and try to help them if she could
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:19,008	| serial-s01-e09 |	At the sentencing listening to his mother
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:23,360	| serial-s01-e09 |	That was the first time an understood how people on his side of the courtroom saw him
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:25,408	| serial-s01-e09 |	Keep never felt hated before
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:29,248	| serial-s01-e09 |	When is June 14th 2000 letter to Krista he writes
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:33,344	| serial-s01-e09 |	And I feel her pain cuz I cared about her and how sad she is
EDL	00:34:33,856	00:34:36,928	| serial-s01-e09 |	But on the other I'm thinking please believe me I didn't kill your daughter
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:44,096	| serial-s01-e09 |	She was sitting right next to me and it was really sad but I couldn't help thinking that my mom is going through the exact same thing she's going to
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:45,120	| serial-s01-e09 |	Lose her son forever
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:49,216	| serial-s01-e09 |	Afterwards I was thinking my God No One Believes In Me
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:52,032	| serial-s01-e09 |	Krista I could never explain how that felt
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:55,104	| serial-s01-e09 |	Attorney that addresses the court
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:35:01,504	| serial-s01-e09 |	Put your honor I would ask that this honorable court if it would consider this case more crime of passion than of intent to
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:02,016	| serial-s01-e09 |	To kill
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:03,808	| serial-s01-e09 |	Permanent letter
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:08,928	| serial-s01-e09 |	That's all I heard him say and I turned and just stared at him wanting to hit him with a chair or something
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:13,024	| serial-s01-e09 |	I mean this jerk is going to get up and give away the only thing I have my innocence
EDL	00:35:14,816	00:35:19,168	| serial-s01-e09 |	When he suddenly realizes he has no idea what to say
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:24,800	| serial-s01-e09 |	He had his plan but now quote on the other hand I'm thinking about what the lawyer said about the judge getting upset
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:30,432	| serial-s01-e09 |	On a certain I'm thinking man I should just apologize for everything even though I didn't kill hay
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:32,992	| serial-s01-e09 |	Stupid me I end up doing a little of each
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:36,320	| serial-s01-e09 |	It's true when his moment comes
EDL	00:35:36,320	00:35:39,904	| serial-s01-e09 |	He maintains his innocence he asks for the mercy of the Court
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:43,488	| serial-s01-e09 |	He says quote I'm just sorry for all the pain that this is caused everyone
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:51,424	| serial-s01-e09 |	The judge
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:53,472	| serial-s01-e09 |	Disagreed with a nonce attorney at sentencing
EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:57,056	| serial-s01-e09 |	We know this because she said quote I disagree with you Council
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:35:58,592	| serial-s01-e09 |	This wasn't a crime of passion
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:01,152	| serial-s01-e09 |	She said you planned it
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:03,456	| serial-s01-e09 |	Intellect
EDL	00:36:03,456	00:36:04,992	| serial-s01-e09 |	Physical strength
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:10,880	| serial-s01-e09 |	Use that charismatic ability of yours that made you the president or what was it the king or the prince of your prom
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:17,536	| serial-s01-e09 |	And even today I think you continue to manipulate even those that love you
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:18,816	| serial-s01-e09 |	As you did to the victim
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:22,144	| serial-s01-e09 |	You manipulated her to go with you to her death
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:33,920	| serial-s01-e09 |	Early on I asked Adnan
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:35,968	| serial-s01-e09 |	If you're saying you're innocent
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:37,504	| serial-s01-e09 |	Why aren't you bitter and angry
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:38,784	| serial-s01-e09 |	Why do you sound so calm
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:40,832	| serial-s01-e09 |	He said a lot of things
EDL	00:36:40,832	00:36:42,112	| serial-s01-e09 |	Then and since
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:43,392	| serial-s01-e09 |	Because there's no one answer
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:46,720	| serial-s01-e09 |	Realizes how lucky he is
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:48,512	| serial-s01-e09 |	Compared to so many other guys inside
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:52,096	| serial-s01-e09 |	His family visits he calls him all the time they send him money
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:54,656	| serial-s01-e09 |	He's got people like Robbie inside pulling for him
EDL	00:36:55,424	00:36:56,960	| serial-s01-e09 |	I refuse to be miserable
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:36:59,520	| serial-s01-e09 |	Being religious help
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:03,616	| serial-s01-e09 |	What you hear all the time about people in prison but I never thought about it too much
EDL	00:37:03,616	00:37:04,640	| serial-s01-e09 |	Before I got to know at 9
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:07,712	| serial-s01-e09 |	We end up in prison he says he made a choice
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:08,736	| serial-s01-e09 |	To be a better Muslim
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:12,832	| serial-s01-e09 |	I can say that for nearly half his life he's live like he's supposed to
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:15,904	| serial-s01-e09 |	He knows it's a rationalization of a situation
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:17,440	| serial-s01-e09 |	But it's been the most helpful one
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:20,512	| serial-s01-e09 |	Finally he says he's got a clear conscience
EDL	00:37:20,512	00:37:21,792	| serial-s01-e09 |	Because you didn't kill Hae
EDL	00:37:22,304	00:37:25,632	| serial-s01-e09 |	I'm here because of my own stupid actions
EDL	00:37:26,144	00:37:27,168	| serial-s01-e09 |	I have some money man
EDL	00:37:32,288	00:37:33,056	| serial-s01-e09 |	I mean
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:38,176	| serial-s01-e09 |	I never should have let someone hold my car let someone hold my phone
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:39,968	| serial-s01-e09 |	I never should have been friends with you
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:44,576	| serial-s01-e09 |	I mean I don't feel myself
EDL	00:37:46,112	00:37:49,440	| serial-s01-e09 |	If you think he's lying
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:51,232	| serial-s01-e09 |	I mean
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:52,512	| serial-s01-e09 |	Damn the police
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:53,792	| serial-s01-e09 |	Prosecutors but
EDL	00:37:53,792	00:37:54,304	| serial-s01-e09 |	I mean
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:38:01,216	| serial-s01-e09 |	But at the end of the day I have to take some responsibility
EDL	00:38:01,728	00:38:04,288	| serial-s01-e09 |	You don't really know the things that my younger brother went to
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:12,736	| serial-s01-e09 |	At the end of the day if I have been
EDL	00:38:17,856	00:38:20,160	| serial-s01-e09 |	You know what I mean
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:38,336	| serial-s01-e09 |	You know it
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:39,616	| serial-s01-e09 |	I can't
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:56,000	| serial-s01-e09 |	I can't ever admit to this crime
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:39:00,352	| serial-s01-e09 |	After all his parents have been through the fear and the money and the anguish
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:02,912	| serial-s01-e09 |	How could he ever turn around and say to them
EDL	00:39:03,680	00:39:04,960	| serial-s01-e09 |	Atlantic issue with that
EDL	00:39:05,728	00:39:08,288	| serial-s01-e09 |	Two most important people in the world
EDL	00:39:08,800	00:39:13,920	| serial-s01-e09 |	I know the thing that bothers me the most is not necessarily me being in prison for this
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:28,000	| serial-s01-e09 |	I should be done this and I told him the reason why
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:35,424	| serial-s01-e09 |	We're still going to take care of them
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:39,776	| serial-s01-e09 |	But at least we don't have any more than somewhere
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:46,944	| serial-s01-e09 |	They don't necessarily worry about me being imprisoned because
EDL	00:39:49,760	00:39:54,624	| serial-s01-e09 |	I'm healthy you know whatever to come pick me up
EDL	00:40:04,096	00:40:06,912	| serial-s01-e09 |	I deserve to be here
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:11,776	| serial-s01-e09 |	I can't say what would truly be easier for his family
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:16,384	| serial-s01-e09 |	Knowing their son had murdered someone or feeling as if he's been taken from them unjustly
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:19,456	| serial-s01-e09 |	But it is true that is not has always been fine in
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:20,224	| serial-s01-e09 |	In prison
EDL	00:40:20,224	00:40:20,992	| serial-s01-e09 |	Is adoptable
EDL	00:40:21,504	00:40:24,064	| serial-s01-e09 |	People never been independent anyway
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:26,112	| serial-s01-e09 |	First word of his parents been awarded
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:26,624	| serial-s01-e09 |	State
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:30,720	| serial-s01-e09 |	He spent the initial part of his sentence at a prison in Jessup
EDL	00:40:30,720	00:40:32,512	| serial-s01-e09 |	About a 30-minute drive for his family
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:36,096	| serial-s01-e09 |	It was a loser place in where he is now at North Branch
EDL	00:40:36,096	00:40:36,864	| serial-s01-e09 |	Cumberland
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:39,936	| serial-s01-e09 |	A maximum-security prison more than 2 hours away from Baltimore
EDL	00:40:40,448	00:40:42,752	| serial-s01-e09 |	I didn't have been like
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:44,544	| serial-s01-e09 |	Shifferly like corrupt places
EDL	00:40:44,544	00:40:45,824	| serial-s01-e09 |	So they're not really strict
EDL	00:40:45,824	00:40:46,848	| serial-s01-e09 |	Senseware
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:50,944	| serial-s01-e09 |	You know it's like all you got to do this and this time you got to do this at that time
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:54,272	| serial-s01-e09 |	So maybe it actually is
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:40:59,136	| serial-s01-e09 |	In Jessup especially people got away with all kinds of craziness
EDL	00:40:59,648	00:41:00,928	| serial-s01-e09 |	That person's clothes now
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:06,304	| serial-s01-e09 |	Only had one infraction his entire time would you guide the DLC told me was impressive
EDL	00:41:06,304	00:41:06,816	| serial-s01-e09 |	For anyone
EDL	00:41:07,584	00:41:11,168	| serial-s01-e09 |	After I asked about his prison record and non set me a stack of copies

EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:20,128	| serial-s01-e09 |	In 2005 he got one called the distinguished gentleman's award
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:25,248	| serial-s01-e09 |	You're consistent display of character mannerism self-control and ability to manage adversity
EDL	00:41:25,760	00:41:26,272	| serial-s01-e09 |	Signed by the word

EDL	00:41:31,392	00:41:33,440	| serial-s01-e09 |	Actually had a couple of different cell phones
EDL	00:41:33,440	00:41:35,488	| serial-s01-e09 |	I knew when you got he can figure out how to make it work
EDL	00:41:59,295	00:42:02,879	| serial-s01-e09 |	I just have not had a good job he was a clerk in the chaplain's office
