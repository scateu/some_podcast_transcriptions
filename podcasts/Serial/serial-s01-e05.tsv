EDL	00:00:46,080	00:00:52,480	| serial-s01-e05 |	From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial
EDL	00:00:52,480	00:00:54,528	| serial-s01-e05 |	I told week by week
EDL	00:00:56,064	00:01:01,696	| serial-s01-e05 |	The first letter I got from Adnan Syed almost exactly one year ago included a challenge
EDL	00:01:02,208	00:01:05,536	| serial-s01-e05 |	He was writing about the prosecution's timeline of the crime
EDL	00:01:05,536	00:01:08,352	| serial-s01-e05 |	About when and where Hae Min Lee was killed
EDL	00:01:09,632	00:01:14,496	| serial-s01-e05 |	State contended that hay was killed between 2:15 and 2:36 p.m.
EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:17,568	| serial-s01-e05 |	At the Best Buy parking lot about a mile from Woodlawn High School
EDL	00:01:18,336	00:01:21,152	| serial-s01-e05 |	That's a 21-minute window and wish to commit the murder
EDL	00:01:21,664	00:01:24,224	| serial-s01-e05 |	Which may seem like a long time ago
EDL	00:01:24,224	00:01:27,552	| serial-s01-e05 |	But it is virtually impossible if you consider the following facts
EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:29,088	| serial-s01-e05 |	Which he then listed
EDL	00:01:29,856	00:01:30,624	| serial-s01-e05 |	For example
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:35,232	| serial-s01-e05 |	When the final bell rings at 2:15 you can't just leave and jump in your car he wrote
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:40,864	| serial-s01-e05 |	Quote there are 1500 other students filling the hallways and stairwells of a 4-story building on quote
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:47,264	| serial-s01-e05 |	Then you have to get out of the school parking lot but the parking lot is encircled by the school bus Loop
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:50,848	| serial-s01-e05 |	You can't get your car out until the buses fill up and leave
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:53,152	| serial-s01-e05 |	Which Anon Road took about 10 to 15 minutes
EDL	00:01:55,200	00:01:57,504	| serial-s01-e05 |	A picture of it
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:02:00,064	| serial-s01-e05 |	Woodlawn High School lets out
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:00,832	| serial-s01-e05 |	A 215

EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:23,872	| serial-s01-e05 |	There's someone like
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:29,504	| serial-s01-e05 |	You know what just trying to not have been committed
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:42,048	| serial-s01-e05 |	That happens sometimes the guards come by when you're just done mid-sentence
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:45,120	| serial-s01-e05 |	Anyway I can pick up from add-ons letter
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:49,728	| serial-s01-e05 |	Best Buy
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:55,360	| serial-s01-e05 |	Their major intersections along the way and that there is a ton of traffic at that time on quote
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:03:02,272	| serial-s01-e05 |	And then the murder itself how would he be able to strangle hey a tall strong athletic girl
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:04,320	| serial-s01-e05 |	Remove her body from the car
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:08,928	| serial-s01-e05 |	Turn to the trunk and place her in there in broad daylight at 2:30 in the afternoon
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:13,536	| serial-s01-e05 |	And then I walk into the Best Buy Lobby call Jackie and tell him to come meet me there
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:15,072	| serial-s01-e05 |	21 minutes
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:18,656	| serial-s01-e05 |	Hundred percent sure that if someone tried to do it
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:20,448	| serial-s01-e05 |	It would be impossible on quote
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:26,080	| serial-s01-e05 |	Producer Dana Chavis and I gave it a shot
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:29,920	| serial-s01-e05 |	We tried this drive twice we tried in fact
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:32,480	| serial-s01-e05 |	Because full disclosure the first time we screwed it up
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:35,040	| serial-s01-e05 |	The second time though we were like a machine
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:37,088	| serial-s01-e05 |	So here we go
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:39,648	| serial-s01-e05 |	Woodlawn High School Wednesday afternoon
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,672	| serial-s01-e05 |	After school announcements
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:50,144	| serial-s01-e05 |	Okay then last bell
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:56,032	| serial-s01-e05 |	More than a thousand students fill the Halls just like Adnan describes in his letter
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:01,920	| serial-s01-e05 |	We figured he gets in her car quickly she's in a hurry
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:09,344	| serial-s01-e05 |	This now 217
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:12,672	| serial-s01-e05 |	The bell ring at exactly 2:15
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:14,976	| serial-s01-e05 |	Say that fast as she could have gotten to her car
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:16,768	| serial-s01-e05 |	Is 2 minutes
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:19,071	| serial-s01-e05 |	So that's getting the state the benefit of the doubt right
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:25,983	| serial-s01-e05 |	She's really hustling maybe she can't get to her car and say 2 minutes remember her friend Debbie Warren
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:30,079	| serial-s01-e05 |	Some had told her right after school that she was in a rush to see her new boyfriend Don at the mall
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:32,895	| serial-s01-e05 |	Presumably the Owings Mills mall where they both were
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:35,711	| serial-s01-e05 |	I think this is the last bus
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:41,087	| serial-s01-e05 |	We do indeed have to wait for the Bus Loop to clear it takes a few minutes
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:42,111	| serial-s01-e05 |	Just have to sit there
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:43,647	| serial-s01-e05 |	What timing
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:44,927	| serial-s01-e05 |	We're in the back of the school
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:47,743	| serial-s01-e05 |	Now is to drive up around to the front of the school
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:53,119	| serial-s01-e05 |	Up around the circle near the gym remember that's where Inez Butler Hendrix says she sees hey
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:54,399	| serial-s01-e05 |	Who come to grab a snack
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:57,983	| serial-s01-e05 |	Once we get there we're at 11 minutes 38 seconds
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:04:59,519	| serial-s01-e05 |	I'm going to run in
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:00,031	| serial-s01-e05 |	Set timing
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:08,223	| serial-s01-e05 |	I run into the gym area where the food cart was run back out to the car
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:14,623	| serial-s01-e05 |	Turn on to Security Boulevard
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:15,391	| serial-s01-e05 |	Death row
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:18,207	| serial-s01-e05 |	We're trying to get the Best Buy that's still there today
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:24,607	| serial-s01-e05 |	In 21 minutes we're at 17 minutes right about
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:30,751	| serial-s01-e05 |	17 minutes were just crossing under the Beltway less than a minute later
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:36,895	| serial-s01-e05 |	There's the sign Best Buy
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:42,015	| serial-s01-e05 |	A story was that when he pulled into Best Buy
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:45,343	| serial-s01-e05 |	He saw at 9 at the phone booth are at the edge of the building
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:46,367	| serial-s01-e05 |	Wearing red gloves
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:53,535	| serial-s01-e05 |	9 motion for Jada follow him across the front of the building around to the other side to the farthest corner of a
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:54,559	| serial-s01-e05 |	Side parking lot
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:56,095	| serial-s01-e05 |	Where Jay saw his car parked
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:06:00,191	| serial-s01-e05 |	This particular part of the parking lot Alaska
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:01,215	| serial-s01-e05 |	It has significance
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:06,079	| serial-s01-e05 |	After adhan was arrested the detectives interviewed another friend of his
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:07,615	| serial-s01-e05 |	A kid named Juan
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:10,175	| serial-s01-e05 |	He gotten high with a non one
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:10,943	| serial-s01-e05 |	Ananas car
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:12,735	| serial-s01-e05 |	Her interview
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:15,295	| serial-s01-e05 |	Where was this
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:19,135	| serial-s01-e05 |	Why did you go to Best Buy parking
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:21,695	| serial-s01-e05 |	Nobody
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:27,071	| serial-s01-e05 |	Is Joyce
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:29,887	| serial-s01-e05 |	And I hate to go to space
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:32,447	| serial-s01-e05 |	Adnan Syed
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:33,727	| serial-s01-e05 |	Hey
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:35,519	| serial-s01-e05 |	We can spend time
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:39,359	| serial-s01-e05 |	What they would do there
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:44,735	| serial-s01-e05 |	Play Verano para la colonne noted.
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,879	| serial-s01-e05 |	In case you didn't hear that he says
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:53,439	| serial-s01-e05 |	I think he might have said that they had sex there before
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:54,975	| serial-s01-e05 |	Yeah
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:07:02,911	| serial-s01-e05 |	This happened the strip to get high at Best Buy that it happened after he went missing
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:05,215	| serial-s01-e05 |	Meaning
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:09,311	| serial-s01-e05 |	He was taking John back to the exact spot where he killed Hae
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:11,103	| serial-s01-e05 |	He was returning to the scene of the crime
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:17,247	| serial-s01-e05 |	From the sounds of it right where Jay says his car was that day
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:19,039	| serial-s01-e05 |	Right where Dana and I are now also part
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:22,879	| serial-s01-e05 |	It takes Dan and me 18 minutes
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:23,647	| serial-s01-e05 |	To get to the spot
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:26,719	| serial-s01-e05 |	That leaves three minutes for the actual horror of the thing
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:28,767	| serial-s01-e05 |	An argument may be
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:29,791	| serial-s01-e05 |	And strangulation
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:33,119	| serial-s01-e05 |	He's got to put her body in the trunk
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:34,655	| serial-s01-e05 |	Somehow without anyone seeing
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:41,311	| serial-s01-e05 |	Granted this part of the parking lot is pretty empty but it's still it's a parking lot in the middle of the afternoon
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:45,919	| serial-s01-e05 |	They're definitely cars and people near enough to make this seem like a very very risky move
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:51,807	| serial-s01-e05 |	Counting down the quickest possible imagining of such a thing
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:54,367	| serial-s01-e05 |	Manual strangulation usually takes
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:54,879	| serial-s01-e05 |	A few minutes
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:08:01,535	| serial-s01-e05 |	We get out of our car and walk over to where we think the Payphone was according to a sketch J made for the cops
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:03,327	| serial-s01-e05 |	There's no phone booth there now
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:11,007	| serial-s01-e05 |	I just want to pause here and talk about this phone with from it we have not been able to confirm its existence
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:18,175	| serial-s01-e05 |	The Best Buy employees I talked to did not remember a payphone back then we spoke to the landlord at the time at the property
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:24,575	| serial-s01-e05 |	Manager they had no record of a peso from 2001
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:29,695	| serial-s01-e05 |	Thor Payphone lots of public funds did come down between 2001
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:35,327	| serial-s01-e05 |	Blueprints for the store when it was built in 1995 nothing
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:41,471	| serial-s01-e05 |	The manager also said there is no record of a service agreement between Best Buy in any pay phone company at that store
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:45,823	| serial-s01-e05 |	We checked with the Maryland Public Service Commission we check with Verizon
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:48,127	| serial-s01-e05 |	Neither could track down records from that far back
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:56,575	| serial-s01-e05 |	It seems crazy to me that the cops would have either not checked to make sure it existed or failed to mention it is
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:57,599	| serial-s01-e05 |	Somehow it wasn't there
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:09:01,695	| serial-s01-e05 |	I never got the call record from this booth there's nothing in their files about it
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:07,327	| serial-s01-e05 |	A trial at nuns lawyer brings up this phone booth when she's trying to attack J's credibility
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:08,863	| serial-s01-e05 |	She says to the judge
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:15,263	| serial-s01-e05 |	Quote we believe that the physical description of the actuality of Best Buy including the location of the phone booth
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:16,031	| serial-s01-e05 |	Best Buy
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:18,079	| serial-s01-e05 |	The entrance existence or non-existence of
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:19,871	| serial-s01-e05 |	Security cameras Etc she goes on
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:21,919	| serial-s01-e05 |	I don't know
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:23,711	| serial-s01-e05 |	We're stumped on this one
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:26,271	| serial-s01-e05 |	But let's assume it did exist
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,039	| serial-s01-e05 |	That day
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:30,111	| serial-s01-e05 |	The prosecutor said they knew he was dead by 236
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:34,719	| serial-s01-e05 |	Because there's a call at 2:36 to a non cell phone with J has
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:38,047	| serial-s01-e05 |	Miss a that must be to call Jay told the cops about
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:42,911	| serial-s01-e05 |	Turn on calls his own phone and says come and get me I'm at Best Buy
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:48,287	| serial-s01-e05 |	You can see it on the call log it just says incoming there's no phone number attached incoming calls
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:51,615	| serial-s01-e05 |	This 2:36 call was 5 Seconds long
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:54,687	| serial-s01-e05 |	We get out of quarter we put it in
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:55,455	| serial-s01-e05 |	Dial a number
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:56,991	| serial-s01-e05 |	1
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:58,527	| serial-s01-e05 |	2
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:09:59,807	| serial-s01-e05 |	3
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:01,855	| serial-s01-e05 |	4
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:03,135	| serial-s01-e05 |	5
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:07,487	| serial-s01-e05 |	Stop at 22 and a half
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:13,119	| serial-s01-e05 |	Let's just be precise about it
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:16,191	| serial-s01-e05 |	20 22 22 minutes into seconds
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:22,079	| serial-s01-e05 |	If we just did it in 22 minutes and two seconds and that was leaving about a minute and a half
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:23,871	| serial-s01-e05 |	In the car
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:25,663	| serial-s01-e05 |	For the actual
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:26,431	| serial-s01-e05 |	Killing Park
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:28,479	| serial-s01-e05 |	Should probably be the minimum
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,271	| serial-s01-e05 |	Lot of time
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:31,039	| serial-s01-e05 |	In the car
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:38,463	| serial-s01-e05 |	I mean if it seems like yeah could be done
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:40,511	| serial-s01-e05 |	But it seems far-fetched
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:43,583	| serial-s01-e05 |	It does seem far-fetched
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:47,167	| serial-s01-e05 |	Because there's no room for any errors any pauses even
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:52,799	| serial-s01-e05 |	Buses to drive the strangulation the moving of the body that they all have to happen
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:55,615	| serial-s01-e05 |	Quickly as I possibly can for the 236 call to work
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:10:58,943	| serial-s01-e05 |	Possible
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:01,247	| serial-s01-e05 |	Or at least not impossible
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:03,295	| serial-s01-e05 |	Which is what I was saying in that first letter
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:14,559	| serial-s01-e05 |	When I told him and I more or less did it in the time allowed the 21 minutes
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:17,631	| serial-s01-e05 |	His overall reaction was incredulity
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:18,655	| serial-s01-e05 |	Seems like 5 minutes
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:30,943	| serial-s01-e05 |	Since you have to wait for the bus
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:33,759	| serial-s01-e05 |	I don't know
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:34,271	| serial-s01-e05 |	Conscious heart
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:41,951	| serial-s01-e05 |	Taken out of
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:46,559	| serial-s01-e05 |	I don't know I mean if you guys like you did it then you did it
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:49,887	| serial-s01-e05 |	I don't know I don't know what to say that
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:53,471	| serial-s01-e05 |	I don't know what to say I just always thought in my mind
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:57,311	| serial-s01-e05 |	This is what I'll say is it doesn't make me think
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:11:59,615	| serial-s01-e05 |	To me it doesn't
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:01,919	| serial-s01-e05 |	Prove anything
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:02,687	| serial-s01-e05 |	Except that it
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:06,015	| serial-s01-e05 |	It's possible it doesn't mean that I think you're lying or that I think
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:09,087	| serial-s01-e05 |	It even happened at the Best Buy I'm just saying
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:11,135	| serial-s01-e05 |	If you're going to debunked
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:11,647	| serial-s01-e05 |	The states
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:13,439	| serial-s01-e05 |	Timeline
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:16,255	| serial-s01-e05 |	Like we weren't able
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:18,559	| serial-s01-e05 |	Yeah we weren't able to do that
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:22,399	| serial-s01-e05 |	We weren't able to debunked they're trying
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:34,687	| serial-s01-e05 |	However
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:35,711	| serial-s01-e05 |	States timeline
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:37,503	| serial-s01-e05 |	In the detective notes
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:43,903	| serial-s01-e05 |	Then I found a handwritten itinerary March 18th 1999
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:45,695	| serial-s01-e05 |	Jay II taped interview with police
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:51,839	| serial-s01-e05 |	This is the route J laid out for the cops his entire driving day on January 13th
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:54,399	| serial-s01-e05 |	This is what we're going to try to replicate
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:56,447	| serial-s01-e05 |	To see if it matches the call record from that day
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:13:01,567	| serial-s01-e05 |	Because right the prosecution story of the crime was mainly pin to two things
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:03,103	| serial-s01-e05 |	Chase statements
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,127	| serial-s01-e05 |	And the sound records
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:10,015	| serial-s01-e05 |	Anon remembers that at his trial the prosecution had a big blow up chart of the call record
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:14,367	| serial-s01-e05 |	Enlisting 34 calls made and received an on cell phone that day
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:16,159	| serial-s01-e05 |	With blanks beside each call
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:20,767	| serial-s01-e05 |	Everytime I witness identified a, list the prosecutor would label it with a sticker
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:26,143	| serial-s01-e05 |	Call Jen pusateri
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:28,959	| serial-s01-e05 |	It was a pretty powerful thing
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:30,495	| serial-s01-e05 |	Because as he was testifying
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:34,847	| serial-s01-e05 |	Cell phone records
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:37,151	| serial-s01-e05 |	Okay be said what happened at this time
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:49,695	| serial-s01-e05 |	Besides the calls themselves they also had a list of all the cell towers that paint each time up
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:51,743	| serial-s01-e05 |	Particular call came in or went out
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:56,095	| serial-s01-e05 |	Sure the prosecutor said you might have your doubts about Jay
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:58,655	| serial-s01-e05 |	But the call record doesn't lie
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:04,799	| serial-s01-e05 |	Jake and possibly have known which Towers were getting paid when he couldn't fabricate that it would be
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:10,175	| serial-s01-e05 |	So the cell towers and the calls and Jay Story the way they all meshed
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:12,223	| serial-s01-e05 |	Prosecutors argue with irrefutable
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:16,319	| serial-s01-e05 |	Prosecutor Casey Murphy said to the jury in her closing statement quote
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:22,719	| serial-s01-e05 |	The most important thing for you to remember about Jay's testimony is that it does not stand alone it is corroborated
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:23,999	| serial-s01-e05 |	Chatot
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:29,375	| serial-s01-e05 |	The cell phone records support with those Witnesses say and the witnesses support with those cell phone records say
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:31,167	| serial-s01-e05 |	There's no way around it
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:33,471	| serial-s01-e05 |	All right ready
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:36,031	| serial-s01-e05 |	So I started it
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:39,615	| serial-s01-e05 |	It's 2:51 and we're making a right out of the Best Buy parking lot
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:46,783	| serial-s01-e05 |	On to Belmont Ave all right so let's see if we can recreate what Jace has happened that day
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:50,879	| serial-s01-e05 |	The next stop after Best Buy is the I-70 park and ride
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:53,439	| serial-s01-e05 |	Where Jay says they leave his car for a few hours
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:55,231	| serial-s01-e05 |	It's just a large commuter parking lot
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:15:00,863	| serial-s01-e05 |	Jay says he follows Adnan there Anon is driving his car Jay has an on scar
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:05,983	| serial-s01-e05 |	He's pretty careful to let the cops know he wasn't ever in his car never touched her or her stuff
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:09,311	| serial-s01-e05 |	Did you get out of the car the car and
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:11,359	| serial-s01-e05 |	This is from J second tape statement
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:15,199	| serial-s01-e05 |	Trumpkin
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:16,479	| serial-s01-e05 |	The backseat
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:19,295	| serial-s01-e05 |	This detail has always struck me by the way
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:23,903	| serial-s01-e05 |	Anon is going through the trunk of his car at the I-70 park and ride
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:26,207	| serial-s01-e05 |	His body is back there
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:27,487	| serial-s01-e05 |	In the trunk at this point
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:28,511	| serial-s01-e05 |	But anyway
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:31,327	| serial-s01-e05 |	Several items you picked up in
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:33,375	| serial-s01-e05 |	Move around stuff Academy
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:34,655	| serial-s01-e05 |	Came over to his card
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:37,471	| serial-s01-e05 |	Show me Paw Patrol Paw Patrol
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:42,079	| serial-s01-e05 |	And then he got in the driver's seat
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:43,359	| serial-s01-e05 |	And we switch places
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:44,895	| serial-s01-e05 |	And I got the passenger
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:51,551	| serial-s01-e05 |	Text Dana and me 11 minutes to get to the park and ride from Best Buy
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:54,111	| serial-s01-e05 |	Then we wait a couple minutes to account for a nun's movement
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:59,999	| serial-s01-e05 |	In case you're wondering if there were no security cameras at this park and ride back in 99 which exit.
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:03,071	| serial-s01-e05 |	So now it's a little after 3 p.m.
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:07,167	| serial-s01-e05 |	I took the cops on this ride on March 18th to Matt about the timeline
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:10,495	| serial-s01-e05 |	He told him that after they left the park and ride they went in search of weed
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:13,055	| serial-s01-e05 |	He says that's when he calls his friend Patrick
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:15,359	| serial-s01-e05 |	And this is where things start to get off
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:18,431	| serial-s01-e05 |	There is indeed a call to Patrick on the call log
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:20,735	| serial-s01-e05 |	But it's at 3:59 p.m.
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:23,039	| serial-s01-e05 |	The Runaway we've got a Time problem
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:27,903	| serial-s01-e05 |	Jay has sorted that out so his story better match the call log
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:33,535	| serial-s01-e05 |	He testified that he called Jen pusateri 1st at 3:21 to find out if Patrick was home
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:39,935	| serial-s01-e05 |	Jen testified that no Jay would not have called her to find out where Patrick was it's just not a thing that would have happened
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:43,007	| serial-s01-e05 |	Trinity case there is a call to Jen a321
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:48,639	| serial-s01-e05 |	Chase's when they didn't find Patrick at home they switched course and headed up to Forest Park to buy weed
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:50,687	| serial-s01-e05 |	Didn't I drive that same route
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:54,271	| serial-s01-e05 |	Are they said they buy two dimes of weed here that's a side note
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:57,599	| serial-s01-e05 |	Done
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:59,647	| serial-s01-e05 |	We are making a left
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:02,719	| serial-s01-e05 |	Jay also mentioned another call around this time
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:08,095	| serial-s01-e05 |	This call is incredibly important and I will talk more about it and another episode I swear
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:10,655	| serial-s01-e05 |	But for right now what you need to know is
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:14,239	| serial-s01-e05 |	In his second interview when the cops show him the list of calls
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:17,311	| serial-s01-e05 |	Jay says Adnan spoke to some girl in Silver Spring
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:20,639	| serial-s01-e05 |	Her name was Nisha that girl would not have been flirting with
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:23,711	| serial-s01-e05 |	Briefly put J on the phone with her
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:31,135	| serial-s01-e05 |	And the reason this is so important is for two reasons one it's the only call in this stretch of time that's to some
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:32,159	| serial-s01-e05 |	Anondo
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:33,439	| serial-s01-e05 |	Rather than a friend of Jays
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:34,975	| serial-s01-e05 |	And
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:40,607	| serial-s01-e05 |	It puts Jay and Adnan together in the middle of the afternoon when a nan says he was not with Jack he was back at
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:41,119	| serial-s01-e05 |	High School
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:45,983	| serial-s01-e05 |	In the March 18th itinerary there's a note about the Nisha call
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:49,055	| serial-s01-e05 |	Turn on handed the phone to Jay at the golf course
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:50,591	| serial-s01-e05 |	On West Forest Park Avenue
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:52,127	| serial-s01-e05 |	Yeah that is the first okay
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:55,711	| serial-s01-e05 |	If indeed this is the golf course he's saying where
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:18:00,831	| serial-s01-e05 |	Suspect hands the phone to the 10 to the witness who is Jay that was the Nisha call
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:03,647	| serial-s01-e05 |	And that does happen right now
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:07,999	| serial-s01-e05 |	So the time works for this one and not just a story
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:11,839	| serial-s01-e05 |	Here's the problem it doesn't match the cell tower in the car records
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:15,679	| serial-s01-e05 |	It's picking at our back near the Best Buy West of where we are
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:22,847	| serial-s01-e05 |	And that is true of all these calls from the middle of the afternoon the 321 to Jen 332 Denisha 3
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:29,247	| serial-s01-e05 |	848-283-5092 Patrick paying the tower near where Jay tells the cops
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:31,295	| serial-s01-e05 |	They were driving at afternoon not a one
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:38,207	| serial-s01-e05 |	A child and accounted for in Jay's testimony
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:41,791	| serial-s01-e05 |	Prosecutors did not point out that the cell towers didn't match
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:44,607	| serial-s01-e05 |	Announce defense attorney
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:48,959	| serial-s01-e05 |	Sort of but reading a trial transcript even if she notes the discrepancy
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:50,239	| serial-s01-e05 |	She doesn't nail it
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:52,799	| serial-s01-e05 |	So it's hard to tell what the discrepancy means
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:59,967	| serial-s01-e05 |	So onward we are headed to Pasco state park right now
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:06,111	| serial-s01-e05 |	We definitely don't have time to go to Patapsco well let's see how long
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:16,095	| serial-s01-e05 |	This is the next stop on the itinerary The Cliffs at Patapsco State Park which is a good 20-minute Drive
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:17,119	| serial-s01-e05 |	From where we are right now
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:19,935	| serial-s01-e05 |	I don't track practice starts at 4 p.m.
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:26,847	| serial-s01-e05 |	It before we were sort of clinging respectively to the great upon timeline thumb our noses
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:30,687	| serial-s01-e05 |	Yeah I mean this just seems absurd it's 3
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:35,039	| serial-s01-e05 |	Set between 3:45 and 3:50 now and their world
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:41,951	| serial-s01-e05 |	And if I'm on on and I need to be seen for truck I'm freaking out right now that I need to get back to track
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:44,255	| serial-s01-e05 |	To have an alibi
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:49,119	| serial-s01-e05 |	What's this like
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:52,191	| serial-s01-e05 |	Across the county to go to a state park to smoke a blunt like
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:54,751	| serial-s01-e05 |	Pull up to smoke in your car and
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:59,359	| serial-s01-e05 |	It just seems like there had to be other places you could have just pulled over for a quick smoke
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:01,407	| serial-s01-e05 |	If indeed that's what needed to happen
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:04,991	| serial-s01-e05 |	There's a shrimp sale at The Crab Crib
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:08,575	| serial-s01-e05 |	Sometimes I think Dana isn't listening to me
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:12,927	| serial-s01-e05 |	Anyway we had to Patapsco State Park because Jay is very clear
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:14,975	| serial-s01-e05 |	Take statement Number One Taste
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:17,535	| serial-s01-e05 |	Remember to March 18th itinerary
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:20,095	| serial-s01-e05 |	Now is when they go smoke a blunt at the Cliffs at Patapsco
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:22,143	| serial-s01-e05 |	My truck in there
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:24,959	| serial-s01-e05 |	Domini
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:27,775	| serial-s01-e05 |	Refune steps
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:29,567	| serial-s01-e05 |	This is beautiful
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:32,383	| serial-s01-e05 |	You can see the river below some train tracks
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:35,967	| serial-s01-e05 |	Chase memories about the spider specific
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:38,271	| serial-s01-e05 |	Daenerys from the handwritten notes March 18th
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:40,063	| serial-s01-e05 |	Chinese religious texts
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:42,111	| serial-s01-e05 |	That's it says Patapsco Valley State Park
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:44,159	| serial-s01-e05 |	1630 hour
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:47,999	| serial-s01-e05 |	And then the next node is Sun getting ready to hit mountaintops
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:51,583	| serial-s01-e05 |	1630 hour means 4:30 p.m.
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:54,911	| serial-s01-e05 |	Sunset that day was at 5:05 p.m. so that would make sense
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:58,751	| serial-s01-e05 |	And then it says I can't believe I did it I'm sad but not really
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:02,079	| serial-s01-e05 |	Here's what J says they talked about
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:05,407	| serial-s01-e05 |	And before I play this mixtape just a warning that is disturbing
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:09,247	| serial-s01-e05 |	Percentage overlooking a whole bunch of stuff at this Cliff you're not
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:11,295	| serial-s01-e05 |	He starts
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:12,831	| serial-s01-e05 |	Tell me about
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:15,647	| serial-s01-e05 |	How was when he killed her house
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:19,232	| serial-s01-e05 |	He said he wrapped his hand around her
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:25,376	| serial-s01-e05 |	Started kicking then he said he looked up to make sure nobody was
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:26,912	| serial-s01-e05 |	Look in the car Adam
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:33,824	| serial-s01-e05 |	Synonym for fingernails
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:40,992	| serial-s01-e05 |	Emily. She's trying to say something that she thinks that she was trying to say that she was starting but that's what she deserves
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:44,320	| serial-s01-e05 |	How long
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:45,856	| serial-s01-e05 |	Do you think you're worthless
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:47,392	| serial-s01-e05 |	20 minutes to happiness
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:51,744	| serial-s01-e05 |	Other than that conversation was there anything additional
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:56,864	| serial-s01-e05 |	It said to me wonders where you can put the body at
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:59,168	| serial-s01-e05 |	Did you make any suggestions
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:00,704	| serial-s01-e05 |	Not at all
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:02,752	| serial-s01-e05 |	Did he name any location
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:07,104	| serial-s01-e05 |	You didn't say you know what about here yo
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:09,152	| serial-s01-e05 |	He didn't name up
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:11,456	| serial-s01-e05 |	They have dozens locations and you gave him
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:12,736	| serial-s01-e05 |	Thumbs up or thumbs down
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:18,112	| serial-s01-e05 |	John PS
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:20,160	| serial-s01-e05 |	Say something to me
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:29,376	| serial-s01-e05 |	Defective State Park where we were a little bit up the river but I told him that
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:30,656	| serial-s01-e05 |	People walk up and down there
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:35,264	| serial-s01-e05 |	AJ says they talked about the murder at the cliffs
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:40,128	| serial-s01-e05 |	He said they talked about whether to dispose of the body right there and Patapsco State Park
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:43,200	| serial-s01-e05 |	He says they're there for 20 minutes to half an hour
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:49,600	| serial-s01-e05 |	Come trial when json the stand talking about where they went that day
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:52,928	| serial-s01-e05 |	This whole trip to Patapsco and never happens
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:54,208	| serial-s01-e05 |	It's just not there
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:59,840	| serial-s01-e05 |	Instead it happens in a nun's car when they're tooling around looking to buy weed
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:06,240	| serial-s01-e05 |	This is a puzzle to me it's such a vivid scene describing it's so detailed
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:08,800	| serial-s01-e05 |	I have to think he included it for a good reason
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:11,104	| serial-s01-e05 |	But it doesn't fit the timeline
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:16,224	| serial-s01-e05 |	Patapsco story at all
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:25,696	| serial-s01-e05 |	It's like trying to
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:32,608	| serial-s01-e05 |	I'm trying to think of an analogy
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:35,680	| serial-s01-e05 |	The uselessness of what we're trying to do
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:37,984	| serial-s01-e05 |	By recreating something that doesn't
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:39,520	| serial-s01-e05 |	Fit
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:43,104	| serial-s01-e05 |	Like trying to plot
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:50,016	| serial-s01-e05 |	You know the coordinates of someone's dream or something we're just like 420 that doesn't like as if we're going to be surprised every single time but it's
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:52,832	| serial-s01-e05 |	It's not
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:54,368	| serial-s01-e05 |	Probably call it a Fool's errand
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:24:02,560	| serial-s01-e05 |	A trial Jason on gets another call I just dropping an on off at school for track
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:06,912	| serial-s01-e05 |	Before he left the car he received a phone call or placed a phone call
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:08,192	| serial-s01-e05 |	It was in Arabic
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:11,264	| serial-s01-e05 |	I don't know who he was talking to I don't know what it entails
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:13,056	| serial-s01-e05 |	I believe it was his mother on quote
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:16,896	| serial-s01-e05 |	Adnan and his family say he doesn't speak Arabic
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:18,688	| serial-s01-e05 |	Or Pashto or Urdu
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:22,528	| serial-s01-e05 |	Accent on the other end of the call
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:26,368	| serial-s01-e05 |	And there is a 427 call in the log maybe that's the one
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:30,464	| serial-s01-e05 |	But again the cell tower pings isn't near Woodlawn High School
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:37,632	| serial-s01-e05 |	The earliest and I can get from The Cliffs back to Woodlawn is 4:45 p.m. and that's being generous
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:41,216	| serial-s01-e05 |	But even so that means if an OnStar to get changed
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:47,616	| serial-s01-e05 |	He is very late for 4 p.m. track now which seems like a bad strategy
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:48,128	| serial-s01-e05 |	Wait like that
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:51,712	| serial-s01-e05 |	Jay says he goes next to a friend's house
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:54,528	| serial-s01-e05 |	I'm going to call this friend Kathy because she didn't want to be identified
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:57,856	| serial-s01-e05 |	Jay says he gets there by 5:20 or 5:30
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:04,000	| serial-s01-e05 |	He says he smokes more weed there but it's not long before an on calls him and says I'm done with track come get me
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:06,816	| serial-s01-e05 |	Chickens back to Woodlawn to get an on
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:10,912	| serial-s01-e05 |	She tells the cops that he gets to Woodlawn at about 6 p.m.
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:12,960	| serial-s01-e05 |	Andre season on with a friend from track
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:15,776	| serial-s01-e05 |	The notes for March 18th say
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:18,080	| serial-s01-e05 |	Said goodbye to track buddy will
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:18,848	| serial-s01-e05 |	That day
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:23,456	| serial-s01-e05 |	DJ by the wheel and then
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:26,272	| serial-s01-e05 |	That is Will
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:26,784	| serial-s01-e05 |	Amtrak
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:28,832	| serial-s01-e05 |	It's hard to remember that
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:30,112	| serial-s01-e05 |	What a contraction
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:31,904	| serial-s01-e05 |	You mean I should have asked you 15 years ago
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:34,464	| serial-s01-e05 |	Maybe
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:38,816	| serial-s01-e05 |	That's hard to remember
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:43,424	| serial-s01-e05 |	I didn't even know that I was apart of anything until you just told me that like
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:45,984	| serial-s01-e05 |	No one ever contacted me about everything
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:47,008	| serial-s01-e05 |	Really
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:48,544	| serial-s01-e05 |	Yeah like
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:53,664	| serial-s01-e05 |	No cops ever called you and said with an eye on it
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:57,504	| serial-s01-e05 |	Track that day no no attorneys no attorneys ever called and said
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:26:01,344	| serial-s01-e05 |	Did you work with a non present at track practice at
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:02,880	| serial-s01-e05 |	I don't remember any of that
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:06,208	| serial-s01-e05 |	Will confirm that yes track started at 4
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:09,024	| serial-s01-e05 |	So you had quite a bit of time from the end of school at 2:15
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:12,608	| serial-s01-e05 |	Big round
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:17,984	| serial-s01-e05 |	No playing footsies with your little girlfriend and then go get back to go get ready for practice
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:21,568	| serial-s01-e05 |	Ready and on top of an excuse to be late
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:23,872	| serial-s01-e05 |	Because there was so much
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:30,016	| serial-s01-e05 |	Exactly what would happen if you were really late or you skipped or
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:33,344	| serial-s01-e05 |	It was already,
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:35,392	| serial-s01-e05 |	Actually like giving you my love
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:38,208	| serial-s01-e05 |	Family emergency
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:38,976	| serial-s01-e05 |	Okay
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:47,680	| serial-s01-e05 |	Their coach Michaels I told the cops that are non probably was there that day
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:50,240	| serial-s01-e05 |	3 things you didn't notice of a non wasn't there
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:51,776	| serial-s01-e05 |	But I couldn't be a hundred percent sure
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:58,688	| serial-s01-e05 |	The other thing will told me he saw Jay pick up and also drop off at 9 for track multiple times
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:27:01,248	| serial-s01-e05 |	Yeah that was just normal
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:04,064	| serial-s01-e05 |	Normal to the point where no one will pay attention to it
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:04,576	| serial-s01-e05 |	Right
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:08,672	| serial-s01-e05 |	So you can't solve this crime for us
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:10,976	| serial-s01-e05 |	Wish I could oh my goodness
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:21,216	| serial-s01-e05 |	There's another problem with the track story
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:23,520	| serial-s01-e05 |	Jay says he gets up not at about 6
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:27,616	| serial-s01-e05 |	There's an outgoing call at 5:38 p.m.
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:29,152	| serial-s01-e05 |	2 anons friend Krista
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:30,688	| serial-s01-e05 |	Someone J would not be calling
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:35,040	| serial-s01-e05 |	Which would suggest Adnan had his phone at 5:38 p.m.
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:41,440	| serial-s01-e05 |	Call Pings a tower that's out near that guy Patrick's house so does near where they end up ditching his car
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:43,232	| serial-s01-e05 |	Not at all close to Woodlawn High School
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:47,328	| serial-s01-e05 |	I could keep going here to The Bitter End Of The Night
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:49,376	| serial-s01-e05 |	But I'm hoping you'll take my word for it
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:51,424	| serial-s01-e05 |	The timeline has some problems
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:28:04,992	| serial-s01-e05 |	I'm going to try very hard not to bore you right now but I do want to talk about
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:06,016	| serial-s01-e05 |	Outsell records for a sec
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:12,160	| serial-s01-e05 |	Because I want to know whether the state use the call records accurately and fairly in a dunce trial
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:14,976	| serial-s01-e05 |	Do the records really corroborates a story
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:21,376	| serial-s01-e05 |	Seen some recent reports about how cell phone evidence isn't as reliable as it was once cracked up to be
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:25,216	| serial-s01-e05 |	Washington Post ran a story in June for instance with the headline
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:29,312	| serial-s01-e05 |	Experts say law enforcement's use of cellphone records can be inaccurate
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:34,432	| serial-s01-e05 |	Federal courts in Oregon and Illinois have ruled cell phone evidence inadmissible
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:41,856	| serial-s01-e05 |	The problems arise when you're trying to say I can prove you were at such-and-such a place at such-and-such a time because of the cell
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:43,136	| serial-s01-e05 |	Power that your phone paint
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:49,280	| serial-s01-e05 |	You can't do that with certainty because of the way cell towers get activated and how much charge were they cover
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:55,936	| serial-s01-e05 |	In fact these kinds of records are mostly useful as a way to say where someone wasn't rather than where he or she was
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:29:02,848	| serial-s01-e05 |	Call Pings a tower in downtown Baltimore I'm going to be pretty confident that you're not making that call from
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:04,640	| serial-s01-e05 |	Annapolis or DC
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:06,176	| serial-s01-e05 |	Or Patapsco State Park
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:12,832	| serial-s01-e05 |	The first I know Adam case was the first in Maryland to use cell tower technology as evidence
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:13,856	| serial-s01-e05 |	There's a new thing
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:18,208	| serial-s01-e05 |	Because I am technologically speaking a moron
EDL	00:29:18,208	00:29:20,000	| serial-s01-e05 |	I asked Dana to find out
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:25,888	| serial-s01-e05 |	Did the cell experts who testified at trial present the technology accurately in a way that still holds up
EDL	00:29:27,168	00:29:31,264	| serial-s01-e05 |	So Dana sent this gripping testimony to two different engineering professors
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:33,824	| serial-s01-e05 |	Purdue and one at Stanford University
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:35,360	| serial-s01-e05 |	Yes
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:38,432	| serial-s01-e05 |	The way the science is explained in here is right
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:41,760	| serial-s01-e05 |	Anyway that the stakes expert a guy named Abraham aronowitz
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:43,040	| serial-s01-e05 |	Custody cell site
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:47,904	| serial-s01-e05 |	I just going around to different spots and dialing a number and noting the tower it ping
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:48,672	| serial-s01-e05 |	That's legit
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:50,464	| serial-s01-e05 |	What is not junk science
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:53,536	| serial-s01-e05 |	But that's a different question from
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:57,376	| serial-s01-e05 |	Does the science is explaining here actually support the state's case
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:30:00,192	| serial-s01-e05 |	Did the prosecution deploy that science fair Lee
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:03,776	| serial-s01-e05 |	That's a more complicated question with a more complicated answer
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:12,480	| serial-s01-e05 |	Aronowitz the cell expert and prosecutor Casey Murphy did the sight test
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:13,248	| serial-s01-e05 |	Together
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:16,320	| serial-s01-e05 |	She took him around to various locations connected to Jay story
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:18,112	| serial-s01-e05 |	Explain it to me
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:22,464	| serial-s01-e05 |	They went to the spots that matter the most in the story of the crime
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:24,512	| serial-s01-e05 |	What's the place is like
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:26,048	| serial-s01-e05 |	Jen's house
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:27,584	| serial-s01-e05 |	The Best Buy
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:33,728	| serial-s01-e05 |	We can park where where hey was buried so like those places that are really important Kathy's Apartments
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:37,056	| serial-s01-e05 |	2nd stage 14 of the
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:39,872	| serial-s01-e05 |	That's right. The state in October they do 14 of them
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:42,432	| serial-s01-e05 |	Do you know how many Nevada fit trial
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:45,760	| serial-s01-e05 |	They asked
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:48,576	| serial-s01-e05 |	The cell phone expert about
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:49,344	| serial-s01-e05 |	Four of them
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:52,672	| serial-s01-e05 |	Really for us
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:54,976	| serial-s01-e05 |	Four of them
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:57,792	| serial-s01-e05 |	Because the rest of the tests didn't really help their argument
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:31:01,888	| serial-s01-e05 |	Which is their prerogative their job is to put on the strongest possible case
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:09,056	| serial-s01-e05 |	But of the foresight test they do talk about one is a test run and what's does in a place called gilston Park which I'm not even
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:09,824	| serial-s01-e05 |	Can explain
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:11,360	| serial-s01-e05 |	It's basically irrelevant to our story
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:13,664	| serial-s01-e05 |	The other three places
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:15,968	| serial-s01-e05 |	It all happened in Jay's narrative
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:17,504	| serial-s01-e05 |	After 6 p.m.
EDL	00:31:17,504	00:31:19,552	| serial-s01-e05 |	After J had picked a nun up from track
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:22,624	| serial-s01-e05 |	Serta from 12:07 until
EDL	00:31:22,624	00:31:23,136	| serial-s01-e05 |	6
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:24,928	| serial-s01-e05 |	07
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:26,976	| serial-s01-e05 |	That window of time is where
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:27,488	| serial-s01-e05 |	Kind of
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:30,560	| serial-s01-e05 |	Jay's story doesn't line up
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:31,840	| serial-s01-e05 |	With the cell phone records
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:35,424	| serial-s01-e05 |	And the timeline he's giving is also not lining up with
EDL	00:31:35,424	00:31:36,448	| serial-s01-e05 |	The times of the cell phone
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:40,800	| serial-s01-e05 |	So the towers the times
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:43,616	| serial-s01-e05 |	And Jay's story are not matching right
EDL	00:31:43,616	00:31:45,152	| serial-s01-e05 |	Anywhere in that basic
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:46,432	| serial-s01-e05 |	6 hour.
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:53,600	| serial-s01-e05 |	This is sort of what date and I have experienced on our drive that day but it wasn't plotting out
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:57,440	| serial-s01-e05 |	Just a word about the cell tower testimony
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:31:58,464	| serial-s01-e05 |	It took two days
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:32:00,256	| serial-s01-e05 |	And it was sort of a mess
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:03,328	| serial-s01-e05 |	Announce defense attorney Christina Gutierrez
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:08,448	| serial-s01-e05 |	Claimed she didn't have all the cell record of attention have the cell tower maps she tries to get we're running with
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:09,984	| serial-s01-e05 |	Testimony thrown out
EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:12,032	| serial-s01-e05 |	The judge nearly agrees with her
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:15,872	| serial-s01-e05 |	Prosecutor Kevin urick and the Basking for a mistrial which isn't granted
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:20,224	| serial-s01-e05 |	And this might sound like exciting courtroom fireworks but I just
EDL	00:32:20,224	00:32:23,808	| serial-s01-e05 |	I can't stress enough how tedious this must have been for the jury
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:26,368	| serial-s01-e05 |	And also possibly confusing
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:29,952	| serial-s01-e05 |	This is actually a young guy on the stand he looks
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:32,000	| serial-s01-e05 |	Kind of like George Stephanopoulos
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:33,536	| serial-s01-e05 |	Except tired and fearful
EDL	00:32:34,048	00:32:38,400	| serial-s01-e05 |	Here's one of the more lively moments of his testimony prosecutor Kevin urick talks first
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:40,192	| serial-s01-e05 |	Wiping your breakfast
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:43,776	| serial-s01-e05 |	RAM for cell phones
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:44,288	| serial-s01-e05 |	Functioning
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:45,568	| serial-s01-e05 |	Wireless camera
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:47,872	| serial-s01-e05 |	Overruled if you know
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:51,200	| serial-s01-e05 |	Depends on the quality of the phone
EDL	00:32:51,968	00:32:53,248	| serial-s01-e05 |	How might that affect you
EDL	00:32:53,248	00:32:54,272	| serial-s01-e05 |	Objection
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:56,064	| serial-s01-e05 |	Overalls and again
EDL	00:32:56,832	00:32:57,600	| serial-s01-e05 |	If you know
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:32:59,136	| serial-s01-e05 |	Poor performance
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:00,416	| serial-s01-e05 |	If how so
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:01,440	| serial-s01-e05 |	Objection
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:05,792	| serial-s01-e05 |	Disappointment
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:08,608	| serial-s01-e05 |	Mister on York
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:11,680	| serial-s01-e05 |	Unless you are prepared to last position
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:15,264	| serial-s01-e05 |	Seriously most of it is more boring than that
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:17,824	| serial-s01-e05 |	Which is why I made a Nereid at all so I didn't have to
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:23,712	| serial-s01-e05 |	She explained that the cell site test the prosecution did bring up a trial the ones after 6 p.m.
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:29,600	| serial-s01-e05 |	The first one was about a site near Kathy's apartment remember that's the call Adnan get to Kathy's
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:32,672	| serial-s01-e05 |	When officer Adcock called asking if he seen hey
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:35,232	| serial-s01-e05 |	It says that one worked
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:37,792	| serial-s01-e05 |	At 6:24 p.m. call in the winter
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:44,192	| serial-s01-e05 |	It matches the cell tower and matches the call log and it matches Jay story Adnan story and Kathy
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:44,960	| serial-s01-e05 |	Happy Story 2
EDL	00:33:45,472	00:33:49,056	| serial-s01-e05 |	It puts Jane and on together at a certain place at a certain time
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:52,640	| serial-s01-e05 |	The question is what happens after that
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:59,040	| serial-s01-e05 |	Chase's after the Adcock called they left Kathy's and that's when they went to Barry hay and leakin Park
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:05,952	| serial-s01-e05 |	Then they ditched her car out of Edmondson Avenue and then they headed back toward Westview Mall where they true evidence in
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:06,464	| serial-s01-e05 |	Dumpsters
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:13,888	| serial-s01-e05 |	And if you map the cell towers that ping between 6:24 p.m. and say 805
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:16,192	| serial-s01-e05 |	If you imagine each Tower lighting up
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:18,496	| serial-s01-e05 |	Illuminate this Trail
EDL	00:34:19,264	00:34:21,312	| serial-s01-e05 |	They support the locations in Jay's story
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:26,176	| serial-s01-e05 |	Confirm this with riveting testimony that sounds like this
EDL	00:34:26,944	00:34:27,456	| serial-s01-e05 |	Yes
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:32,576	| serial-s01-e05 |	The most incriminating stop on the route that night is of course we can park
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:37,696	| serial-s01-e05 |	There were two incoming calls one at 7:09 and one at 7:16
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:40,256	| serial-s01-e05 |	The hit a tower at the Northwest end of the park
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:46,400	| serial-s01-e05 |	I asked Dana since the range of that leakin Park Tower reaches Beyond just the territory of the park
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:48,704	| serial-s01-e05 |	Could they have been someplace else besides
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:50,752	| serial-s01-e05 |	Digging a grave in the actual Park
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:53,312	| serial-s01-e05 |	I do have been at someone's house or something
EDL	00:34:55,104	00:34:57,664	| serial-s01-e05 |	It's possible you could have been here with that like this is
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:34:59,712	| serial-s01-e05 |	Patrick's house
EDL	00:34:59,712	00:35:03,808	| serial-s01-e05 |	One of his address for Catherine since these are strips
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:06,624	| serial-s01-e05 |	Maybe you could have been there okay
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:08,928	| serial-s01-e05 |	I think they were probably in Lincoln Park
EDL	00:35:10,208	00:35:10,720	| serial-s01-e05 |	Okay
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:13,024	| serial-s01-e05 |	Because it's
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:13,536	| serial-s01-e05 |	Just
EDL	00:35:14,048	00:35:19,680	| serial-s01-e05 |	I don't think I thought the amount of Lucky would have to have to make up a story like that and then have
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:21,728	| serial-s01-e05 |	The cell phone records corroborate those key points
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:23,008	| serial-s01-e05 |	I just don't
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:25,312	| serial-s01-e05 |	That's possible
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:28,640	| serial-s01-e05 |	Isn't that sort of tantamount to say
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:30,432	| serial-s01-e05 |	I think they were in
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:32,736	| serial-s01-e05 |	The truth
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:35,552	| serial-s01-e05 |	I'm saying I think the cell phone was in Lincoln Park
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:37,856	| serial-s01-e05 |	Right
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:39,392	| serial-s01-e05 |	Looks pretty bad for a non
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:45,792	| serial-s01-e05 |	Because even though the cell towers can't say who was with the phone or who was making the call
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:50,144	| serial-s01-e05 |	And I'm self says he's pretty sure he was with his phone at that time after track
EDL	00:35:50,912	00:35:53,984	| serial-s01-e05 |	Getting his memory is vague. I probably would have
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:57,312	| serial-s01-e05 |	But he says that from what he can remember the evening
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:59,360	| serial-s01-e05 |	After he got the call from officer Adcock
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:02,688	| serial-s01-e05 |	He remembers dropping Jay off at some point
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:05,248	| serial-s01-e05 |	And then he said he would have gone to the mosque for prayers
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:06,016	| serial-s01-e05 |	What is Ramadan
EDL	00:36:06,784	00:36:10,624	| serial-s01-e05 |	He doesn't say he lent his phone out or his car to Jay or anyone else that evening
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:14,464	| serial-s01-e05 |	So according to Adnan he was with the phone
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:17,536	| serial-s01-e05 |	I'm twice that night the phone ping the tower near leakin Park
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:20,352	| serial-s01-e05 |	So bad for Adnan
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:22,656	| serial-s01-e05 |	On the other hand
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:28,032	| serial-s01-e05 |	Also undermined what J tells the cops about that same trip to Lincoln Park
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:32,384	| serial-s01-e05 |	The actor called Cathy's ends about 6:29 p.m.
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:35,456	| serial-s01-e05 |	But we can park calls are 40 minutes later
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:41,344	| serial-s01-e05 |	Put chases after the iPad call henan on left Kathy's and then they do a bunch of different things
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:45,952	| serial-s01-e05 |	They drive to Jay's house for shovels then to I-70 park and ride for Hays
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:52,096	| serial-s01-e05 |	Karsten Jacobs to McDonalds back by school to wait for Adnan says he's there waiting for about 20 minutes
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:56,960	| serial-s01-e05 |	Then they drive all around for a while back over to Patapsco then
EDL	00:36:56,960	00:36:57,728	| serial-s01-e05 |	Security
EDL	00:36:57,728	00:36:59,520	| serial-s01-e05 |	Before they finally get to Lincoln Park
EDL	00:37:00,544	00:37:02,592	| serial-s01-e05 |	All that what I just described
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:04,384	| serial-s01-e05 |	That takes an hour and 20 minutes
EDL	00:37:04,896	00:37:06,688	| serial-s01-e05 |	Twice as long in other words
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:08,224	| serial-s01-e05 |	Pinnacle lock accounts for
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:12,320	| serial-s01-e05 |	I'm not trying to be Petty Here
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:16,160	| serial-s01-e05 |	I don't think we should hold to some Crystal Clear timeline
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:21,280	| serial-s01-e05 |	How could you possibly remember each twist and turn and phone call from that day 6 weeks later
EDL	00:37:22,048	00:37:23,072	| serial-s01-e05 |	Ever
EDL	00:37:23,072	00:37:24,608	| serial-s01-e05 |	If the state is saying
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:29,472	| serial-s01-e05 |	Adnan Syed is guilty because we have this witness and his story is backed up by cell records
EDL	00:37:30,240	00:37:35,872	| serial-s01-e05 |	What I see is have this witness but his story has shifted rather significantly over time
EDL	00:37:36,384	00:37:41,504	| serial-s01-e05 |	And you have his call records but I don't think there is Ironclad as you're making them out to be
EDL	00:37:42,528	00:37:46,112	| serial-s01-e05 |	Because for the most part they don't exactly align with your Witnesses narrative
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:50,208	| serial-s01-e05 |	There are key moments when they do support his version of that night
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:52,512	| serial-s01-e05 |	But what about the rest of the day
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:09,408	| serial-s01-e05 |	Whatever is true even with the prosecutor says
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:12,736	| serial-s01-e05 |	Moses tablet
EDL	00:38:12,736	00:38:16,832	| serial-s01-e05 |	Whatever something I'm saying is like the Holy Grail we don't know where it is
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:18,880	| serial-s01-e05 |	It really exists
EDL	00:38:19,392	00:38:23,232	| serial-s01-e05 |	But that's not cool though because now what you're saying is that you can use
EDL	00:38:23,232	00:38:24,256	| serial-s01-e05 |	Shuffle records
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:25,536	| serial-s01-e05 |	When it benefits me
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:30,400	| serial-s01-e05 |	That was a 30-minute cutoff
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:31,424	| serial-s01-e05 |	Adhan called back
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:37,568	| serial-s01-e05 |	So but just finished the rent went on
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:39,104	| serial-s01-e05 |	All the calls
EDL	00:38:39,616	00:38:42,432	| serial-s01-e05 |	The 236 call is the most Troublesome to Anan
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:44,480	| serial-s01-e05 |	It's the one he probably thinks about the most
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:47,296	| serial-s01-e05 |	Because that's the call that starts the whole chain
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:51,648	| serial-s01-e05 |	He also thinks about it because he says he has an alibi for that time
EDL	00:38:51,648	00:38:52,672	| serial-s01-e05 |	The Asia letters
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:54,464	| serial-s01-e05 |	Where she said she saw him in the library
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:38:58,816	| serial-s01-e05 |	Here's a weird thing about the 236 call
EDL	00:38:58,816	00:39:03,168	| serial-s01-e05 |	The prosecutors are very clear at trial that this is the come and get me I'm at Best Buy call
EDL	00:39:03,680	00:39:06,240	| serial-s01-e05 |	But they're not basing it on anyone's testimony
EDL	00:39:06,752	00:39:09,056	| serial-s01-e05 |	Jennifer says the call was at that time
EDL	00:39:09,056	00:39:13,664	| serial-s01-e05 |	He says repeatedly that Adnan called him around 3:40 or 3:45
EDL	00:39:13,664	00:39:16,992	| serial-s01-e05 |	Jen also says that's about when Jay left her house that day
EDL	00:39:17,760	00:39:21,600	| serial-s01-e05 |	But there is no incoming call at or near 345 on the call log
EDL	00:39:22,112	00:39:24,928	| serial-s01-e05 |	The prosecution has to go with 236
EDL	00:39:24,928	00:39:28,768	| serial-s01-e05 |	Because it's the only one that's sort of lines jstory up with the log
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:29,792	| serial-s01-e05 |	Is their only choice
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:34,912	| serial-s01-e05 |	When you tease apart the state's case you can get tripped up on details like this
EDL	00:39:35,424	00:39:40,032	| serial-s01-e05 |	Which is maybe why prosecutor Kevin urick address this head-on in his opening statement to the jury
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:41,312	| serial-s01-e05 |	He told them
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:43,104	| serial-s01-e05 |	Look at the big picture
EDL	00:39:43,872	00:39:46,944	| serial-s01-e05 |	The main plot points in Jay story have been consistent
EDL	00:39:47,456	00:39:50,016	| serial-s01-e05 |	He tells them that consistently J quote
EDL	00:39:50,016	00:39:53,344	| serial-s01-e05 |	Has always given the same story about what the defendant did wear
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:56,928	| serial-s01-e05 |	Consistently he tells Jennifer a consistent story
EDL	00:39:56,928	00:39:59,488	| serial-s01-e05 |	He tells police a consistent story about the defendant
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:02,560	| serial-s01-e05 |	It has consistently the defendants involvement
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:04,608	| serial-s01-e05 |	The defendant's actions on that day
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:06,912	| serial-s01-e05 |	He has never wavered on that point unquote
EDL	00:40:08,448	00:40:10,240	| serial-s01-e05 |	That is a lot of consistently is
EDL	00:40:10,752	00:40:13,312	| serial-s01-e05 |	Maybe it's not great oratory
EDL	00:40:13,312	00:40:15,616	| serial-s01-e05 |	It does have the advantage of being true
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:19,456	| serial-s01-e05 |	Commence wild a particular shifted
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:21,248	| serial-s01-e05 |	The spine of his story did not
EDL	00:40:21,760	00:40:26,368	| serial-s01-e05 |	Anon told Jay was going to do it and then showed him the body they buried her in Lincoln Park
EDL	00:40:26,368	00:40:27,392	| serial-s01-e05 |	They ditched her car
EDL	00:40:27,904	00:40:29,696	| serial-s01-e05 |	Jay has been consistent on those points
EDL	00:40:31,488	00:40:34,816	| serial-s01-e05 |	Itsfunneh there's this part of the trial that keeps coming back to me
EDL	00:40:34,816	00:40:37,888	| serial-s01-e05 |	Twin Christina Gutierrez is cross-examining J
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:40,960	| serial-s01-e05 |	Just pointing out that he lied to detectives about various things
EDL	00:40:40,960	00:40:45,568	| serial-s01-e05 |	Including the location where he says Adnan showed him his body in the trunk of the car
EDL	00:40:46,080	00:40:48,384	| serial-s01-e05 |	What you told them
EDL	00:40:48,384	00:40:51,968	| serial-s01-e05 |	Interactive showing them that place
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:40:56,832	| serial-s01-e05 |	They're not
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:41:00,160	| serial-s01-e05 |	What's the opposite of the
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:02,464	| serial-s01-e05 |	Objection sustained
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:07,584	| serial-s01-e05 |	You told them something that is not
EDL	00:41:07,584	00:41:12,192	| serial-s01-e05 |	The truth Naruto
EDL	00:41:12,192	00:41:15,776	| serial-s01-e05 |	You back it up showing them up slang
EDL	00:41:16,288	00:41:17,824	| serial-s01-e05 |	That was not true
EDL	00:41:19,104	00:41:20,128	| serial-s01-e05 |	I told him the truth
EDL	00:41:20,640	00:41:22,688	| serial-s01-e05 |	I did not show them in a location extreme now
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:26,528	| serial-s01-e05 |	He says I told him the truth
EDL	00:41:26,528	00:41:28,576	| serial-s01-e05 |	I did not show them a location that was true
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:34,208	| serial-s01-e05 |	Is oxymoronic as that sounds I think I see what he saying
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:36,256	| serial-s01-e05 |	Yes I told him lies
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:37,280	| serial-s01-e05 |	I told the truth
EDL	00:41:38,048	00:41:39,328	| serial-s01-e05 |	Overall I told the truth
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:43,424	| serial-s01-e05 |	Parts of J story that make no sense
EDL	00:41:43,936	00:41:47,008	| serial-s01-e05 |	It seems like there must have been more going on than he's saying
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:49,824	| serial-s01-e05 |	But here's what's also the truth
EDL	00:41:50,592	00:41:53,407	| serial-s01-e05 |	You can say the same thing about Adnan Story 2
