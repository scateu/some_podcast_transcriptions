EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:21,695	| serial-s03-e04 |	Which means the county could try to resend item in future
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:22,719	| serial-s03-e04 |	It for now

EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:32,703	| serial-s03-e04 |	Killed in her car seat
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:39,615	| serial-s03-e04 |	It was a kind of incident that makes a city stop arguing for a bit over what the criminal justice system is doing right and what it's doing

EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:56,255	| serial-s03-e04 |	Because I figured if any homicides were going to get the full menu of police and prosecution resources
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:57,023	| serial-s03-e04 |	It would be these

EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:05,119	| serial-s03-e04 |	I was not able to ask the police what the heck happened
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:12,031	| serial-s03-e04 |	The detectives weren't allowed to talk to me and techno Cleveland officials no police officials no one from the mayor's office
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:15,359	| serial-s03-e04 |	Would agree to an on-the-record interview for the series
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:19,455	| serial-s03-e04 |	I frankly never encountered a city government with a jaw locked up tighter than Cleveland
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:21,247	| serial-s03-e04 |	They wanted nothing to do with us
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:26,623	| serial-s03-e04 |	Which is too bad because Cleveland has some interesting Leaders with ideas and lots to say about their City
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:33,023	| serial-s03-e04 |	Just not to me so well I did meet the homicide detectives in charge of aavielle Wakefield case I could not
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:33,535	| serial-s03-e04 |	Ask them
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:37,119	| serial-s03-e04 |	How much did you know about Davon Holmes before you arrested him
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,167	| serial-s03-e04 |	Instead
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:39,935	| serial-s03-e04 |	I went to Dave on
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:44,543	| serial-s03-e04 |	He started at the beginning right after Thanksgiving 2015
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:47,359	| serial-s03-e04 |	I was at my mom house going to make me a plate from
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:48,383	| serial-s03-e04 |	Leftover Thanksgiving
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:52,735	| serial-s03-e04 |	I was making a play in my mom said
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:54,271	| serial-s03-e04 |	What the police doing her like that
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:09:00,671	| serial-s03-e04 |	So meet me at me I just look I ain't got nothing to be scared of I ain't you know I'm saying I did nothing wrong
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:02,719	| serial-s03-e04 |	So I come in and dining room my mom said come here
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:05,279	| serial-s03-e04 |	So I woke up there
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:06,559	| serial-s03-e04 |	They just
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:07,071	| serial-s03-e04 |	Arrest
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,607	| serial-s03-e04 |	Wake up me up
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:12,447	| serial-s03-e04 |	I said what am I being arrested for they don't talk to you
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:13,215	| serial-s03-e04 |	Wouldn't talk to me
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:15,263	| serial-s03-e04 |	They say what I say what am I being arrested for
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:18,335	| serial-s03-e04 |	He say will tell you when you get downtown
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:21,407	| serial-s03-e04 |	It wasn't just a couple of cops at the door
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:26,015	| serial-s03-e04 |	It was the US Marshal's Northern Ohio violent fugitive task force in full battle rattle
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:28,575	| serial-s03-e04 |	There's a warrant out for his arrest
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:29,599	| serial-s03-e04 |	But he didn't know that
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:33,183	| serial-s03-e04 |	They take him downtown to the Justice Center to an interview room
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:34,463	| serial-s03-e04 |	And I sent a detective
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:40,351	| serial-s03-e04 |	You just dissed you a baby killer you you killed the baby I know you did
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:42,143	| serial-s03-e04 |	Everybody saying you did it we know you did it
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:47,519	| serial-s03-e04 |	Me I don't know what you talkin about I wasn't there I heard about the tile done
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:50,847	| serial-s03-e04 |	I feel bad but I'm not the one that did it y'all got the wrong guy
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:53,151	| serial-s03-e04 |	Are you you baby killer
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:56,223	| serial-s03-e04 |	You did wrong Houston

EDL	00:09:58,527	00:10:00,319	| serial-s03-e04 |	Economy all type of baby killers in
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:02,111	| serial-s03-e04 |	Towers in
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:03,135	| serial-s03-e04 |	Just belittling me
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:03,903	| serial-s03-e04 |	Hologram board
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:07,999	| serial-s03-e04 |	It was to the point that I just can't take it no more
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:10,559	| serial-s03-e04 |	Cuz I was cuffed up
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:12,351	| serial-s03-e04 |	I know what was going on
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:15,935	| serial-s03-e04 |	I think they was trying to scare me to
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:18,495	| serial-s03-e04 |	Like
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:19,263	| serial-s03-e04 |	Telling myself
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:21,823	| serial-s03-e04 |	But I can confess
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:23,615	| serial-s03-e04 |	I can confess to somebody to do
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:25,407	| serial-s03-e04 |	People do it all the time
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:26,687	| serial-s03-e04 |	You know
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:27,199	| serial-s03-e04 |	But
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:29,503	| serial-s03-e04 |	I was really innocent
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:31,807	| serial-s03-e04 |	Sussy okay I'm ready to go home
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:34,879	| serial-s03-e04 |	So the lady detective said no
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:35,647	| serial-s03-e04 |	You going
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:37,695	| serial-s03-e04 |	To jail for the rest of your life
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:41,023	| serial-s03-e04 |	The lady detective was Rhonda Gray
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:45,119	| serial-s03-e04 |	Same one who listen to Avila Wakefield mother screaming down the halls of the ER
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:50,751	| serial-s03-e04 |	Davon understood the pressure political and personal to solve crimes like these
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:53,055	| serial-s03-e04 |	Over weeks then months
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:54,335	| serial-s03-e04 |	That's what scared him
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:57,407	| serial-s03-e04 |	The knowledge that he didn't kill ivy all Wakefield
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:11:00,479	| serial-s03-e04 |	And he could well be convicted for killing aavielle Wakefield
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:04,063	| serial-s03-e04 |	Cuz I know to 3-year thano probation
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:06,367	| serial-s03-e04 |	Treatment this is the rest of my life
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,135	| serial-s03-e04 |	The death penalty
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,927	| serial-s03-e04 |	Does a child we talkin
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:11,487	| serial-s03-e04 |	So I know what to do
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:17,887	| serial-s03-e04 |	Davon had been locked up before but the circumstances this time made everything more foul
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:24,031	| serial-s03-e04 |	The creeping mold the roaches having to wash his clothes and sheets in the sink or more often the toilet
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:30,431	| serial-s03-e04 |	The Relentless bologna sandwiches nothing healthy to eat from commissary no no no no
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:36,831	| serial-s03-e04 |	Norfolk Norfolk Norfolk do this when a thing sticks in his mind
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:38,111	| serial-s03-e04 |	Repeat it in batches
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:43,999	| serial-s03-e04 |	Cuz if he's skipping a mental Stone Princeton one of his appointed attorneys Michael Shaughnessy
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:48,607	| serial-s03-e04 |	Is Shaughnessy a good dude though he a really good dude here real good dude
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:52,447	| serial-s03-e04 |	Quebedeaux ain't here just now
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:58,335	| serial-s03-e04 |	Savon said she honestly believed him so he didn't commit this crime
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:05,247	| serial-s03-e04 |	You could do what do they say do you like what do they say the state had against you
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:06,527	| serial-s03-e04 |	Lodi weather
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:08,575	| serial-s03-e04 |	Somebody saying they save me
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:13,183	| serial-s03-e04 |	Running with a gun in my hand somebody saying they can't identify me
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:15,999	| serial-s03-e04 |	No fingerprints no guns no ballistic test
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:18,303	| serial-s03-e04 |	No not all his work
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:20,351	| serial-s03-e04 |	Souly had
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:24,447	| serial-s03-e04 |	China Sea in another appointed attorney the one I met at the party
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:30,847	| serial-s03-e04 |	Would visit Des Moines periodically tell him they were working on it you have an interest in keep your head up.
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:32,127	| serial-s03-e04 |	Davon said he was struggling
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:35,455	| serial-s03-e04 |	He was pent-up in every way a person can be
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:40,831	| serial-s03-e04 |	He said it was almost a relief when he got in a fight with some guy and got sent to the hole
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:44,671	| serial-s03-e04 |	About five months in a date was set for diwan's trial
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:45,695	| serial-s03-e04 |	June 27th
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:47,743	| serial-s03-e04 |	June 27th came and went
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:49,791	| serial-s03-e04 |	They said another child
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:50,815	| serial-s03-e04 |	For late October
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:52,863	| serial-s03-e04 |	Week before that trial date
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:53,887	| serial-s03-e04 |	It too was canceled
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:57,471	| serial-s03-e04 |	A month after that they Vaughn's lawyers came to see him in jail
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,007	| serial-s03-e04 |	They said
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:00,799	| serial-s03-e04 |	Congratulations you're going home
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:03,871	| serial-s03-e04 |	It been a year since he was arrested
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:06,175	| serial-s03-e04 |	Davon said don't play with me like that
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:09,247	| serial-s03-e04 |	He say you go home I say when he said today
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:12,575	| serial-s03-e04 |	I said call my mom and tell him to come get me
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:14,111	| serial-s03-e04 |	Cuz I just didn't believe them
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:15,903	| serial-s03-e04 |	I didn't call my mom and tell her to come get me
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:17,439	| serial-s03-e04 |	Dakar
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:21,791	| serial-s03-e04 |	Can do number cry
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:23,071	| serial-s03-e04 |	It was just like
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:25,631	| serial-s03-e04 |	All my Warriors
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:27,167	| serial-s03-e04 |	What's relief
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:30,239	| serial-s03-e04 |	But it's still hurting me cuz
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:32,287	| serial-s03-e04 |	I just did a year
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:34,335	| serial-s03-e04 |	Wasted a year of my life
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:36,895	| serial-s03-e04 |	But telling these people is saying
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:37,407	| serial-s03-e04 |	They
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:39,711	| serial-s03-e04 |	I did not do it
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:44,319	| serial-s03-e04 |	David's not mad that the cops brought him in for audio Wakefield stuff
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:45,599	| serial-s03-e04 |	He feels like
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:48,415	| serial-s03-e04 |	They had information they acted on that information
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:49,183	| serial-s03-e04 |	Fair enough
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:50,975	| serial-s03-e04 |	What came after
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:51,743	| serial-s03-e04 |	Post-arrest
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:53,279	| serial-s03-e04 |	He's mad about
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:56,095	| serial-s03-e04 |	I feel like they should have did a little bit more investigation
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:59,423	| serial-s03-e04 |	Cleveland they don't
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:00,447	| serial-s03-e04 |	Augusta cake
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:02,751	| serial-s03-e04 |	They good when they come and get somebody
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:05,055	| serial-s03-e04 |	Today
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:07,103	| serial-s03-e04 |	Dang good cops for investigation
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:10,687	| serial-s03-e04 |	When I asked Avon why they finally let him go
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:11,455	| serial-s03-e04 |	He said this
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:12,991	| serial-s03-e04 |	Does the family
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:16,063	| serial-s03-e04 |	The family said that they know I had nothing to do with it
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:18,111	| serial-s03-e04 |	With which family
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:19,903	| serial-s03-e04 |	The child family
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:26,303	| serial-s03-e04 |	Wait that's what your lawyers told you that the child's family said you didn't have anything to do that in the Cordon
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:29,119	| serial-s03-e04 |	Said they heard I had nothing to do with it
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:31,679	| serial-s03-e04 |	How would the family now
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:35,007	| serial-s03-e04 |	That's what I like
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:37,823	| serial-s03-e04 |	Understand by the same time I'm happy that day
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:40,383	| serial-s03-e04 |	Realizing that I read into it
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:42,431	| serial-s03-e04 |	I don't think that's what happened
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:43,967	| serial-s03-e04 |	My mother told me
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:45,759	| serial-s03-e04 |	He said that's why you're getting out
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:49,087	| serial-s03-e04 |	So we had court in the family came
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:51,903	| serial-s03-e04 |	And said you didn't have nothing to do with it
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:53,439	| serial-s03-e04 |	And judge
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:55,743	| serial-s03-e04 |	Dismiss the case right there
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:14:59,583	| serial-s03-e04 |	That's crazy
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,887	| serial-s03-e04 |	If they had court why weren't you there
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:04,191	| serial-s03-e04 |	That's what I understand
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:07,519	| serial-s03-e04 |	This story made no sense to me
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:09,311	| serial-s03-e04 |	But once I thought about it
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:10,847	| serial-s03-e04 |	It makes sense why it would make no sense
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:14,687	| serial-s03-e04 |	Many of the defendants I talk to in Cleveland
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:16,735	| serial-s03-e04 |	Especially the ones who were waiting in jail
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:19,807	| serial-s03-e04 |	I often knew more about what was going on with their cases and they did
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:22,623	| serial-s03-e04 |	Just taking a quick look at the public records
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:26,975	| serial-s03-e04 |	Because their contact with the outside world with the workings of the Court
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:32,095	| serial-s03-e04 |	Is stymied by multiple layers interference like a frustrating game of telephone
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:36,447	| serial-s03-e04 |	Maybe you're signed attorneys checking in briefly but that's about it
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:42,847	| serial-s03-e04 |	So there you are in the county jail only an elevator right away from the courtroom and Prosecutors office but all you have is a
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:46,431	| serial-s03-e04 |	Cloudy porthole to help you decipher what's going on upstairs
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:53,343	| serial-s03-e04 |	I don't know what evidence Dave us attorneys did or didn't show up I don't know what they told Davon about why he was being released
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:56,671	| serial-s03-e04 |	Attorneys will not talk to me for the story
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:59,231	| serial-s03-e04 |	I think they said no out of concern for Davon
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:06,143	| serial-s03-e04 |	The case of Bobby a Wakefield is still open
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:12,543	| serial-s03-e04 |	From the list of evidence the state handed over to the
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:16,895	| serial-s03-e04 |	And I can roughly piece together the swatches of information that led to demands arrest
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:23,551	| serial-s03-e04 |	In the days right after the shooting anonymous tips began income in certain names begin to percolate and repeat
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:27,135	| serial-s03-e04 |	Appears 4 days after the shooting
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:31,743	| serial-s03-e04 |	Crime Stoppers tip Davon Holmes another one the next day
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:37,119	| serial-s03-e04 |	Couple days after that TC telephone call from Anonymous mail reef tank
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:39,679	| serial-s03-e04 |	Take his Dave on his nickname forever
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:41,727	| serial-s03-e04 |	Other names were still coming into
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:44,287	| serial-s03-e04 |	Then on October 10th
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:49,151	| serial-s03-e04 |	Little more than a week after the shooting police show a photo lineup to an eyewitness
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:51,455	| serial-s03-e04 |	I'm going to call this eyewitness the landscaper
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:52,991	| serial-s03-e04 |	Because he worked at a landscaper
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:56,831	| serial-s03-e04 |	The landscaper was there when the shooting happened
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:59,391	| serial-s03-e04 |	On East 145th Street off Kinsman Road
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:01,951	| serial-s03-e04 |	Brighten the middle of the 4th Police District
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:03,487	| serial-s03-e04 |	Busiest one in the city
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:05,279	| serial-s03-e04 |	Possibly the entire state of Ohio
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:09,119	| serial-s03-e04 |	The landscaper been working at a house across the street for some months
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:15,519	| serial-s03-e04 |	I only know the specifics because Dave owns lawyers filed a motion to suppress the evidence the landscaper gave police
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:21,407	| serial-s03-e04 |	In their motion they say that at first the landscaper had told police he hadn't seen the shooter
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:23,967	| serial-s03-e04 |	But that a little more than a week later
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:25,759	| serial-s03-e04 |	He came forward to say that in fact
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:26,271	| serial-s03-e04 |	She had
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:28,575	| serial-s03-e04 |	The police show him some photo arrays
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:31,647	| serial-s03-e04 |	He doesn't positively identify anyone
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:34,207	| serial-s03-e04 |	But he says two people look sort of like the shooter
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:35,743	| serial-s03-e04 |	Neither of them was Davon
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:40,095	| serial-s03-e04 |	The defense says Damon's photo was in that initial array
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:41,119	| serial-s03-e04 |	State says it wasn't
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:46,495	| serial-s03-e04 |	Any case about 5 Weeks Later the cops show the landscaper another photo lineup
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:48,799	| serial-s03-e04 |	First he rules out Davon
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:50,079	| serial-s03-e04 |	Then changes his mind
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:52,383	| serial-s03-e04 |	Sense of someone else's photo looks like the shooter
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:55,455	| serial-s03-e04 |	Finally a week after that
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:58,015	| serial-s03-e04 |	So 57 days after the shooting
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:18:00,319	| serial-s03-e04 |	They show the landscaper that same photo array
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:05,695	| serial-s03-e04 |	And he says he's going to go with his gut and that he's 90% sure it's this guy right here
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:06,975	| serial-s03-e04 |	Davon Holmes
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:15,935	| serial-s03-e04 |	Inner suppression motion Des Moines lawyers reference studies about how memory is malleable and subject to contamination
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:18,751	| serial-s03-e04 |	Especially in times of high stress we missed details
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:23,871	| serial-s03-e04 |	They argue the Davon doesn't really match the landscapers initial description of the shooter
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:27,199	| serial-s03-e04 |	Devon is younger shorter significantly heavier
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:33,599	| serial-s03-e04 |	By showing the landscaper his photo in these lineups maybe the police were in fact creating a memory
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:35,647	| serial-s03-e04 |	Landscaper was recognizing Davon
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:38,975	| serial-s03-e04 |	Because he'd seen him before in these very photo arrays
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:46,143	| serial-s03-e04 |	They don't mention the studies I start looking into this the talk about how when eyewitnesses pick out someone as a purpose
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:51,519	| serial-s03-e04 |	Trader in a police lineup they identify innocent people more than 30% of the time
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:57,919	| serial-s03-e04 |	30% or the ones that say you're never supposed to show an eyewitness the same photo more than once
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:59,711	| serial-s03-e04 |	So yeah
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:05,087	| serial-s03-e04 |	Nearly two months after the fact the landscaper is suddenly 90% sure of his ID
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:13,791	| serial-s03-e04 |	I was aware of the landscaper statement but he was more focused on and Trouble by
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:15,583	| serial-s03-e04 |	Another ID witness the state had
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:17,375	| serial-s03-e04 |	A guy I'm going to call John
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:22,495	| serial-s03-e04 |	Steven said John claimed to have seen Dave on after the shooting running with a gun in his hand
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:26,335	| serial-s03-e04 |	John had given this evidence when he himself was locked up
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:27,871	| serial-s03-e04 |	And facing serious charges
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:30,431	| serial-s03-e04 |	Aggravated robbery felonious assault
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:30,943	| serial-s03-e04 |	Kidnapping
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:35,039	| serial-s03-e04 |	Damon thinks it's John statement that got him arrested
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:39,647	| serial-s03-e04 |	Paper it does look as if the case clicked into place as soon as John talked
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:43,743	| serial-s03-e04 |	Court records show that detectives talk to John on November 18th
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:48,607	| serial-s03-e04 |	And that same day they showed the landscaper another photo lineup with a Vons picture in it
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:53,215	| serial-s03-e04 |	9 days later is when the violent fugitive task force banks on Devon store
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:54,495	| serial-s03-e04 |	Interruptus Thanksgiving leftover
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:59,103	| serial-s03-e04 |	But the disturbing part for Davon is that he knows John
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:00,127	| serial-s03-e04 |	Well
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:02,175	| serial-s03-e04 |	And why did he idea
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:10,367	| serial-s03-e04 |	It was it was something to happen with my brother a long time ago
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:13,951	| serial-s03-e04 |	Invite you want a little tangent now
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:16,255	| serial-s03-e04 |	Just because when I first heard what happened
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:17,535	| serial-s03-e04 |	I couldn't quite believe it
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:21,631	| serial-s03-e04 |	John's older brother and a Vons older brother
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:22,143	| serial-s03-e04 |	We're best friends
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:27,519	| serial-s03-e04 |	One day in 2007 when David's brother was 16 John's brother was 15
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:30,847	| serial-s03-e04 |	They tried to rob a guy coming back from the corner store
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:33,151	| serial-s03-e04 |	We just bought Newport cigarettes in a bag of popcorn
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:35,455	| serial-s03-e04 |	Teenagers had a gun
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:36,991	| serial-s03-e04 |	The guy also had a gun
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:39,551	| serial-s03-e04 |	And he shot and killed John's brother
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:40,319	| serial-s03-e04 |	The fifteen-year-old
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:43,135	| serial-s03-e04 |	Because they were together
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:44,415	| serial-s03-e04 |	And we're trying to commit a crime
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:48,511	| serial-s03-e04 |	And this is the part that blew my mind until I looked up the definition of felony murder
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:52,607	| serial-s03-e04 |	But de Vaughn's brother was charged with the murder of his best friend
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:54,655	| serial-s03-e04 |	Even though he didn't fire the weapon
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:59,519	| serial-s03-e04 |	Davon 16 year old brother was bound over to the Justice Center
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:02,079	| serial-s03-e04 |	Meaning he was transferred from Juvenile Court
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:04,639	| serial-s03-e04 |	Where the maximum sentence he could get was around 5 years
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:06,687	| serial-s03-e04 |	And prosecuted as an adult
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:09,759	| serial-s03-e04 |	He was sentenced to 18 years to life
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:13,087	| serial-s03-e04 |	He can try for parole in March of 2025
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:14,111	| serial-s03-e04 |	He's unlikely to get it
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:17,440	| serial-s03-e04 |	In the aftermath of all this
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:20,512	| serial-s03-e04 |	David said his family and John's family refine
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:22,304	| serial-s03-e04 |	Animosity
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:24,608	| serial-s03-e04 |	In fact his uncle is with John's mom
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:26,144	| serial-s03-e04 |	I thought of John has a brother
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:32,800	| serial-s03-e04 |	The way John statement was worded interpretation was that John wanted to hurt Deion's family
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:36,640	| serial-s03-e04 |	Maybe he blamed a Vons brother for his own brother's death
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:37,920	| serial-s03-e04 |	And wanted Revenge
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:43,040	| serial-s03-e04 |	I like the pain
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:49,440	| serial-s03-e04 |	I want to make clear that this isn't one of those cases where the honor student gets profiled by the cops because he was wearing a hoodie and lives in Ark
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:49,952	| serial-s03-e04 |	Kingsman
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:52,256	| serial-s03-e04 |	When was treated like The Usual Suspects
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:54,304	| serial-s03-e04 |	Because he is the usual
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:57,888	| serial-s03-e04 |	Who's part of the largest most Troublesome gang in Cleveland
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:58,656	| serial-s03-e04 |	The heartless felons
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:05,568	| serial-s03-e04 |	Imagine the cops in Cleveland's fourth district were familiar with the Burley kid called tank long before I'll be awake field was killed
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:09,920	| serial-s03-e04 |	What is brother was locked up for his best friend's death
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:11,200	| serial-s03-e04 |	Davon was 10 years old
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:14,016	| serial-s03-e04 |	Damon told me himself was first locked up
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:15,040	| serial-s03-e04 |	When he was 10 years old
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:16,832	| serial-s03-e04 |	Strong arm robbery
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:20,160	| serial-s03-e04 |	Much as I am tempted to connect these two events
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:21,440	| serial-s03-e04 |	Davon is in
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:25,024	| serial-s03-e04 |	Made it I was angry about it like you I lost my big brother but
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:29,888	| serial-s03-e04 |	That wasn't the reason I was in the streets cuz I was in the streets when he was home
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:31,936	| serial-s03-e04 |	My brother used to make me go home
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:33,728	| serial-s03-e04 |	I get out go home
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:34,496	| serial-s03-e04 |	And I

EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:47,808	| serial-s03-e04 |	Throwing rocks at cars just being bad
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:54,208	| serial-s03-e04 |	And were you just skipping school all the time are you going to school fight

EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:15,712	| serial-s03-e04 |	They called my mama mama chase me through the school this is the school right across the street from Dave a
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:18,016	| serial-s03-e04 |	Don's house it's closed now boarded up
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:21,344	| serial-s03-e04 |	Davon has abiding respect for his mother
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:24,672	| serial-s03-e04 |	She loves them she tried to guide him never gave up on him
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:30,304	| serial-s03-e04 |	But when he was at that age he says he listen to No One not as mother definitely not as teachers

EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:46,304	| serial-s03-e04 |	I don't care what you did
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:48,352	| serial-s03-e04 |	It don't matter if you was

EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:57,568	| serial-s03-e04 |	I am the oldest makes me not even if even if it was a lady
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:28:03,456	| serial-s03-e04 |	Because it's your principal you're just saying it's not about the consequences for me it's just a principle
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:05,248	| serial-s03-e04 |	That's against my religion
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:07,296	| serial-s03-e04 |	Number say that
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:09,344	| serial-s03-e04 |	That's against my religion to tell us
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:12,672	| serial-s03-e04 |	Cuz you're going to make me I'm not going to feel right
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:14,464	| serial-s03-e04 |	Imma feel less of a man
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:17,536	| serial-s03-e04 |	What if it was like a relative who is your
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:18,304	| serial-s03-e04 |	The victim of it
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:23,936	| serial-s03-e04 |	You don't even has your principal Bend at all with
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:27,520	| serial-s03-e04 |	Nature of the crime yet
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:28,800	| serial-s03-e04 |	No
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:32,384	| serial-s03-e04 |	We just going to have to handle it a different way
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:34,688	| serial-s03-e04 |	Meaning Street Justice
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:36,480	| serial-s03-e04 |	Which Davon can get behind
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:40,576	| serial-s03-e04 |	The Cleveland Police Justice or Justice Center Justice
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:41,088	| serial-s03-e04 |	No way
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:46,720	| serial-s03-e04 |	This is precisely what vexes police investigations in cases like ivl's
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:49,280	| serial-s03-e04 |	It's probably as old as crime itself
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:51,072	| serial-s03-e04 |	Friendly's old is organized crime
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:51,840	| serial-s03-e04 |	No snitching
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:54,912	| serial-s03-e04 |	It's not just about gangster quotes of loyalty though
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:58,752	| serial-s03-e04 |	Over the decades it's been helped Along by the criminal justice system itself
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:00,544	| serial-s03-e04 |	Especially during the War on Drugs
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:05,408	| serial-s03-e04 |	You could argue no snitching was a rational response to the widespread use of low-level informants
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:08,736	| serial-s03-e04 |	To be threatened with mandatory prison sentences if they didn't talk
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:12,576	| serial-s03-e04 |	Prom was his Lola bond form and sometimes didn't know that much
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:16,672	| serial-s03-e04 |	Some people are getting arrested based on flimsy or false information
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:20,768	| serial-s03-e04 |	And then of course people don't cooperate because of straight up fear
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:22,560	| serial-s03-e04 |	Well-supported fear
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:27,936	| serial-s03-e04 |	Until we watch the no snitching principle play out during trials and Cleveland
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:31,008	| serial-s03-e04 |	I've never fully understood How Deeply it muddies cases
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:33,824	| serial-s03-e04 |	We watched a capital murder case
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:35,872	| serial-s03-e04 |	In which Witnesses were visibly scared
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:38,176	| serial-s03-e04 |	Even some of the jurors were scared
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:39,200	| serial-s03-e04 |	And they weren't paranoid
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:41,504	| serial-s03-e04 |	The defendant was a heartless felon
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:45,856	| serial-s03-e04 |	Already one witness have been shot and killed in his driveway just before he was supposed to come to court
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:49,696	| serial-s03-e04 |	We watched another case in which a police informant had been murdered
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:52,000	| serial-s03-e04 |	We saw people squirm on the stand
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:52,768	| serial-s03-e04 |	Prevaricate
EDL	00:29:54,304	00:29:58,400	| serial-s03-e04 |	Probably the most torture testimony we saw it was from a man who goes by RJ
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:29:59,680	| serial-s03-e04 |	Hey banana gang
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:05,056	| serial-s03-e04 |	He was an important witness during the trial for the murder of one of the other children killed that follow 2015
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:06,336	| serial-s03-e04 |	Major Howard
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:07,872	| serial-s03-e04 |	It was 3 years old
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:09,920	| serial-s03-e04 |	It was a drive-by
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:13,248	| serial-s03-e04 |	When the shooting happened RJ was there on his front porch
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:16,832	| serial-s03-e04 |	University became a bit of a media hero because you tried to help major
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:20,928	| serial-s03-e04 |	Any news video he's sitting on his porch shirtless being interviewed
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:22,720	| serial-s03-e04 |	It looks sad and dazed
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:25,024	| serial-s03-e04 |	He's got staples up his arm
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:29,376	| serial-s03-e04 |	Holding together a wound from wrist to Elbow the result of an unrelated shooting the week before
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:33,984	| serial-s03-e04 |	The words never snitch are tattooed in fancy script just below his collar bones
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:37,824	| serial-s03-e04 |	A trial the prosecutor and a fry Leah
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:42,176	| serial-s03-e04 |	Made it clear to the jury that RJ had told detectives he seen the defendant
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:43,968	| serial-s03-e04 |	Donnell Lindsey known as now
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:46,528	| serial-s03-e04 |	Shooting from the window of a white car
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:51,904	| serial-s03-e04 |	Now today almost a year-and-a-half since he made that statement
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:53,440	| serial-s03-e04 |	RJ was on the stand
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:54,208	| serial-s03-e04 |	Saying it wasn't true
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:56,000	| serial-s03-e04 |	Nice and nobody showing
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:30:59,328	| serial-s03-e04 |	Okay
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:01,376	| serial-s03-e04 |	Didn't see the shooter didn't even see the car
EDL	00:31:02,144	00:31:05,216	| serial-s03-e04 |	Soon as he heard shots he ducked down onto his porch floor he said
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:07,776	| serial-s03-e04 |	To all he saw was his porch ceiling
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:09,312	| serial-s03-e04 |	And the little chairs he's got out there
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:12,384	| serial-s03-e04 |	Didn't see Donnell Lindsey at all the day major Howard was killed
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:17,760	| serial-s03-e04 |	Jennifer Ali-A tries to tease out of him why the discrepancy between these two statements
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:23,136	| serial-s03-e04 |	I will
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:25,184	| serial-s03-e04 |	I don't know what to do
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:26,976	| serial-s03-e04 |	RJ begins to spiral
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:28,000	| serial-s03-e04 |	It's hard to follow
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:30,560	| serial-s03-e04 |	Which I have to think was at least partly by Design
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:34,144	| serial-s03-e04 |	He says he's got all this pressure on him and no one can help them
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:36,448	| serial-s03-e04 |	Is Eva nassios in prison
EDL	00:31:36,448	00:31:37,984	| serial-s03-e04 |	He's serving time now in a different case
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:40,544	| serial-s03-e04 |	What should I do should he testify
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:43,872	| serial-s03-e04 |	He feels it was right to help the baby says
EDL	00:31:43,872	00:31:44,896	| serial-s03-e04 |	Best thing I ever did
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:47,968	| serial-s03-e04 |	A lot of people in the street or talking about him
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:48,736	| serial-s03-e04 |	Threatening him
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:50,784	| serial-s03-e04 |	Is getting in fights in prison now
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:52,320	| serial-s03-e04 |	Because people afraid he's a snitch
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:55,136	| serial-s03-e04 |	Eventually he says to Anna faraglia
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:57,696	| serial-s03-e04 |	I didn't see Donna Lindsay myself
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:32:00,000	| serial-s03-e04 |	I just told detectives what I'd heard from other people
EDL	00:32:00,512	00:32:03,840	| serial-s03-e04 |	Because my face is already been in the news and since I was already public
EDL	00:32:03,840	00:32:06,400	| serial-s03-e04 |	People in the neighborhood started coming to me with information
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:10,240	| serial-s03-e04 |	People who are scared themselves with scattered before police arrived that day
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:15,104	| serial-s03-e04 |	It's really passing their information to the detectives not my own information
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:16,896	| serial-s03-e04 |	And that was also a good deed
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:19,968	| serial-s03-e04 |	I could have run like other people did I could have shut my door
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:22,016	| serial-s03-e04 |	I knew the police were looking for me for another shooting
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:24,064	| serial-s03-e04 |	But I tried to help that baby
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:25,856	| serial-s03-e04 |	I talked to detectives
EDL	00:32:26,368	00:32:27,648	| serial-s03-e04 |	What else do you want from me
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:30,976	| serial-s03-e04 |	It went on like this for hours
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:33,024	| serial-s03-e04 |	Finally
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:34,304	| serial-s03-e04 |	I have heard
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:39,424	| serial-s03-e04 |	It's a movie move
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:42,752	| serial-s03-e04 |	State's exhibit 351 is an autopsy photograph
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:45,824	| serial-s03-e04 |	Adorable little major Howard's dead body
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:49,408	| serial-s03-e04 |	She has the photo to RJ
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:52,736	| serial-s03-e04 |	Is that what you tried to help
EDL	00:32:56,832	00:32:58,112	| serial-s03-e04 |	Is that a yes or a no
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:01,184	| serial-s03-e04 |	You try to help us little boy
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:02,208	| serial-s03-e04 |	Okay
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:05,024	| serial-s03-e04 |	And don't you think you owe it to him
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:09,632	| serial-s03-e04 |	The tallest jury who shot this little boy and not be afraid anymore sir
EDL	00:33:11,168	00:33:11,680	| serial-s03-e04 |	Front
EDL	00:33:13,984	00:33:15,008	| serial-s03-e04 |	RJ swamp
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:16,032	| serial-s03-e04 |	Starts to cry
EDL	00:33:17,056	00:33:19,616	| serial-s03-e04 |	Play major was shot RJ random
EDL	00:33:19,616	00:33:21,664	| serial-s03-e04 |	Took off his own shirt wrapped around him
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:24,480	| serial-s03-e04 |	Jumping a car and held onto major
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:25,760	| serial-s03-e04 |	Well they rushed to the hospital
EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:27,808	| serial-s03-e04 |	Major was still conscious
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:29,344	| serial-s03-e04 |	Looking up at him
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:30,368	| serial-s03-e04 |	Touching his chest
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:31,648	| serial-s03-e04 |	Dying
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:33,184	| serial-s03-e04 |	4 years old
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:36,000	| serial-s03-e04 |	RJ was still tormented by it
EDL	00:33:36,512	00:33:38,304	| serial-s03-e04 |	Did now shoot this little boy
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:43,168	| serial-s03-e04 |	Two-seater shooting from a white car that night
EDL	00:33:43,168	00:33:44,448	| serial-s03-e04 |	And all I asking you
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:50,336	| serial-s03-e04 |	Other people saying
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:51,872	| serial-s03-e04 |	Can you step up
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:54,688	| serial-s03-e04 |	Should I'm trying to do the best way I can
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:34:01,600	| serial-s03-e04 |	Alvin Gators telling the truth
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:03,392	| serial-s03-e04 |	I told you my truth
EDL	00:34:04,672	00:34:05,952	| serial-s03-e04 |	Anna says to him
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:06,720	| serial-s03-e04 |	Let's get real
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:09,792	| serial-s03-e04 |	You won't deliver because you're afraid of Retribution
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:13,632	| serial-s03-e04 |	Tell me gay members that come in the courtroom sat in the back
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:14,656	| serial-s03-e04 |	Trying to get Margie's head
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:16,704	| serial-s03-e04 |	She said to RJ
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:18,752	| serial-s03-e04 |	Afraid because you broke the code
EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:22,848	| serial-s03-e04 |	He says that ship sailed the moment I picked up that little boy
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:26,944	| serial-s03-e04 |	I broke the code by talking to the news reporter who approached me on the street
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:29,248	| serial-s03-e04 |	I broke the code by speaking to the cops
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:32,064	| serial-s03-e04 |	I'm breaking the code right now by sitting in this courtroom
EDL	00:34:32,576	00:34:34,880	| serial-s03-e04 |	Doesn't even really matter what words I say
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:35,904	| serial-s03-e04 |	Just being here is enough
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:39,232	| serial-s03-e04 |	Like I said I already said I broke up with her talking to you
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:40,512	| serial-s03-e04 |	Tomorrow
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:42,816	| serial-s03-e04 |	Marlene is more fun to talk to you
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:44,608	| serial-s03-e04 |	Carpro
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:55,360	| serial-s03-e04 |	I talked to a few jurors about the case afterwards
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:59,200	| serial-s03-e04 |	Two out of the three said they didn't believe are Json Ellen the car
EDL	00:34:59,712	00:35:06,112	| serial-s03-e04 |	But there was other evidence aside from RJ and Donna Lindsay was convicted he got 37 years
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:07,392	| serial-s03-e04 |	Instalife
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:11,488	| serial-s03-e04 |	For what it's worth his lawyers don't think he did it that's actually unusual for them
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:18,144	| serial-s03-e04 |	Watch the whole trial and he came away not at all convinced Donnell Lindsey was guilty I still don't know what to think
EDL	00:35:36,064	00:35:38,624	| serial-s03-e04 |	So what exactly did they have on Davon Holmes
EDL	00:35:39,392	00:35:40,416	| serial-s03-e04 |	New video
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:41,696	| serial-s03-e04 |	No physical evidence
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:43,488	| serial-s03-e04 |	No fingerprints no DNA
EDL	00:35:43,488	00:35:44,256	| serial-s03-e04 |	Logan
EDL	00:35:45,024	00:35:49,120	| serial-s03-e04 |	I found out Davon apparently had made a statement placing himself in the vicinity of the crime
EDL	00:35:49,632	00:35:52,960	| serial-s03-e04 |	Saying he been at the Family Dollar at the top of the street and it seems people running
EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:56,288	| serial-s03-e04 |	Tumi Davon denied making any such statement
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:36:03,712	| serial-s03-e04 |	Police had gotten his cell records would show that he was indeed nearby at the time of the shooting but considering he lives only a few blocks
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:04,736	| serial-s03-e04 |	Max from where the shooting happened
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:06,784	| serial-s03-e04 |	The cell records seems underwhelming
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:09,856	| serial-s03-e04 |	The eyewitnesses were Paramount
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:12,928	| serial-s03-e04 |	At least on paper they look wobbly
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:15,488	| serial-s03-e04 |	It was John the guy Dave on new
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:17,792	| serial-s03-e04 |	. offered information from jail
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:20,352	| serial-s03-e04 |	Witnesses like that are inherently weak
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:22,912	| serial-s03-e04 |	The defense can always argue the person's lying to get a deal
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:25,984	| serial-s03-e04 |	I wasn't able to reach John
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:27,776	| serial-s03-e04 |	But I did talk to someone close to him
EDL	00:36:27,776	00:36:29,056	| serial-s03-e04 |	I believe is reliable
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:32,384	| serial-s03-e04 |	Who said they had talked to John about his statement
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:34,176	| serial-s03-e04 |	This person told me
EDL	00:36:34,176	00:36:35,456	| serial-s03-e04 |	That was John told the police
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:37,248	| serial-s03-e04 |	Code it's not true
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:39,808	| serial-s03-e04 |	This person said John had lied
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:41,856	| serial-s03-e04 |	To save himself to try to avoid going to prison
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:44,928	| serial-s03-e04 |	Didn't think John did it because of his brother's death
EDL	00:36:45,440	00:36:46,208	| serial-s03-e04 |	But yes
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:48,256	| serial-s03-e04 |	He does still suffer over his brother
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:50,560	| serial-s03-e04 |	But they didn't think that was the reason John lied about Davon
EDL	00:36:51,840	00:36:55,168	| serial-s03-e04 |	So the landscapers ID was probably the strongest thing they had
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:37:00,032	| serial-s03-e04 |	I wasn't sure what to make of his sudden Clarity 57 days post shooting
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:06,432	| serial-s03-e04 |	Was he somehow manipulated by the police or maybe he been scared of choosing the wrong person or the right person
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:08,480	| serial-s03-e04 |	Maybe he just made a mistake
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:12,832	| serial-s03-e04 |	I went looking for him one day at various addresses around the city
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:16,928	| serial-s03-e04 |	Emmanuel and I left notes and our business cards talk to mail boxes in front doors
EDL	00:37:17,440	00:37:17,952	| serial-s03-e04 |	It works
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:20,768	| serial-s03-e04 |	I got a call that same night from the landscaper
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:22,816	| serial-s03-e04 |	He did not trust me
EDL	00:37:23,328	00:37:26,912	| serial-s03-e04 |	The neighbors had seen a manual and me walking around with her hands in her pockets
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:28,192	| serial-s03-e04 |	We look like cops
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:31,008	| serial-s03-e04 |	I told him it was cold outside that's why
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:34,848	| serial-s03-e04 |	I asked him if we could meet so we could see if himself I was harmless
EDL	00:37:34,848	00:37:38,432	| serial-s03-e04 |	But the more I asked the more suspicious he thought I was trying to set him up to arrest him
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:41,248	| serial-s03-e04 |	We spoke a couple of times on the phone
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:44,320	| serial-s03-e04 |	He was upset his name was part of Dave on the case
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:46,368	| serial-s03-e04 |	He was told his name would stay out of it
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:49,696	| serial-s03-e04 |	He said they threatened me that if they didn't come to court they put me in jail
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:54,560	| serial-s03-e04 |	He thinks they dropped avons case because they didn't want to pay out the reward money
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:55,840	| serial-s03-e04 |	Which is $25,000
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:37:59,168	| serial-s03-e04 |	Landscaper was full of conspiratorial forever
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:01,472	| serial-s03-e04 |	I got the feeling he come by honestly
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:05,056	| serial-s03-e04 |	Sometime later a woman called me
EDL	00:38:05,056	00:38:06,848	| serial-s03-e04 |	She said she was family to the landscaper
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:09,920	| serial-s03-e04 |	She said you should be careful what you do
EDL	00:38:09,920	00:38:16,320	| serial-s03-e04 |	Because you can come in and ask all these questions but then you get to leave we don't we live here
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:16,832	| serial-s03-e04 |	Kill you
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:20,160	| serial-s03-e04 |	Will cops in our family I know how things happen
EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:22,208	| serial-s03-e04 |	I told her I know she's right
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:24,768	| serial-s03-e04 |	I am trying to tread delicately
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:26,048	| serial-s03-e04 |	We talked for a long time

EDL	00:40:55,808	00:40:56,576	| serial-s03-e04 |	Until
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:40:58,368	| serial-s03-e04 |	I don't know I had more information I guess
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:00,160	| serial-s03-e04 |	But really I was avoiding it
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:04,768	| serial-s03-e04 |	I figured it would be painful for him and professionally a little used to me
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:07,072	| serial-s03-e04 |	We know I know the whole story so
EDL	00:41:08,352	00:41:10,144	| serial-s03-e04 |	I got to say it's just the waiting game
EDL	00:41:10,912	00:41:11,936	| serial-s03-e04 |	I was being a dummy
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:16,800	| serial-s03-e04 |	Charles Wakefield is a lovely welcoming person who says he knows exactly what happened
EDL	00:41:17,312	00:41:19,104	| serial-s03-e04 |	First shot hit in the
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:21,152	| serial-s03-e04 |	Back at the front
EDL	00:41:21,664	00:41:22,944	| serial-s03-e04 |	Passenger tire
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:31,136	| serial-s03-e04 |	And I think the bullet wanted to the dashboard in a second but it went in the corner of the passenger window
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:32,672	| serial-s03-e04 |	Wish where my mom was sitting at
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:37,536	| serial-s03-e04 |	Then the third bullet went in the back door and through her car seat
EDL	00:41:38,304	00:41:39,840	| serial-s03-e04 |	Charles wasn't there himself
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:41,120	| serial-s03-e04 |	He wasn't a witness
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:43,936	| serial-s03-e04 |	He doesn't have any proof for his version of what happened
EDL	00:41:44,448	00:41:46,496	| serial-s03-e04 |	Song information he's gathered from other people
EDL	00:41:47,008	00:41:48,800	| serial-s03-e04 |	I'm going to be beeping at a name here
EDL	00:41:49,824	00:41:52,640	| serial-s03-e04 |	The version of the story he feels confident is true
EDL	00:41:52,640	00:41:56,735	| serial-s03-e04 |	Is it some guys were shooting dice in a building on East 145th Street off Kinsman
EDL	00:41:57,759	00:42:04,159	| serial-s03-e04 |	Sometime earlier one of them had been robbed maybe at another dice game or there's been some gambling issue Charles wasn't sure about that
EDL	00:42:04,159	00:42:04,927	| serial-s03-e04 |	That part
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:06,719	| serial-s03-e04 |	I later learned there had been a shooting
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:09,279	| serial-s03-e04 |	Anyway these guys were ready to retaliate
EDL	00:42:09,791	00:42:12,351	| serial-s03-e04 |	They're on the lookout for particular car
EDL	00:42:12,351	00:42:14,399	| serial-s03-e04 |	A car that looked a lot like Charles's car
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:19,007	| serial-s03-e04 |	House of the guy they were after I had a white 2000 Oldsmobile Aurora

EDL	00:42:25,151	00:42:26,943	| serial-s03-e04 |	He has had tinted windows
EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:29,503	| serial-s03-e04 |	And ours had a sunroof
EDL	00:42:30,783	00:42:33,599	| serial-s03-e04 |	The guys playing the dice game see an Oldsmobile coming
EDL	00:42:34,111	00:42:35,903	| serial-s03-e04 |	Charles has one of them recognized it
EDL	00:42:36,415	00:42:37,439	| serial-s03-e04 |	Somebody
EDL	00:42:38,207	00:42:39,743	| serial-s03-e04 |	That was there with them
EDL	00:42:40,255	00:42:41,279	| serial-s03-e04 |	New my car
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:42,815	| serial-s03-e04 |	Tomato
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:44,607	| serial-s03-e04 |	They said that ain't the car
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:47,167	| serial-s03-e04 |	But once I started firing anyway
EDL	00:42:47,679	00:42:50,239	| serial-s03-e04 |	Beyonce Ayesha was driving
EDL	00:42:50,239	00:42:52,543	| serial-s03-e04 |	His elderly mother was in the passenger seat
EDL	00:42:52,543	00:42:54,335	| serial-s03-e04 |	Behind her was aviao
EDL	00:42:54,335	00:42:56,639	| serial-s03-e04 |	I'm behind Aisha was her other daughter
EDL	00:42:56,639	00:42:57,407	| serial-s03-e04 |	Who is 8 years old
EDL	00:42:58,175	00:43:02,527	| serial-s03-e04 |	They were driving to the Save-A-Lot just a few blocks away to get ingredients for Charles's birthday cake
EDL	00:43:03,039	00:43:04,319	| serial-s03-e04 |	Is his birthday the next day
EDL	00:43:04,831	00:43:07,903	| serial-s03-e04 |	I just seen the person with that car but I don't know who he is
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:13,023	| serial-s03-e04 |	I actually met him up at the carwash when I first met him
EDL	00:43:13,791	00:43:20,191	| serial-s03-e04 |	You know somebody got the same type of car they and you know it just bursts a conversation and next thing I know somebody was shooting at
EDL	00:43:20,191	00:43:22,495	| serial-s03-e04 |	That same car but it was my car thinking it was
EDL	00:43:23,007	00:43:23,519	| serial-s03-e04 |	His car
EDL	00:43:25,311	00:43:27,871	| serial-s03-e04 |	I'm not sure why this hadn't occurred to me before
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:29,919	| serial-s03-e04 |	But it was hitting me now talking to Charles
EDL	00:43:30,431	00:43:31,711	| serial-s03-e04 |	He lives right here
EDL	00:43:32,223	00:43:34,527	| serial-s03-e04 |	The shooting happened down the street from where we're sitting
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:38,879	| serial-s03-e04 |	The people he thinks are involved with his daughter's death they also live
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:39,647	| serial-s03-e04 |	Right here
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:41,951	| serial-s03-e04 |	Within blocks of each other some of them
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:43,487	| serial-s03-e04 |	Of course he knew things
EDL	00:43:43,999	00:43:44,511	| serial-s03-e04 |	I heard things
EDL	00:43:45,535	00:43:47,327	| serial-s03-e04 |	Best Charles about Davon
EDL	00:43:47,327	00:43:48,095	| serial-s03-e04 |	Tank
EDL	00:43:48,095	00:43:50,911	| serial-s03-e04 |	When he got arrested did you think oh okay they got them
EDL	00:43:51,679	00:43:53,471	| serial-s03-e04 |	Yeah I know right away was to
EDL	00:43:54,495	00:43:56,799	| serial-s03-e04 |	I know this is where I'm going to start beeping
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:43:57,823	| serial-s03-e04 |	Because trials
EDL	00:43:57,823	00:43:58,847	| serial-s03-e04 |	Doesn't think it was
EDL	00:43:59,359	00:44:01,407	| serial-s03-e04 |	He told me a story about another person
EDL	00:44:01,407	00:44:02,431	| serial-s03-e04 |	How many names
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:04,991	| serial-s03-e04 |	Soon as the shots was fired my car was hit
EDL	00:44:06,271	00:44:08,575	| serial-s03-e04 |	Wanted to do is come running to me
EDL	00:44:08,575	00:44:10,367	| serial-s03-e04 |	First words, his mouth is
EDL	00:44:10,367	00:44:11,903	| serial-s03-e04 |	Said he going to holler at you
EDL	00:44:13,439	00:44:16,511	| serial-s03-e04 |	And in my head I'm thinking like why would he say
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:19,071	| serial-s03-e04 |	And I'm putting on highlighter
EDL	00:44:19,839	00:44:21,887	| serial-s03-e04 |	What did you take that to me as he's going to holler at you
EDL	00:44:22,911	00:44:24,959	| serial-s03-e04 |	But he's got to see how to speak to you about something
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:28,799	| serial-s03-e04 |	I pretty much he was either gone or I believe
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:30,335	| serial-s03-e04 |	They didn't think my daughter was going to die
EDL	00:44:32,127	00:44:33,151	| serial-s03-e04 |	So he was going to
EDL	00:44:33,663	00:44:38,783	| serial-s03-e04 |	You know try to patch up but but she end up dying so it
EDL	00:44:39,295	00:44:41,599	| serial-s03-e04 |	I couldn't become do it no more
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:44,159	| serial-s03-e04 |	And then it was
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:45,695	| serial-s03-e04 |	Probably few days later
EDL	00:44:46,463	00:44:48,511	| serial-s03-e04 |	United States started talking then
EDL	00:44:49,535	00:44:51,583	| serial-s03-e04 |	All fingers pointing back to
EDL	00:44:52,863	00:44:54,143	| serial-s03-e04 |	How many people talk to you about it
EDL	00:44:54,655	00:44:56,191	| serial-s03-e04 |	Well for 5 p
EDL	00:44:56,191	00:44:59,007	| serial-s03-e04 |	People that came out of their mouth
EDL	00:44:59,007	00:45:05,407	| serial-s03-e04 |	And you're pretty sure it wasn't just an echo chamber where is like they'd all her the same single rumor it was a different information
EDL	00:45:05,407	00:45:06,431	| serial-s03-e04 |	Different information
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:09,503	| serial-s03-e04 |	Charles knows this guy he's talking about
EDL	00:45:09,503	00:45:13,087	| serial-s03-e04 |	They weren't close friends but they definitely knew each other and had been cool with each other
EDL	00:45:13,599	00:45:17,183	| serial-s03-e04 |	He says ever since the shooting this guy acts strangely when he sees them
EDL	00:45:17,695	00:45:18,207	| serial-s03-e04 |	Twitchy
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:22,303	| serial-s03-e04 |	Twitchy is a useful towel in the movie version of the story
EDL	00:45:22,303	00:45:23,583	| serial-s03-e04 |	But it is not evidence
EDL	00:45:23,583	00:45:24,607	| serial-s03-e04 |	Anything really
EDL	00:45:25,119	00:45:28,447	| serial-s03-e04 |	But to Charles it feels like this guy's body language is what gives him away
EDL	00:45:28,959	00:45:35,103	| serial-s03-e04 |	And it's not even me like he he will see one of my buddies that I'm kind of close within my buddy with her this hot new
EDL	00:45:35,615	00:45:37,407	| serial-s03-e04 |	Casey minajesty and I was like
EDL	00:45:38,175	00:45:42,527	| serial-s03-e04 |	He took off like he jumped in somebody car that he wasn't even in and took off
EDL	00:45:43,295	00:45:45,599	| serial-s03-e04 |	And I'm like well he did he like I know bro
EDL	00:45:46,623	00:45:49,183	| serial-s03-e04 |	Has he finally confronted the guy himself
EDL	00:45:49,183	00:45:49,951	| serial-s03-e04 |	In the street
EDL	00:45:50,463	00:45:51,999	| serial-s03-e04 |	I broke my wife cheat

EDL	00:46:00,959	00:46:05,823	| serial-s03-e04 |	Is that what happened in a car
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:08,383	| serial-s03-e04 |	When you stood out travel to the people across the street
EDL	00:46:08,383	00:46:09,919	| serial-s03-e04 |	I was walking back from the store
EDL	00:46:11,199	00:46:12,479	| serial-s03-e04 |	He was facing this way
EDL	00:46:13,759	00:46:15,295	| serial-s03-e04 |	When I turned the corner
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:17,599	| serial-s03-e04 |	He backed up in my driveway and went that way
EDL	00:46:18,623	00:46:20,159	| serial-s03-e04 |	So I'm in the middle of the street
EDL	00:46:20,927	00:46:22,719	| serial-s03-e04 |	Like this with my arms up

EDL	00:46:24,511	00:46:26,559	| serial-s03-e04 |	Finally he looks through the rearview mirror
EDL	00:46:26,559	00:46:27,327	| serial-s03-e04 |	He stops
EDL	00:46:27,327	00:46:28,095	| serial-s03-e04 |	The car
EDL	00:46:28,095	00:46:30,143	| serial-s03-e04 |	He comes back when you got somebody to car one
EDL	00:46:31,167	00:46:32,959	| serial-s03-e04 |	And the look on his face was like
EDL	00:46:33,983	00:46:36,799	| serial-s03-e04 |	I think he just wanted me to do something to him so he can
EDL	00:46:36,799	00:46:38,335	| serial-s03-e04 |	Press charges and give me like that
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:40,127	| serial-s03-e04 |	And I'm looking at him like

EDL	00:46:48,319	00:46:49,343	| serial-s03-e04 |	You know what I said he
EDL	00:46:49,343	00:46:51,647	| serial-s03-e04 |	I don't know what to tell you
EDL	00:46:51,647	00:46:58,047	| serial-s03-e04 |	I was at the wrong place at the wrong time or something about the card you it was the wrong car son whatever he
EDL	00:46:58,047	00:46:59,839	| serial-s03-e04 |	You told me but I'm telling him like that ain't it
EDL	00:47:01,119	00:47:04,959	| serial-s03-e04 |	I like I told him it ain't just me that's mad at you
EDL	00:47:05,727	00:47:08,287	| serial-s03-e04 |	You got it Mason of people you kill the innocent
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:08,799	| serial-s03-e04 |	Baby
EDL	00:47:09,823	00:47:12,895	| serial-s03-e04 |	I can't stop people from doing what they feel
EDL	00:47:12,895	00:47:13,919	| serial-s03-e04 |	In my heart
EDL	00:47:13,919	00:47:16,223	| serial-s03-e04 |	I'm not the only person to know your face now
EDL	00:47:17,247	00:47:23,647	| serial-s03-e04 |	It's like you're telling this to me in it in a very moderate tone was at
EDL	00:47:23,647	00:47:30,047	| serial-s03-e04 |	At the tone of the conversation where you screaming in the street
EDL	00:47:30,047	00:47:36,447	| serial-s03-e04 |	Girls wasn't scared when worried about someone coming after him for telling police what he'd heard is a grieving father of a day
EDL	00:47:36,447	00:47:42,847	| serial-s03-e04 |	Dead baby daughter the rules didn't apply to him or if they didn't care he should sidestep the game
EDL	00:47:42,847	00:47:48,991	| serial-s03-e04 |	M2 and turn himself in
EDL	00:47:55,647	00:47:57,695	| serial-s03-e04 |	Calling in anonymous tips about Davon
EDL	00:47:58,207	00:48:03,583	| serial-s03-e04 |	One reason he said was because Davon changed his appearance soon after the shooting it cut his dreads
EDL	00:48:03,583	00:48:09,471	| serial-s03-e04 |	Because he cut his dreads off claiming that he had a warrant for some he did on the Westside
EDL	00:48:09,471	00:48:12,543	| serial-s03-e04 |	So it made everybody think you know he has something to do with it
EDL	00:48:14,591	00:48:15,871	| serial-s03-e04 |	So
EDL	00:48:15,871	00:48:17,151	| serial-s03-e04 |	He had a gun
EDL	00:48:17,151	00:48:18,175	| serial-s03-e04 |	But he didn't shoot
EDL	00:48:19,455	00:48:22,271	| serial-s03-e04 |	Wait so you're saying tank was there
EDL	00:48:22,271	00:48:24,063	| serial-s03-e04 |	He was there and he had a gun he just didn't you
EDL	00:48:25,343	00:48:25,855	| serial-s03-e04 |	Who was there
EDL	00:48:27,135	00:48:28,159	| serial-s03-e04 |	Have you ever spoken to him
EDL	00:48:29,695	00:48:31,743	| serial-s03-e04 |	News from the tank
EDL	00:48:32,255	00:48:32,767	| serial-s03-e04 |	Oh you did
EDL	00:48:33,535	00:48:34,815	| serial-s03-e04 |	Where'd you see him
EDL	00:48:34,815	00:48:35,583	| serial-s03-e04 |	At the store
EDL	00:48:36,607	00:48:39,423	| serial-s03-e04 |	Teavana told me he didn't know the Wakefield family
EDL	00:48:39,423	00:48:42,751	| serial-s03-e04 |	And you guys speak what do you say
EDL	00:48:43,775	00:48:45,311	| serial-s03-e04 |	You know he just say
EDL	00:48:45,311	00:48:51,711	| serial-s03-e04 |	He seemed pretty much sizing me up to see if I still think if he had something to do with it or if I'm going you know.
EDL	00:48:51,711	00:48:54,015	| serial-s03-e04 |	Do something to him or you know like that but
EDL	00:48:54,783	00:48:55,551	| serial-s03-e04 |	Hino
EDL	00:48:55,551	00:48:57,855	| serial-s03-e04 |	If I want to do something other than did it
EDL	00:48:58,623	00:49:03,743	| serial-s03-e04 |	I respect that man enough he stayed in jail for about a year for something he didn't do so
EDL	00:49:04,511	00:49:05,535	| serial-s03-e04 |	But you're saying he knows what hap
EDL	00:49:06,047	00:49:11,423	| serial-s03-e04 |	He knows but I mean he didn't do it it's a difference between knowing and doing are two different things
EDL	00:49:13,215	00:49:17,055	| serial-s03-e04 |	Why do you think it took so long
EDL	00:49:17,055	00:49:18,079	| serial-s03-e04 |	For them to let
EDL	00:49:18,591	00:49:19,871	| serial-s03-e04 |	Pink out
EDL	00:49:20,895	00:49:26,015	| serial-s03-e04 |	That was too they was trying to get him to snitch on that I was just at the dry out
EDL	00:49:26,527	00:49:29,343	| serial-s03-e04 |	Turn the volume up that's all that was
EDL	00:49:29,343	00:49:31,391	| serial-s03-e04 |	They know team didn't do that and never let him out
EDL	00:49:32,159	00:49:38,303	| serial-s03-e04 |	Charles thinks the state indicted Davon on three different kinds of murder charges and held them in a filthy jail cell for a full year
EDL	00:49:38,815	00:49:39,583	| serial-s03-e04 |	And Hope
EDL	00:49:39,583	00:49:40,863	| serial-s03-e04 |	That he turn on
EDL	00:49:41,375	00:49:43,167	| serial-s03-e04 |	Kevin told me he doesn't know
EDL	00:49:43,679	00:49:45,215	| serial-s03-e04 |	Charles feels pretty sure he does
EDL	00:49:46,239	00:49:49,567	| serial-s03-e04 |	3 clear Charles did not know who Tavon was before all this happened
EDL	00:49:50,079	00:49:53,151	| serial-s03-e04 |	But he told me several times he's got no problem with him now
EDL	00:49:55,967	00:49:56,479	| serial-s03-e04 |	Okay
EDL	00:49:56,991	00:50:01,855	| serial-s03-e04 |	So I've been talking to Dave on for 4 months by this point and he had not said any of this to me
EDL	00:50:01,855	00:50:03,391	| serial-s03-e04 |	Given categorical
EDL	00:50:03,391	00:50:07,231	| serial-s03-e04 |	He knew nothing about that shooting wasn't there didn't know any of these people
EDL	00:50:08,511	00:50:12,351	| serial-s03-e04 |	After I talk to Charles I went back to Davon ran all this by him
EDL	00:50:12,351	00:50:16,959	| serial-s03-e04 |	Are you set aside from yes recognizing Charles Wakefield on the street none of it was true
EDL	00:50:17,727	00:50:20,031	| serial-s03-e04 |	He said he'd heard all these same rumors I had
EDL	00:50:20,031	00:50:21,311	| serial-s03-e04 |	That's what they were
EDL	00:50:21,311	00:50:22,335	| serial-s03-e04 |	Rumors
EDL	00:50:22,335	00:50:23,103	| serial-s03-e04 |	Stories
EDL	00:50:23,103	00:50:26,431	| serial-s03-e04 |	Which by virtue of repetition do not become true
EDL	00:50:26,431	00:50:30,783	| serial-s03-e04 |	I don't know if they Vons telling me the truth about what he knows or doesn't know
EDL	00:50:30,783	00:50:36,927	| serial-s03-e04 |	But now that I know what I know I wouldn't be surprised if he's not I might be the oldest nicest meanest lady
EDL	00:50:37,439	00:50:39,999	| serial-s03-e04 |	But at the end of the day I'm still an outsider
EDL	00:50:40,767	00:50:44,863	| serial-s03-e04 |	Well I can understand why Charles feels that his information is solid and true
EDL	00:50:44,863	00:50:46,399	| serial-s03-e04 |	At the end of the day
EDL	00:50:46,399	00:50:50,751	| serial-s03-e04 |	It's all secondhand
EDL	00:50:54,079	00:51:00,223	| serial-s03-e04 |	You're naming to me like individual people who you think were there and would know the same story your time
EDL	00:51:00,991	00:51:03,551	| serial-s03-e04 |	And yet not one of them it seems like has
EDL	00:51:03,551	00:51:06,367	| serial-s03-e04 |	Gone to the police or talk to the police about it does that surprise you
EDL	00:51:07,391	00:51:13,535	| serial-s03-e04 |	No not really I mean like I said comes the boys down to nobody want to be labeled a snitch
EDL	00:51:14,815	00:51:16,095	| serial-s03-e04 |	And everybody to tell me
EDL	00:51:16,607	00:51:17,375	| serial-s03-e04 |	Who did it
EDL	00:51:17,375	00:51:21,471	| serial-s03-e04 |	But you know cuz I can't go to the office or welts I just told me
EDL	00:51:21,983	00:51:24,031	| serial-s03-e04 |	They have to tell the you know so
EDL	00:51:24,799	00:51:27,359	| serial-s03-e04 |	I don't notice that make you mad at all your
EDL	00:51:27,359	00:51:33,759	| serial-s03-e04 |	This is me all the way up like every time I go outside I just look at everybody different like you know
EDL	00:51:33,759	00:51:34,527	| serial-s03-e04 |	What happened
EDL	00:51:34,527	00:51:35,295	| serial-s03-e04 |	Don't say that
EDL	00:51:36,319	00:51:37,087	| serial-s03-e04 |	You know so
EDL	00:51:37,855	00:51:39,903	| serial-s03-e04 |	That's just how I look at everybody like
EDL	00:51:41,183	00:51:44,767	| serial-s03-e04 |	You know that's the same one
EDL	00:51:46,559	00:51:49,631	| serial-s03-e04 |	And then I would let you cuz you know you've been through this whole time
EDL	00:51:51,679	00:51:53,215	| serial-s03-e04 |	Charles is a big man
EDL	00:51:53,215	00:51:54,751	| serial-s03-e04 |	Big and soft around the edges
EDL	00:51:55,263	00:51:57,567	| serial-s03-e04 |	His mother told me he was always a crier
EDL	00:51:57,567	00:51:59,871	| serial-s03-e04 |	But now that your seem to leak from him unbidden
EDL	00:52:00,639	00:52:03,455	| serial-s03-e04 |	His mom told me the loss of his baby was a soft hurt
EDL	00:52:03,967	00:52:05,759	| serial-s03-e04 |	Which I took to mean still tender
EDL	00:52:06,527	00:52:08,831	| serial-s03-e04 |	I didn't know him before Abigail died
EDL	00:52:08,831	00:52:11,647	| serial-s03-e04 |	But my son's now is that he is ravaged by the loss of her
EDL	00:52:12,415	00:52:16,255	| serial-s03-e04 |	Halfway through a conversation I realized I was talking to him from the same place he sleeps
EDL	00:52:16,767	00:52:19,839	| serial-s03-e04 |	An oversized armchair and matching ottoman in the living room
EDL	00:52:20,607	00:52:23,423	| serial-s03-e04 |	At the foot of the makeshift bed with a coffee table
EDL	00:52:23,423	00:52:26,239	| serial-s03-e04 |	Covered with photographs and mementos of IDL
EDL	00:52:27,263	00:52:29,055	| serial-s03-e04 |	Charles has been a stay-at-home father
EDL	00:52:29,055	00:52:31,871	| serial-s03-e04 |	I used to work and so he took care of IBL all day
EDL	00:52:31,871	00:52:33,151	| serial-s03-e04 |	He felt very close to her
EDL	00:52:34,431	00:52:39,807	| serial-s03-e04 |	Since the shooting he's had a hard time not thinking about her and her death in the unsolved case
EDL	00:52:39,807	00:52:40,575	| serial-s03-e04 |	Every minute
EDL	00:52:41,343	00:52:44,671	| serial-s03-e04 |	It just kind of makes me want to take matters to your own hand
EDL	00:52:48,511	00:52:51,839	| serial-s03-e04 |	Is that a possibility that you would do something about it yourself
EDL	00:52:51,839	00:52:54,399	| serial-s03-e04 |	No I'm not not okay
EDL	00:52:54,399	00:52:56,191	| serial-s03-e04 |	But nobody in this in
EDL	00:52:56,191	00:52:57,983	| serial-s03-e04 |	This pain that I feel
EDL	00:52:57,983	00:52:59,263	| serial-s03-e04 |	Cuz nobody else deal with it
EDL	00:52:59,775	00:53:02,847	| serial-s03-e04 |	Just the me knowing is somebody going to be sitting
EDL	00:53:03,615	00:53:04,639	| serial-s03-e04 |	Feeling like this
EDL	00:53:10,015	00:53:11,551	| serial-s03-e04 |	Hotel versus bro man
EDL	00:53:13,599	00:53:15,391	| serial-s03-e04 |	Vista disable pay yuan
EDL	00:53:18,207	00:53:20,767	| serial-s03-e04 |	It might be I got a conscious like I can't live life
EDL	00:53:24,351	00:53:24,863	| serial-s03-e04 |	But
EDL	00:53:25,887	00:53:26,655	| serial-s03-e04 |	Play worth it
EDL	00:53:28,959	00:53:30,239	| serial-s03-e04 |	I've had the opportunity
EDL	00:53:30,239	00:53:32,031	| serial-s03-e04 |	Plenty of times I know where you at
EDL	00:53:32,799	00:53:36,127	| serial-s03-e04 |	No worries they know where you be I know everything I need
EDL	00:53:37,919	00:53:39,199	| serial-s03-e04 |	That's what hurt me
EDL	00:53:42,015	00:53:43,551	| serial-s03-e04 |	Maybe I should go get her
EDL	00:53:46,111	00:53:47,135	| serial-s03-e04 |	Imma be on the road
EDL	00:53:49,695	00:53:52,511	| serial-s03-e04 |	That's where I get my satisfaction from knowing that
EDL	00:53:54,303	00:53:56,095	| serial-s03-e04 |	His life will never be the same
EDL	00:53:56,607	00:53:57,375	| serial-s03-e04 |	But
EDL	00:53:57,375	00:54:00,959	| serial-s03-e04 |	All going right now as we speak he probably laughing it
EDL	00:54:00,959	00:54:02,239	| serial-s03-e04 |	But it is mine
EDL	00:54:03,007	00:54:03,775	| serial-s03-e04 |	It's not right
EDL	00:54:18,367	00:54:24,511	| serial-s03-e04 |	Charles feels as though he can't directly ask anyone to come forward and speak to the police
EDL	00:54:25,023	00:54:27,839	| serial-s03-e04 |	Understands snitches get killed
EDL	00:54:27,839	00:54:30,655	| serial-s03-e04 |	He wants to live in a world where snitching is unnecessary
EDL	00:54:31,423	00:54:33,983	| serial-s03-e04 |	I heard this from several people interviewed in Cleveland
EDL	00:54:33,983	00:54:36,543	| serial-s03-e04 |	If the cops just did their jobs better
EDL	00:54:36,543	00:54:38,847	| serial-s03-e04 |	Civilians wouldn't be put in an impossible position
EDL	00:54:39,359	00:54:41,151	| serial-s03-e04 |	System shouldn't send
EDL	00:54:42,175	00:54:42,943	| serial-s03-e04 |	Need
EDL	00:54:42,943	00:54:44,735	| serial-s03-e04 |	The public to do its job
EDL	00:54:44,735	00:54:48,063	| serial-s03-e04 |	That's the stamp I like they all they do is get out here
EDL	00:54:48,063	00:54:51,903	| serial-s03-e04 |	Ask somebody else to do their job like no you get out here and
EDL	00:54:52,927	00:54:54,463	| serial-s03-e04 |	Look for the person you think did it
EDL	00:54:54,975	00:54:57,279	| serial-s03-e04 |	Steady want somebody else to tell on somebody
EDL	00:54:58,047	00:55:04,447	| serial-s03-e04 |	But I mean isn't that them doing their jobs always try to get how I mean they're not magic like they weren't here the only way they could
EDL	00:55:04,447	00:55:05,727	| serial-s03-e04 |	Information is people telling them information
EDL	00:55:06,495	00:55:11,871	| serial-s03-e04 |	No they get information about getting out here in these streets in in finding information except just like I did
EDL	00:55:13,663	00:55:16,223	| serial-s03-e04 |	Right but that still would require someone to tell
EDL	00:55:16,735	00:55:18,527	| serial-s03-e04 |	I mean like if they go to
EDL	00:55:18,527	00:55:21,087	| serial-s03-e04 |	The same people who talk to you they're asking them to tell
EDL	00:55:21,599	00:55:23,647	| serial-s03-e04 |	Right but no I'm saying
EDL	00:55:23,647	00:55:26,975	| serial-s03-e04 |	That person will be telling them instead of telling me
EDL	00:55:27,487	00:55:31,583	| serial-s03-e04 |	You said I was saying like this is easy like I said the whole neighborhood and told me what happened
EDL	00:55:32,095	00:55:33,119	| serial-s03-e04 |	Exactly
EDL	00:55:33,119	00:55:34,143	| serial-s03-e04 |	Because he's not a cop
EDL	00:55:35,423	00:55:39,263	| serial-s03-e04 |	I got to say most the detectives I talked to told me that back in the day
EDL	00:55:39,263	00:55:40,287	| serial-s03-e04 |	20 years ago
EDL	00:55:40,287	00:55:41,055	| serial-s03-e04 |	Even 10 years ago
EDL	00:55:41,567	00:55:44,127	| serial-s03-e04 |	They did have better relationships with the people they police
EDL	00:55:44,895	00:55:47,199	| serial-s03-e04 |	There wasn't as much animosity toward them for one thing
EDL	00:55:47,711	00:55:50,783	| serial-s03-e04 |	They used to have a substantial community policing unit
EDL	00:55:50,783	00:55:52,319	| serial-s03-e04 |	Former Commander that told me
EDL	00:55:52,319	00:55:54,367	| serial-s03-e04 |	22 police mini stations
EDL	00:55:54,367	00:55:56,159	| serial-s03-e04 |	Staff with two officers each
EDL	00:55:56,159	00:55:58,207	| serial-s03-e04 |	Plus dare officers at schools
EDL	00:55:58,207	00:55:59,743	| serial-s03-e04 |	Officers at public pools
EDL	00:56:00,255	00:56:03,327	| serial-s03-e04 |	Police didn't materialize only in the aftermath of disaster
EDL	00:56:03,839	00:56:05,375	| serial-s03-e04 |	They were visibly around
EDL	00:56:05,375	00:56:06,399	| serial-s03-e04 |	They could develop relationship
EDL	00:56:06,911	00:56:08,703	| serial-s03-e04 |	Which in turn could lead to information
EDL	00:56:09,471	00:56:11,007	| serial-s03-e04 |	You make a quiet phone call
EDL	00:56:11,007	00:56:13,567	| serial-s03-e04 |	And people on the other end of the line with trust you
EDL	00:56:13,567	00:56:14,591	| serial-s03-e04 |	To keep their names out of it
EDL	00:56:15,615	00:56:17,919	| serial-s03-e04 |	I don't know whether these guys were waxing nostalgic
EDL	00:56:18,431	00:56:23,295	| serial-s03-e04 |	But everyone I talked to agree that it has been degrading in recent years this relationship with the public
EDL	00:56:24,319	00:56:27,903	| serial-s03-e04 |	The team in charge of police reform in Cleveland recently surveyed officers
EDL	00:56:28,415	00:56:29,951	| serial-s03-e04 |	They should report a few months ago
EDL	00:56:30,463	00:56:35,327	| serial-s03-e04 |	That included officers estimating that 60% of people they come into contact with
EDL	00:56:35,327	00:56:36,607	| serial-s03-e04 |	Want nothing to do with them
EDL	00:56:37,631	00:56:40,447	| serial-s03-e04 |	The police many stations were asked more than a decade ago
EDL	00:56:40,959	00:56:44,031	| serial-s03-e04 |	Budget cuts led to the department losing hundreds of officers
EDL	00:56:48,127	00:56:51,711	| serial-s03-e04 |	Charles said he did relay everything he'd been hearing to the cops
EDL	00:56:52,223	00:56:54,527	| serial-s03-e04 |	Specifically to detective articles
EDL	00:56:54,527	00:56:57,343	| serial-s03-e04 |	And detective Rhonda gray we're running the investigation
EDL	00:56:58,111	00:57:00,671	| serial-s03-e04 |	Joe says he was calling and calling leaving messages
EDL	00:57:00,671	00:57:02,975	| serial-s03-e04 |	I got information I got another person
EDL	00:57:03,487	00:57:04,767	| serial-s03-e04 |	He says he never got a call back
EDL	00:57:05,279	00:57:07,071	| serial-s03-e04 |	My dad just went cold
EDL	00:57:07,583	00:57:10,911	| serial-s03-e04 |	The guy Charles believe shot ivl the police are aware of him
EDL	00:57:11,423	00:57:13,983	| serial-s03-e04 |	Charles didn't tell me anything he hadn't already told police
EDL	00:57:14,495	00:57:19,615	| serial-s03-e04 |	And anyway he said detective Ackles already heard that same guys name almost as soon as Charles dead
EDL	00:57:20,383	00:57:26,783	| serial-s03-e04 |	This man himself knows the police are aware of him I met him at is I recognized in one day at the justice
EDL	00:57:26,783	00:57:30,111	| serial-s03-e04 |	Center while he was sitting on a bench waiting to make a 10 a.m. Jail visit
EDL	00:57:30,111	00:57:32,927	| serial-s03-e04 |	And I asked if I could talk to him about the Wakefield case
EDL	00:57:32,927	00:57:33,695	| serial-s03-e04 |	I gave my card
EDL	00:57:34,463	00:57:36,255	| serial-s03-e04 |	He was unequivocal no
EDL	00:57:36,767	00:57:39,327	| serial-s03-e04 |	I got nothing to say I just want to leave all that in the past
EDL	00:57:39,839	00:57:42,655	| serial-s03-e04 |	It's over
EDL	00:57:48,031	00:57:52,127	| serial-s03-e04 |	The last time Charles met with the detectives was late November of 2016
EDL	00:57:52,895	00:57:55,967	| serial-s03-e04 |	They called him and Ayesha to tell them they had important news
EDL	00:57:56,479	00:57:58,271	| serial-s03-e04 |	They all gathered in the prosecutor's office
EDL	00:57:59,039	00:58:03,647	| serial-s03-e04 |	For the detectives and prosecutors explained they be letting Davon Holmes out of jail
EDL	00:58:04,159	00:58:06,207	| serial-s03-e04 |	Charles said he told them yeah
EDL	00:58:06,207	00:58:07,231	| serial-s03-e04 |	Because tank didn't do it
EDL	00:58:08,255	00:58:10,303	| serial-s03-e04 |	They said they'd still be pursuing the case
EDL	00:58:10,303	00:58:11,583	| serial-s03-e04 |	Still looking at other suspects
EDL	00:58:12,351	00:58:14,143	| serial-s03-e04 |	Including the guy Charles Blues today
EDL	00:58:14,655	00:58:15,679	| serial-s03-e04 |	They discuss that guy
EDL	00:58:16,191	00:58:17,215	| serial-s03-e04 |	They discussed Avon
EDL	00:58:17,727	00:58:19,775	| serial-s03-e04 |	I wanted to take the told me he liked well
EDL	00:58:20,287	00:58:24,639	| serial-s03-e04 |	You know I believe they're going to be at each other and you know this and that like you don't even
EDL	00:58:25,151	00:58:26,943	| serial-s03-e04 |	Basically saying they're going to kill each other
EDL	00:58:27,455	00:58:28,991	| serial-s03-e04 |	That's what he said to you
EDL	00:58:29,759	00:58:30,271	| serial-s03-e04 |	This is Echo
EDL	00:58:33,599	00:58:34,623	| serial-s03-e04 |	Olympic
EDL	00:58:35,903	00:58:38,975	| serial-s03-e04 |	That was the day they let think about you and I will you know
EDL	00:58:39,743	00:58:45,887	| serial-s03-e04 |	How do you say don't worry about it Mr Rayfield delegate they're going to still deal with each other
EDL	00:58:45,887	00:58:47,167	| serial-s03-e04 |	Pretty after a while
EDL	00:58:47,167	00:58:50,751	| serial-s03-e04 |	They're going to close passing they going you know it's going to be between them to now
EDL	00:58:52,543	00:58:53,311	| serial-s03-e04 |	That's what it was
EDL	00:58:55,615	00:58:57,407	| serial-s03-e04 |	I pretty much shocked it
EDL	00:58:57,919	00:59:00,223	| serial-s03-e04 |	Me and the guys I'll be with haven't did nothing
EDL	00:59:00,991	00:59:05,087	| serial-s03-e04 |	No kind of proud of you like you know I'm glad you ain't did nothing yet but
EDL	00:59:05,087	00:59:06,111	| serial-s03-e04 |	Don't worry it's going to happen
EDL	00:59:06,623	00:59:07,903	| serial-s03-e04 |	You know me like
EDL	00:59:07,903	00:59:09,183	| serial-s03-e04 |	That's kind of was
EDL	00:59:14,815	00:59:16,863	| serial-s03-e04 |	I wasn't able to run this by detective Ackles
EDL	00:59:17,375	00:59:19,679	| serial-s03-e04 |	Again the Cleveland Police Department didn't want to comment on it
EDL	00:59:20,703	00:59:24,543	| serial-s03-e04 |	Prosecutor at the meeting said he didn't remember detective Echols saying that
EDL	00:59:24,543	00:59:26,591	| serial-s03-e04 |	But I can kind of imagine it
EDL	00:59:26,591	00:59:32,991	| serial-s03-e04 |	I had this meeting the Cleveland Police Department had only 12 homicide detectives murders in Cleveland reaching the
EDL	00:59:32,991	00:59:34,527	| serial-s03-e04 |	Are highest numbers in a decade
EDL	00:59:35,039	00:59:37,855	| serial-s03-e04 |	So yeah I can see a cop saying to Charles
EDL	00:59:37,855	00:59:41,695	| serial-s03-e04 |	Between us I think your best bet is to let them kill each other
EDL	00:59:41,695	00:59:44,767	| serial-s03-e04 |	Quiet bitter nod to the supremacy of Street Justice
EDL	00:59:46,559	00:59:47,327	| serial-s03-e04 |	So
EDL	00:59:47,327	00:59:49,119	| serial-s03-e04 |	What did get out of jail
EDL	00:59:49,887	00:59:51,679	| serial-s03-e04 |	Well it was detective work
EDL	00:59:52,191	00:59:53,983	| serial-s03-e04 |	But not by detectives
