EDL	00:01:42,912	00:01:48,032	| serial-s03-e03 |	A while back and maybe when I went to a meeting about community policing in Cleveland
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:51,616	| serial-s03-e03 |	The police department had invited people to a banquet hall for a workshop
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:53,920	| serial-s03-e03 |	Big round tables filled the space
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:56,736	| serial-s03-e03 |	Representatives from the police department or sprinkled throughout
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:58,784	| serial-s03-e03 |	Any stable had a moderator to keep things moving
EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:03,904	| serial-s03-e03 |	The group is supposed to answer a bunch of questions about what kinds of problems they wanted police to deal with
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:06,720	| serial-s03-e03 |	My table was populated with rule-followers
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:09,280	| serial-s03-e03 |	They dutifully work their way down the list of questions
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:13,888	| serial-s03-e03 |	The kids are hanging out in abandoned house in your neighborhood what should the police do about that
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:18,240	| serial-s03-e03 |	I guess I would hope that they would start by talking to the kids and
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:22,848	| serial-s03-e03 |	Reminding them that some people have to go to sleep and get up and work the next
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:24,128	| serial-s03-e03 |	Stay and be a little more

EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:34,112	| serial-s03-e03 |	Because his table
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:35,136	| serial-s03-e03 |	Brass tacks

EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:43,584	| serial-s03-e03 |	Music particular we are afraid of the police officer
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:45,376	| serial-s03-e03 |	I'm just going to be on it
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:46,912	| serial-s03-e03 |	I have a guy with an attorney
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:47,936	| serial-s03-e03 |	The civil rights cases
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:51,776	| serial-s03-e03 |	A police Commander sitting at the table Langley responded to him
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,312	| serial-s03-e03 |	Chris that's a broad brush
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:58,176	| serial-s03-e03 |	That's a broad brush you just have not afraid of me you not afraid of me

EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:08,160	| serial-s03-e03 |	This was the struggle of the table
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:13,024	| serial-s03-e03 |	The citizens wanting to talk historically culturally structurally
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:15,328	| serial-s03-e03 |	The cops wanting to talk specifically
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,096	| serial-s03-e03 |	Personally
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:16,864	| serial-s03-e03 |	Procedurally
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:19,680	| serial-s03-e03 |	The tables moderator was stalwart
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:23,520	| serial-s03-e03 |	She tried her level best to keep everyone on task there was just no way
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:25,312	| serial-s03-e03 |	We can have meeting for Dad
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:31,200	| serial-s03-e03 |	Mini if you said earlier we don't do a good job of getting people to come out
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:33,504	| serial-s03-e03 |	Would you do that way but how else do we
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:36,832	| serial-s03-e03 |	Send out to get feedback how can we engage more people
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:38,368	| serial-s03-e03 |	In this process
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:39,904	| serial-s03-e03 |	I want to know
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:42,208	| serial-s03-e03 |	What responsibilities or what

EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:45,183	| serial-s03-e03 |	Below the surface on the surface
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:48,255	| serial-s03-e03 |	His killing causes Civic spasm
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:51,839	| serial-s03-e03 |	Between police and the public but still painful and still unresolved
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:57,215	| serial-s03-e03 |	Santa Maria rice shows up at a meeting about the community's expectations from police
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:59,007	| serial-s03-e03 |	She speaks with Dreadful moral Authority
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:03,359	| serial-s03-e03 |	At first I didn't understand what Miss rice wanted from this meeting
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:06,175	| serial-s03-e03 |	She didn't seem interested in the State admission of the workshop

EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:10,015	| serial-s03-e03 |	For the community
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:14,623	| serial-s03-e03 |	Because it's going to be for the police today
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:19,743	| serial-s03-e03 |	The reason is aggravated because
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:21,535	| serial-s03-e03 |	That's what this mean it should be about you
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:30,495	| serial-s03-e03 |	We have an estimate no that's the main thing that's the main topic
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:36,895	| serial-s03-e03 |	Episodes of anything else that night
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:41,759	| serial-s03-e03 |	All of that falls upon the Earth
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:44,319	| serial-s03-e03 |	One of the two police officers at the table jumps in
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:45,087	| serial-s03-e03 |	He says

EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:49,183	| serial-s03-e03 |	How can you help us do that
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:52,767	| serial-s03-e03 |	What is a solution

EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:57,119	| serial-s03-e03 |	That's what I got it
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:06:03,007	| serial-s03-e03 |	But there's something absurdly wrongheaded to her and to a lot of people in Cleveland mostly black people
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:05,055	| serial-s03-e03 |	With this Earnest sounding question
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:07,103	| serial-s03-e03 |	How can you help us do that
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:08,895	| serial-s03-e03 |	Tamiya Raisa saying
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:10,431	| serial-s03-e03 |	Why are you turning his back on me
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:13,759	| serial-s03-e03 |	Why is it my job to help you do your job the way you're supposed to
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:17,343	| serial-s03-e03 |	You're the ones with the Cruisers in the handcuffs in the tasers and the god

EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:32,959	| serial-s03-e03 |	A persistent slogan in Cleveland even four years after his killing
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:34,495	| serial-s03-e03 |	Is Justice for Tamir
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:38,079	| serial-s03-e03 |	The case was investigated by three different agencies
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:39,871	| serial-s03-e03 |	City state and federal
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:42,687	| serial-s03-e03 |	The mayor appointed his own panel for fourth investigation
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:45,247	| serial-s03-e03 |	None found that the officers broke the law
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:52,159	| serial-s03-e03 |	Steuben County prosecutor handle the case with the delicacy of a lumberjack calling it a perfect storm of human error
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:53,951	| serial-s03-e03 |	Mistakes and miscommunications
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:57,791	| serial-s03-e03 |	Should have come as a surprise to no-one when a grand jury declined to indict
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:00,607	| serial-s03-e03 |	Technically you can argue
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:05,727	| serial-s03-e03 |	How many police officers in prosecutors do that Justice was applied in Tamir rice his case
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:07,775	| serial-s03-e03 |	But it doesn't feel that way
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:11,615	| serial-s03-e03 |	Instead it feels like an open question haunting the courthouse
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:14,175	| serial-s03-e03 |	If you're harmed by police
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:15,199	| serial-s03-e03 |	What does it take
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:17,247	| serial-s03-e03 |	Define Justice in court
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:18,527	| serial-s03-e03 |	Knife feels like justice
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:22,623	| serial-s03-e03 |	One way to try
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:24,159	| serial-s03-e03 |	Is by filing a lawsuit
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:24,927	| serial-s03-e03 |	Suing the police
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:26,719	| serial-s03-e03 |	We're going to

EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:55,647	| serial-s03-e03 |	Is face hugely puffed up on one side
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:59,743	| serial-s03-e03 |	Skin so tight from swelling that you could see the hospital lights reflected in his cheek
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:02,303	| serial-s03-e03 |	His left eye was submerged by the distortion

EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:39,423	| serial-s03-e03 |	When I was still blood red
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:41,215	| serial-s03-e03 |	He described above his eyebrow
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:41,983	| serial-s03-e03 |	How long have you lived here

EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:55,295	| serial-s03-e03 |	Then a lot of neighborhoods in Cleveland
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:58,111	| serial-s03-e03 |	Especially if you're from a dangerous neighborhood
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:09:00,159	| serial-s03-e03 |	Save got a teenager trying to keep out of the street
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:03,999	| serial-s03-e03 |	You might send them to his Andres grandma and you could put in school there
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:07,327	| serial-s03-e03 |	Airbus' building is called Richmond Hills
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:09,887	| serial-s03-e03 |	Apartment complex built in the 1960s
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:10,911	| serial-s03-e03 |	I'm so tired out by now
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:13,215	| serial-s03-e03 |	Irma's lives on the 5th floor
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:16,287	| serial-s03-e03 |	He wants me through his version of what happened that day
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:18,591	| serial-s03-e03 |	The police have a different version which will get to later
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:22,943	| serial-s03-e03 |	Therapist says he come downstairs to bum a cigarette from a friend on the 4th
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:27,039	| serial-s03-e03 |	And a couple cops were coming down the stairwell at one end of the hallway
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:28,063	| serial-s03-e03 |	Anime songs
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:29,855	| serial-s03-e03 |	Standing there knocking at his friends door
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:32,415	| serial-s03-e03 |	So sorry they can do that
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:34,719	| serial-s03-e03 |	I was going to tell you through the window
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:37,279	| serial-s03-e03 |	Yeah they saw me through the window I was standing at the door knocking at the door
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:39,071	| serial-s03-e03 |	And they came and stopped me
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:41,375	| serial-s03-e03 |	Right here where we standing
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:43,935	| serial-s03-e03 |	So they did they talk to you from there
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:45,983	| serial-s03-e03 |	Yes they were basically telling me to stop
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:47,519	| serial-s03-e03 |	You know just stay still
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:50,079	| serial-s03-e03 |	And they want to ask me some questions whatever
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:53,407	| serial-s03-e03 |	And it was two of them like mess we how y'all standing
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:54,431	| serial-s03-e03 |	And
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:10:01,855	| serial-s03-e03 |	Dachshund for my ID and asked me to searching for weapons in cops around the hallways before so that was
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:08,255	| serial-s03-e03 |	Surprised they work security here Moonlighting technically they're off-duty but they're in uniform and they are full
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:12,607	| serial-s03-e03 |	Police Powers most normal by the way lots of cops do this in Cuyahoga County
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:17,471	| serial-s03-e03 |	And Hermes had had run-ins with the police before and mostly they gone okay
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:23,871	| serial-s03-e03 |	Not counting the time he says he was jaywalking in East Cleveland and a cop stopped him and he ended up getting whacked in the knee repeatedly with a billy club in a rush
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:25,407	| serial-s03-e03 |	President put in jail for the night
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:29,759	| serial-s03-e03 |	But mostly he felt like he knew how to successfully navigate these interactions
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:35,903	| serial-s03-e03 |	With the Euclid cops that day he figured his best strategy was to cooperate and get it over with
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:39,743	| serial-s03-e03 |	He wasn't doing anything wrong he didn't want to give the cops any reason to suspect otherwise
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:43,583	| serial-s03-e03 |	So says he showed them his ID told him he lived upstairs
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:45,887	| serial-s03-e03 |	He said they asked if they could search him for weapons
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:48,447	| serial-s03-e03 |	Which means a pat down there feeling around for a gun
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:52,287	| serial-s03-e03 |	An air mass allowed in he didn't have a weapon on him he wasn't worried
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:54,847	| serial-s03-e03 |	What you did have on him with a blood
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:58,175	| serial-s03-e03 |	Marijuana cigarette in the pocket of his jeans
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:11:04,063	| serial-s03-e03 |	Which the cops found and which I'll get back to you because this measly blunt will become an outside player in the story
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:07,903	| serial-s03-e03 |	Anyway next thing Erma's new the officers went to arrest him
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:10,207	| serial-s03-e03 |	The other officer on this side
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:11,743	| serial-s03-e03 |	Acme
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:12,511	| serial-s03-e03 |	2
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:17,375	| serial-s03-e03 |	Put my hands behind my back I told them what am I under arrest where I'm asking like what am I under arrest for
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:20,703	| serial-s03-e03 |	And you never told me what I was under arrest for
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:23,263	| serial-s03-e03 |	At that point Irma says he stiffened his arm
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:25,823	| serial-s03-e03 |	The arm that one of the officers was trying to put behind his back
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:27,871	| serial-s03-e03 |	Who is resisting technically
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:29,919	| serial-s03-e03 |	And he's also asking
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:31,967	| serial-s03-e03 |	Why are you arresting me what did I do
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:33,503	| serial-s03-e03 |	No answer
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:34,015	| serial-s03-e03 |	Discussion
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:35,551	| serial-s03-e03 |	And then
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:37,087	| serial-s03-e03 |	The one on your side
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:39,903	| serial-s03-e03 |	He was like shut the f****** and need me and my boss
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:41,695	| serial-s03-e03 |	And I went down
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:43,743	| serial-s03-e03 |	Orissa my balls immediately like this
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:46,559	| serial-s03-e03 |	The other officer trying to tell me on the ground
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:48,863	| serial-s03-e03 |	I guess as if he was going to
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:50,655	| serial-s03-e03 |	Don't you know the procedure how they
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:52,191	| serial-s03-e03 |	You know if you resist arrest
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:54,239	| serial-s03-e03 |	They have a right to throw you to the ground
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,263	| serial-s03-e03 |	Put your hands behind your back
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:58,335	| serial-s03-e03 |	But they didn't put my hands on her better have one hand behind my back
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:03,199	| serial-s03-e03 |	And then other one to the kicking my face while I was on the ground
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:06,271	| serial-s03-e03 |	The kickin' Irma says is what caused the damage to his face
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:07,295	| serial-s03-e03 |	Broken orbital bone
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:09,087	| serial-s03-e03 |	That's about around your eye
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:14,463	| serial-s03-e03 |	A public defender in Cleveland told me how everyone's always whining about a broken orbital bone
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:20,351	| serial-s03-e03 |	What an air mass is case it was bad enough that the Euclid ER folks transferred him to a bigger Hospital in Cleveland
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:21,631	| serial-s03-e03 |	To make sure I would be okay
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:27,775	| serial-s03-e03 |	Anyway Aramis is down on the ground when cop is kicking him in the face another cop is holding back his right arm
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:30,335	| serial-s03-e03 |	His left arm is pinned underneath them
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:31,103	| serial-s03-e03 |	He can't get it free
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:34,175	| serial-s03-e03 |	Hermes got down on the gross hallway carpet to xiaomi
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:38,015	| serial-s03-e03 |	I didn't need him to do that but it seems as if he wanted to replay each step
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:39,295	| serial-s03-e03 |	Wish I could understand
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:41,855	| serial-s03-e03 |	It only been 10 days since it happened
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:43,135	| serial-s03-e03 |	Dan got his mind around it
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:44,415	| serial-s03-e03 |	I'm right here
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:46,463	| serial-s03-e03 |	My head is right here
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:47,999	| serial-s03-e03 |	The blood is leaking from my face
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:49,791	| serial-s03-e03 |	Going down dropping
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:50,815	| serial-s03-e03 |	What's the weather like this
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:52,351	| serial-s03-e03 |	So what happened was
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:54,655	| serial-s03-e03 |	He pays me right here
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:57,215	| serial-s03-e03 |	Something like this it takes me right here
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:59,007	| serial-s03-e03 |	Pays me and my neck
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:01,055	| serial-s03-e03 |	Tase me in the back of my thigh
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:03,103	| serial-s03-e03 |	And taste me and my left chest right here
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:05,151	| serial-s03-e03 |	And then I finally I told him like
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:07,967	| serial-s03-e03 |	I'm going to let you put my hands behind my back
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:11,551	| serial-s03-e03 |	And they put my hands behind my back pick me up
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:16,927	| serial-s03-e03 |	Oh my God is that your blood right there
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:22,047	| serial-s03-e03 |	There was a smear of blood with a big drip going down the wall at exactly the height of air masses I
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:23,583	| serial-s03-e03 |	Which isn't very high by the way
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:26,399	| serial-s03-e03 |	Nervous about 5657 I'd say
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:27,423	| serial-s03-e03 |	X-lite
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:29,471	| serial-s03-e03 |	The police tase him about 7 times
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:33,055	| serial-s03-e03 |	Not the full deployment each time where the wires come out in everything
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:35,871	| serial-s03-e03 |	The Lesser taser setting where it shocks and burns
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:39,199	| serial-s03-e03 |	Irma said he could feel electricity shoot down his legs
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:43,551	| serial-s03-e03 |	There's the burn marks to from the city mean
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:48,159	| serial-s03-e03 |	Aaron's furniture some spots that are feet where the carpet fibers were melted and Clump together
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:49,695	| serial-s03-e03 |	Is Hazel rare
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:53,791	| serial-s03-e03 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:58,399	| serial-s03-e03 |	Burn through my skin just like a burn through the carpet
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:13:59,167	| serial-s03-e03 |	So
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:05,823	| serial-s03-e03 |	Irma said while all this was going on the police were cursing at him he was cursing back
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:09,151	| serial-s03-e03 |	He said I just kept asking them why why are y'all doing this
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:10,687	| serial-s03-e03 |	What did I do to deserve this
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:12,735	| serial-s03-e03 |	He says they would not answer
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:16,831	| serial-s03-e03 |	Aramis if he'd been scared or enraged
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:19,647	| serial-s03-e03 |	The word he used was uncomfortable
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:25,791	| serial-s03-e03 |	Is it the whole thing made him feel uncomfortable which seems like an oddly muted way to express being kicked in the head by a cop
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:32,191	| serial-s03-e03 |	He also said he was trying not to let what happened distract him mentally not let it take him out of his everyday life
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:35,007	| serial-s03-e03 |	He said he just turned 30 a few days earlier
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:38,079	| serial-s03-e03 |	His family his girlfriend had gathered around him to cheer him up
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:39,103	| serial-s03-e03 |	He tried to celebrate
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:43,455	| serial-s03-e03 |	I got the sense he wasn't ready to stare too hard it would happen
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:44,735	| serial-s03-e03 |	For now
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:46,015	| serial-s03-e03 |	He'd leave it at uncomfortable
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:51,647	| serial-s03-e03 |	There's a security camera in the hallway right near the door he was knocking on
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:57,023	| serial-s03-e03 |	But it was pointed straight down we saw it so it seemed quite possible that even if it were working at the time
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:58,047	| serial-s03-e03 |	Apparently wasn't
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:15:00,095	| serial-s03-e03 |	Mapreduce footage of the floor
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:04,447	| serial-s03-e03 |	As the cops walked Aramis out of the building he says they were talking s*** to him
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:06,751	| serial-s03-e03 |	It doesn't remember exactly what they said
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:09,055	| serial-s03-e03 |	One more false move
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:10,335	| serial-s03-e03 |	Going to make it even worse for you the next
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:12,895	| serial-s03-e03 |	Then they put him in an ambulance
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:19,295	| serial-s03-e03 |	Backup an air mass is apartment we talked about that marijuana cigarette he had in his pocket
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:23,391	| serial-s03-e03 |	Dermis is thinking the police had no right to arrest him in the first place
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:27,999	| serial-s03-e03 |	That's why he's different his arm because he says he genuinely did not understand what was going on
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:31,327	| serial-s03-e03 |	Because of the amount of weed that I had
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:33,887	| serial-s03-e03 |	It was not arrested or charged
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:36,447	| serial-s03-e03 |	So I can never be resisting arrest for when blind
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:38,495	| serial-s03-e03 |	That's not impossible
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:43,871	| serial-s03-e03 |	Blend on me and believe me I have situations like this before
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:46,431	| serial-s03-e03 |	Where officers will take the weed
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:48,479	| serial-s03-e03 |	Throw it in the grass
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:49,503	| serial-s03-e03 |	Or throw it away
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:51,295	| serial-s03-e03 |	Flush it down the toilet
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:54,879	| serial-s03-e03 |	Because there's no probable cause to arrest
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:57,183	| serial-s03-e03 |	Sometimes officers write you a ticket
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:16:00,767	| serial-s03-e03 |	I'm not like I still couldn't be arrested no matter
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:04,863	| serial-s03-e03 |	No matter how mean are you sure that's true and Euclid though maybe that's true in Cleveland
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:07,423	| serial-s03-e03 |	That sure is a misdemeanor offense
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:08,703	| serial-s03-e03 |	And it's not a rustable
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:11,007	| serial-s03-e03 |	Is that right so
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:14,079	| serial-s03-e03 |	Lawyer in the room
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:16,895	| serial-s03-e03 |	Explain jet lazy could that
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:17,919	| serial-s03-e03 |	Aramis is incorrect
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:22,015	| serial-s03-e03 |	And Euclid Ohio any amount of weed can be charged as an M1
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,295	| serial-s03-e03 |	First degree misdemeanor
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:26,367	| serial-s03-e03 |	Possibility of $1,000 fine 6 months in jail
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:29,951	| serial-s03-e03 |	Just over the City Line back in Cleveland Ms would be correct
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:31,743	| serial-s03-e03 |	One blunt probably would be at
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:32,767	| serial-s03-e03 |	At most
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:34,303	| serial-s03-e03 |	But not here in Euclid
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:36,863	| serial-s03-e03 |	Ohio takes home rule very
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:37,631	| serial-s03-e03 |	Seriously
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:40,703	| serial-s03-e03 |	Cuyahoga County has 59 different municipalities
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:42,751	| serial-s03-e03 |	Each one has its own set of ordinances
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:46,591	| serial-s03-e03 |	Most of them align their city codes with Ohio state law
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:49,919	| serial-s03-e03 |	Which treats less than 100 grams of marijuana as a minor misdemeanor
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:54,527	| serial-s03-e03 |	But two of them treat any amount of marijuana as an M1
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:55,551	| serial-s03-e03 |	Broadview Heights
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:56,319	| serial-s03-e03 |	Little town down South
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:57,343	| serial-s03-e03 |	And Euclid
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:17:01,439	| serial-s03-e03 |	Euclid made its ordinance harsher in 1998
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:02,207	| serial-s03-e03 |	I'm not sure why
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:06,047	| serial-s03-e03 |	But it's worth noting that the city's black population was growing then
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:10,655	| serial-s03-e03 |	Curfew decades white people have been moving out and black people have been moving in
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:12,703	| serial-s03-e03 |	About 60% African
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:19,359	| serial-s03-e03 |	Euclid city government though city council six out of nine members are white mayor is white
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:24,479	| serial-s03-e03 |	Police chief is White City prosecutors White City law director is White City Judges White
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:27,551	| serial-s03-e03 |	And it's got the harshest weed law in the county
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:28,575	| serial-s03-e03 |	Just saying
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:38,303	| serial-s03-e03 |	The best Paul can do for Hermes
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:40,095	| serial-s03-e03 |	It's really the only thing he can do
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:43,935	| serial-s03-e03 |	It's a try to make everyone involved in sending Hermes to the hospital pay
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:48,031	| serial-s03-e03 |	How to drive back to Cleveland Paul talks about what he would do next
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:50,847	| serial-s03-e03 |	He also anticipated with the city's lawyer would like
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:52,895	| serial-s03-e03 |	Which he can do with confidence
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:55,199	| serial-s03-e03 |	Because Paul used to be that lawyer
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:57,759	| serial-s03-e03 |	Used to work the other side of these cases
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:17:59,295	| serial-s03-e03 |	Defending the government
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:17:59,807	| serial-s03-e03 |	The cops
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:02,111	| serial-s03-e03 |	He works for the city of Cleveland
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:06,975	| serial-s03-e03 |	Then he was a partner in a law firm that contracted with insurance companies to defend against civil rights claim
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:09,023	| serial-s03-e03 |	I was good at his job
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:10,303	| serial-s03-e03 |	Any make good money
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:11,327	| serial-s03-e03 |	Here to BMW
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:13,119	| serial-s03-e03 |	Convertible and hardtop
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:16,191	| serial-s03-e03 |	After while he couldn't stomach it
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:18,751	| serial-s03-e03 |	Cuz he felt like he was working for the wrong side
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:19,519	| serial-s03-e03 |	And start to affect
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:20,799	| serial-s03-e03 |	Is health so they switched over
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:24,127	| serial-s03-e03 |	So frequently mentioned that he drives a Hyundai now
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:24,895	| serial-s03-e03 |	And then I'll say
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:25,663	| serial-s03-e03 |	I'm fine with that
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:27,711	| serial-s03-e03 |	He's not totally fine with that
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:31,039	| serial-s03-e03 |	Aramis is case won't be huge money
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:33,343	| serial-s03-e03 |	Aramis wasn't permanently injured not physically
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:35,903	| serial-s03-e03 |	The poor things you can at least get him something
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:36,927	| serial-s03-e03 |	Maybe in the tens of thousands
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:42,815	| serial-s03-e03 |	Is a complication they have to take care of first though before Paul can get a lawsuit going
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:46,143	| serial-s03-e03 |	Nothing not small matter of air masses criminal charges
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:48,703	| serial-s03-e03 |	The Euclid Police cited Aramis
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:49,471	| serial-s03-e03 |	4 crimes
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:50,751	| serial-s03-e03 |	Drug abuse
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:51,775	| serial-s03-e03 |	Resisting arrest
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:53,311	| serial-s03-e03 |	Theft and criminal damaging
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:55,359	| serial-s03-e03 |	Paul said that list
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:56,383	| serial-s03-e03 |	Pretty typical
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:58,431	| serial-s03-e03 |	So I'm hitting you with four charges
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:00,223	| serial-s03-e03 |	And so now let's negotiate down
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:07,647	| serial-s03-e03 |	So I'm going to load you up so this way I mean it over overcharges and the prosecutor little something else
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:08,415	| serial-s03-e03 |	A little bit more left
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:11,231	| serial-s03-e03 |	To still get you to plead to something
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:13,535	| serial-s03-e03 |	I was confused
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:15,071	| serial-s03-e03 |	House where Aramis and Paul
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:18,655	| serial-s03-e03 |	What does theft and criminal damaging or about
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:20,447	| serial-s03-e03 |	Until I read the police report
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:22,239	| serial-s03-e03 |	There's a page long narrative
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:27,359	| serial-s03-e03 |	Didn't the cops describe an event with roughly the same Contours as what Hermes told me
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:28,383	| serial-s03-e03 |	But very different detail
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:31,455	| serial-s03-e03 |	The officers didn't talk to me for this
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:34,783	| serial-s03-e03 |	Story and just to say neither of them has been disciplined for what happened that night
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:39,647	| serial-s03-e03 |	In the report they say that after They confiscated the marijuana
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:41,439	| serial-s03-e03 |	Hermes try to take it out of one office
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:43,999	| serial-s03-e03 |	They say Aramis was fighting with
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:45,279	| serial-s03-e03 |	Pushing them
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:47,583	| serial-s03-e03 |	But everyone was getting stung by the taser in the process
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:50,911	| serial-s03-e03 |	They say Hermes tried to take the taser away from them
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:51,935	| serial-s03-e03 |	That's the FAFSA parent
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:54,751	| serial-s03-e03 |	And if the tasers cartridge got pulled off
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:56,287	| serial-s03-e03 |	And the blast door broken off
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:19:59,871	| serial-s03-e03 |	The term has knocked one officers glasses off his face
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:00,383	| serial-s03-e03 |	Breaking them
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:02,943	| serial-s03-e03 |	They never mention kicking Aramis
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:05,247	| serial-s03-e03 |	They do describe kneeing him in the crotch
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:07,295	| serial-s03-e03 |	Anclote close-fisted strikes
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:08,063	| serial-s03-e03 |	To his face and head
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:12,159	| serial-s03-e03 |	Aramis has got to get out from under these charges
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:13,695	| serial-s03-e03 |	Strategically
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:14,207	| serial-s03-e03 |	Quietly
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:17,279	| serial-s03-e03 |	Right now I almost doesn't think he should have to plead any
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:23,679	| serial-s03-e03 |	But Paul thinks it might actually be better for the civil case if he does plead to something minor
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:25,727	| serial-s03-e03 |	And that's hilarious is looking at
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:27,519	| serial-s03-e03 |	He's like like I should walk out of this
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:28,287	| serial-s03-e03 |	Literally
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:28,799	| serial-s03-e03 |	With no
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:31,615	| serial-s03-e03 |	Problem with that is
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:34,943	| serial-s03-e03 |	Nephew just take this hard-line
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:36,479	| serial-s03-e03 |	Like I'm not going to plead the even up
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:38,527	| serial-s03-e03 |	Minor misdemeanor some one of them
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:39,551	| serial-s03-e03 |	Play U2
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:43,135	| serial-s03-e03 |	I think that's going to
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:43,903	| serial-s03-e03 |	Raise
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:44,927	| serial-s03-e03 |	The flags that that
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:49,791	| serial-s03-e03 |	He's up to something that that he's standing on principle he's looking to sue you for the injuries
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:54,399	| serial-s03-e03 |	Last thing Paul wanted the stage is for Euclid to know it is being sued
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:57,727	| serial-s03-e03 |	Because if they know they will dig in on the criminal charges
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:20:59,775	| serial-s03-e03 |	Tell first step
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:00,287	| serial-s03-e03 |	Delay
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:03,615	| serial-s03-e03 |	Hermes was supposed to have his initial court appearance
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:04,895	| serial-s03-e03 |	Today actually
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:06,943	| serial-s03-e03 |	Are they got it postponed a couple weeks
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:08,991	| serial-s03-e03 |	Ticket is FaceTime to go back to normal
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:12,575	| serial-s03-e03 |	I don't want him walking into court looking like he just got his ass
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:14,367	| serial-s03-e03 |	Why
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:16,672	| serial-s03-e03 |	Again because
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:21,024	| serial-s03-e03 |	People asking a so what happened then
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:24,352	| serial-s03-e03 |	If you go in front of the judge
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:25,632	| serial-s03-e03 |	Sure
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:26,912	| serial-s03-e03 |	Yeah young man what happened to you
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:33,568	| serial-s03-e03 |	Prosecutor might notice you could police officers who happen to be in court that day they might notice
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:34,592	| serial-s03-e03 |	Start asking around
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:37,664	| serial-s03-e03 |	Paul wants Hermes to be unremarkable
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:40,480	| serial-s03-e03 |	Just there to take care of these charges and go on home
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:41,248	| serial-s03-e03 |	No big deal

EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:41,632	| serial-s03-e03 |	A study published in 2016 found that
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:46,496	| serial-s03-e03 |	Reports of police brutality not only contribute to a quote Spirit of legal cynicism
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:49,824	| serial-s03-e03 |	They also cause people to not call the cops when they need them
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:51,616	| serial-s03-e03 |	They make entire cities less safe
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:58,016	| serial-s03-e03 |	The researchers looked at 911 calls before and after an Infamous case in Milwaukee
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:26:00,576	| serial-s03-e03 |	The 2004 beating of a guy named Frank Jude
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:07,488	| serial-s03-e03 |	They found it for a year afterwards there were twenty-two thousand fewer 9-1-1 calls in Milwaukee Residence Inn
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:11,072	| serial-s03-e03 |	Black neighborhoods especially or far less likely to report crime
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:17,216	| serial-s03-e03 |	And at the same time that people were reporting fewer crimes murders in Milwaukee Rose by 32%
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:21,312	| serial-s03-e03 |	The goal of Paul's lawsuit
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:22,848	| serial-s03-e03 |	Aside from getting Hermes some justice
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:23,872	| serial-s03-e03 |	Dim sum dough
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:26,688	| serial-s03-e03 |	Is DeForest police to account for their behavior
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:27,456	| serial-s03-e03 |	Answer for it
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:28,992	| serial-s03-e03 |	And I asked him
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:31,040	| serial-s03-e03 |	Setting his own livelihood aside
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:34,624	| serial-s03-e03 |	Is it possible that his involvement could actually be hampering progress
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:38,208	| serial-s03-e03 |	Seramis went to the police department in complaint
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:38,976	| serial-s03-e03 |	The supervisors
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:43,072	| serial-s03-e03 |	Or the use of force in the officer's report triggered an internal investigation
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:47,680	| serial-s03-e03 |	And say that process were allowed to play out without the Specter of a lawsuit
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:51,008	| serial-s03-e03 |	Isn't it possible that apartment would fix itself
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:52,800	| serial-s03-e03 |	That is no that's
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:53,568	| serial-s03-e03 |	I mean

EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:55,872	| serial-s03-e03 |	People say it's a great question
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:59,456	| serial-s03-e03 |	I love when people say that
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:00,480	| serial-s03-e03 |	It is
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:01,248	| serial-s03-e03 |	Because
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:03,040	| serial-s03-e03 |	I mean you know if I could even
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:04,576	| serial-s03-e03 |	We brought your question a little bit
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:06,112	| serial-s03-e03 |	I know what you're asking is
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:09,440	| serial-s03-e03 |	But the way you're handling is Paula kind of how you're at your ear
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:15,584	| serial-s03-e03 |	Triangulating orchestrating if you well you're denying the city of Euclid
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:17,376	| serial-s03-e03 |	And the police department the opportunity
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:20,448	| serial-s03-e03 |	To do this right on their own
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:21,728	| serial-s03-e03 |	And you're absolutely right
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:23,776	| serial-s03-e03 |	You're right I am doing that but that's because
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:26,080	| serial-s03-e03 |	Distrust
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:30,944	| serial-s03-e03 |	If I were to kind of do what you're saying are we were to March down there and fill out a citizen
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:34,528	| serial-s03-e03 |	Complaint and talk to them about constitutional rights and excessive force
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:36,576	| serial-s03-e03 |	I'm leaving it up to them now
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:40,416	| serial-s03-e03 |	Set to kind of say well you know what yeah this was awful we better do an intro investigate
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:41,696	| serial-s03-e03 |	Guess we better do what's right
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:42,464	| serial-s03-e03 |	And
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:44,256	| serial-s03-e03 |	And that just hasn't been my experience
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:47,072	| serial-s03-e03 |	I thought just hasn't been my experience
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:48,352	| serial-s03-e03 |	I think when you do that
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:50,912	| serial-s03-e03 |	They don't own it be the lawyer up
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:52,704	| serial-s03-e03 |	It's never situation

EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:17,792	| serial-s03-e03 |	Did that would happen
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:24,448	| serial-s03-e03 |	This is what bothered Paul the most when he worked the defense side he said
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:26,752	| serial-s03-e03 |	The city's disdain for the plaintiffs

EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:04,480	| serial-s03-e03 |	And the many calls for his resignation
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:08,576	| serial-s03-e03 |	In what article he explained that he'd appointed himself as a commissioner
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:12,416	| serial-s03-e03 |	Because he didn't want to subject any of his patrolman to quote that farce of a commission
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:16,256	| serial-s03-e03 |	Still he insisted he is not an to reform
EDL	00:36:16,256	00:36:18,304	| serial-s03-e03 |	We can always improve on what we do here
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:20,352	| serial-s03-e03 |	He told me and I'm happy to take that challenge on
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:23,936	| serial-s03-e03 |	But when I asked him about possible reforms in Cleveland
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:27,264	| serial-s03-e03 |	Reforms that are being discussed and implemented all over the country
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:29,312	| serial-s03-e03 |	Vigorously whacked each one aside
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:32,384	| serial-s03-e03 |	Slowing down police interactions with suspects
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:33,664	| serial-s03-e03 |	And hopes of avoiding the need for
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:34,432	| serial-s03-e03 |	Perforce
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:35,712	| serial-s03-e03 |	Everybody wants to talk about
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:39,552	| serial-s03-e03 |	The escalation it's just really sexy word for talking
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:43,648	| serial-s03-e03 |	You know it is good that's what guess what
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:45,952	| serial-s03-e03 |	That's what we've done since the beginning of time
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:46,464	| serial-s03-e03 |	Bias
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:51,584	| serial-s03-e03 |	Steve would like to see one study linking implicit bias to police actions and reactions
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:53,376	| serial-s03-e03 |	Racial profiling
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:55,680	| serial-s03-e03 |	I'm not going to sit here and say that that doesn't
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:57,472	| serial-s03-e03 |	Happened somewhere else
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:37:00,544	| serial-s03-e03 |	And a world I am going to sit here and say
EDL	00:37:00,544	00:37:01,568	| serial-s03-e03 |	In the city of Cleveland
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:03,104	| serial-s03-e03 |	There's no way that it
EDL	00:37:03,616	00:37:05,408	| serial-s03-e03 |	It's not supported in fact
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:07,200	| serial-s03-e03 |	Right
EDL	00:37:07,200	00:37:09,504	| serial-s03-e03 |	Are you supports policy
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:10,272	| serial-s03-e03 |	Is coming out
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:12,576	| serial-s03-e03 |	Nothing is going to be atrocious
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:17,696	| serial-s03-e03 |	More restrictions on how and when police can use a gun is going to endanger his officers
EDL	00:37:17,696	00:37:19,232	| serial-s03-e03 |	Cuz they'll think twice
EDL	00:37:19,232	00:37:21,536	| serial-s03-e03 |	Don't be afraid of getting in trouble for doing it wrong
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:22,816	| serial-s03-e03 |	And then it'll be too late
EDL	00:37:23,328	00:37:24,608	| serial-s03-e03 |	The common complaint among police
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:25,888	| serial-s03-e03 |	Tasering people
EDL	00:37:26,400	00:37:28,192	| serial-s03-e03 |	You know why you can't teaser juvenile
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:30,240	| serial-s03-e03 |	Okay
EDL	00:37:30,240	00:37:31,008	| serial-s03-e03 |	Yellow
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:35,872	| serial-s03-e03 |	Tamir rice nobody wants to talk about it but to be racist 5-foot 791
EDL	00:37:37,152	00:37:37,920	| serial-s03-e03 |	All right
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:39,200	| serial-s03-e03 |	Annie's 12 years old
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:46,112	| serial-s03-e03 |	Does Steve the Tamir rice case is the perfect example of how people misunderstand and willfully distort what the police
EDL	00:37:46,112	00:37:47,904	| serial-s03-e03 |	Still other fixes make no sense
EDL	00:37:48,928	00:37:55,328	| serial-s03-e03 |	To me the way Steve talked about the Tamir rice case was a perfect example of why so many people in Cleveland believe the police has
EDL	00:37:55,328	00:37:57,376	| serial-s03-e03 |	0 capacity for self-reflection
EDL	00:37:57,376	00:37:58,656	| serial-s03-e03 |	Much less self-correction
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:38:03,008	| serial-s03-e03 |	The officer who shot Tamir was new Young still on probation
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:08,896	| serial-s03-e03 |	I pointed out that Steve himself as an experienced officer had avoided shootings by lowering his weapon
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:10,944	| serial-s03-e03 |	You just giving me a couple examples
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:15,808	| serial-s03-e03 |	So why is he saying in the Tamir rice situation any officer would have done the same thing
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:17,088	| serial-s03-e03 |	You wouldn't have done
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:21,184	| serial-s03-e03 |	And you're telling me right now you would I absolutely would have done the same
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:23,744	| serial-s03-e03 |	Would not have done the same
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:26,048	| serial-s03-e03 |	You're telling me you wouldn't
EDL	00:38:26,048	00:38:28,352	| serial-s03-e03 |	You want to get into rice we're going to get in the train tracks
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:29,632	| serial-s03-e03 |	So it began
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:32,704	| serial-s03-e03 |	Steve reiterated as he has many times
EDL	00:38:32,704	00:38:35,008	| serial-s03-e03 |	The number one camera was a big kid
EDL	00:38:35,008	00:38:36,800	| serial-s03-e03 |	As if that made him blameworthy
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:38,848	| serial-s03-e03 |	A child in a man's body
EDL	00:38:39,616	00:38:40,384	| serial-s03-e03 |	Bottom line
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:41,920	| serial-s03-e03 |	There's no denying that
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:43,712	| serial-s03-e03 |	Nobody can dispute
EDL	00:38:44,736	00:38:47,296	| serial-s03-e03 |	Number to Tamir rice noodle exactly why those
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:48,064	| serial-s03-e03 |	Policeman
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:50,368	| serial-s03-e03 |	We're driving that marked police car towards him
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:51,904	| serial-s03-e03 |	Right
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:53,952	| serial-s03-e03 |	He is a product of the street
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:56,000	| serial-s03-e03 |	He is not a product of
EDL	00:38:58,816	00:38:59,328	| serial-s03-e03 |	Loving
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:00,864	| serial-s03-e03 |	Home
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:04,448	| serial-s03-e03 |	Hang on
EDL	00:39:04,960	00:39:07,008	| serial-s03-e03 |	I did hang on and it got worse
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:08,800	| serial-s03-e03 |	The salvaging of Samaria rice
EDL	00:39:08,800	00:39:10,848	| serial-s03-e03 |	But I'm not going to dignify by repeating here
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:13,920	| serial-s03-e03 |	Steve has said unkind things about the rice family
EDL	00:39:13,920	00:39:14,688	| serial-s03-e03 |	In the past
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:20,064	| serial-s03-e03 |	He also helpfully suggested they should use the money they got from a lawsuit to educate kids about the dangers of
EDL	00:39:20,064	00:39:20,576	| serial-s03-e03 |	Guns
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:23,904	| serial-s03-e03 |	He wasn't worried about his tone or its implications then
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:24,672	| serial-s03-e03 |	He's not worried now
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:26,464	| serial-s03-e03 |	He believes the factor with him
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:31,840	| serial-s03-e03 |	We disagreed about whether the police drove up to close to Tamir whether they drove up
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:37,216	| serial-s03-e03 |	Too fast with her Tamir pulled the gun from his waistband with of the shooting of Tamir rice was a mistake at all
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:40,288	| serial-s03-e03 |	Okay we can disagree till the cows come home
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:42,080	| serial-s03-e03 |	Poem about what should have happened or why it
EDL	00:39:43,104	00:39:45,664	| serial-s03-e03 |	And my guess is we probably would
EDL	00:39:45,664	00:39:46,688	| serial-s03-e03 |	Supported in fact
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:50,784	| serial-s03-e03 |	That's fine but I think we can all agree it was a
EDL	00:39:50,784	00:39:51,552	| serial-s03-e03 |	Horrible
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:53,088	| serial-s03-e03 |	Horrible outcome right
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:55,392	| serial-s03-e03 |	They want I know you have I know you have
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:39:56,416	| serial-s03-e03 |	So what I'm
EDL	00:39:56,928	00:39:58,208	| serial-s03-e03 |	Wondering is
EDL	00:39:58,208	00:40:00,000	| serial-s03-e03 |	Do you see any fixes
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:02,048	| serial-s03-e03 |	Is there a thing where you're like
EDL	00:40:02,048	00:40:05,120	| serial-s03-e03 |	Sure isn't change that I think could have avoided
EDL	00:40:05,120	00:40:07,168	| serial-s03-e03 |	That's that isn't only on Tamir
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:08,448	| serial-s03-e03 |	They haven't they haven't
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:10,496	| serial-s03-e03 |	It's absolutely artem
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:14,336	| serial-s03-e03 |	It's on any suspect get shot by the police
EDL	00:40:15,360	00:40:16,896	| serial-s03-e03 |	Actions by suspects
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:18,432	| serial-s03-e03 |	Cause reactions by police office
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:19,968	| serial-s03-e03 |	Justified react
EDL	00:40:21,760	00:40:24,832	| serial-s03-e03 |	Did police take away any lessons then from the Tamir rice case
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:27,392	| serial-s03-e03 |	Sure he said we always learn a lot
EDL	00:40:28,416	00:40:29,184	| serial-s03-e03 |	So what is it
EDL	00:40:29,952	00:40:30,464	| serial-s03-e03 |	I don't know
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:35,584	| serial-s03-e03 |	It was in fact the only time I stumped him in our 6 hours together
EDL	00:40:36,096	00:40:37,632	| serial-s03-e03 |	I asked him several times
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:40,448	| serial-s03-e03 |	And he could not come up with one thing that wasn't two mirrors fault
EDL	00:40:41,216	00:40:43,520	| serial-s03-e03 |	It sounds like you're saying there's nothing that needs
EDL	00:40:43,520	00:40:44,032	| serial-s03-e03 |	2 Chainz
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:46,336	| serial-s03-e03 |	That's what needs to change
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:50,432	| serial-s03-e03 |	That's not what I'm saying what I'm saying is that those changes need to be based in reality
EDL	00:40:50,944	00:40:52,480	| serial-s03-e03 |	But what should the changes be
EDL	00:40:52,992	00:40:54,272	| serial-s03-e03 |	Not La La Land
EDL	00:40:55,040	00:40:56,576	| serial-s03-e03 |	Why do we fix a tan
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:40:57,088	| serial-s03-e03 |	Focus
EDL	00:40:57,856	00:40:58,368	| serial-s03-e03 |	On
EDL	00:40:59,392	00:41:00,416	| serial-s03-e03 |	Tamir rice
EDL	00:41:00,416	00:41:01,952	| serial-s03-e03 |	That's the beer question to me
EDL	00:41:02,464	00:41:05,024	| serial-s03-e03 |	Is we want to change our entire profession
EDL	00:41:05,536	00:41:06,560	| serial-s03-e03 |	Based on
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:07,584	| serial-s03-e03 |	A couple different
EDL	00:41:08,352	00:41:11,168	| serial-s03-e03 |	When you're saying why are we fixating on these desk
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:13,728	| serial-s03-e03 |	Because people are like enough is enough is enough is enough
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:16,544	| serial-s03-e03 |	They're saying it's one one is two
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:19,360	| serial-s03-e03 |	Too many one accident like this is too many let's fix
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:21,664	| serial-s03-e03 |	Can you race was not an accident
EDL	00:41:22,688	00:41:24,736	| serial-s03-e03 |	Tamir rice was pulling a gun out of his waist
EDL	00:41:26,016	00:41:28,832	| serial-s03-e03 |	All right we're saying you shouldn't have died for it
EDL	00:41:29,600	00:41:30,880	| serial-s03-e03 |	He shouldn't have died
EDL	00:41:31,392	00:41:33,952	| serial-s03-e03 |	I this is what I'm saying I think this is what we're all asked
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:37,536	| serial-s03-e03 |	But what's frustrating is
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:38,304	| serial-s03-e03 |	We don't go
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:42,912	| serial-s03-e03 |	When somebody calls us and tells us that somebody should have rec center with a gun
EDL	00:41:42,912	00:41:43,424	| serial-s03-e03 |	We don't go
EDL	00:41:44,192	00:41:45,472	| serial-s03-e03 |	That's the only way to fix it
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:48,800	| serial-s03-e03 |	Right
EDL	00:41:50,080	00:41:52,384	| serial-s03-e03 |	Black panther hat
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:56,223	| serial-s03-e03 |	I think Steve might actually believe what he's saying here
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:41:59,551	| serial-s03-e03 |	The police are never to blame for harming someone in the line of duty
EDL	00:41:59,551	00:42:03,903	| serial-s03-e03 |	If you end up dead or hurt it's always because of something you did or didn't do
EDL	00:42:04,671	00:42:07,231	| serial-s03-e03 |	It follows then that the only ones who need to reform
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:07,999	| serial-s03-e03 |	Are the citizens
EDL	00:42:08,767	00:42:11,583	| serial-s03-e03 |	The name of Cleveland's 1500 patrolman
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:13,119	| serial-s03-e03 |	Steve Loomis is folding his arms
EDL	00:42:13,631	00:42:15,935	| serial-s03-e03 |	Inside his petulance is also a threat
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:18,239	| serial-s03-e03 |	Not like how we do business fine
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:19,519	| serial-s03-e03 |	. arresting people
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:21,311	| serial-s03-e03 |	See how you like your sitting at
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:26,943	| serial-s03-e03 |	It's the same stance some police officers have taken in Chicago and Minneapolis
EDL	00:42:26,943	00:42:28,991	| serial-s03-e03 |	New York and Baltimore
EDL	00:42:28,991	00:42:29,759	| serial-s03-e03 |	Cop out
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:45,375	| serial-s03-e03 |	Speed limit says Cleveland's problem isn't rotten police or poorly trained police or faulty policies
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:47,935	| serial-s03-e03 |	Problem he says is understaffing
EDL	00:42:47,935	00:42:54,335	| serial-s03-e03 |	He's not wrong even people who can't abide Steve Loomis agree that Cleveland Police Department is overburdened and under
EDL	00:42:54,335	00:42:55,871	| serial-s03-e03 |	Plaid and poorly paid
EDL	00:42:56,639	00:42:59,711	| serial-s03-e03 |	This of course is the limit of law enforcement everywhere
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:00,991	| serial-s03-e03 |	Civilians
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:02,527	| serial-s03-e03 |	We need your tax dollars
EDL	00:43:03,039	00:43:04,063	| serial-s03-e03 |	But we don't need
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:05,599	| serial-s03-e03 |	Is there oversight
EDL	00:43:10,719	00:43:11,743	| serial-s03-e03 |	A Cota here
EDL	00:43:11,743	00:43:13,279	| serial-s03-e03 |	A few weeks after we spoke
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:17,119	| serial-s03-e03 |	Steve Loomis was replaced as Union president have been voted out of office
EDL	00:43:17,119	00:43:20,703	| serial-s03-e03 |	And I'm not saying these things are necessarily connected but
EDL	00:43:20,703	00:43:25,311	| serial-s03-e03 |	8 months later the team in charge of overseeing police reforms in Cleveland release some stats
EDL	00:43:26,079	00:43:28,639	| serial-s03-e03 |	Showing the during the first five months of 2018
EDL	00:43:29,151	00:43:32,991	| serial-s03-e03 |	Police use-of-force in Cleveland has decreased by nearly 40%
EDL	00:43:32,991	00:43:34,015	| serial-s03-e03 |	Compared to the year before
EDL	00:43:34,527	00:43:38,623	| serial-s03-e03 |	It was too soon to claim victory the report said that it was encouraging
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:42,207	| serial-s03-e03 |	Aramis Spencer
EDL	00:43:42,207	00:43:42,975	| serial-s03-e03 |	Okay
EDL	00:43:42,975	00:43:44,255	| serial-s03-e03 |	We are here on this
EDL	00:43:44,255	00:43:45,535	| serial-s03-e03 |	Motion to suppress
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:48,095	| serial-s03-e03 |	5 months after he been arrested
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:50,143	| serial-s03-e03 |	Aramis went to court for hearing
EDL	00:43:50,911	00:43:53,983	| serial-s03-e03 |	By now the city of Euclid knew a civil lawsuit was probably coming
EDL	00:43:54,495	00:43:59,103	| serial-s03-e03 |	Which is why after all this time before criminal charges were still hungered in his case File
EDL	00:43:59,615	00:44:01,919	| serial-s03-e03 |	It's all predicted the city was unrelenting
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:04,479	| serial-s03-e03 |	The prosecutor was not going to drop them
EDL	00:44:04,479	00:44:06,271	| serial-s03-e03 |	Definitely not the resisting arrest
EDL	00:44:07,039	00:44:08,575	| serial-s03-e03 |	That's the linchpin charge
EDL	00:44:08,575	00:44:09,599	| serial-s03-e03 |	The resisting
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:11,903	| serial-s03-e03 |	The one that could really mess up air masses civil case
EDL	00:44:12,415	00:44:17,279	| serial-s03-e03 |	Because of Aramis gets convicted of resisting that could justify the officer's use-of-force
EDL	00:44:17,791	00:44:21,631	| serial-s03-e03 |	Not necessarily the excessiveness of the beating it doesn't give him carte blanche
EDL	00:44:22,143	00:44:25,727	| serial-s03-e03 |	But it does allow the officers to do what they have to do to subdue a suspect
EDL	00:44:26,495	00:44:30,847	| serial-s03-e03 |	Tavares has to eat that resisting charge it could shrivel his civil claim
EDL	00:44:31,359	00:44:33,151	| serial-s03-e03 |	That's why the city won't budge on the resist
EDL	00:44:33,663	00:44:35,455	| serial-s03-e03 |	And wireless won't budge either
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:39,039	| serial-s03-e03 |	Instead today Aramis is here on a motion sensor
EDL	00:44:39,039	00:44:39,807	| serial-s03-e03 |	Suppress
EDL	00:44:39,807	00:44:45,695	| serial-s03-e03 |	He's trying to get all the charges dropped by claiming that the police had no Reasonable Suspicion to stop him in that hallway
EDL	00:44:45,695	00:44:49,279	| serial-s03-e03 |	And then after they made the faulty stop they had no probable cause to search him
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:52,095	| serial-s03-e03 |	What you make the actual blunt they found on him
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:53,887	| serial-s03-e03 |	The fruit of a poisonous tree
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:55,167	| serial-s03-e03 |	That's the legal metaphor
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:57,983	| serial-s03-e03 |	So no legal stop no legal arrest
EDL	00:44:57,983	00:44:58,495	| serial-s03-e03 |	No case
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:03,359	| serial-s03-e03 |	When I walk into the courtroom Mary case of the city prosecutor said to me
EDL	00:45:03,359	00:45:05,151	| serial-s03-e03 |	You do know this is just a hearing right
EDL	00:45:05,663	00:45:06,431	| serial-s03-e03 |	I do I said
EDL	00:45:07,199	00:45:09,247	| serial-s03-e03 |	Then she and the other lawyers left the room
EDL	00:45:09,247	00:45:09,759	| serial-s03-e03 |	For a while
EDL	00:45:10,527	00:45:12,319	| serial-s03-e03 |	I sat waiting in the empty jewelry box
EDL	00:45:12,319	00:45:15,135	| serial-s03-e03 |	Hermes the two cops are masses mother all set on the benches
EDL	00:45:15,647	00:45:16,671	| serial-s03-e03 |	No one said anything
EDL	00:45:17,183	00:45:18,463	| serial-s03-e03 |	I wrote in my notes
EDL	00:45:18,463	00:45:19,487	| serial-s03-e03 |	It's like a tomb in
EDL	00:45:20,767	00:45:23,839	| serial-s03-e03 |	I heard a ruckus to the wall behind me where the prosecutor's office is
EDL	00:45:24,351	00:45:25,119	| serial-s03-e03 |	People were shouting
EDL	00:45:25,887	00:45:28,703	| serial-s03-e03 |	After while the lawyers filed back into the courtroom
EDL	00:45:28,703	00:45:29,215	| serial-s03-e03 |	Looking peeved
EDL	00:45:29,727	00:45:32,543	| serial-s03-e03 |	Mary case in a couple other lawyers sat on one side
EDL	00:45:32,543	00:45:34,591	| serial-s03-e03 |	How the other Aramis and his defense attorney
EDL	00:45:35,103	00:45:36,639	| serial-s03-e03 |	The local guy Paul had enlisted

EDL	00:45:38,943	00:45:40,479	| serial-s03-e03 |	Judge Deborah lebarron announced

EDL	00:45:50,975	00:45:53,023	| serial-s03-e03 |	Proceedings with casein
EDL	00:45:53,023	00:45:54,559	| serial-s03-e03 |	Thank you.
EDL	00:45:54,559	00:45:56,863	| serial-s03-e03 |	You're at this time the city would request
EDL	00:45:56,863	00:45:58,655	| serial-s03-e03 |	A continuance of this hearing
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:46:01,215	| serial-s03-e03 |	We have some concerns with respect to this
EDL	00:46:01,215	00:46:03,519	| serial-s03-e03 |	During being recorded for a public podcast
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:05,823	| serial-s03-e03 |	It seemed I had been the cause of the Ruckus
EDL	00:46:06,591	00:46:09,663	| serial-s03-e03 |	We have an interest in protecting the city of Euclid
EDL	00:46:11,967	00:46:15,807	| serial-s03-e03 |	Any flicker of an ocean I had that the city's intentions were forthright
EDL	00:46:15,807	00:46:16,831	| serial-s03-e03 |	Withered now
EDL	00:46:17,343	00:46:20,159	| serial-s03-e03 |	Before I figured Wilshire there triangulating
EDL	00:46:20,159	00:46:21,183	| serial-s03-e03 |	Just like Paul
EDL	00:46:21,183	00:46:25,279	| serial-s03-e03 |	It also assumed that they were at least Prosecuting Aramis in good faith
EDL	00:46:25,279	00:46:26,815	| serial-s03-e03 |	Because they believe the cops
EDL	00:46:26,815	00:46:28,607	| serial-s03-e03 |	Believe he committed these crimes
EDL	00:46:28,607	00:46:29,631	| serial-s03-e03 |	And deserve punishment
EDL	00:46:30,655	00:46:36,031	| serial-s03-e03 |	But you don't try to kick a reporter out of a public proceeding unless there's something unsavory about what's about to happen
EDL	00:46:37,311	00:46:39,615	| serial-s03-e03 |	Judge LeBaron deny the prosecutor's request
EDL	00:46:39,615	00:46:40,383	| serial-s03-e03 |	For continuance
EDL	00:46:40,383	00:46:41,663	| serial-s03-e03 |	It again
EDL	00:46:41,663	00:46:46,783	| serial-s03-e03 |	Hearing would not touch on anything that came after the search so nothing about the resisting or the beating
EDL	00:46:46,783	00:46:50,111	| serial-s03-e03 |	This was only about the validity of the stop in the search
EDL	00:46:50,111	00:46:56,511	| serial-s03-e03 |	Mary Kay Satin Spiros gonakis took both cops through it Moment by moment that's where the law tends to snap into place
EDL	00:46:56,511	00:46:57,279	| serial-s03-e03 |	An instant
EDL	00:46:58,047	00:47:00,351	| serial-s03-e03 |	First up with officer Shane Rivera
EDL	00:47:00,351	00:47:02,911	| serial-s03-e03 |	He explained that he and his partner officer Michael amiott
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:07,775	| serial-s03-e03 |	I've been working an off-duty detail that day at the Richmond Hills Apartment Complex

EDL	00:47:09,055	00:47:13,407	| serial-s03-e03 |	He said they've been working this particular detail for two years there been problems in the building
EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:14,943	| serial-s03-e03 |	Drug trafficking break-ins
EDL	00:47:15,455	00:47:18,783	| serial-s03-e03 |	Beginner usual soup of the building starting at the 5th floor
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:19,551	| serial-s03-e03 |	The top floor
EDL	00:47:19,551	00:47:20,575	| serial-s03-e03 |	Working their way down
EDL	00:47:21,343	00:47:25,695	| serial-s03-e03 |	The Saltair Missy said as they came down the stairs to the 4th floor who's knocking on a door
EDL	00:47:26,207	00:47:27,999	| serial-s03-e03 |	And when he was
EDL	00:47:27,999	00:47:30,303	| serial-s03-e03 |	Knocking on the door
EDL	00:47:30,303	00:47:32,095	| serial-s03-e03 |	Call if anyone answered the door
EDL	00:47:32,095	00:47:32,863	| serial-s03-e03 |	No one answered the door
EDL	00:47:33,375	00:47:37,471	| serial-s03-e03 |	At any point did the individual take keys out open the door to the apart
EDL	00:47:38,751	00:47:40,799	| serial-s03-e03 |	Usain Aramis looked suspicious right then
EDL	00:47:41,311	00:47:42,079	| serial-s03-e03 |	Reasonably so
EDL	00:47:42,591	00:47:44,639	| serial-s03-e03 |	Why would you keep knocking on a door if no one's answering
EDL	00:47:45,407	00:47:47,199	| serial-s03-e03 |	This is what burglars do in the building
EDL	00:47:47,199	00:47:49,759	| serial-s03-e03 |	Knock and then when no one answers they kick in the door
EDL	00:47:49,759	00:47:53,855	| serial-s03-e03 |	Felt as I approached I asked him if he lived in the complex he said he did
EDL	00:47:54,367	00:47:55,647	| serial-s03-e03 |	And I asked if you knew
EDL	00:47:56,159	00:47:58,463	| serial-s03-e03 |	Who I'll look at that particular requirement
EDL	00:47:58,463	00:47:59,743	| serial-s03-e03 |	And he said he did not
EDL	00:48:00,767	00:48:01,791	| serial-s03-e03 |	And
EDL	00:48:01,791	00:48:04,095	| serial-s03-e03 |	Aramis was squirming at the defense table
EDL	00:48:04,095	00:48:04,863	| serial-s03-e03 |	Shaking his head
EDL	00:48:05,375	00:48:05,887	| serial-s03-e03 |	Stifled
EDL	00:48:06,655	00:48:09,471	| serial-s03-e03 |	He told me he was knocking at his friend's apartment door
EDL	00:48:09,471	00:48:10,495	| serial-s03-e03 |	Because you wanted a cigarette
EDL	00:48:11,519	00:48:14,335	| serial-s03-e03 |	His friend wasn't home but his friend's wife was there asleep
EDL	00:48:14,847	00:48:17,151	| serial-s03-e03 |	Emma said she eventually woke up and did open the door
EDL	00:48:17,663	00:48:21,247	| serial-s03-e03 |	He said she saw him being beat up and that the police told her to go back inside
EDL	00:48:21,247	00:48:21,759	| serial-s03-e03 |	And she did
EDL	00:48:22,783	00:48:25,087	| serial-s03-e03 |	But Hermes can't say anything about that now
EDL	00:48:25,087	00:48:26,367	| serial-s03-e03 |	She's not taking the stand
EDL	00:48:26,879	00:48:30,975	| serial-s03-e03 |	The Lord didn't want the prosecutor to get a crack at cross-examining Hermes prior to trial
EDL	00:48:31,743	00:48:32,767	| serial-s03-e03 |	So he's got to suck it up
EDL	00:48:33,535	00:48:36,351	| serial-s03-e03 |	Every defendant I spoke to while I was in Cleveland eventually asked
EDL	00:48:36,863	00:48:38,143	| serial-s03-e03 |	What do I get to say my thing
EDL	00:48:38,655	00:48:40,703	| serial-s03-e03 |	When do I get to explain to the judge what happened
EDL	00:48:41,471	00:48:42,495	| serial-s03-e03 |	The answer
EDL	00:48:42,495	00:48:43,263	| serial-s03-e03 |	Often
EDL	00:48:43,263	00:48:43,775	| serial-s03-e03 |	Is never
EDL	00:48:44,287	00:48:46,591	| serial-s03-e03 |	Very anxious and nervous and
EDL	00:48:47,103	00:48:49,407	| serial-s03-e03 |	Japanese hands in his pockets as soon as you saw it
EDL	00:48:50,431	00:48:53,247	| serial-s03-e03 |	He was advised a couple of times to take his hands out of his pockets
EDL	00:48:56,575	00:48:57,855	| serial-s03-e03 |	Did he take his hands out of his pocket
EDL	00:48:58,367	00:49:00,927	| serial-s03-e03 |	Yes but it kept putting back in and say run
EDL	00:49:00,927	00:49:01,695	| serial-s03-e03 |	Three four times
EDL	00:49:02,207	00:49:05,535	| serial-s03-e03 |	And I'm how did you react to him putting his hands back in the socket
EDL	00:49:07,327	00:49:11,167	| serial-s03-e03 |	Nervously I mean makes police officer nervous
EDL	00:49:11,167	00:49:15,007	| serial-s03-e03 |	Because typically when people keep reaching into their pockets it's a
EDL	00:49:15,519	00:49:19,615	| serial-s03-e03 |	Indicator that the Apache band or a possibly weapon on their person

EDL	00:49:53,663	00:49:57,247	| serial-s03-e03 |	Knocking as opposed to
EDL	00:49:57,247	00:49:59,039	| serial-s03-e03 |	He wasn't doing that
EDL	00:49:59,039	00:49:59,551	| serial-s03-e03 |	Knocking on the door
EDL	00:50:00,319	00:50:01,599	| serial-s03-e03 |	Knocking on the door
EDL	00:50:01,599	00:50:03,135	| serial-s03-e03 |	He wasn't screaming
EDL	00:50:04,415	00:50:06,463	| serial-s03-e03 |	Let me in
EDL	00:50:06,463	00:50:07,487	| serial-s03-e03 |	What are you doing
EDL	00:50:07,487	00:50:09,023	| serial-s03-e03 |	What's going on
EDL	00:50:09,535	00:50:10,303	| serial-s03-e03 |	Okay
EDL	00:50:10,303	00:50:12,095	| serial-s03-e03 |	Next up officer Michael amiott
EDL	00:50:12,607	00:50:15,167	| serial-s03-e03 |	He seemed more comfortable on the standing officer Rivera
EDL	00:50:15,679	00:50:16,703	| serial-s03-e03 |	Eden so nervous
EDL	00:50:16,703	00:50:17,471	| serial-s03-e03 |	It wasn't defensive
EDL	00:50:18,239	00:50:20,799	| serial-s03-e03 |	Propose mr. Spencer he was still at the door I walked past
EDL	00:50:21,823	00:50:24,127	| serial-s03-e03 |	And as I approached him I could smell the odor marijuana
EDL	00:50:24,127	00:50:25,151	| serial-s03-e03 |	They got stronger
EDL	00:50:25,151	00:50:26,175	| serial-s03-e03 |	Westerly coming from him
EDL	00:50:26,687	00:50:27,967	| serial-s03-e03 |	And I stop
EDL	00:50:28,735	00:50:31,295	| serial-s03-e03 |	This is key to making the Stop Kosher
EDL	00:50:31,295	00:50:34,111	| serial-s03-e03 |	The smell of raw marijuana emanating from Aramis
EDL	00:50:34,111	00:50:34,623	| serial-s03-e03 |	6%
EDL	00:50:35,135	00:50:36,671	| serial-s03-e03 |	It's what allows them to detain Aramis
EDL	00:50:37,439	00:50:39,231	| serial-s03-e03 |	The prosecutor is cemented in the record
EDL	00:50:39,743	00:50:43,583	| serial-s03-e03 |	It's in your experience as a police officer can you smell raw marijuana
EDL	00:50:43,583	00:50:44,863	| serial-s03-e03 |	In a bag inside someone
EDL	00:50:46,143	00:50:49,215	| serial-s03-e03 |	And has marijuana smell the same regardless of what
EDL	00:50:49,215	00:50:51,263	| serial-s03-e03 |	Amount
EDL	00:50:51,263	00:50:53,055	| serial-s03-e03 |	Sometimes it stronger than others
EDL	00:50:54,335	00:50:55,359	| serial-s03-e03 |	Know what I smell right now
EDL	00:50:55,871	00:50:57,151	| serial-s03-e03 |	Reasonable suspicion
EDL	00:50:57,663	00:51:02,783	| serial-s03-e03 |	The officer amiott did not smell an unlit blunt wrapped in a baggie and Aramis his jeans pocket
EDL	00:51:03,551	00:51:05,343	| serial-s03-e03 |	It's not impossible you smelled it
EDL	00:51:05,343	00:51:10,207	| serial-s03-e03 |	But the level of confidence he's exhibiting here that he can smell any amount of marijuana in a person's pocket
EDL	00:51:10,719	00:51:13,791	| serial-s03-e03 |	In the hallway of a building where I am certain marijuana is not scarce
EDL	00:51:14,559	00:51:17,631	| serial-s03-e03 |	No one in the courtroom seems to register any skepticism about that
EDL	00:51:18,143	00:51:19,423	| serial-s03-e03 |	Apart from Spiros
EDL	00:51:19,423	00:51:23,007	| serial-s03-e03 |	You guys are basically
EDL	00:51:27,103	00:51:28,383	| serial-s03-e03 |	That's unnecessary
EDL	00:51:28,895	00:51:31,711	| serial-s03-e03 |	I'll take that back
EDL	00:51:32,223	00:51:38,623	| serial-s03-e03 |	Officer amiott says after he smelled the marijuana he asked Aramis if he had any drugs on him
EDL	00:51:38,623	00:51:42,975	| serial-s03-e03 |	Saving equals hands up like this I said you have any drugs on you put his hands up like this
EDL	00:51:42,975	00:51:44,511	| serial-s03-e03 |	Okay and
EDL	00:51:44,511	00:51:46,303	| serial-s03-e03 |	What do you do if your placenta
EDL	00:51:47,839	00:51:49,119	| serial-s03-e03 |	And did you find anything
EDL	00:51:49,631	00:51:53,471	| serial-s03-e03 |	Yeah I went into his pocket on epoxy was reaching into
EDL	00:51:53,471	00:51:57,823	| serial-s03-e03 |	It was a small bag of marijuana was probably a side wasn't very big wrapping a baggie
EDL	00:51:58,335	00:52:00,127	| serial-s03-e03 |	Each efficient beat of this hearing
EDL	00:52:00,127	00:52:02,943	| serial-s03-e03 |	The cops are chipping away at Hermes his chances for success
EDL	00:52:03,455	00:52:04,479	| serial-s03-e03 |	Criminal and civil
EDL	00:52:04,991	00:52:06,783	| serial-s03-e03 |	Aramis is a scary door knocker
EDL	00:52:06,783	00:52:09,343	| serial-s03-e03 |	He smells like marijuana he seems nervous
EDL	00:52:09,343	00:52:11,391	| serial-s03-e03 |	He keeps putting his hands in his pockets
EDL	00:52:11,391	00:52:12,671	| serial-s03-e03 |	He lets me search him for drugs
EDL	00:52:13,183	00:52:14,719	| serial-s03-e03 |	Is all very neat
EDL	00:52:14,719	00:52:17,535	| serial-s03-e03 |	And all very different from what Hermes says actually happened
EDL	00:52:18,047	00:52:19,839	| serial-s03-e03 |	Then comes one more
EDL	00:52:19,839	00:52:21,119	| serial-s03-e03 |	A to Z right at the end
EDL	00:52:21,631	00:52:24,191	| serial-s03-e03 |	Mary Casey squeezes it in during her closing
EDL	00:52:24,703	00:52:27,519	| serial-s03-e03 |	The testimony wasn't he patted the outside of the pocket first
EDL	00:52:27,519	00:52:28,799	| serial-s03-e03 |	Faded pat-down
EDL	00:52:28,799	00:52:29,567	| serial-s03-e03 |	He felt a ball
EDL	00:52:32,127	00:52:32,895	| serial-s03-e03 |	Objection
EDL	00:52:33,663	00:52:36,223	| serial-s03-e03 |	Services like whoa whoa whoa a bulge
EDL	00:52:36,223	00:52:37,503	| serial-s03-e03 |	Where does Bones come from
EDL	00:52:38,015	00:52:39,807	| serial-s03-e03 |	The Bulge could suggest a weapon
EDL	00:52:39,807	00:52:42,623	| serial-s03-e03 |	Which could give officer amiott reason to go into Hermes
EDL	00:52:42,623	00:52:43,903	| serial-s03-e03 |	The pockets we can make
EDL	00:52:43,903	00:52:46,463	| serial-s03-e03 |	Research legal which can make the charges stick which could hurt the civil law
EDL	00:52:47,743	00:52:49,023	| serial-s03-e03 |	Siri says wait up
EDL	00:52:49,023	00:52:51,327	| serial-s03-e03 |	Mei himself never said anything about a bulge
EDL	00:52:52,351	00:52:53,631	| serial-s03-e03 |	Event that did not happen
EDL	00:52:55,167	00:52:56,703	| serial-s03-e03 |	He said
EDL	00:52:57,471	00:52:58,495	| serial-s03-e03 |	And there was a ball
EDL	00:52:59,519	00:53:00,799	| serial-s03-e03 |	The judge says I heard it
EDL	00:53:00,799	00:53:01,823	| serial-s03-e03 |	I wrote it down right here
EDL	00:53:02,591	00:53:03,359	| serial-s03-e03 |	Just telling you
EDL	00:53:03,359	00:53:04,383	| serial-s03-e03 |	That's in my notes
EDL	00:53:06,431	00:53:07,711	| serial-s03-e03 |	So no further argument
EDL	00:53:08,479	00:53:11,039	| serial-s03-e03 |	It was over Mary Casey looks very pleased at the end
EDL	00:53:11,551	00:53:13,599	| serial-s03-e03 |	Chatting animatedly with the other lawyers at
EDL	00:53:13,599	00:53:14,111	| serial-s03-e03 |	Her table
EDL	00:53:14,623	00:53:15,391	| serial-s03-e03 |	Chino's
EDL	00:53:15,391	00:53:16,415	| serial-s03-e03 |	Everyone in the courtroom knows
EDL	00:53:16,927	00:53:18,207	| serial-s03-e03 |	And who you going to believe contest
EDL	00:53:18,719	00:53:21,279	| serial-s03-e03 |	The judge tends to presume the cops are telling the truth
EDL	00:53:21,279	00:53:23,327	| serial-s03-e03 |	So her side virtually always wins
EDL	00:53:24,351	00:53:25,631	| serial-s03-e03 |	Spiros knows it too
EDL	00:53:25,631	00:53:28,447	| serial-s03-e03 |	Expected the police to say most of what they said today
EDL	00:53:28,447	00:53:31,007	| serial-s03-e03 |	But the Bulge thing that was a new one
EDL	00:53:31,007	00:53:33,311	| serial-s03-e03 |	Out in the hallways grosses still arguing
EDL	00:53:33,311	00:53:35,103	| serial-s03-e03 |	You can't just invent testimony
EDL	00:53:38,943	00:53:41,247	| serial-s03-e03 |	Play pattern
EDL	00:53:43,039	00:53:44,063	| serial-s03-e03 |	Did you hear anything about
EDL	00:53:45,343	00:53:47,391	| serial-s03-e03 |	Where did not say that he felt a ball
EDL	00:53:48,159	00:53:49,183	| serial-s03-e03 |	Stress is right
EDL	00:53:49,183	00:53:49,951	| serial-s03-e03 |	I have the tape
EDL	00:53:50,463	00:53:52,255	| serial-s03-e03 |	Despite what the judge thought she heard
EDL	00:53:52,255	00:53:54,303	| serial-s03-e03 |	Officer amiott did not mention a bulge
EDL	00:53:55,071	00:53:56,351	| serial-s03-e03 |	Balls or no balls
EDL	00:53:56,351	00:53:58,143	| serial-s03-e03 |	Girls tries to boost Aramis spirits
EDL	00:54:04,543	00:54:06,591	| serial-s03-e03 |	This bulge is going to be an issue
EDL	00:54:08,895	00:54:09,919	| serial-s03-e03 |	Five network will form
EDL	00:54:12,479	00:54:14,015	| serial-s03-e03 |	He just can't even if he can stop you
EDL	00:54:14,527	00:54:15,295	| serial-s03-e03 |	Marijuana
EDL	00:54:15,295	00:54:17,087	| serial-s03-e03 |	Does it mean he can go inside of your pocket
EDL	00:54:18,623	00:54:20,159	| serial-s03-e03 |	Reasonable Suspicion means he can
EDL	00:54:20,671	00:54:25,279	| serial-s03-e03 |	Keep you there and figure out what's what's going on right he can catch you down for officer safety
EDL	00:54:26,303	00:54:31,167	| serial-s03-e03 |	But that would have been had a much through conversation on direct examination as to I patted him down
EDL	00:54:31,167	00:54:32,703	| serial-s03-e03 |	Over the top I felt a ball
EDL	00:54:33,215	00:54:33,983	| serial-s03-e03 |	We thought it was a weapon
EDL	00:54:36,031	00:54:36,799	| serial-s03-e03 |	The Battle of the Bulge
EDL	00:54:37,567	00:54:40,639	| serial-s03-e03 |	Let me know about that
EDL	00:54:40,639	00:54:41,151	| serial-s03-e03 |	Just lying down
EDL	00:54:41,919	00:54:44,735	| serial-s03-e03 |	Aramis is Mom Kali the only one who laughed at my joke
EDL	00:54:45,503	00:54:48,063	| serial-s03-e03 |	Aramis himself is brimming with frustration
EDL	00:54:48,831	00:54:50,111	| serial-s03-e03 |	It's been 5 months
EDL	00:54:50,111	00:54:52,927	| serial-s03-e03 |	He's having the fight criminal charges he considers illegitimate
EDL	00:54:53,439	00:54:59,839	| serial-s03-e03 |	Because of what happened in the hallway of the building management stuck a 3-day notice on his apartment door telling him he had to move out or else
EDL	00:54:59,839	00:55:00,351	| serial-s03-e03 |	Hbase eviction
EDL	00:55:01,119	00:55:04,191	| serial-s03-e03 |	He said they told him the incident was a violation of the buildings rules
EDL	00:55:04,703	00:55:06,239	| serial-s03-e03 |	I got an extension still
EDL	00:55:07,007	00:55:08,543	| serial-s03-e03 |	He said his girlfriend was harassed
EDL	00:55:08,543	00:55:11,359	| serial-s03-e03 |	In front of the building he thinks it was the same officers who stopped her
EDL	00:55:11,871	00:55:14,431	| serial-s03-e03 |	He said she told him she stayed with Aramis upstairs
EDL	00:55:14,943	00:55:15,967	| serial-s03-e03 |	The restaurant Warren
EDL	00:55:16,479	00:55:22,879	| serial-s03-e03 |	And today he's just listen to police officers tell a version of the original incident which Bears little resemblance to his own
EDL	00:55:22,879	00:55:26,207	| serial-s03-e03 |	He said they asked him to stop from down the hall
EDL	00:55:26,207	00:55:29,023	| serial-s03-e03 |	Before they even got near him they said stop don't move
EDL	00:55:29,535	00:55:32,351	| serial-s03-e03 |	He says he never told him he didn't know whose door he was knocking on
EDL	00:55:32,863	00:55:35,423	| serial-s03-e03 |	Anyway why would he be knocking on a door of a person he doesn't know
EDL	00:55:36,191	00:55:39,775	| serial-s03-e03 |	They never ask me that question who is Dory this is the never ask me that
EDL	00:55:39,775	00:55:46,175	| serial-s03-e03 |	Dachshund they stopped me and asked me search me for weapons they never ask me anything about any drugs anything's
EDL	00:55:46,175	00:55:46,943	| serial-s03-e03 |	Weather today
EDL	00:55:47,455	00:55:49,503	| serial-s03-e03 |	That's completely false
EDL	00:55:49,503	00:55:51,039	| serial-s03-e03 |	They lied under oath
EDL	00:55:51,807	00:55:54,623	| serial-s03-e03 |	I'm sitting here watching them off
EDL	00:55:54,623	00:56:00,767	| serial-s03-e03 |	They lie
EDL	00:56:07,423	00:56:09,471	| serial-s03-e03 |	Judge LeBaron deny dermis is motion to
EDL	00:56:09,471	00:56:10,239	| serial-s03-e03 |	Suppress
EDL	00:56:10,239	00:56:12,543	| serial-s03-e03 |	Which means that resisting charge is sticking
EDL	00:56:12,543	00:56:13,055	| serial-s03-e03 |	Not good
EDL	00:56:13,823	00:56:17,151	| serial-s03-e03 |	Yeah it's always something like that the police always have
EDL	00:56:17,151	00:56:18,431	| serial-s03-e03 |	Scratch with a Prosecco
EDL	00:56:19,455	00:56:21,759	| serial-s03-e03 |	Paul cristallo hadn't gone to the suppression hearing
EDL	00:56:21,759	00:56:24,063	| serial-s03-e03 |	He was still trying to remain invisible and you could
EDL	00:56:24,575	00:56:27,391	| serial-s03-e03 |	But Spirit-filled him in and he read the judge's opinion
EDL	00:56:27,391	00:56:28,671	| serial-s03-e03 |	Which amounted to
EDL	00:56:28,671	00:56:29,439	| serial-s03-e03 |	The stop
EDL	00:56:29,439	00:56:30,719	| serial-s03-e03 |	Search all legal
EDL	00:56:31,231	00:56:32,255	| serial-s03-e03 |	Xi'an get to the balls
EDL	00:56:32,767	00:56:36,607	| serial-s03-e03 |	She wrote the based on the suspicious door-knocking in the smell of marijuana
EDL	00:56:36,607	00:56:37,119	| serial-s03-e03 |	For good
EDL	00:56:37,631	00:56:38,655	| serial-s03-e03 |	If it's not
EDL	00:56:39,167	00:56:41,727	| serial-s03-e03 |	Smelling marijuana for the smell of alcohol
EDL	00:56:42,239	00:56:43,263	| serial-s03-e03 |	It's
EDL	00:56:45,311	00:56:46,847	| serial-s03-e03 |	He made a furtive movement
EDL	00:56:46,847	00:56:47,359	| serial-s03-e03 |	With his hands
EDL	00:56:47,871	00:56:50,943	| serial-s03-e03 |	He kept moving his hands
EDL	00:56:50,943	00:56:54,015	| serial-s03-e03 |	And I wasn't sure you know that's that's
EDL	00:56:54,015	00:56:55,295	| serial-s03-e03 |	Find a baby he's got a weapon
EDL	00:56:56,063	00:56:58,623	| serial-s03-e03 |	He was acting nervous and I think in fact they even
EDL	00:56:58,623	00:57:00,927	| serial-s03-e03 |	Testified that he was acting
EDL	00:57:01,951	00:57:02,719	| serial-s03-e03 |	I mean it's just
EDL	00:57:06,815	00:57:08,863	| serial-s03-e03 |	But that's your script
EDL	00:57:08,863	00:57:10,399	| serial-s03-e03 |	Everybody says for the flu
EDL	00:57:10,399	00:57:11,167	| serial-s03-e03 |	Everybody smells
EDL	00:57:12,447	00:57:14,495	| serial-s03-e03 |	Another phrase you hear a lot in these cases
EDL	00:57:14,495	00:57:16,031	| serial-s03-e03 |	Reaching toward his waistband
EDL	00:57:16,543	00:57:17,567	| serial-s03-e03 |	That's where Guns live
EDL	00:57:17,567	00:57:18,335	| serial-s03-e03 |	Waistbands
EDL	00:57:19,103	00:57:25,503	| serial-s03-e03 |	In a written report that you could officers wrote that Aramis was quote fighting with officers and pulling both arms together toward his waist
EDL	00:57:25,503	00:57:26,015	| serial-s03-e03 |	Panaderia
EDL	00:57:26,527	00:57:32,415	| serial-s03-e03 |	And a little lower down more strikes were delivered until Spencer stop fighting and stopped reaching toward his waistband
EDL	00:57:33,439	00:57:34,463	| serial-s03-e03 |	Aramis had no weapon
EDL	00:57:34,975	00:57:36,767	| serial-s03-e03 |	I know nothing tucked in his waistband
EDL	00:57:37,279	00:57:40,351	| serial-s03-e03 |	Why then in the midst of a fight would he be reaching toward his waistband
EDL	00:57:41,375	00:57:42,911	| serial-s03-e03 |	Because waistband is a magic word
EDL	00:57:43,423	00:57:43,935	| serial-s03-e03 |	Furtive
EDL	00:57:44,447	00:57:45,727	| serial-s03-e03 |	Like odor of raw marijuana
EDL	00:57:46,239	00:57:48,799	| serial-s03-e03 |	A plant's a strong seed of reasonable suspicion
EDL	00:57:48,799	00:57:51,359	| serial-s03-e03 |	The blossoms into a tree of probable cause
EDL	00:57:51,359	00:57:53,151	| serial-s03-e03 |	Which can produce untainted fruit
EDL	00:57:53,663	00:57:56,991	| serial-s03-e03 |	Justified use of force in response to resisting illegitimate arrest
EDL	00:57:58,271	00:57:59,039	| serial-s03-e03 |	I asked Paul
EDL	00:57:59,551	00:58:02,367	| serial-s03-e03 |	Back when he was working for insurance companies defending cops
EDL	00:58:02,879	00:58:05,183	| serial-s03-e03 |	Whether he done the same thing Euclid was doing now
EDL	00:58:05,695	00:58:07,487	| serial-s03-e03 |	When they could see a civil lawsuit in the distance
EDL	00:58:07,999	00:58:12,095	| serial-s03-e03 |	Would he meet with City officials are cops about doubling down on the criminal charges
EDL	00:58:12,095	00:58:14,143	| serial-s03-e03 |	To try to stop the civil case from getting traction
EDL	00:58:28,223	00:58:30,015	| serial-s03-e03 |	City Hall
EDL	00:58:30,015	00:58:30,527	| serial-s03-e03 |	Office
EDL	00:58:33,855	00:58:35,135	| serial-s03-e03 |	Flying together
EDL	00:58:36,671	00:58:38,975	| serial-s03-e03 |	When you're trying this kind of reluctantly is this
EDL	00:58:38,975	00:58:39,999	| serial-s03-e03 |	Is this why
EDL	00:58:40,767	00:58:46,143	| serial-s03-e03 |	Violet custom button that's that's like I shouldn't be like why are you
EDL	00:58:46,655	00:58:47,167	| serial-s03-e03 |	Because
EDL	00:58:51,263	00:58:51,775	| serial-s03-e03 |	I mean
EDL	00:58:55,871	00:58:59,199	| serial-s03-e03 |	Letting you know I'm doing my job you know what I was doing and I was doing my job

EDL	00:59:04,575	00:59:06,623	| serial-s03-e03 |	And I don't regret doing my job and you know it
EDL	00:59:09,183	00:59:10,207	| serial-s03-e03 |	I think it's part of
EDL	00:59:10,207	00:59:11,487	| serial-s03-e03 |	Letting the police
EDL	00:59:11,999	00:59:13,023	| serial-s03-e03 |	Dynamic is
EDL	00:59:20,447	00:59:22,495	| serial-s03-e03 |	How much of an airtight defense is the best offense if you
EDL	00:59:23,775	00:59:25,823	| serial-s03-e03 |	And I said hesitantly a reluctant
EDL	00:59:25,823	00:59:26,335	| serial-s03-e03 |	Only because
EDL	00:59:26,847	00:59:27,615	| serial-s03-e03 |	NIU.
EDL	00:59:32,223	00:59:36,063	| serial-s03-e03 |	But you know I mean I'm not proud of that
EDL	00:59:36,831	00:59:37,855	| serial-s03-e03 |	OIC
EDL	00:59:37,855	00:59:42,719	| serial-s03-e03 |	Yeah yeah yeah no I didn't I didn't I didn't ask it as a way to be like aren't you I didn't mean to
EDL	00:59:42,719	00:59:45,535	| serial-s03-e03 |	I was going to know you.
EDL	00:59:45,535	00:59:48,863	| serial-s03-e03 |	I always were asking practically it was like are you talking from Once
EDL	00:59:48,863	00:59:49,631	| serial-s03-e03 |	Do you know
EDL	00:59:49,631	00:59:50,399	| serial-s03-e03 |	Or you just
EDL	00:59:50,399	00:59:50,911	| serial-s03-e03 |	Like I suspect
EDL	00:59:51,423	00:59:57,055	| serial-s03-e03 |	What's going on are you like no I know this is what's going on because I
EDL	01:00:03,455	01:00:06,015	| serial-s03-e03 |	Is it isn't surprising what's with problem
EDL	01:00:06,015	01:00:07,039	| serial-s03-e03 |	Surprising is
EDL	01:00:07,039	01:00:08,319	| serial-s03-e03 |	How
EDL	01:00:08,319	01:00:09,599	| serial-s03-e03 |	It remains
EDL	01:00:09,599	01:00:10,367	| serial-s03-e03 |	It cast
EDL	01:00:10,367	01:00:10,879	| serial-s03-e03 |	Source
EDL	01:00:11,391	01:00:13,695	| serial-s03-e03 |	Of aggravation
EDL	01:00:17,279	01:00:23,679	| serial-s03-e03 |	It's still hard to watch it is only to see this happening
EDL	01:00:23,679	01:00:25,471	| serial-s03-e03 |	Courtroom people
EDL	01:00:25,471	01:00:31,359	| serial-s03-e03 |	Making payments on the stand that aren't necessarily accurate they know it
EDL	01:00:31,871	01:00:38,271	| serial-s03-e03 |	But they have it of course
EDL	01:00:38,271	01:00:41,343	| serial-s03-e03 |	It's upsetting to see if a police officer lies
EDL	01:00:41,343	01:00:47,743	| serial-s03-e03 |	What's more upsetting is when a system of laws and procedures kicks in to support and sanitize those lies
EDL	01:00:47,743	01:00:50,559	| serial-s03-e03 |	So that it looks and sounds as if Justice is happening
EDL	01:00:51,071	01:00:57,215	| serial-s03-e03 |	But even wager that the officers in the prosecutor and the judge they all swear with conscience is clear
EDL	01:00:57,215	01:01:00,287	| serial-s03-e03 |	The Aramis is hearing was fair by the book
EDL	01:01:01,311	01:01:07,711	| serial-s03-e03 |	If Aramis wants these police officers to be held accountable for beating him he's now gotten the message the criminal court is
EDL	01:01:07,711	01:01:10,015	| serial-s03-e03 |	Probably the last place you should look for help
EDL	01:01:15,135	01:01:17,951	| serial-s03-e03 |	A few months later I got a call from Paul on my cell phone
EDL	01:01:18,463	01:01:19,487	| serial-s03-e03 |	Oh my God
