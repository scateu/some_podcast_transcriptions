EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:40,352	| serial-s02-e11 |	I had a couple of conversations recently that I just want to tell you about
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:42,656	| serial-s02-e11 |	When was with this guy Justin
EDL	00:01:42,656	00:01:43,936	| serial-s02-e11 |	Kid email.
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:44,704	| serial-s02-e11 |	So I gave him a call
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:48,032	| serial-s02-e11 |	Boom boom boom January 2006 I like

EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:00,320	| serial-s02-e11 |	I want to be with this guy
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:02,368	| serial-s02-e11 |	Coast Guard boot camp
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:05,440	| serial-s02-e11 |	And he remembers the night Bo broke down
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:09,536	| serial-s02-e11 |	Remember standing outside on a freezing February night in Cape May New Jersey
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:11,584	| serial-s02-e11 |	Well something strange happened inside
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:15,424	| serial-s02-e11 |	Remember seeing blood and broken glass in the bathroom
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:16,448	| serial-s02-e11 |	And yellow caution tape
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:21,312	| serial-s02-e11 |	Justin was seventeen at the time and there's some details he couldn't recall
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:25,664	| serial-s02-e11 |	But he let me to another guy also from that boot camp class
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:26,432	| serial-s02-e11 |	John Ross
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:29,504	| serial-s02-e11 |	John was an older recruits 26
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:31,040	| serial-s02-e11 |	He remembered though do you like them
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:32,064	| serial-s02-e11 |	I thought he was a nice guy
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:37,440	| serial-s02-e11 |	One night a couple of weeks in John says there was a fire drill
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:39,488	| serial-s02-e11 |	They did that a lot these wee hours fire drills
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:45,632	| serial-s02-e11 |	I'm Commander would bang on the top of a garbage can and wake everybody up and they'd all have to rush outside and muster up
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:49,472	| serial-s02-e11 |	Each person had a number and they called out in order
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:52,544	| serial-s02-e11 |	01003 cetera
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:55,360	| serial-s02-e11 |	It became clear there was a number missing
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:56,384	| serial-s02-e11 |	Also clear
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:57,408	| serial-s02-e11 |	That number was Bo
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:02:59,712	| serial-s02-e11 |	John was at the edge of the group
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:03,296	| serial-s02-e11 |	So his commanders sends him and another guy back inside to find bow
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:05,856	| serial-s02-e11 |	We go running back and
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:08,672	| serial-s02-e11 |	The running into the head
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:11,232	| serial-s02-e11 |	And there he was he
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:14,048	| serial-s02-e11 |	Get blood even felt pretty good
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:18,656	| serial-s02-e11 |	We were never sure exactly how he did it
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:21,472	| serial-s02-e11 |	But there was
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:22,496	| serial-s02-e11 |	Quite a bit of blood
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:25,056	| serial-s02-e11 |	There was some blood on the wall
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:27,104	| serial-s02-e11 |	Vladimir's what are those
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:29,664	| serial-s02-e11 |	The sink
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:32,480	| serial-s02-e11 |	The countertop area
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:36,320	| serial-s02-e11 |	And he was bleeding from a space there was
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,600	| serial-s02-e11 |	No blood on his hands
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:41,184	| serial-s02-e11 |	Blake he had
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:45,280	| serial-s02-e11 |	Cam smashes face into the mirror
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:47,072	| serial-s02-e11 |	And he was
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:48,352	| serial-s02-e11 |	Huddled up crying
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:49,376	| serial-s02-e11 |	Hi yuan
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:52,192	| serial-s02-e11 |	Balled up
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:56,544	| serial-s02-e11 |	One of those moments you run into you like oh s***
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:04:00,128	| serial-s02-e11 |	What if I could I just like step into
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:02,176	| serial-s02-e11 |	Did you try to talk to him
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:05,248	| serial-s02-e11 |	I did and he was just sleeping
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:08,832	| serial-s02-e11 |	I was just and it was shocking
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:10,112	| serial-s02-e11 |	Bedtime
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:16,000	| serial-s02-e11 |	I like the guy so I was trying to find out what happened I remember just
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:22,655	| serial-s02-e11 |	Connect coaching down next to him like I do what's going on are you okay and you was sleeping like go away leave me alone
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:29,567	| serial-s02-e11 |	This version is more alarming than the one I'd heard previously from bow or from the Army investigation
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:32,127	| serial-s02-e11 |	It's why Justin emailed us in the first place
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:35,967	| serial-s02-e11 |	To say sure didn't look like a garden-variety panic attack to him
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:38,271	| serial-s02-e11 |	And it wasn't
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:44,415	| serial-s02-e11 |	A military psychologist I talk to you said you don't usually hospitalize someone much less eject them from the military
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:45,695	| serial-s02-e11 |	Based on a single panic attack
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:48,255	| serial-s02-e11 |	So whatever was going on with bow
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:49,535	| serial-s02-e11 |	Must have been more serious than that
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:52,607	| serial-s02-e11 |	Sobo got sent home
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:55,167	| serial-s02-e11 |	Dejana Justin no big surprise there
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:05:00,031	| serial-s02-e11 |	They said Coast Guard training was very demanding psychologically and it was clear bow couldn't hack it
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:02,079	| serial-s02-e11 |	The big surprise
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:02,847	| serial-s02-e11 |	Came much later
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:06,687	| serial-s02-e11 |	When Bill was rescued a friend of John Rolfe is called him and said
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:08,735	| serial-s02-e11 |	Can you believe that p o w
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:10,015	| serial-s02-e11 |	From bootcamp
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:13,087	| serial-s02-e11 |	John said it took him awhile to put it together
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:14,879	| serial-s02-e11 |	Techno music
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:18,719	| serial-s02-e11 |	Who captured by the Taliban I'm like who
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:21,023	| serial-s02-e11 |	Like what the hell is he doing
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:25,375	| serial-s02-e11 |	You are like
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:28,959	| serial-s02-e11 |	How do you survive five years of the Taliban you're like how that guy and lives
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:32,031	| serial-s02-e11 |	Exactly
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:33,055	| serial-s02-e11 |	Yeah
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:37,919	| serial-s02-e11 |	Didn't make any sense to me
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:38,687	| serial-s02-e11 |	That just
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:39,967	| serial-s02-e11 |	Blew my mind away
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:43,551	| serial-s02-e11 |	I guess it was a really nice guy but
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:45,343	| serial-s02-e11 |	If you couldn't handle
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:46,111	| serial-s02-e11 |	The Coast Guard
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:51,487	| serial-s02-e11 |	And the comfort is stressful
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:53,023	| serial-s02-e11 |	Make it sound like it
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:54,559	| serial-s02-e11 |	A cakewalk
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:59,167	| serial-s02-e11 |	But he should not have gone to another
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:00,191	| serial-s02-e11 |	French
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:07,615	| serial-s02-e11 |	Again in his investigation General Kenneth Dahl found the Army recruiter followed all the regulations when he signed blow up
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:12,223	| serial-s02-e11 |	I also wrote that he thought those regulations were inadequate in those case
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:16,063	| serial-s02-e11 |	His Coast Guard separation should have been looked at more carefully than it was
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:19,647	| serial-s02-e11 |	John spent eight years in the Coast Guard Reserves
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:22,207	| serial-s02-e11 |	Justin became a rescue swimmer
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:24,255	| serial-s02-e11 |	Like a special forces the Coast Guard
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:26,303	| serial-s02-e11 |	I got you drop out of helicopters into the ocean
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:30,399	| serial-s02-e11 |	Presumably they both know a thing or two about the military mindset
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:33,215	| serial-s02-e11 |	Justin had the same question as John
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:35,263	| serial-s02-e11 |	Why they let that guy into the army
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:40,127	| serial-s02-e11 |	They saw what I saw this on what happened during Coast Guard boot camp
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:41,663	| serial-s02-e11 |	Not at all. There's no
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,991	| serial-s02-e11 |	No reason why they should ever let him in
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:45,503	| serial-s02-e11 |	At all
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:54,463	| serial-s02-e11 |	Sometimes bouquets is summed up like this
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:56,255	| serial-s02-e11 |	What book did was wrong
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:58,303	| serial-s02-e11 |	Walking off his post was wrong
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:00,863	| serial-s02-e11 |	But the Army shouldn't have let him enlist in the first place
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:03,167	| serial-s02-e11 |	+ 5 years captivity
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:04,703	| serial-s02-e11 |	5 years
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:07,007	| serial-s02-e11 |	Scales balance
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:09,567	| serial-s02-e11 |	The Army messed up messed up
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:10,335	| serial-s02-e11 |	Let's move on
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:12,895	| serial-s02-e11 |	That leaves out a reckoning
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:15,967	| serial-s02-e11 |	And a reckoning is what the military wants understandably
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:19,807	| serial-s02-e11 |	Afghanistan into their families
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:24,671	| serial-s02-e11 |	If you don't consider the consequences of bows decision to walk off opms
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:28,767	| serial-s02-e11 |	Eye feels as if something important and painful has been papered over
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:30,815	| serial-s02-e11 |	And that doesn't feel like justice
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:32,351	| serial-s02-e11 |	I want an accounting
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:37,471	| serial-s02-e11 |	This is our last episode this season and so I want to try to answer this now
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:40,287	| serial-s02-e11 |	What exactly should we blame bo4
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:42,335	| serial-s02-e11 |	What's his fault and what is a
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:45,407	| serial-s02-e11 |	And the heaviest moral charge against him
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:51,295	| serial-s02-e11 |	The elephant in so many discussions about Bo and about the trade and about the military proceedings against him
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:54,879	| serial-s02-e11 |	Did any American soldiers died looking for him
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:59,487	| serial-s02-e11 |	Some people very high up in the military world are saying yes
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:00,767	| serial-s02-e11 |	People did die looking for Bowe
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:04,607	| serial-s02-e11 |	Michael Flynn is the highest-ranking person I've interviewed so far
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:09,215	| serial-s02-e11 |	He's a retired lieutenant general who is head of Dia the defense intelligence agency
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:13,567	| serial-s02-e11 |	Back in 2009 when both went missing Flynn was in Afghanistan
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:16,383	| serial-s02-e11 |	He was General Stanley McChrystal director of intelligence
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:22,015	| serial-s02-e11 |	What crystal in case you've forgotten was commander of us and Coalition forces for all of Afghanistan
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:25,855	| serial-s02-e11 |	So when just under McChrystal is a big deal
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:30,463	| serial-s02-e11 |	Explain to him that this was one of my outstanding questions about both story
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:34,815	| serial-s02-e11 |	This very thing of like will wait did people die
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:41,471	| serial-s02-e11 |	During this search for Bergdahl as a unit
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:44,543	| serial-s02-e11 |	Okay if somebody was on a mission to go
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:46,335	| serial-s02-e11 |	Find an American
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:47,615	| serial-s02-e11 |	Now there's
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:52,479	| serial-s02-e11 |	What did the guy did a soldier walk down a road
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:54,271	| serial-s02-e11 |	And in an IED blew up
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:59,135	| serial-s02-e11 |	And if the soldier was walking down that road in an area where
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:03,487	| serial-s02-e11 |	He would not have have been had it not been for the search for Bergdahl
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:07,071	| serial-s02-e11 |	And in fact his mission there their tactical mission was to
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:09,375	| serial-s02-e11 |	You know conduct a patrol
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:10,911	| serial-s02-e11 |	And and
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:14,239	| serial-s02-e11 |	Try to find intelligence or try to find
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:20,383	| serial-s02-e11 |	Any indications of where the soldier might be and then and in fact was blown up by that IAD or others wounded
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:27,807	| serial-s02-e11 |	That's a no-brainer I agree that does that.
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:28,319	| serial-s02-e11 |	Connect
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:31,903	| serial-s02-e11 |	Here's the problem now
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:37,023	| serial-s02-e11 |	General Flynn's no-brainer scenario I haven't found one like that
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:39,327	| serial-s02-e11 |	When he said those are dots he connected
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:42,399	| serial-s02-e11 |	He wasn't thinking of any particular cases of soldiers who died
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:46,495	| serial-s02-e11 |	He was there he says he knows it to be true
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:50,079	| serial-s02-e11 |	Durbin lots of media stories
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:55,199	| serial-s02-e11 |	Declarative stories citing specific cases of soldiers who died because of the search
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:58,271	| serial-s02-e11 |	Usually there are six names all from Bo's battalion
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:09:59,295	| serial-s02-e11 |	The first of the five-oh-first
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:03,135	| serial-s02-e11 |	We know for sure there was a massive search for bow
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:07,487	| serial-s02-e11 |	She walked off Opie Mast on June 30th 2009
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:12,351	| serial-s02-e11 |	For the month of July people were sent out all over praktika Province and Beyond
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:14,655	| serial-s02-e11 |	Doing nothing but missions to find the dust one
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:19,263	| serial-s02-e11 |	But brother miraculously no one died on those missions
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:21,823	| serial-s02-e11 |	The six names of soldiers who died
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:24,383	| serial-s02-e11 |	They were all on missions that happened later
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:26,431	| serial-s02-e11 |	7 to 10 weeks after bow disappeared
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:29,503	| serial-s02-e11 |	And none of those missions was a search and rescue mission
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:34,111	| serial-s02-e11 |	We looked into all these incidents there are four of them
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:35,903	| serial-s02-e11 |	Talk to soldiers who are there
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:38,463	| serial-s02-e11 |	And two people higher up who planned and organized them
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:41,791	| serial-s02-e11 |	Official information on these missions is thin
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:45,375	| serial-s02-e11 |	We've seen Army investigations on only two of the four cases
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:51,263	| serial-s02-e11 |	One of those was just a summary they were both redacted so we can't tell what the precise Mission orders and objectives were
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:56,895	| serial-s02-e11 |	We put in for your request with the Army long ago on all these cases but haven't gotten anything back
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:11:02,783	| serial-s02-e11 |	Again the Army itself hasn't formally investigated the question of whether people died looking for Bo
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:03,551	| serial-s02-e11 |	That we know of
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:05,087	| serial-s02-e11 |	But somehow
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:08,159	| serial-s02-e11 |	This idea that people died looking for Bo
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:11,231	| serial-s02-e11 |	To a lot of people it's not a question
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:16,863	| serial-s02-e11 |	It has traveled out of the realm of the murky and has solidified into concrete information
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:21,983	| serial-s02-e11 |	Point where a clothing company made a f*** Bergdahl T-shirt with 6 Stars underneath
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:26,335	| serial-s02-e11 |	To represent quote the 6 honorable soldiers from the first of the five-oh-first
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:28,639	| serial-s02-e11 |	That lost their lives all because of Bergdahl
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:35,039	| serial-s02-e11 |	Why are some people so sure about this
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:36,575	| serial-s02-e11 |	Where did it come from
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:44,511	| serial-s02-e11 |	On September 4th 2009
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:47,327	| serial-s02-e11 |	One of those six soldiers Darren Andrews
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:51,679	| serial-s02-e11 |	Was killed in Pacheco province in a village called Palau right near Okemos
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:54,495	| serial-s02-e11 |	Who's the second lieutenant in later
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:55,775	| serial-s02-e11 |	His parents
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:12:02,175	| serial-s02-e11 |	Sandra and Andy Andrews I've been told by the army that Darren was killed in an RPG attack on a mission to rest
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:04,735	| serial-s02-e11 |	Target Topanga
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:10,623	| serial-s02-e11 |	When they attack happened apparently pushed aside other men he was awarded the Silver Star posthumously
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:18,559	| serial-s02-e11 |	About five years later his parents were on a long drive to the hospital for Andy's cancer
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:21,887	| serial-s02-e11 |	When President Obama announced Bose return
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:28,287	| serial-s02-e11 |	Eddie says the way he remembers at the Rose Garden ceremony hadn't even finished before someone contacted them
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:34,687	| serial-s02-e11 |	I don't find him Saundra got a call and this gas is I want to let you know where
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:41,087	| serial-s02-e11 |	Fixing to break this story and tell the truth of what really happened this phone call with someone in
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:47,487	| serial-s02-e11 |	Aaron's unit this was the first Andy and Sandra were hearing that Darren was actually killed on a mission related to Bo
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:52,095	| serial-s02-e11 |	And then we were on the phone literally she was on the phone literally
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:58,495	| serial-s02-e11 |	From the time we left Cameron till we got to MD Anderson 3 hours later with NBC CBS
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:13:00,799	| serial-s02-e11 |	ABC and I don't everybody know
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:05,151	| serial-s02-e11 |	When it broke it broke hard
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:10,271	| serial-s02-e11 |	Started texting and sending messages on Facebook and calling and telling me
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:15,391	| serial-s02-e11 |	You know we're not going to stand by and let them say
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:16,415	| serial-s02-e11 |	He is a hero
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:21,279	| serial-s02-e11 |	Is your son in the other guys were a hero
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:23,327	| serial-s02-e11 |	And we're not going to stand for this
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:27,423	| serial-s02-e11 |	That same day the six names were put out there
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:27,935	| serial-s02-e11 |	Online
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:31,519	| serial-s02-e11 |	My day 3 destroy had anchored in the mainstream press
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:36,895	| serial-s02-e11 |	Cassandra and Andy it was such a jolt that first call
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:42,271	| serial-s02-e11 |	Because after 5 years they'd come to accept the original army issue version of what happened to Darren
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:44,831	| serial-s02-e11 |	That he been killed on a mission to rest a Taliban guy
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:47,647	| serial-s02-e11 |	They weren't looking for someone else to blame
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:50,207	| serial-s02-e11 |	They were doing okay with what they thought they knew
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:51,743	| serial-s02-e11 |	Uniwigs tala
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:55,071	| serial-s02-e11 |	Fit the story into our life
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:57,375	| serial-s02-e11 |	We have done
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:58,911	| serial-s02-e11 |	Talked about it
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:00,703	| serial-s02-e11 |	And now all of that
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:02,495	| serial-s02-e11 |	Was gone
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:05,055	| serial-s02-e11 |	We had a whole new story to get used to
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:07,615	| serial-s02-e11 |	Anna
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:09,407	| serial-s02-e11 |	A lot more anger
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:13,247	| serial-s02-e11 |	Sandra said they felt angry at Beaufort one thing
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:15,551	| serial-s02-e11 |	And they felt they been lied to
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:16,575	| serial-s02-e11 |	Are the army
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:17,599	| serial-s02-e11 |	I'd Aaron's Commander
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:20,927	| serial-s02-e11 |	Because no one had ever mentioned berdosa them before
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:21,951	| serial-s02-e11 |	Which goldfish eat
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:23,487	| serial-s02-e11 |	Like there was a cover-up
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:29,631	| serial-s02-e11 |	Two and a half weeks later at the andrews's went to Washington DC to testify before a congressional committee
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:34,751	| serial-s02-e11 |	Andy Andrews told the committee that six different soldiers who served with their son
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:38,591	| serial-s02-e11 |	I told him and his wife that Darren was killed while searching for Bo
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:41,663	| serial-s02-e11 |	Founder says at the very least
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:43,967	| serial-s02-e11 |	Bo was a contributing factor in his death
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:46,015	| serial-s02-e11 |	It may not have been directly
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:48,063	| serial-s02-e11 |	But indirectly
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:49,599	| serial-s02-e11 |	He was responsible
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:57,791	| serial-s02-e11 |	So this story the six names the lineup of photos in the Press
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:01,887	| serial-s02-e11 |	As far as I can tell it originated at the ground level from Bo's platoon mates
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:07,775	| serial-s02-e11 |	Documentation to back up what they were saying the defense department wasn't seconding these claims
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:09,823	| serial-s02-e11 |	These guys did have reasons
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:11,615	| serial-s02-e11 |	They were just making it up
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:15,455	| serial-s02-e11 |	Take Palau the tour Darren Andrews died on September 4th
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:19,295	| serial-s02-e11 |	I wasn't clear what exactly that mission was about
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:21,599	| serial-s02-e11 |	And I didn't understand what the connection to Bo was
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:26,463	| serial-s02-e11 |	So I asked John Thurman to explain it to me because he was on that plow mission
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:31,583	| serial-s02-e11 |	And I also knew John was in the camp of soldiers who thought bill was responsible for the people who died
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:34,399	| serial-s02-e11 |	They said we're going out for
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:36,447	| serial-s02-e11 |	You know up to 10 10 days
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:38,239	| serial-s02-e11 |	And that's
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:40,543	| serial-s02-e11 |	Basically all I remember
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,823	| serial-s02-e11 |	But what was your mission
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:44,383	| serial-s02-e11 |	But I don't actually know
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:50,015	| serial-s02-e11 |	That was definitely way above my paygrade we were going to be going into Palau
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:54,367	| serial-s02-e11 |	And we were going to be looking around and going house-to-house we had
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:58,207	| serial-s02-e11 |	Quite a few attachments that I'd never seen before we had a female engagement team
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:01,791	| serial-s02-e11 |	And we also had a combat camera team that was with us
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:04,095	| serial-s02-e11 |	So I don't actually know
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:05,887	| serial-s02-e11 |	This is an unusual actually
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:08,703	| serial-s02-e11 |	Trello level Soldier doesn't know the overall mission
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:10,751	| serial-s02-e11 |	What's communicated to Jimenez
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:12,543	| serial-s02-e11 |	Pac4x many days
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:14,591	| serial-s02-e11 |	And then before they go out each day
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:16,383	| serial-s02-e11 |	Every spider immediate leader
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:17,919	| serial-s02-e11 |	In this case Erin Andrews
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:24,319	| serial-s02-e11 |	We're going to go to this location or going to knock on doors or head out stuff or meet with Afghan Security Forces
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:24,831	| serial-s02-e11 |	Whatever
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:30,975	| serial-s02-e11 |	I've asked a lot of people not just John but Battalion officers people doing Intel
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:33,023	| serial-s02-e11 |	What was the purpose of the Palau mission
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:35,583	| serial-s02-e11 |	Here's what I've gathered big picture
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:40,191	| serial-s02-e11 |	The trip to Palau was part of a larger roughly 10-day operation
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:41,727	| serial-s02-e11 |	Push into the yackle district
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:46,591	| serial-s02-e11 |	US forces have been pretty successful in other towns but farther north
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:49,151	| serial-s02-e11 |	They're working up there with local leaders doing
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:53,503	| serial-s02-e11 |	Coin essentially making friends helping build local government and security
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:55,295	| serial-s02-e11 |	But not so much in my account
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:56,575	| serial-s02-e11 |	Which is right near Okemos
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:17:02,719	| serial-s02-e11 |	The Villages around there had quite a bit of Taliban activity they were not friendly to US forces
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:05,791	| serial-s02-e11 |	I said the Battalion had planned this mission to try to push back in there
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:11,679	| serial-s02-e11 |	That area was strategic it was between the Pakistan border and a main Highway in Afghanistan
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:14,239	| serial-s02-e11 |	That goes up to Kabul and then all through the country
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:18,079	| serial-s02-e11 |	The weight of Italian plan these larger operations
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:20,127	| serial-s02-e11 |	They weren't just about one objective
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:22,431	| serial-s02-e11 |	You try to accomplish a bunch of things at once
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:25,759	| serial-s02-e11 |	Get all kinds of US government agencies doing their stuff
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:32,671	| serial-s02-e11 |	State Department or the Department of Agriculture they might be assessing which little grapes are best to grow in whatever Valley
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:34,719	| serial-s02-e11 |	So you might have them along
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:38,559	| serial-s02-e11 |	Honest pulao Mission John remembers a female engagement team
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:41,119	| serial-s02-e11 |	That likely would have been headed up by a social scientist
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:45,727	| serial-s02-e11 |	His job is to help the US military understand Afghan culture
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:52,639	| serial-s02-e11 |	John doesn't remember looking for a specific high-value Taliban guy on that mission but other people I spoke to her
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:58,271	| serial-s02-e11 |	Who are there do remember that but they infected detain someone zip tied his hands guarded him
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:18:01,087	| serial-s02-e11 |	But then were told by higher-ups to let him go which they did
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:06,975	| serial-s02-e11 |	Again I haven't seen the mission order or the after-action report so I can't be sure
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:08,767	| serial-s02-e11 |	Adheres with John remembers
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:10,303	| serial-s02-e11 |	From his vantage point
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:13,375	| serial-s02-e11 |	In the driver's seat behind the wheel of an mrap
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:16,703	| serial-s02-e11 |	He remembers they had a lot of trucks that day maybe seven
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:18,495	| serial-s02-e11 |	Take me to court on in the village
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:24,383	| serial-s02-e11 |	And John in the Gunner waiting in the truck while the other guys went door-to-door about 45 minutes passed on to us
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:28,479	| serial-s02-e11 |	So my Gunner and I were sitting in the truck
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:31,295	| serial-s02-e11 |	And we just we had this Eerie feeling we were talking about
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:33,599	| serial-s02-e11 |	You know over some cigarettes like this
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:36,671	| serial-s02-e11 |	The sound is doesn't feel right it didn't give us a good vibe
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:40,511	| serial-s02-e11 |	And I remember a bunch of kids
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:43,583	| serial-s02-e11 |	Were congregating under the gigantic tree there
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:46,399	| serial-s02-e11 |	And then they all started to filter back into their houses
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:49,727	| serial-s02-e11 |	And I'm a gunner had actually been in Iraq
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:51,519	| serial-s02-e11 |	On the deployment prior to ours
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:54,335	| serial-s02-e11 |	And he said you know
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:56,127	| serial-s02-e11 |	I got a bad feeling we're about to go
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:56,639	| serial-s02-e11 |	Get f***** up
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:58,431	| serial-s02-e11 |	Because when the town clears out
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:04,575	| serial-s02-e11 |	Usually it means that the Taliban is going to stand something up there bringing the civilians back in so that they don't get hurt
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:08,415	| serial-s02-e11 |	I'm going to put the word out you know we're going to attack the Americans today
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:11,999	| serial-s02-e11 |	So we radio up
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:13,023	| serial-s02-e11 |	And
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:14,815	| serial-s02-e11 |	Everybody kind of knows what's going on
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:17,119	| serial-s02-e11 |	They all get ready to leave
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:21,471	| serial-s02-e11 |	And then someone comes out from behind a wall and shoot an RPG at one of their trucks
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:23,007	| serial-s02-e11 |	They shoot back
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:24,031	| serial-s02-e11 |	Hainan aerospace
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:26,591	| serial-s02-e11 |	I was Truck 3
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:28,895	| serial-s02-e11 |	And I just see the first truck just
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:29,663	| serial-s02-e11 |	Explode
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:31,967	| serial-s02-e11 |	Not the whole thing obviously but I see
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:33,759	| serial-s02-e11 |	The mine roller in the hood
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:35,807	| serial-s02-e11 |	Separate from the vehicle and
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:38,111	| serial-s02-e11 |	They rolled over pressure plate ID
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:41,183	| serial-s02-e11 |	And then from then on
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:44,511	| serial-s02-e11 |	You know it was RPG Valley so it was Small Arms fire
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:47,327	| serial-s02-e11 |	Recoilless rifles mortars
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:51,935	| serial-s02-e11 |	Everything because once they took out that first truck we were stuck
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:54,239	| serial-s02-e11 |	Because you're all behind that truck
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:54,751	| serial-s02-e11 |	Correct
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,287	| serial-s02-e11 |	Yeah that's
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:20:00,895	| serial-s02-e11 |	That's a technique that the Taliban had sort of adopted when the Soviets had invaded
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:03,711	| serial-s02-e11 |	Is Hino take out the first truck
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:04,991	| serial-s02-e11 |	Shoot up the last truck
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:07,295	| serial-s02-e11 |	And then everybody in The Middle's completely fuk
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:11,135	| serial-s02-e11 |	Darren Andrews had been in John's truck
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:11,903	| serial-s02-e11 |	The third track
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:14,975	| serial-s02-e11 |	John says Darren ran out to the first track
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:16,255	| serial-s02-e11 |	The one that just gotten blown up
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:18,047	| serial-s02-e11 |	To help the guys there
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:21,887	| serial-s02-e11 |	They set up what's called a casualty collection Point Littlefield trauma area
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:25,471	| serial-s02-e11 |	So many RPG started coming in
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:28,287	| serial-s02-e11 |	John says he watched Erin Andrews get killed
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:31,615	| serial-s02-e11 |	He watched Matt Martinez John's good friend who'd also been in his truck
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:35,455	| serial-s02-e11 |	That would die in a hospital in Germany a week later
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:39,807	| serial-s02-e11 |	John in the Gunner are inside the truck during the Ambush stuck there
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:41,855	| serial-s02-e11 |	Is Gunner is firing at whatever he can
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:46,463	| serial-s02-e11 |	And how about it like how long are you sitting there just like
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:49,023	| serial-s02-e11 |	Taking this attack
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:50,303	| serial-s02-e11 |	I think
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:52,863	| serial-s02-e11 |	I think the initial attack
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:54,655	| serial-s02-e11 |	Kick-off somewhere around 1500
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:59,263	| serial-s02-e11 |	And we didn't get back to mess till 0506
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:02,335	| serial-s02-e11 |	Oh my God you're out there all night
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:03,103	| serial-s02-e11 |	Yeah
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:03,871	| serial-s02-e11 |	Terrible
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:05,919	| serial-s02-e11 |	Oh man
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:08,991	| serial-s02-e11 |	I mean my Gunner and I just accepted it
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:12,831	| serial-s02-e11 |	I said am I sick and I think we're probably going to die tonight BC I think we are
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:16,672	| serial-s02-e11 |	So it was horrible the whole thing
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:18,208	| serial-s02-e11 |	People died
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:19,232	| serial-s02-e11 |	People were injured
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:21,536	| serial-s02-e11 |	Brass John again
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:23,840	| serial-s02-e11 |	How is any of this connected to Bo
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:27,424	| serial-s02-e11 |	And he said what we were always supposed to be looking
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:29,984	| serial-s02-e11 |	He said his platoon leader Darren Andrews
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:33,312	| serial-s02-e11 |	Didn't mention bow before they set off for pulao that day
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:35,872	| serial-s02-e11 |	But he did mention go back at 5 Sharona
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:38,176	| serial-s02-e11 |	A few days before they set off on the whole operation
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:43,552	| serial-s02-e11 |	I remember the 10 and Andrew saying you know if you hear or see
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:45,088	| serial-s02-e11 |	Any signs
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:45,856	| serial-s02-e11 |	A Bergdahl
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:47,904	| serial-s02-e11 |	We need to know about it
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:51,488	| serial-s02-e11 |	I mean and that was just the amendment to everything
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:53,792	| serial-s02-e11 |	They don't before any big push
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:59,936	| serial-s02-e11 |	And it wasn't it does also sounds like it wasn't terribly specific to any one mission
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:00,448	| serial-s02-e11 |	No
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:08,128	| serial-s02-e11 |	Got it okay now I'm beginning to understand why you could have a mission that is simultaneously not specific to birds
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:09,408	| serial-s02-e11 |	Doll and
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:11,456	| serial-s02-e11 |	Also involving Bergdahl
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:13,248	| serial-s02-e11 |	IC
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:19,904	| serial-s02-e11 |	It's hard it's hard cuz it's like an umbrella over everything you're doing exactly
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:21,440	| serial-s02-e11 |	It's the perfect way to describe it
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:25,280	| serial-s02-e11 |	So if you close the umbrella
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:26,560	| serial-s02-e11 |	Then
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:30,144	| serial-s02-e11 |	You can't make the argument it was looking for Bergdahl
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:30,912	| serial-s02-e11 |	Right
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,192	| serial-s02-e11 |	But if you open it you can
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:35,520	| serial-s02-e11 |	So it's just
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:41,920	| serial-s02-e11 |	Depends on who's living under the umbrella from my
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:45,248	| serial-s02-e11 |	From my small scope is specialist Thurmond III
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:47,296	| serial-s02-e11 |	I don't know
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:48,576	| serial-s02-e11 |	Who knows what
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:49,088	| serial-s02-e11 |	Above me
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:51,648	| serial-s02-e11 |	Right now I only know what I know
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:57,280	| serial-s02-e11 |	John told me it's totally possible this was a specific mission to look for bow
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:22:59,584	| serial-s02-e11 |	But that information just never filter down to him
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:04,448	| serial-s02-e11 |	John's Battalion Commander Lieutenant Colonel Clint Baker would probably know
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:05,728	| serial-s02-e11 |	I haven't been able to talk to him
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:08,544	| serial-s02-e11 |	But I did talk to his number two
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:10,592	| serial-s02-e11 |	Command sergeant major Ken Wolfe
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:15,456	| serial-s02-e11 |	He's out of the military now but at the time he was the highest NCO in the battalion
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:17,504	| serial-s02-e11 |	Who do the commanders in the privates
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:18,272	| serial-s02-e11 |	Cared about them
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:21,344	| serial-s02-e11 |	It took me quite a long time to persuade Ken to talk to
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:23,904	| serial-s02-e11 |	He has no love lost for bow
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:25,952	| serial-s02-e11 |	He thinks he's selfish plain and simple
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:26,720	| serial-s02-e11 |	Traitor to his unit
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:30,816	| serial-s02-e11 |	Finally after many emails and negotiations
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:32,608	| serial-s02-e11 |	Kant agreed on one condition
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:34,656	| serial-s02-e11 |	He wanted to be able to say this
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:37,984	| serial-s02-e11 |	The families who lost
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:40,288	| serial-s02-e11 |	Chun's
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:41,824	| serial-s02-e11 |	During this deployment
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:43,616	| serial-s02-e11 |	To let them know that
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:44,128	| serial-s02-e11 |	There
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:46,944	| serial-s02-e11 |	Their sons
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:48,224	| serial-s02-e11 |	Did not die
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:49,504	| serial-s02-e11 |	Looking
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:51,296	| serial-s02-e11 |	For PFC Bergdahl
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:54,624	| serial-s02-e11 |	Their son didn't die looking for him
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:56,928	| serial-s02-e11 |	Explain why
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:24:00,768	| serial-s02-e11 |	Why you're saying like why you know this to be true
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:03,072	| serial-s02-e11 |	Because
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:04,096	| serial-s02-e11 |	All you
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:06,144	| serial-s02-e11 |	All you got to do
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:07,424	| serial-s02-e11 |	Is look at a map
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:09,472	| serial-s02-e11 |	And look at a time frame
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:12,032	| serial-s02-e11 |	Okay I'm so time frame
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:18,944	| serial-s02-e11 |	Again the incidents that resulted in the six deaths in a battalion happened between August 18th and September
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:21,504	| serial-s02-e11 |	4/5 about two months after Bo left
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:24,320	| serial-s02-e11 |	We we we looked and we looked
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:24,832	| serial-s02-e11 |	And we look
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:27,392	| serial-s02-e11 |	And
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:30,720	| serial-s02-e11 |	But you can't
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:33,280	| serial-s02-e11 |	And this is where this is where it gets very difficult
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:35,840	| serial-s02-e11 |	For people to understand
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:43,776	| serial-s02-e11 |	Because you can never a new one in the army
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:44,800	| serial-s02-e11 |	Is ever going to say
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:46,080	| serial-s02-e11 |	We stopped looking for you
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:49,152	| serial-s02-e11 |	Right right
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:52,224	| serial-s02-e11 |	But
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:54,528	| serial-s02-e11 |	Here's a deal
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:59,136	| serial-s02-e11 |	You know it's it's been 45 + base
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:00,160	| serial-s02-e11 |	At this point
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:04,512	| serial-s02-e11 |	We know where he's at In-N-Out is in Pakistan
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:05,792	| serial-s02-e11 |	All right
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:12,192	| serial-s02-e11 |	A vanilla unit like a five-oh-first is not leaving its battle space and going into Pakistan
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:13,472	| serial-s02-e11 |	Define vim
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:16,800	| serial-s02-e11 |	By look at a map
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:21,408	| serial-s02-e11 |	Because if anyone is going after bow in Pakistan will be a special forces team
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:23,200	| serial-s02-e11 |	Not an infantry unit
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:27,552	| serial-s02-e11 |	Of course they were going to keep their eyes and ears open
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:31,136	| serial-s02-e11 |	But if your commander you're balancing no man left behind
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:32,928	| serial-s02-e11 |	With some very practical matters
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:36,768	| serial-s02-e11 |	Your Intel regarding the dust one is drying up
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:39,072	| serial-s02-e11 |	You're unlikely to find him in Afghanistan anyway
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:41,632	| serial-s02-e11 |	There's an Afghan presidential election
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:42,400	| serial-s02-e11 |	Prepare for
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:43,168	| serial-s02-e11 |	Award win
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:46,496	| serial-s02-e11 |	So you're not sending your guys on search missions anymore
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:49,568	| serial-s02-e11 |	In terms of operations they needed to get back to work
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:53,920	| serial-s02-e11 |	Cancers that Palau Mission had nothing to do with bow
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:56,480	| serial-s02-e11 |	What some of the soldiers will say is
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:59,552	| serial-s02-e11 |	Okay maybe not directly but it's still connected to
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:02,368	| serial-s02-e11 |	Because the search for bow affected everything
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:05,184	| serial-s02-e11 |	They talk a lot about second and third order effects
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:07,744	| serial-s02-e11 |	A concept that's drilled into soldiers
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:10,048	| serial-s02-e11 |	But everything they do has consequences
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:11,072	| serial-s02-e11 |	Once or twice removed
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:14,400	| serial-s02-e11 |	Search change the course of their deployment
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:17,984	| serial-s02-e11 |	Change the landscape of their overall mission in a bunch of detrimental ways
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:20,032	| serial-s02-e11 |	Led to people dying
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:22,080	| serial-s02-e11 |	I put their argument to Ken
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:29,504	| serial-s02-e11 |	Well sure you know the September 4th Mission wasn't expressly only to go look for birds
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:30,016	| serial-s02-e11 |	Doll say
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:34,368	| serial-s02-e11 |	But because we had been out looking for him for the past 2 months
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:40,768	| serial-s02-e11 |	We had been making inroads in certain places and because we had to kind of pull away from that and focus on
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:46,400	| serial-s02-e11 |	Looking for him and we became much more kinetic we became more aggressive we are going into places we hadn't been before
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:47,936	| serial-s02-e11 |	We were stretched thin
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:51,008	| serial-s02-e11 |	That that it gave the insurgents a foothold
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:52,288	| serial-s02-e11 |	In places
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:58,432	| serial-s02-e11 |	You know where we are kind of kept them at Bay and now those places were more dangerous like that's one of the argument still make
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:01,760	| serial-s02-e11 |	Minnesota fair argument
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:04,320	| serial-s02-e11 |	It doesn't hold water because
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:07,904	| serial-s02-e11 |	You you you are in a very
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:08,928	| serial-s02-e11 |	Bad neighborhood
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:11,488	| serial-s02-e11 |	Regardless
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:13,280	| serial-s02-e11 |	You can get killed any day
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:13,792	| serial-s02-e11 |	I mean
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:16,096	| serial-s02-e11 |	If you
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:18,912	| serial-s02-e11 |	You could have you could have been on it on a random patrol
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:21,984	| serial-s02-e11 |	In Palau on the 29th
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:23,520	| serial-s02-e11 |	Of
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:24,288	| serial-s02-e11 |	June
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:25,824	| serial-s02-e11 |	And hit
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:28,896	| serial-s02-e11 |	Shania t as well so I mean I get it
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:33,504	| serial-s02-e11 |	However it you know it's just purely speculation
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:34,528	| serial-s02-e11 |	And hypothetical
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:41,184	| serial-s02-e11 |	Speculation and hypothetical toucan are Far Cry from say knowledge and understanding
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:47,328	| serial-s02-e11 |	Ken says there were so many factors factors beyond bow these soldiers are not taking into account
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:48,864	| serial-s02-e11 |	70 factors they aren't aware of
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:51,168	| serial-s02-e11 |	I'll give you a perfect example he said
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:55,520	| serial-s02-e11 |	And yet you told me this whole story about Yaya cow and the surrounding villages
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:59,616	| serial-s02-e11 |	Different factions have been in Conflict there since the early 1970s
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:03,456	| serial-s02-e11 |	Playlist in the Monarch kicking around the Communist sympathizers
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:07,296	| serial-s02-e11 |	Well and then when the communists come in
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:08,832	| serial-s02-e11 |	They check the Loyalists around
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:11,136	| serial-s02-e11 |	Well and then
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:13,696	| serial-s02-e11 |	When the Taliban comes in
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:17,280	| serial-s02-e11 |	They took the Communists around
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:18,816	| serial-s02-e11 |	And then when we come in
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:21,120	| serial-s02-e11 |	We took the Taliban out
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:23,168	| serial-s02-e11 |	So now they retaliate
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:25,216	| serial-s02-e11 |	Well some of these folks
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:28,032	| serial-s02-e11 |	They went across the border into Pakistan
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:30,592	| serial-s02-e11 |	Because they want to get kicked around
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:33,408	| serial-s02-e11 |	And then when they came back
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:35,200	| serial-s02-e11 |	They found that their houses
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:36,224	| serial-s02-e11 |	We're occupied
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:39,296	| serial-s02-e11 |	By the people who were kicking around right
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:41,088	| serial-s02-e11 |	Pirate show
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:43,392	| serial-s02-e11 |	They're they're angry
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:48,768	| serial-s02-e11 |	I just come back from Pakistan and when I left her 10 years ago this was my house and now you're living in it
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:51,328	| serial-s02-e11 |	Well there is no
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:53,888	| serial-s02-e11 |	You can't go down to the county courthouse
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:59,008	| serial-s02-e11 |	I'm sure Anna and pull up the deed that says this house belongs to me
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:01,312	| serial-s02-e11 |	So what are you do
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:03,104	| serial-s02-e11 |	You fight over it
EDL	00:29:03,872	00:29:04,640	| serial-s02-e11 |	Chode
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:06,176	| serial-s02-e11 |	It doesn't it didn't matter
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:08,992	| serial-s02-e11 |	That PFC Bergdahl
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:10,272	| serial-s02-e11 |	Walked off
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:14,112	| serial-s02-e11 |	There was a conflict that was so much deeper
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:15,392	| serial-s02-e11 |	Bergdahl
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:20,512	| serial-s02-e11 |	NM quite frankly so much more important than Bergdahl just to solve
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:23,072	| serial-s02-e11 |	Dev the problem
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:24,096	| serial-s02-e11 |	Impact eco
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:26,656	| serial-s02-e11 |	That these guys
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:27,680	| serial-s02-e11 |	They don't understand
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:33,568	| serial-s02-e11 |	The guys are making these arguments and it's not because you're bad guys
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:35,104	| serial-s02-e11 |	It's not MacArthur ill-informed
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:36,640	| serial-s02-e11 |	It's because
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:40,224	| serial-s02-e11 |	They aren't pretty
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:42,016	| serial-s02-e11 |	Did the same information
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:43,296	| serial-s02-e11 |	That I am
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:45,856	| serial-s02-e11 |	And here's the deal
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:50,464	| serial-s02-e11 |	The story I just told you you know how long it took me to learn that
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:51,744	| serial-s02-e11 |	Took me 9 months
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:54,560	| serial-s02-e11 |	Took me 9 months rolling in there
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:56,352	| serial-s02-e11 |	All the time
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:57,376	| serial-s02-e11 |	And Hawking
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:29:57,888	| serial-s02-e11 |	The people
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:29:59,424	| serial-s02-e11 |	Before
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:01,728	| serial-s02-e11 |	They laid that whole story out for me
EDL	00:30:03,776	00:30:05,824	| serial-s02-e11 |	Their mission is different than mine mission
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:10,432	| serial-s02-e11 |	My mission was to go out there and figure out what the problem is
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:14,016	| serial-s02-e11 |	Why Why everytime we roll through
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:15,808	| serial-s02-e11 |	This one place
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:16,832	| serial-s02-e11 |	We got blown up
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:20,928	| serial-s02-e11 |	Are the soldiers who see all of this differently
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:22,720	| serial-s02-e11 |	Ken doesn't begrudge them their perspective
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:25,792	| serial-s02-e11 |	He just wishes they hadn't been so public about it
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:32,192	| serial-s02-e11 |	Did these young men that are that are saying these things I love every one of them and every one of those guys know
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:32,960	| serial-s02-e11 |	I think him
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:36,800	| serial-s02-e11 |	Make him get ahold of me in and I'll do anything in the world for those guys they know that
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:39,616	| serial-s02-e11 |	What they're doing
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:41,664	| serial-s02-e11 |	I just don't think that
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:44,480	| serial-s02-e11 |	They thought it through
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:46,528	| serial-s02-e11 |	And
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:49,856	| serial-s02-e11 |	By not thinking it through they didn't understand the ramifications
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:52,416	| serial-s02-e11 |	Of their verbalization
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:54,208	| serial-s02-e11 |	What that was going to have
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:30:55,744	| serial-s02-e11 |	On on the families
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:30:59,584	| serial-s02-e11 |	Again Ken's not being protective of Bo here
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:01,632	| serial-s02-e11 |	He just thinks the record. To be set straight
EDL	00:31:02,144	00:31:04,704	| serial-s02-e11 |	He doesn't want the memories of the guys who died
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:06,496	| serial-s02-e11 |	To be dragged into the bergdoll morass
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:08,288	| serial-s02-e11 |	Three Sally buy it
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:09,312	| serial-s02-e11 |	Are the politics of it
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:12,128	| serial-s02-e11 |	I think it's not fair to those men
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:13,152	| serial-s02-e11 |	Or their families
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:21,088	| serial-s02-e11 |	Are you sure something else I've heard along the way
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:24,928	| serial-s02-e11 |	Maybe some of these guys think they were looking for Bo
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:29,024	| serial-s02-e11 |	But really their commanders were only using bow as an excuse
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:30,048	| serial-s02-e11 |	Top cover
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:33,632	| serial-s02-e11 |	To get extra assets to go kick in doors and RC East
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:39,008	| serial-s02-e11 |	We were actually looking for him there didn't come a point where he did just become an excuse to go out
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:42,848	| serial-s02-e11 |	And do things but
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:47,968	| serial-s02-e11 |	This is a guy I'm calling Scott he arrived in Afghanistan in ghazni in mid-july
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:51,808	| serial-s02-e11 |	His job was classified which is why he doesn't want to use his name
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:56,672	| serial-s02-e11 |	All I could say was that he was attached to an elite unit he said before about left
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:32:00,512	| serial-s02-e11 |	In order for unit to leave the wire you had to have good actionable intelligence
EDL	00:32:01,536	00:32:07,936	| serial-s02-e11 |	But when when he disappeared. Does limits those thresholds for going
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:11,264	| serial-s02-e11 |	Hangout became much much lower so if you had
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:15,872	| serial-s02-e11 |	Very unreliable information about Bowe bergdahl's whereabouts
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:16,896	| serial-s02-e11 |	You can go anywhere
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:21,760	| serial-s02-e11 |	Just use him as an excuse to go wherever we wanted to go
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:25,088	| serial-s02-e11 |	How do you know that I mean you weren't there before
EDL	00:32:25,088	00:32:28,160	| serial-s02-e11 |	China Wok. So how do you know the threshold got lower
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:32,768	| serial-s02-e11 |	Because every other mission that we try to go on
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:35,072	| serial-s02-e11 |	That he
EDL	00:32:35,072	00:32:36,352	| serial-s02-e11 |	That didn't involve him
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:38,912	| serial-s02-e11 |	Was much more difficult to get out of
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:40,192	| serial-s02-e11 |	Get outside the wire on
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:42,496	| serial-s02-e11 |	So someone would say I think we need to go do ax
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:45,056	| serial-s02-e11 |	Forget it unless it involves
EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:47,616	| serial-s02-e11 |	Yes
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:49,408	| serial-s02-e11 |	I mean I I sat through
EDL	00:32:49,920	00:32:51,200	| serial-s02-e11 |	Why briefings were
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:52,992	| serial-s02-e11 |	Missions were turned down
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:55,040	| serial-s02-e11 |	And I sat through
EDL	00:32:55,552	00:32:58,880	| serial-s02-e11 |	Live briefings were missions were accepted that probably shouldn't have been
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:32:59,648	| serial-s02-e11 |	Warfarin
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:01,952	| serial-s02-e11 |	So is this true
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:06,048	| serial-s02-e11 |	Were people just using the search as a way to get unrelated missions okayed
EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:07,328	| serial-s02-e11 |	Or the way to scam assets
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:12,704	| serial-s02-e11 |	I asked and I asked and finally I found Lieutenant Colonel Paul Edgar
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:18,336	| serial-s02-e11 |	He was a guy in charge of managing the search for Belle he was operations officer for the Brigade
EDL	00:33:18,336	00:33:21,920	| serial-s02-e11 |	You're planning a mission for the five-oh-first and you wanted special assets
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:23,712	| serial-s02-e11 |	Usually aircraft or drones
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:24,992	| serial-s02-e11 |	You had to go through Paul
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:27,552	| serial-s02-e11 |	Around mid-august
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:31,392	| serial-s02-e11 |	I thought that there were a couple of requests from subordinate units that
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:33,440	| serial-s02-e11 |	That were
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:37,792	| serial-s02-e11 |	Taking advantage or attempting to take advantage a little bit of
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:39,584	| serial-s02-e11 |	Doing something else
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:42,656	| serial-s02-e11 |	In the name of looking for for Bowe Bergdahl
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:46,240	| serial-s02-e11 |	And when his team saw that they disapproved those missions
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:49,312	| serial-s02-e11 |	Also she didn't see rampant abuse or anything
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:51,872	| serial-s02-e11 |	He said it was more like a natural inclination
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:55,456	| serial-s02-e11 |	To try to sell your own mission spin your objectives
EDL	00:33:55,456	00:33:57,760	| serial-s02-e11 |	In a way that was going to be most persuasive to your bosses
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:34:04,160	| serial-s02-e11 |	For instance a couple of the people who helped plan missions lower down the company and Battalion level
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:08,768	| serial-s02-e11 |	Tell me that if you wanted extra support for operation in August or September say
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:10,816	| serial-s02-e11 |	You might sandwich bow in there
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:12,608	| serial-s02-e11 |	So the operation paperwork
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:15,424	| serial-s02-e11 |	Might well have included among other objectives
EDL	00:34:15,424	00:34:21,312	| serial-s02-e11 |	Language saying they were facilitating recovery of dust one or in support of dust One recovery operations
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:22,848	| serial-s02-e11 |	That's one meaning bow
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:26,944	| serial-s02-e11 |	If you had that you were more likely to get additional assets
EDL	00:34:26,944	00:34:27,712	| serial-s02-e11 |	The helicopter
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:29,760	| serial-s02-e11 |	On the other hand
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:33,856	| serial-s02-e11 |	To get approved in the first place you had to have actual Intel backing it up
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:38,720	| serial-s02-e11 |	Maybe it wasn't the strongest Intel but still it had to be legitimately connected to those whereabouts
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:43,584	| serial-s02-e11 |	And then on your mission you were actually question people about Beau
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:45,632	| serial-s02-e11 |	You can just invent something and get assets
EDL	00:34:46,656	00:34:48,192	| serial-s02-e11 |	Because first off that's just wrong
EDL	00:34:48,704	00:34:53,312	| serial-s02-e11 |	Resources are scarce and so you're very aware that if your getting use of an aircraft
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:55,104	| serial-s02-e11 |	Someone else who needs it just got denied
EDL	00:34:55,872	00:34:56,640	| serial-s02-e11 |	And second
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:58,688	| serial-s02-e11 |	If you try to manufacture a reason
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:35:00,992	| serial-s02-e11 |	Someone like Paul was going to catch it
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:08,160	| serial-s02-e11 |	A little cheating maybe little massaging
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:09,184	| serial-s02-e11 |	But not a scandal
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:14,560	| serial-s02-e11 |	But all this leads to another big question hovering over the search for Bo
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:19,168	| serial-s02-e11 |	By mid-july common sense told you what was probably in Pakistan
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:25,568	| serial-s02-e11 |	So why through August and into September are US soldiers still looking for a man Afghanistan at all
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:28,896	| serial-s02-e11 |	Why might an operation plan for September
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:33,248	| serial-s02-e11 |	Include a legitimate objective of facilitating recovery of the Dust one
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:35,040	| serial-s02-e11 |	When the dust one is long gone
EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:36,576	| serial-s02-e11 |	Cross the border America Shah
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:44,768	| serial-s02-e11 |	Within two or three days of beau's disappearance news outlets were quoting Taliban sources saying those kidnapping was directed by
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:46,048	| serial-s02-e11 |	By Melissa Jean
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:48,864	| serial-s02-e11 |	Rose case would be referred to sirajudeen haqqani
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:50,400	| serial-s02-e11 |	Does guys operate in Pakistan
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:57,824	| serial-s02-e11 |	On July 20th right after the Taliban released the first Proof of Life video of bo ABC ran a story with the
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:36:01,408	| serial-s02-e11 |	Headline exclusive missing US soldier maybe in Pakistan
EDL	00:36:02,176	00:36:08,576	| serial-s02-e11 |	So then why were they still looking in Afghanistan 30 days later 60 days later and Beyond
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:12,416	| serial-s02-e11 |	Well first off Afghanistan's the only place they really can look
EDL	00:36:12,416	00:36:16,768	| serial-s02-e11 |	Since I can't go tromping into Pakistan Sovereign Nation Ally Etc
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:18,816	| serial-s02-e11 |	And Paul told me
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:24,192	| serial-s02-e11 |	Sure they sell those new stories in Pakistan and they had their own until that bow is in Pakistan
EDL	00:36:24,704	00:36:31,104	| serial-s02-e11 |	But they also had until just as persuasive that bow is in Afghanistan
EDL	00:36:31,104	00:36:34,432	| serial-s02-e11 |	Strong as a news report
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:35,200	| serial-s02-e11 |	Yes
EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:37,504	| serial-s02-e11 |	Right okay
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:39,808	| serial-s02-e11 |	And I'm not and I'm not dissing news reports
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:43,136	| serial-s02-e11 |	Because sometimes sneezes
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:48,768	| serial-s02-e11 |	But if you see something on you know if I see something on on CNN International
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:50,304	| serial-s02-e11 |	And then
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:55,168	| serial-s02-e11 |	I go across the hallway to our Brigade intelligence cell
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:36:57,984	| serial-s02-e11 |	I ain't talked to a number of folks and
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:36:59,776	| serial-s02-e11 |	Overlay some different information
EDL	00:37:00,544	00:37:02,336	| serial-s02-e11 |	Am I suppose standing there
EDL	00:37:02,848	00:37:05,664	| serial-s02-e11 |	In front of an unknown land marker in
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:06,688	| serial-s02-e11 |	Pakistan
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:09,760	| serial-s02-e11 |	With today's newspaper or something like that
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:14,112	| serial-s02-e11 |	I'm going to looks very seriously and consider very seriously The credibility of
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:18,720	| serial-s02-e11 |	Of our information versus what what I read on CNN
EDL	00:37:19,488	00:37:22,816	| serial-s02-e11 |	Probability that Bo was in Pakistan wasn't enough
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:28,704	| serial-s02-e11 |	In fact Paul said his best guess was that boy was initially captured by some JV Taliban
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:32,032	| serial-s02-e11 |	And that rather than spiriting him across the border into Pakistan
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:37,920	| serial-s02-e11 |	The Taliban had sent a big cheese from Pakistan back into Afghanistan to handle the situation
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:40,480	| serial-s02-e11 |	DePaul wasn't at all convinced but wasn't still in Afghanistan
EDL	00:37:41,760	00:37:45,856	| serial-s02-e11 |	Army commanders are literal when they say they needed to know for a fact
EDL	00:37:45,856	00:37:48,672	| serial-s02-e11 |	That ball was in Pakistan before they would change course
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:53,024	| serial-s02-e11 |	General Flynn the guy who is mcchrystal's intelligence Chief at the time
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:54,048	| serial-s02-e11 |	Made this clear to me
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:58,912	| serial-s02-e11 |	If you're if you think probably a few weeks after like yeah he's probably empaques
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:37:59,424	| serial-s02-e11 |	Stan
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:03,520	| serial-s02-e11 |	So what do you want me to say sorry you want me to say that we're going to give up on him
EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:07,872	| serial-s02-e11 |	No I'm not going to say that I can sit here and we will never give up
EDL	00:38:08,384	00:38:11,200	| serial-s02-e11 |	You know you don't I mean you know something American
EDL	00:38:11,712	00:38:14,016	| serial-s02-e11 |	You know I'm going to hold out hope until
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:18,112	| serial-s02-e11 |	Until the last possible thing that we can
EDL	00:38:18,112	00:38:19,392	| serial-s02-e11 |	Potentially doing even
EDL	00:38:19,392	00:38:20,928	| serial-s02-e11 |	And we would even pull
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:23,488	| serial-s02-e11 |	Intelligence threads even after
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:24,256	| serial-s02-e11 |	Months
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:28,864	| serial-s02-e11 |	I mean I'm not I'm not a satisfied person
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:32,192	| serial-s02-e11 |	Even if you ever talked to an intelligence officer who says they're satisfied
EDL	00:38:32,704	00:38:33,728	| serial-s02-e11 |	There's
EDL	00:38:33,728	00:38:39,360	| serial-s02-e11 |	There's something we call bulletproof intelligence and and when you get bulletproof intelligence
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:41,920	| serial-s02-e11 |	That's rare that is rare
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:44,736	| serial-s02-e11 |	And even when you think your Intel is Bulletproof
EDL	00:38:44,736	00:38:45,504	| serial-s02-e11 |	You double check
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:50,368	| serial-s02-e11 |	Flynn says we've consistently underestimated our enemy in these wars
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:52,928	| serial-s02-e11 |	I use deception a lie effectively
EDL	00:38:53,440	00:38:56,512	| serial-s02-e11 |	We never got to 100% on his location
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:39:00,096	| serial-s02-e11 |	So the search for Bowen Afghanistan was never called off
EDL	00:39:00,096	00:39:02,912	| serial-s02-e11 |	Cuz again it's an army value and American value
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:06,496	| serial-s02-e11 |	But you don't give up on a Conrad who's falling into enemy hands
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:09,056	| serial-s02-e11 |	As one battalion officer said to me
EDL	00:39:09,056	00:39:10,336	| serial-s02-e11 |	Even if they're a dick head
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:11,616	| serial-s02-e11 |	You will do everything you can
EDL	00:39:13,920	00:39:14,688	| serial-s02-e11 |	But
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:15,712	| serial-s02-e11 |	One last word on this
EDL	00:39:16,224	00:39:19,296	| serial-s02-e11 |	Zoom out one level to the US Central Command
EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:21,856	| serial-s02-e11 |	Because it wasn't just the Army calling the shots here
EDL	00:39:21,856	00:39:26,464	| serial-s02-e11 |	Centcom ultimately control defense department Assets in Afghanistan at the time
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:28,512	| serial-s02-e11 |	Planes helicopters drones
EDL	00:39:28,512	00:39:30,304	| serial-s02-e11 |	Predators with and without weapons attached
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:34,912	| serial-s02-e11 |	About two weeks after Bo was captured so mid-july
EDL	00:39:34,912	00:39:37,728	| serial-s02-e11 |	A ground-level analysts at centcom inform the boss
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:39,520	| serial-s02-e11 |	We think he's in Pakistan
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:42,080	| serial-s02-e11 |	But this analyst
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:44,128	| serial-s02-e11 |	You can't write that in your assessment
EDL	00:39:44,128	00:39:46,432	| serial-s02-e11 |	Not unless you have bomb-proof evidence
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:48,992	| serial-s02-e11 |	Meaning to Independent corroborated sources
EDL	00:39:49,504	00:39:52,320	| serial-s02-e11 |	Which is not the normal standard for an Intel assessment
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:58,976	| serial-s02-e11 |	Rather that's the standard usually reserved for Recovery Mission say when you're actually sending people into Harm's Way
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:01,024	| serial-s02-e11 |	Not for an Intel assessment
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:05,120	| serial-s02-e11 |	But in this case they weren't allowed to put it in a report so they didn't
EDL	00:40:05,120	00:40:06,912	| serial-s02-e11 |	They waited another thirty
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:10,496	| serial-s02-e11 |	40 days or so till sometime in late August early September
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:17,408	| serial-s02-e11 |	Which meant the intensity of the search for bow remain high in Afghanistan for several more weeks rather than
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:18,432	| serial-s02-e11 |	Tapering off in mid July
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:22,784	| serial-s02-e11 |	My source wasn't sure why they weren't allowed to call it earlier
EDL	00:40:22,784	00:40:29,184	| serial-s02-e11 |	Maybe because this was an unprecedented situation nobody exactly knew the implications tactic
EDL	00:40:29,184	00:40:31,232	| serial-s02-e11 |	Play strategically politically
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:36,608	| serial-s02-e11 |	A saying a US Soldier was being held in Pakistan for the dod had no Authority
EDL	00:40:40,448	00:40:42,240	| serial-s02-e11 |	Lieutenant Colonel Mike Waltz
EDL	00:40:42,240	00:40:43,776	| serial-s02-e11 |	The Special Forces Commander
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:46,848	| serial-s02-e11 |	Was one of the people who went on TV very early on
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:48,640	| serial-s02-e11 |	And said people died looking for Bo
EDL	00:40:49,152	00:40:51,968	| serial-s02-e11 |	Men died searching for
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:55,296	| serial-s02-e11 |	Sergeant Bergdahl and when we believed at the time
EDL	00:40:55,296	00:40:56,576	| serial-s02-e11 |	It's the short-handed
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:40:58,880	| serial-s02-e11 |	Is stating it as a nuanced fact
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:40:59,904	| serial-s02-e11 |	But I have trouble with
EDL	00:41:00,416	00:41:03,744	| serial-s02-e11 |	It seems Reckless to throw around something like that without solid cause
EDL	00:41:04,512	00:41:06,048	| serial-s02-e11 |	If you press for the evidence
EDL	00:41:06,048	00:41:09,376	| serial-s02-e11 |	Mike and others will argue on the basis of second and third order effects
EDL	00:41:10,912	00:41:13,984	| serial-s02-e11 |	So many resources were diverted to look for bow
EDL	00:41:13,984	00:41:16,544	| serial-s02-e11 |	Depriving other units resulting in fatality
EDL	00:41:17,312	00:41:20,128	| serial-s02-e11 |	On July 4th just a few days after Bo walked
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:23,456	| serial-s02-e11 |	There's a big attack in an outpost in Peck Tikka called Ciroc
EDL	00:41:23,456	00:41:24,736	| serial-s02-e11 |	Which two mortar men died
EDL	00:41:25,760	00:41:27,552	| serial-s02-e11 |	Maybe it would have gone down the way it did
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:29,600	| serial-s02-e11 |	They had the Intel aircraft a task for
EDL	00:41:30,112	00:41:31,136	| serial-s02-e11 |	Intel aircraft
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:32,416	| serial-s02-e11 |	Tied up in the search for Bo
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:38,048	| serial-s02-e11 |	In early October another big attack on a nopi located hundreds of miles north of Pact
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:40,096	| serial-s02-e11 |	8 Americans were killed
EDL	00:41:40,864	00:41:44,448	| serial-s02-e11 |	It happened three months after Bo left but is also been linked to him
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:49,312	| serial-s02-e11 |	Plans to shut down that Opie which is considered vulnerable I've been delayed
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:50,848	| serial-s02-e11 |	Partly because of starch
EDL	00:41:52,384	00:41:54,687	| serial-s02-e11 |	When I interviewed Mike Waltz I pushed him on this
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:56,991	| serial-s02-e11 |	The causality here is tenuous
EDL	00:41:57,503	00:41:58,783	| serial-s02-e11 |	So why are people saying it
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:03,903	| serial-s02-e11 |	And he said look directly or indirectly killed or almost killed
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:04,927	| serial-s02-e11 |	Why are we parsing this
EDL	00:42:05,439	00:42:09,023	| serial-s02-e11 |	There were real consequences to what bow did why can't we talk about that
EDL	00:42:10,047	00:42:13,631	| serial-s02-e11 |	Which made me realize this is the root of what these guys are saying
EDL	00:42:13,631	00:42:15,935	| serial-s02-e11 |	What they've been saying since the day bow got traded
EDL	00:42:16,447	00:42:17,215	| serial-s02-e11 |	And that is
EDL	00:42:17,215	00:42:19,263	| serial-s02-e11 |	Don't tell me it's over his back
EDL	00:42:19,263	00:42:20,287	| serial-s02-e11 |	No harm no foul
EDL	00:42:21,055	00:42:27,455	| serial-s02-e11 |	You can spend I think the rest of Eternity parsing well it was a supply run to the base at Salerno I'm was
EDL	00:42:27,455	00:42:30,527	| serial-s02-e11 |	That indirectly yeah that was ICD-10 was that related or not
EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:33,599	| serial-s02-e11 |	But like I mean for that period of time
EDL	00:42:33,599	00:42:35,391	| serial-s02-e11 |	That's all we were doing
EDL	00:42:35,391	00:42:37,183	| serial-s02-e11 |	And it if you were hurt
EDL	00:42:37,183	00:42:41,023	| serial-s02-e11 |	Injured I listen to it on the radio people being met of act
EDL	00:42:41,023	00:42:42,303	| serial-s02-e11 |	During ambushes
EDL	00:42:42,303	00:42:44,351	| serial-s02-e11 |	From tcp's that they had set up
EDL	00:42:44,863	00:42:46,911	| serial-s02-e11 |	Trying to find Bergdahl
EDL	00:42:47,935	00:42:53,311	| serial-s02-e11 |	My own soldiers barely escaped death from from essentially an ambush
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:59,455	| serial-s02-e11 |	Based on it that was set up based on information looking for Bergdahl I'm absolutely adamant my mind
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:03,039	| serial-s02-e11 |	That soldiers were either put In Harm's Way or were harmed looking for him
EDL	00:43:04,063	00:43:04,831	| serial-s02-e11 |	And
EDL	00:43:04,831	00:43:07,391	| serial-s02-e11 |	Thought I'd sorry I'm a I do get a bit
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:12,255	| serial-s02-e11 |	Not emotional but I I
EDL	00:43:12,255	00:43:14,303	| serial-s02-e11 |	Couldn't push back more forcefully
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:14,815	| serial-s02-e11 |	That
EDL	00:43:15,583	00:43:17,887	| serial-s02-e11 |	That his actions just had no effect
EDL	00:43:17,887	00:43:23,519	| serial-s02-e11 |	And so the notion that it didn't really affect the election there didn't really do that much
EDL	00:43:23,519	00:43:25,823	| serial-s02-e11 |	I think it's just a
EDL	00:43:25,823	00:43:27,359	| serial-s02-e11 |	It's just absolutely untrue
EDL	00:43:28,895	00:43:33,503	| serial-s02-e11 |	I think it's a stretch too far to say people were killed looking for bow or because of bow
EDL	00:43:34,527	00:43:37,087	| serial-s02-e11 |	But that's not to say there weren't major consequences
EDL	00:43:37,599	00:43:42,975	| serial-s02-e11 |	Per month or six weeks the shape and mood of the war end of the US mission in Regional command East
EDL	00:43:42,975	00:43:43,743	| serial-s02-e11 |	Changed
EDL	00:43:44,255	00:43:45,791	| serial-s02-e11 |	Resources were diverted
EDL	00:43:45,791	00:43:50,655	| serial-s02-e11 |	People stop doing some of the arguably constructive things they were doing to look for bow
EDL	00:43:51,167	00:43:53,471	| serial-s02-e11 |	And people suffered looking for Bo
EDL	00:43:53,471	00:43:56,031	| serial-s02-e11 |	They suffered psychologically and physically
EDL	00:43:56,031	00:43:57,567	| serial-s02-e11 |	A couple of cases severely
EDL	00:43:58,335	00:44:02,943	| serial-s02-e11 |	In September a Navy SEAL named Jimmy hatch went on CNN and talk to Anderson Cooper
EDL	00:44:03,711	00:44:07,807	| serial-s02-e11 |	Hatch said he was part of the team that flew to helicopters into a compound
EDL	00:44:07,807	00:44:09,087	| serial-s02-e11 |	On the night of July 9th
EDL	00:44:10,111	00:44:13,951	| serial-s02-e11 |	Qasidah immediately deal with a pre-major gunfight
EDL	00:44:13,951	00:44:16,767	| serial-s02-e11 |	And at that point what's the what's the goal
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:18,815	| serial-s02-e11 |	Goes to get that kid
EDL	00:44:19,583	00:44:20,607	| serial-s02-e11 |	Find GoPro.
EDL	00:44:21,631	00:44:23,167	| serial-s02-e11 |	Fast and we were close
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:24,703	| serial-s02-e11 |	Cuz things started right away
EDL	00:44:25,471	00:44:29,823	| serial-s02-e11 |	Hatch didn't want to talk to me but I spoke to another person who was on the mission
EDL	00:44:29,823	00:44:31,103	| serial-s02-e11 |	Do backed up hatches story
EDL	00:44:31,615	00:44:33,919	| serial-s02-e11 |	That they had information but was there
EDL	00:44:33,919	00:44:34,687	| serial-s02-e11 |	And that's why they went
EDL	00:44:35,455	00:44:37,247	| serial-s02-e11 |	It turned out but wasn't there
EDL	00:44:37,247	00:44:39,551	| serial-s02-e11 |	A lot of Taliban were killed in the fighting
EDL	00:44:39,551	00:44:42,879	| serial-s02-e11 |	Hatch was shot just above the right knee is bone was shattered
EDL	00:44:42,879	00:44:46,207	| serial-s02-e11 |	In the CNN story he talks about how he became depressed
EDL	00:44:46,207	00:44:46,975	| serial-s02-e11 |	Suicidal
EDL	00:44:48,511	00:44:50,303	| serial-s02-e11 |	One day earlier on July 8th
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:56,447	| serial-s02-e11 |	Sergeant First Class Mark Allen was with the National Guard team going door-to-door in a village Indila District
EDL	00:44:56,447	00:44:57,471	| serial-s02-e11 |	South of mass
EDL	00:44:57,471	00:45:02,335	| serial-s02-e11 |	There were a handful of Americans who happen to go along with a platoon of Afghan National army soldiers
EDL	00:45:02,847	00:45:04,127	| serial-s02-e11 |	Their Commander had offered them up
EDL	00:45:05,151	00:45:08,991	| serial-s02-e11 |	We spoke to the commander as well as one of the other guys on that mission
EDL	00:45:08,991	00:45:11,039	| serial-s02-e11 |	And they both said yeah it was clear
EDL	00:45:11,551	00:45:13,087	| serial-s02-e11 |	The mission was to look for bow
EDL	00:45:13,599	00:45:15,903	| serial-s02-e11 |	Which considering the date just a week out
EDL	00:45:15,903	00:45:16,671	| serial-s02-e11 |	It makes sense
EDL	00:45:17,439	00:45:18,463	| serial-s02-e11 |	They got attacked
EDL	00:45:18,463	00:45:21,023	| serial-s02-e11 |	One soldier his right hand was badly wounded
EDL	00:45:21,535	00:45:23,583	| serial-s02-e11 |	Emetic took shrapnel shot in the hip
EDL	00:45:24,095	00:45:25,887	| serial-s02-e11 |	Mark Allen was shot in the head
EDL	00:45:26,655	00:45:28,703	| serial-s02-e11 |	He survived but he's in a wheelchair
EDL	00:45:28,703	00:45:29,727	| serial-s02-e11 |	He can't walk or talk
EDL	00:45:30,495	00:45:31,519	| serial-s02-e11 |	He's got a wife and two kids
EDL	00:45:32,031	00:45:33,823	| serial-s02-e11 |	It's been awful for all of them
EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:34,335	| serial-s02-e11 |	Obviously
EDL	00:45:36,127	00:45:40,223	| serial-s02-e11 |	So yes during the search for Bo people were very seriously injured
EDL	00:45:40,223	00:45:43,807	| serial-s02-e11 |	In ways that permanently mess with their lives mess with their families
EDL	00:45:43,807	00:45:50,207	| serial-s02-e11 |	What are the charges against Bo is that he endanger the safety of other soldiers and rawnsley cause search and Recovery
EDL	00:45:50,207	00:45:50,719	| serial-s02-e11 |	Operations
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:52,767	| serial-s02-e11 |	Be convicted of that
EDL	00:45:52,767	00:45:53,535	| serial-s02-e11 |	He'll be punished
EDL	00:45:55,071	00:45:57,631	| serial-s02-e11 |	Punishment is very different from blame
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:45:59,423	| serial-s02-e11 |	Flame is more delicate
EDL	00:45:59,935	00:46:01,471	| serial-s02-e11 |	It comes up almost always
EDL	00:46:01,983	00:46:04,031	| serial-s02-e11 |	In my conversations about bow with
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:07,359	| serial-s02-e11 |	Soldiers commanders civilians diplomats everybody really
EDL	00:46:07,871	00:46:08,895	| serial-s02-e11 |	And it can be slippery
EDL	00:46:09,407	00:46:11,199	| serial-s02-e11 |	Pecan Lodge where it shouldn't
EDL	00:46:11,199	00:46:12,991	| serial-s02-e11 |	And it can skirt where not to stay
EDL	00:46:14,783	00:46:18,111	| serial-s02-e11 |	When I was talking to Ken wolfos former command sergeant major
EDL	00:46:18,111	00:46:22,463	| serial-s02-e11 |	Going to the list of names of men from the five-oh-first who died during that deployment
EDL	00:46:22,975	00:46:26,559	| serial-s02-e11 |	Ken was explaining no BS or not to do with bow
EDL	00:46:26,559	00:46:29,119	| serial-s02-e11 |	But he stopped short when we got to the name Kurt Curtis
EDL	00:46:29,887	00:46:32,191	| serial-s02-e11 |	Cancel that one he partly blames himself
EDL	00:46:32,703	00:46:34,751	| serial-s02-e11 |	Was a firefight in a medical clinic
EDL	00:46:34,751	00:46:38,591	| serial-s02-e11 |	They're going after a Taliban guy who committed some really brutal crimes apparently
EDL	00:46:39,359	00:46:41,663	| serial-s02-e11 |	Staff sergeant Kurt Curtis was shot and killed
EDL	00:46:42,943	00:46:45,759	| serial-s02-e11 |	Curtis was supposed to work from the base in Alaska
EDL	00:46:45,759	00:46:49,599	| serial-s02-e11 |	But Ken told him our numbers are low I need you to deploy to Afghanistan
EDL	00:46:50,367	00:46:53,695	| serial-s02-e11 |	Curtis is married he been on something like for deployments already
EDL	00:46:53,695	00:46:54,463	| serial-s02-e11 |	Where the most guys
EDL	00:46:54,975	00:46:56,255	| serial-s02-e11 |	Prasad okay
EDL	00:46:56,767	00:46:57,279	| serial-s02-e11 |	I'll do it
EDL	00:46:58,047	00:46:59,071	| serial-s02-e11 |	In late August
EDL	00:46:59,071	00:47:02,911	| serial-s02-e11 |	Curtis was on the quick reaction team that was called out to the medical clinic
EDL	00:47:02,911	00:47:04,447	| serial-s02-e11 |	And a town called star hausa
EDL	00:47:05,215	00:47:08,031	| serial-s02-e11 |	Can wolves have been to that clinic many times he toured it
EDL	00:47:08,543	00:47:10,335	| serial-s02-e11 |	He said the people in the town had a lot of pride in it
EDL	00:47:11,103	00:47:13,151	| serial-s02-e11 |	So he knew the layout better than anyone
EDL	00:47:13,919	00:47:16,735	| serial-s02-e11 |	And Ken said before Curtis and the other guys went out there
EDL	00:47:16,735	00:47:17,759	| serial-s02-e11 |	They were briefed
EDL	00:47:17,759	00:47:20,063	| serial-s02-e11 |	On how the road was where the trouble spots were
EDL	00:47:21,087	00:47:22,623	| serial-s02-e11 |	I did not tell them
EDL	00:47:23,903	00:47:25,951	| serial-s02-e11 |	And this is what haunts me to this day cuz
EDL	00:47:25,951	00:47:28,255	| serial-s02-e11 |	I just didn't think about it
EDL	00:47:30,559	00:47:32,863	| serial-s02-e11 |	There's this Clinic is two parts
EDL	00:47:33,631	00:47:37,983	| serial-s02-e11 |	What's inside a wall compound like most places in that part of the world
EDL	00:47:39,263	00:47:39,775	| serial-s02-e11 |	In
EDL	00:47:40,287	00:47:43,615	| serial-s02-e11 |	So you had, like the inpatient outpatient side
EDL	00:47:44,383	00:47:45,151	| serial-s02-e11 |	And I never
EDL	00:47:45,663	00:47:46,943	| serial-s02-e11 |	Hold these guys
EDL	00:47:47,711	00:47:50,015	| serial-s02-e11 |	That it was really two different buildings
EDL	00:47:50,783	00:47:51,551	| serial-s02-e11 |	And
EDL	00:47:53,087	00:47:55,135	| serial-s02-e11 |	Today they went in with the Afghan
EDL	00:47:55,135	00:47:55,903	| serial-s02-e11 |	Police
EDL	00:47:57,183	00:47:58,719	| serial-s02-e11 |	Give me a went to the first one
EDL	00:47:58,719	00:48:00,255	| serial-s02-e11 |	No issues
EDL	00:48:00,255	00:48:01,791	| serial-s02-e11 |	And they went in a second one
EDL	00:48:02,815	00:48:03,583	| serial-s02-e11 |	End
EDL	00:48:04,863	00:48:06,655	| serial-s02-e11 |	Church rummage
EDL	00:48:07,167	00:48:08,191	| serial-s02-e11 |	Was ambushed
EDL	00:48:08,191	00:48:09,471	| serial-s02-e11 |	When he went in that building
EDL	00:48:09,983	00:48:11,775	| serial-s02-e11 |	The second building with it along with the squad
EDL	00:48:12,543	00:48:13,311	| serial-s02-e11 |	Panda
EDL	00:48:14,335	00:48:15,871	| serial-s02-e11 |	And was killed there that day
EDL	00:48:18,431	00:48:24,319	| serial-s02-e11 |	But why would it have mattered if they had known they were two buildings like why does that part on you
EDL	00:48:24,319	00:48:26,879	| serial-s02-e11 |	Their tactical plan would have changed
EDL	00:48:28,415	00:48:30,207	| serial-s02-e11 |	And maybe Kurt wouldn't have died
EDL	00:48:30,207	00:48:30,719	| serial-s02-e11 |	Is what he saying
EDL	00:48:31,487	00:48:33,023	| serial-s02-e11 |	That's why Ken's haunted by it
EDL	00:48:33,791	00:48:35,071	| serial-s02-e11 |	And John Thurman
EDL	00:48:35,071	00:48:37,119	| serial-s02-e11 |	He feels guilt about what happened in Palau
EDL	00:48:37,631	00:48:39,679	| serial-s02-e11 |	It's hard for him to talk about the guys who got killed there
EDL	00:48:40,447	00:48:42,495	| serial-s02-e11 |	One of them Matthew Martinez
EDL	00:48:42,495	00:48:44,799	| serial-s02-e11 |	Was a radiotelephone operator like John
EDL	00:48:45,311	00:48:48,127	| serial-s02-e11 |	But that day John was the driver instead
EDL	00:48:48,127	00:48:49,407	| serial-s02-e11 |	Which means you stay in the truck
EDL	00:48:49,919	00:48:51,711	| serial-s02-e11 |	Darren Andrews their platoon leader
EDL	00:48:51,711	00:48:55,039	| serial-s02-e11 |	I called Martinez out of the truck to help when the attack happened
EDL	00:48:55,039	00:48:57,599	| serial-s02-e11 |	Because Matt was RTO that day not John
EDL	00:48:58,111	00:48:59,391	| serial-s02-e11 |	And that was just by chance
EDL	00:49:00,415	00:49:04,511	| serial-s02-e11 |	Yeah and it was actually we were drawing straws and I had drawn the longest straw on that one
EDL	00:49:05,023	00:49:09,119	| serial-s02-e11 |	Are you literally Drew star-like not metaphorically like you actually Drew straws
EDL	00:49:09,887	00:49:10,399	| serial-s02-e11 |	Oh
EDL	00:49:11,679	00:49:13,471	| serial-s02-e11 |	Yeah so that's why that one's been
EDL	00:49:13,471	00:49:13,983	| serial-s02-e11 |	Pretty hard
EDL	00:49:14,751	00:49:15,775	| serial-s02-e11 |	For really long time
EDL	00:49:17,823	00:49:22,175	| serial-s02-e11 |	John is the son of Air Force veterans who grew up in Texas and Washington State
EDL	00:49:22,687	00:49:25,759	| serial-s02-e11 |	Dance Cotillion and was a competitive figure skater as a tiger
EDL	00:49:26,527	00:49:27,807	| serial-s02-e11 |	In 2007
EDL	00:49:27,807	00:49:29,599	| serial-s02-e11 |	When he was a fresh 21 years old
EDL	00:49:29,599	00:49:31,391	| serial-s02-e11 |	If something is up to no good or anything
EDL	00:49:31,391	00:49:32,671	| serial-s02-e11 |	You're selling shoes at Nordstrom
EDL	00:49:33,183	00:49:34,975	| serial-s02-e11 |	And he learned a lot about shoes
EDL	00:49:35,487	00:49:38,047	| serial-s02-e11 |	But that was not the direction he wanted his life to take
EDL	00:49:38,047	00:49:38,815	| serial-s02-e11 |	So we join the Army
EDL	00:49:39,583	00:49:41,119	| serial-s02-e11 |	I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this
EDL	00:49:41,631	00:49:43,679	| serial-s02-e11 |	Except to remind you to remind me
EDL	00:49:44,191	00:49:48,031	| serial-s02-e11 |	That these guys who deployed to war zones are so young
EDL	00:49:48,031	00:49:49,311	| serial-s02-e11 |	And then they're traumatized
EDL	00:49:49,823	00:49:51,359	| serial-s02-e11 |	All of them pretty much
EDL	00:49:51,359	00:49:52,127	| serial-s02-e11 |	It sucks
EDL	00:49:53,919	00:49:56,223	| serial-s02-e11 |	It's not John's fault that Matt Martinez died
EDL	00:49:56,735	00:49:58,783	| serial-s02-e11 |	It's not kids fault that Kurt Curtis died
EDL	00:49:59,551	00:50:01,343	| serial-s02-e11 |	In the five-oh-first
EDL	00:50:01,855	00:50:03,391	| serial-s02-e11 |	Clay Bowen and Maurice Walker
EDL	00:50:03,903	00:50:09,535	| serial-s02-e11 |	They were doing election crap on August 18th 2009 when their vehicle ran over an ID
EDL	00:50:09,535	00:50:10,303	| serial-s02-e11 |	They were both killed
EDL	00:50:11,071	00:50:12,351	| serial-s02-e11 |	They were in an armored Humvee
EDL	00:50:12,863	00:50:14,143	| serial-s02-e11 |	Not an mrap
EDL	00:50:14,143	00:50:15,167	| serial-s02-e11 |	Which writer protected them
EDL	00:50:16,191	00:50:19,263	| serial-s02-e11 |	Who's to blame for that every time Commander
EDL	00:50:19,263	00:50:21,311	| serial-s02-e11 |	Then-defense secretary Robert Gates
EDL	00:50:21,311	00:50:22,335	| serial-s02-e11 |	President Obama
EDL	00:50:23,871	00:50:26,687	| serial-s02-e11 |	You just want to blame something or somebody
EDL	00:50:28,479	00:50:30,271	| serial-s02-e11 |	I blame the Taliban
EDL	00:50:30,783	00:50:31,807	| serial-s02-e11 |	You know
EDL	00:50:32,575	00:50:33,087	| serial-s02-e11 |	Yeah
EDL	00:50:34,367	00:50:35,903	| serial-s02-e11 |	That's Risa joglar
EDL	00:50:35,903	00:50:36,927	| serial-s02-e11 |	Claiborne's mother
EDL	00:50:39,231	00:50:41,023	| serial-s02-e11 |	When I first talked to John Thurman
EDL	00:50:41,023	00:50:42,047	| serial-s02-e11 |	Last August
EDL	00:50:42,047	00:50:44,351	| serial-s02-e11 |	He blamed for the deaths in the five-oh-first
EDL	00:50:44,863	00:50:48,447	| serial-s02-e11 |	About the time we had this conversation 5 6 months later
EDL	00:50:48,447	00:50:49,215	| serial-s02-e11 |	Kid movies off of that
EDL	00:50:49,983	00:50:51,519	| serial-s02-e11 |	Not toward Clarity exactly
EDL	00:50:52,543	00:50:53,311	| serial-s02-e11 |	And I blame
EDL	00:50:53,823	00:50:54,591	| serial-s02-e11 |	I blame
EDL	00:50:58,687	00:51:00,223	| serial-s02-e11 |	I mean you can point the blame on anybody
EDL	00:51:00,991	00:51:01,503	| serial-s02-e11 |	Sometimes I
EDL	00:51:03,039	00:51:03,551	| serial-s02-e11 |	I don't know
EDL	00:51:05,855	00:51:07,391	| serial-s02-e11 |	Sorry
EDL	00:51:07,391	00:51:08,415	| serial-s02-e11 |	Sometimes I just think
EDL	00:51:10,975	00:51:12,511	| serial-s02-e11 |	Where's one of those things that
EDL	00:51:12,511	00:51:13,535	| serial-s02-e11 |	It's hard to pin down
EDL	00:51:14,047	00:51:14,815	| serial-s02-e11 |	Who's responsible
EDL	00:51:17,887	00:51:21,471	| serial-s02-e11 |	I know and I feel like that seat that sounds like a cop-out
EDL	00:51:21,471	00:51:23,007	| serial-s02-e11 |	But now it now it's not
EDL	00:51:24,287	00:51:26,847	| serial-s02-e11 |	And I've done a ton of therapy on it and I still haven't
EDL	00:51:26,847	00:51:27,615	| serial-s02-e11 |	Yeah
EDL	00:51:27,615	00:51:28,127	| serial-s02-e11 |	I meant like
EDL	00:51:28,895	00:51:30,943	| serial-s02-e11 |	75% sense of it but
EDL	00:51:32,223	00:51:34,271	| serial-s02-e11 |	I still can't get that last 25
EDL	00:51:34,271	00:51:36,319	| serial-s02-e11 |	Cuz it's you know you start playing with variables
EDL	00:51:36,319	00:51:37,087	| serial-s02-e11 |	You know what else
EDL	00:51:37,855	00:51:39,647	| serial-s02-e11 |	And that's where you can drive yourself insane
EDL	00:51:41,439	00:51:42,975	| serial-s02-e11 |	These things happen in war
EDL	00:51:42,975	00:51:43,743	| serial-s02-e11 |	It's normal
EDL	00:51:44,767	00:51:50,399	| serial-s02-e11 |	I was talking to retired lieutenant colonel Paul Edgar former brigade-level officer who managed the search for Bo
EDL	00:51:50,399	00:51:51,935	| serial-s02-e11 |	And he said something that surprised me
EDL	00:51:52,703	00:51:55,263	| serial-s02-e11 |	He said oh is also normal in war
EDL	00:51:56,031	00:51:57,823	| serial-s02-e11 |	As a society we treat bow
EDL	00:51:59,871	00:52:03,199	| serial-s02-e11 |	Yeah it's some aberration when really he's
EDL	00:52:03,199	00:52:03,967	| serial-s02-e11 |	He is
EDL	00:52:03,967	00:52:06,015	| serial-s02-e11 |	His case is simply
EDL	00:52:06,015	00:52:07,551	| serial-s02-e11 |	A very normal parts
EDL	00:52:08,063	00:52:09,343	| serial-s02-e11 |	Of War
EDL	00:52:09,855	00:52:12,159	| serial-s02-e11 |	Paul said we signed up for Afghanistan
EDL	00:52:12,671	00:52:17,535	| serial-s02-e11 |	Not every single citizen obviously but as a country reeling from the September 11th attacks
EDL	00:52:17,535	00:52:20,863	| serial-s02-e11 |	Nobody put up too much of a fuss about going after Osama bin Laden
EDL	00:52:21,375	00:52:27,775	| serial-s02-e11 |	But when we signed up we were also signing up for all the things we tend to forget but that nevertheless attend
EDL	00:52:27,775	00:52:28,543	| serial-s02-e11 |	War
EDL	00:52:28,543	00:52:29,567	| serial-s02-e11 |	Mistakes
EDL	00:52:29,567	00:52:30,079	| serial-s02-e11 |	Accidents
EDL	00:52:30,591	00:52:33,151	| serial-s02-e11 |	People dying for a voidable or even ridiculous reasons
EDL	00:52:33,663	00:52:37,247	| serial-s02-e11 |	An Army Recruiting system that lowers its standards when it needs more bodies
EDL	00:52:37,759	00:52:39,295	| serial-s02-e11 |	20-something year olds
EDL	00:52:39,295	00:52:41,087	| serial-s02-e11 |	Who quickly become disillusioned
EDL	00:52:41,087	00:52:42,879	| serial-s02-e11 |	And do something rash or Criminal
EDL	00:52:43,903	00:52:44,671	| serial-s02-e11 |	It's all
EDL	00:52:44,671	00:52:46,207	| serial-s02-e11 |	Unfortunately normal
EDL	00:52:46,975	00:52:53,119	| serial-s02-e11 |	So there's a level of responsibility here whether it's you know whether it's Bo and his particulars or the things the back
EDL	00:52:54,655	00:52:56,703	| serial-s02-e11 |	That goes along with every single one
EDL	00:52:57,471	00:52:59,519	| serial-s02-e11 |	That we signed up for society
EDL	00:53:00,031	00:53:02,591	| serial-s02-e11 |	Going to take all of that independent
EDL	00:53:02,591	00:53:04,383	| serial-s02-e11 |	Politically and otherwise
EDL	00:53:04,895	00:53:08,223	| serial-s02-e11 |	On you know this 20 year old
EDL	00:53:09,759	00:53:10,783	| serial-s02-e11 |	Is in my opinion
EDL	00:53:12,575	00:53:13,599	| serial-s02-e11 |	Very very wrong
EDL	00:53:20,255	00:53:26,655	| serial-s02-e11 |	Movie first teamed up with Mark Bowl for the story Mark had just come to the end of his own X
EDL	00:53:26,655	00:53:28,191	| serial-s02-e11 |	Extensive reporting on bow
EDL	00:53:28,191	00:53:31,519	| serial-s02-e11 |	And I wanted to know if there was anything Mark still wondered about
EDL	00:53:31,519	00:53:33,311	| serial-s02-e11 |	Any outstanding questions he had
EDL	00:53:33,823	00:53:35,615	| serial-s02-e11 |	And he said yeah he did have one
EDL	00:53:36,127	00:53:39,455	| serial-s02-e11 |	I think the biggest question I have is what the
EDL	00:53:40,223	00:53:41,503	| serial-s02-e11 |	Appropriate
EDL	00:53:41,503	00:53:43,039	| serial-s02-e11 |	Punishment for what he did
EDL	00:53:43,807	00:53:45,599	| serial-s02-e11 |	And like how do you treat
EDL	00:53:45,599	00:53:46,623	| serial-s02-e11 |	How do you treat this
EDL	00:53:47,135	00:53:49,439	| serial-s02-e11 |	This guy who after all it was
EDL	00:53:49,951	00:53:52,511	| serial-s02-e11 |	Put through the wringer by the Taliban because he was
EDL	00:53:52,511	00:53:53,535	| serial-s02-e11 |	An American Soldier
EDL	00:53:56,351	00:53:58,143	| serial-s02-e11 |	Is there some recognition that
EDL	00:53:58,143	00:54:00,703	| serial-s02-e11 |	That he was coming from a from a place which is
EDL	00:54:01,215	00:54:02,495	| serial-s02-e11 |	Basically altruistic
EDL	00:54:03,007	00:54:05,311	| serial-s02-e11 |	Maybe self-serving to but
EDL	00:54:05,311	00:54:06,591	| serial-s02-e11 |	Certainly not
EDL	00:54:06,591	00:54:09,407	| serial-s02-e11 |	You know intending to cause harm
EDL	00:54:09,919	00:54:13,759	| serial-s02-e11 |	So I don't know I guess the question about how the country ultimately views him
EDL	00:54:14,783	00:54:17,855	| serial-s02-e11 |	Is interesting to me because it it speaks to
EDL	00:54:18,367	00:54:22,463	| serial-s02-e11 |	I think our in our capacity for forgiveness in some ways and also
EDL	00:54:23,231	00:54:23,999	| serial-s02-e11 |	The other kind of
EDL	00:54:24,511	00:54:26,815	| serial-s02-e11 |	I think the ambivalence about bow
EDL	00:54:26,815	00:54:30,143	| serial-s02-e11 |	Somewhat reflects the another larger confusion about
EDL	00:54:30,143	00:54:30,655	| serial-s02-e11 |	War
EDL	00:54:31,423	00:54:33,215	| serial-s02-e11 |	The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
EDL	00:54:33,983	00:54:38,335	| serial-s02-e11 |	Because we don't think of them like World War II the quote-unquote good War
EDL	00:54:38,335	00:54:41,151	| serial-s02-e11 |	Or like Vietnam a lot of circles a bad War
EDL	00:54:41,919	00:54:43,199	| serial-s02-e11 |	So what are these worth
EDL	00:54:43,967	00:54:46,527	| serial-s02-e11 |	Because there's just like this incredible
EDL	00:54:47,295	00:54:52,159	| serial-s02-e11 |	Like Haze over our thinking about the war on terror and because these were 16th
EDL	00:54:52,927	00:54:53,951	| serial-s02-e11 |	Biso
EDL	00:54:53,951	00:54:54,463	| serial-s02-e11 |	You know
EDL	00:54:54,975	00:54:55,743	| serial-s02-e11 |	Hard to Define
EDL	00:54:57,791	00:55:00,351	| serial-s02-e11 |	It seems like as a country we don't know what to do with this guy
EDL	00:55:01,631	00:55:05,983	| serial-s02-e11 |	A few weeks ago Zach borrow one of those between mates got in touch with us
EDL	00:55:05,983	00:55:08,287	| serial-s02-e11 |	I also interviewed Zach back in the summer
EDL	00:55:08,287	00:55:10,335	| serial-s02-e11 |	But now she wanted to say something else
EDL	00:55:11,103	00:55:13,919	| serial-s02-e11 |	He been listening to the podcast and it was bothering him
EDL	00:55:13,919	00:55:15,711	| serial-s02-e11 |	The bone might be listening to
EDL	00:55:15,711	00:55:17,759	| serial-s02-e11 |	Getting the idea that everyone was mad at him
EDL	00:55:18,271	00:55:19,551	| serial-s02-e11 |	Zach was mad at first
EDL	00:55:20,063	00:55:21,599	| serial-s02-e11 |	You said it was kinda easier to be mad
EDL	00:55:22,111	00:55:25,439	| serial-s02-e11 |	You going to any military website everyone's angry with bow
EDL	00:55:25,951	00:55:29,279	| serial-s02-e11 |	You see your friends on TV talking about all the bad stuff Bo did
EDL	00:55:29,279	00:55:30,815	| serial-s02-e11 |	Can you get it why they're mad
EDL	00:55:31,839	00:55:34,655	| serial-s02-e11 |	But after he thought it through Zack said he realized
EDL	00:55:35,679	00:55:37,215	| serial-s02-e11 |	I was not what he was mad about
EDL	00:55:37,727	00:55:40,031	| serial-s02-e11 |	I just become a kind of Repository
EDL	00:55:40,543	00:55:41,823	| serial-s02-e11 |	Maybe like we're
EDL	00:55:42,335	00:55:46,687	| serial-s02-e11 |	Holding on to all this stuff and wanting to punish this kid for stuff that
EDL	00:55:47,967	00:55:48,479	| serial-s02-e11 |	Yeah
EDL	00:55:48,991	00:55:51,551	| serial-s02-e11 |	We are all the bad situation bad stuff happens
EDL	00:55:53,343	00:55:53,855	| serial-s02-e11 |	Yes
EDL	00:55:55,903	00:55:56,927	| serial-s02-e11 |	Added to
EDL	00:55:57,695	00:56:00,767	| serial-s02-e11 |	The bad situation but I don't think maybe
EDL	00:56:02,303	00:56:03,327	| serial-s02-e11 |	As much as
EDL	00:56:03,839	00:56:05,119	| serial-s02-e11 |	People blame
EDL	00:56:05,119	00:56:05,887	| serial-s02-e11 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:56:07,679	00:56:09,471	| serial-s02-e11 |	I mean it was going to suck no matter what
EDL	00:56:10,751	00:56:12,799	| serial-s02-e11 |	I feel like he's a young guy
EDL	00:56:12,799	00:56:14,847	| serial-s02-e11 |	It was in a really stressful place
EDL	00:56:14,847	00:56:16,639	| serial-s02-e11 |	And he made a terrible mistake
EDL	00:56:17,919	00:56:18,687	| serial-s02-e11 |	And
EDL	00:56:19,967	00:56:21,247	| serial-s02-e11 |	I don't know maybe we just
EDL	00:56:22,527	00:56:25,599	| serial-s02-e11 |	For myself I guess maybe I can accept that
EDL	00:56:27,135	00:56:28,671	| serial-s02-e11 |	I can understand that
EDL	00:56:29,695	00:56:30,719	| serial-s02-e11 |	When you're young
EDL	00:56:30,719	00:56:32,767	| serial-s02-e11 |	And you're dumb obviously I didn't make that
EDL	00:56:33,279	00:56:35,071	| serial-s02-e11 |	But I can see how it happened
EDL	00:56:35,583	00:56:36,095	| serial-s02-e11 |	People
EDL	00:56:37,119	00:56:41,983	| serial-s02-e11 |	Another platoon made Austin Lanford told me he decided not to blame go anymore either
EDL	00:56:42,495	00:56:46,335	| serial-s02-e11 |	He said when he was in Afghanistan he had crazy thoughts sometimes too
EDL	00:56:46,847	00:56:48,383	| serial-s02-e11 |	He said I hated it over there
EDL	00:56:48,895	00:56:51,199	| serial-s02-e11 |	I wanted to leave extremely bad sometimes
EDL	00:56:51,711	00:56:53,247	| serial-s02-e11 |	He said that could have been me
EDL	00:56:57,599	00:56:59,135	| serial-s02-e11 |	The Army gave us some numbers
EDL	00:56:59,647	00:57:06,047	| serial-s02-e11 |	From 2001 to 2014 more than 3500 people were convicted of being a wall
EDL	00:57:06,047	00:57:07,583	| serial-s02-e11 |	980 of those
EDL	00:57:07,583	00:57:08,863	| serial-s02-e11 |	Were convicted of desertion
EDL	00:57:09,375	00:57:13,215	| serial-s02-e11 |	Most of those happened here in the US people not showing up their bases for example
EDL	00:57:13,983	00:57:16,287	| serial-s02-e11 |	But there have been cases not unlike bows
EDL	00:57:17,055	00:57:21,407	| serial-s02-e11 |	Military therapist told us about a guy who left his fob in Kandahar in 2012
EDL	00:57:21,919	00:57:23,967	| serial-s02-e11 |	Apparently trying to walk to an outpost
EDL	00:57:23,967	00:57:25,503	| serial-s02-e11 |	Rejoin his platoon
EDL	00:57:25,503	00:57:27,807	| serial-s02-e11 |	Turn the reverse of what Bo said he was planning
EDL	00:57:28,831	00:57:30,879	| serial-s02-e11 |	He was quickly picked up by asking please
EDL	00:57:30,879	00:57:32,159	| serial-s02-e11 |	Wasn't charged with anything
EDL	00:57:32,927	00:57:36,511	| serial-s02-e11 |	And in 2010 8 months after Bo disappeared
EDL	00:57:36,511	00:57:39,071	| serial-s02-e11 |	A young Soldier sneaked off fob sharana
EDL	00:57:39,071	00:57:39,839	| serial-s02-e11 |	At 3 a.m.
EDL	00:57:40,351	00:57:43,679	| serial-s02-e11 |	About 7 hours later Afghan police found him wandering around
EDL	00:57:43,679	00:57:45,215	| serial-s02-e11 |	They handed him back over to the Army
EDL	00:57:45,727	00:57:49,567	| serial-s02-e11 |	When is kid was questioned evidently he said he planned to walk to Eastern Europe
EDL	00:57:49,567	00:57:53,151	| serial-s02-e11 |	Get a sleeping bag first aid kit food and water sunscreen
EDL	00:57:53,151	00:57:58,783	| serial-s02-e11 |	An ornamental sword and ornamental battle-axe his journal and an English to Pashto translation guide
EDL	00:57:59,551	00:58:03,647	| serial-s02-e11 |	According to an army report he quote plan to make it look like you have been kidnapped on quote
EDL	00:58:04,159	00:58:05,439	| serial-s02-e11 |	Kid cut his left hand
EDL	00:58:05,439	00:58:09,791	| serial-s02-e11 |	And left a trail of blood from his bunk to the fence line of the fob then cut his way through the fence
EDL	00:58:11,583	00:58:14,911	| serial-s02-e11 |	You haven't heard of him because he didn't get kidnapped by Taliban
EDL	00:58:14,911	00:58:18,239	| serial-s02-e11 |	Because he wasn't declared us one because there was no search
EDL	00:58:18,751	00:58:22,591	| serial-s02-e11 |	You haven't heard of him because no one noticed he was even gone until the Afghan police called
EDL	00:58:23,103	00:58:27,199	| serial-s02-e11 |	You haven't heard of him because we didn't trade Five Guys out of Guantanamo Bay
EDL	00:58:27,199	00:58:27,711	| serial-s02-e11 |	To get them back
EDL	00:58:28,735	00:58:30,783	| serial-s02-e11 |	We talked to someone in this guy's command group
EDL	00:58:31,295	00:58:35,647	| serial-s02-e11 |	You told us as a group they sat down and they talked about what to do about the soldier
EDL	00:58:36,671	00:58:40,767	| serial-s02-e11 |	Which gained a lot of publicity this is very low key
EDL	00:58:40,767	00:58:43,839	| serial-s02-e11 |	Didn't make the news so there was no pressure from anybody hire
EDL	00:58:45,631	00:58:47,423	| serial-s02-e11 |	The kid wasn't charged with any crimes
EDL	00:58:47,935	00:58:49,215	| serial-s02-e11 |	The guy from the command told us
EDL	00:58:49,215	00:58:51,263	| serial-s02-e11 |	He was sent home to get the help he needed
EDL	00:58:51,775	00:58:54,591	| serial-s02-e11 |	About a year later he was medically retired from the Army
EDL	00:58:55,871	00:58:59,711	| serial-s02-e11 |	Military therapist we talked you said these soldiers who walk off
EDL	00:58:59,711	00:59:00,991	| serial-s02-e11 |	Into Afghanistan
EDL	00:59:00,991	00:59:03,039	| serial-s02-e11 |	The Army treats them as headcases
EDL	00:59:03,039	00:59:06,111	| serial-s02-e11 |	It's so dangerous you kind of have to be crazy to do it
EDL	00:59:06,111	00:59:07,135	| serial-s02-e11 |	Art suicidal
EDL	00:59:07,647	00:59:09,439	| serial-s02-e11 |	He compared them to astronauts
EDL	00:59:09,439	00:59:10,975	| serial-s02-e11 |	Taking off their helmets in space
EDL	00:59:18,399	00:59:23,263	| serial-s02-e11 |	Bose court-martial is scheduled to start in August but right now the proceedings are stayed
EDL	00:59:23,263	00:59:29,663	| serial-s02-e11 |	Because the defense in the government are fighting over this massive Trove of classified documents more than 300,000 page
EDL	00:59:29,663	00:59:30,431	| serial-s02-e11 |	Because apparently
EDL	00:59:30,431	00:59:31,711	| serial-s02-e11 |	Who knows what's in there
EDL	00:59:32,223	00:59:35,551	| serial-s02-e11 |	So it seems very unlikely to me that anything's going to start this summer
EDL	00:59:36,575	00:59:40,415	| serial-s02-e11 |	I want to recordings of Mark and there's this part where Beau explains
EDL	00:59:40,415	00:59:45,791	| serial-s02-e11 |	The most the time he was a prisoner just dealing with the day-to-day his mind felt kind of numb
EDL	00:59:46,559	00:59:48,863	| serial-s02-e11 |	But then he said there were a couple of times
EDL	00:59:48,863	00:59:49,631	| serial-s02-e11 |	Brief moments
EDL	00:59:50,143	00:59:51,935	| serial-s02-e11 |	When he got this surge
EDL	00:59:51,935	00:59:53,215	| serial-s02-e11 |	I can't breathe for a second
EDL	00:59:54,239	00:59:57,055	| serial-s02-e11 |	One of those times he said was during his first year
EDL	00:59:57,055	00:59:58,847	| serial-s02-e11 |	He was being held in a mud compound
EDL	00:59:58,847	01:00:00,383	| serial-s02-e11 |	The one where he said he made friends with
EDL	01:00:00,383	01:00:02,687	| serial-s02-e11 |	The dog and had tried to Tunnel himself out
EDL	01:00:03,199	01:00:05,247	| serial-s02-e11 |	When I managed to slip outside
EDL	01:00:05,759	01:00:06,527	| serial-s02-e11 |	Into the courtyard
EDL	01:00:07,039	01:00:07,807	| serial-s02-e11 |	And he looked up
EDL	01:00:12,927	01:00:15,999	| serial-s02-e11 |	Anything like that
EDL	01:00:34,175	01:00:36,479	| serial-s02-e11 |	Things went so far beyond me
EDL	01:00:36,991	01:00:38,015	| serial-s02-e11 |	Yeah
EDL	01:00:38,783	01:00:44,415	| serial-s02-e11 |	It is just that relief of knowing that the stupidity doesn't go any further than that
EDL	01:00:55,167	01:00:58,751	| serial-s02-e11 |	Then it's almost like you don't have to be scared
EDL	01:01:05,151	01:01:08,479	| serial-s02-e11 |	Mark still talks about occasionally not as much as he used to
EDL	01:01:08,991	01:01:12,575	| serial-s02-e11 |	Mark says there isn't much more to say until the military settles Bose case
EDL	01:01:13,855	01:01:16,927	| serial-s02-e11 |	When the Army are adversaries legally speaking
EDL	01:01:16,927	01:01:18,463	| serial-s02-e11 |	Still a soldier
EDL	01:01:19,231	01:01:20,511	| serial-s02-e11 |	As soon as he was rescued
EDL	01:01:21,023	01:01:22,559	| serial-s02-e11 |	Somewhere in a government office
EDL	01:01:22,559	01:01:25,887	| serial-s02-e11 |	Someone filled out a department of the army form for 187
