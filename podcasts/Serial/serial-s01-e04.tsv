EDL	00:00:22,528	00:00:27,904	| serial-s01-e04 |	Normal for me to leave school to go do something and then come back
EDL	00:00:32,768	00:00:39,168	| serial-s01-e04 |	This is a Global Tel Link prepaid call from
EDL	00:00:39,168	00:00:45,568	| serial-s01-e04 |	An inmate at Maryland Correctional Facility
EDL	00:00:45,568	00:00:51,968	| serial-s01-e04 |	From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago and serial one story told
EDL	00:00:51,968	00:00:53,504	| serial-s01-e04 |	Week-by-week I'm Sarah Koenig
EDL	00:00:53,504	00:00:59,904	| serial-s01-e04 |	Remember how last time I ended by saying that the detectives had other leads in the
EDL	00:00:59,904	00:01:02,720	| serial-s01-e04 |	Does case besides mr. ask the guy who found his body
EDL	00:01:03,232	00:01:05,280	| serial-s01-e04 |	But they were also starting to look at at 9
EDL	00:01:05,792	00:01:08,608	| serial-s01-e04 |	The reason we know that is because of this memo
EDL	00:01:09,120	00:01:12,704	| serial-s01-e04 |	The memo was dated 12 February 1999
EDL	00:01:12,704	00:01:16,544	| serial-s01-e04 |	Trump detective Darryl Massey to detective Greg mcgillivary
EDL	00:01:17,056	00:01:20,384	| serial-s01-e04 |	This memo he's talking about is regarding an anonymous call
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:22,432	| serial-s01-e04 |	That's detective Ritz on the witness stand at trial
EDL	00:01:22,944	00:01:27,040	| serial-s01-e04 |	He's talking about how they got this Anonymous call three days after his body was found
EDL	00:01:27,808	00:01:30,880	| serial-s01-e04 |	The call came in to detective mascia Baltimore County cop
EDL	00:01:31,392	00:01:37,536	| serial-s01-e04 |	The car must have been an accident of some kind because Massey's report described him as an Asian male 18 to 21 years old
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:41,632	| serial-s01-e04 |	So it's unclear whether Asian in this case means East Asian like
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:44,192	| serial-s01-e04 |	Korean or South Asian like Pakistani
EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:45,728	| serial-s01-e04 |	But anyway
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:48,544	| serial-s01-e04 |	Mystery caller says look at the ex-boyfriend
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:50,848	| serial-s01-e04 |	The caller for their advice with boyfriend
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:55,968	| serial-s01-e04 |	I'll take him to the the Beckham to Linkin Park on past occasions for sexual encounter
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:02:03,136	| serial-s01-e04 |	Project including the phone interview to call it further stated that the victim broke off the relationship with her boyfriend about a week before she
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:04,160	| serial-s01-e04 |	She was reported missing
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:05,952	| serial-s01-e04 |	The caller hangs up
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:10,048	| serial-s01-e04 |	Then a few minutes later the same guy calls back and says oh yeah
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:10,816	| serial-s01-e04 |	By the way
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:15,424	| serial-s01-e04 |	This time to call a remembered about a year ago the suspect informed friend of his

EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:29,760	| serial-s01-e04 |	This time the color mentions a friend of an oz
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:31,040	| serial-s01-e04 |	Vasarely
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:33,344	| serial-s01-e04 |	Actually the name of this friend is Yasir Ali
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:36,672	| serial-s01-e04 |	The color says Yasir might know something
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:39,744	| serial-s01-e04 |	Hang up again the cops can't trace the call
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:41,024	| serial-s01-e04 |	It's out of range
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:47,424	| serial-s01-e04 |	Anonymous call The Detectives

EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:09,952	| serial-s01-e04 |	Who has ever gotten to the bottom of who made this Anonymous call the cops in figure it out another term
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:12,768	| serial-s01-e04 |	He didn't figure it out figure it out 2
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:19,168	| serial-s01-e04 |	For a while I couldn't let it go because it seemed to me that whoever made this call he must be the key to the whole
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:25,312	| serial-s01-e04 |	But so far I only have gases that I can't responsibly say out loud
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:29,920	| serial-s01-e04 |	Today after the Pizza Hut tok on February 16th
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:34,528	| serial-s01-e04 |	The detectives do some paperwork that will ultimately crack the whole case open for them
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:37,600	| serial-s01-e04 |	They get a subpoena for a non cell phone records
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:39,648	| serial-s01-e04 |	The results of that sir
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:45,792	| serial-s01-e04 |	Subpoena include a list of all the calls dialed and received this phone on January 13th
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:52,192	| serial-s01-e04 |	The day he disappeared that list will become a piece of paper
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:53,984	| serial-s01-e04 |	All the thousands in this case
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:55,776	| serial-s01-e04 |	Will become their map
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,056	| serial-s01-e04 |	Snow following

EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:11,392	| serial-s01-e04 |	There are 34 calls that day
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:15,744	| serial-s01-e04 |	Obviously the first thing they have to do is figure out who all the phone numbers belong to
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:17,280	| serial-s01-e04 |	Home cell and pager numbers
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:19,839	| serial-s01-e04 |	Once they do they realize
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:20,607	| serial-s01-e04 |	Wait a minute
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:23,167	| serial-s01-e04 |	One person was called six times that day
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:25,215	| serial-s01-e04 |	Much more often than anyone else
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:29,823	| serial-s01-e04 |	The person is an 18 year old girl named Jennifer pusateri
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:31,871	| serial-s01-e04 |	Is not a friend of Adnan

EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:22,303	| serial-s01-e04 |	Because we've arrived along with the detectives
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:23,327	| serial-s01-e04 |	At the heart of the FAE
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:28,191	| serial-s01-e04 |	This interview with Jen happens on February 27th 1999
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:32,543	| serial-s01-e04 |	The day before on the 26th the cops have gone to find Jen at our house

EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:39,967	| serial-s01-e04 |	Jen is Thoroughly we doubt she says she can't right now she's busy maybe later
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:43,295	| serial-s01-e04 |	Jennifer and go CJ
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:45,087	| serial-s01-e04 |	He's at work at a video store
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:46,111	| serial-s01-e04 |	She tells J
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:47,903	| serial-s01-e04 |	The police want to talk to me what do I do
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:50,463	| serial-s01-e04 |	A trial Jen says
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:56,095	| serial-s01-e04 |	He told me to go down there and tell them what I do tell them enough to keep me out of trouble
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:57,631	| serial-s01-e04 |	And tell them to go see Jay
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:58,399	| serial-s01-e04 |	Send them his way
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:02,751	| serial-s01-e04 |	Bojangles downtown to see the cops later that night
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:04,287	| serial-s01-e04 |	And she lies to them
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:05,567	| serial-s01-e04 |	So she doesn't know anything
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:09,663	| serial-s01-e04 |	I seen the detectives notes from that interview and they're remarkably uninteresting
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:14,527	| serial-s01-e04 |	By the time she left that night Jen thought it was possible she was about to get charged
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:21,439	| serial-s01-e04 |	A trial she said the last thing detective megillah very said to her that night was quote everyone's a suspect and no one's ass

EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:28,863	| serial-s01-e04 |	She's got an attorney with her plus her mom
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:30,655	| serial-s01-e04 |	They turn on the tape recorder
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:33,727	| serial-s01-e04 |	Who what where when why
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:37,567	| serial-s01-e04 |	That's why when you said that
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:39,103	| serial-s01-e04 |	Having said that
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:40,127	| serial-s01-e04 |	A broken heart
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:43,455	| serial-s01-e04 |	Did he say anything else
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:50,367	| serial-s01-e04 |	Emotive

EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:54,719	| serial-s01-e04 |	Which of course they already knew
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:57,535	| serial-s01-e04 |	But then Jen's information gets a little muddier
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:06:59,583	| serial-s01-e04 |	Yes and where it happens
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:01,119	| serial-s01-e04 |	He told me

EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:14,655	| serial-s01-e04 |	Question to the jury about Jay
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:16,447	| serial-s01-e04 |	Think about it she said
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:19,519	| serial-s01-e04 |	Do you really believe that the defendant meaning Adan
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:25,407	| serial-s01-e04 |	Go to one of his upstanding Magnet School honor student friend or friend from the mosque to assist them with this app
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:26,943	| serial-s01-e04 |	Of course not
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:31,039	| serial-s01-e04 |	Someone who behaves a little more dangerously than those people
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,319	| serial-s01-e04 |	Can you just someone who took risks
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:35,903	| serial-s01-e04 |	The defendant hopes that you will look at Jay and say
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:37,439	| serial-s01-e04 |	I don't believe him
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:40,511	| serial-s01-e04 |	That is why the defendant chose J
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:43,839	| serial-s01-e04 |	Because if something went wrong the defendant could point the finger at J
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:49,471	| serial-s01-e04 |	This idea this is what J's more less trying to communicate to the cops
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:54,591	| serial-s01-e04 |	Ask him if you're actually not the type of guy who knows where to bury a body
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:55,871	| serial-s01-e04 |	Then why did you help
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:57,919	| serial-s01-e04 |	Why didn't you go to the police instead

EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:25,215	| serial-s01-e04 |	In my mind I don't think
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:32,127	| serial-s01-e04 |	It never crossed my mind I could be getting shot at and I wouldn't be let's call the cops

EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:39,551	| serial-s01-e04 |	So if you didn't want to go to the police yourself how about making an anonymous call then
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:43,647	| serial-s01-e04 |	You could have done it right after he shows you the body as you're leaving the Best Buy parking lot
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:45,439	| serial-s01-e04 |	You're driving off the parking lot

EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:37,920	| serial-s01-e04 |	Your involvement
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:42,528	| serial-s01-e04 |	Is beyond belief
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:46,880	| serial-s01-e04 |	Other than you being afraid of the police either he has paid you something or
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:49,952	| serial-s01-e04 |	Like I said he knows I sold drugs I mean
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:51,744	| serial-s01-e04 |	That was dumb
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:53,536	| serial-s01-e04 |	I mean
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:57,376	| serial-s01-e04 |	If you get me locked up for that I mean
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:22:02,752	| serial-s01-e04 |	I'm sure if I ratted him out for killing hey did he wouldn't hesitate to turn me over selling drugs
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:11,968	| serial-s01-e04 |	Training else that you'd like to add to this

EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:21,696	| serial-s01-e04 |	I feel bad
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:26,048	| serial-s01-e04 |	GameStop by Arrowhead
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:36,800	| serial-s01-e04 |	He says I just feel bad about it that's all I got to say
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:48,064	| serial-s01-e04 |	The cops have a struggle with j
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:49,600	| serial-s01-e04 |	The struggle with j
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:51,904	| serial-s01-e04 |	She's the biggest mystery of this whole case for me
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:56,000	| serial-s01-e04 |	The cops interview him at least four times that I know about
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:57,024	| serial-s01-e04 |	Two of those are on tape
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:23:02,912	| serial-s01-e04 |	And J also tells the story a trial not once but twice cuz the first proceeding ended in a mistrial
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:04,960	| serial-s01-e04 |	So at least say six
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:06,240	| serial-s01-e04 |	She's told what happened
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:09,056	| serial-s01-e04 |	And each time some details chef
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:13,920	| serial-s01-e04 |	Some of these discrepancies seem small to me and understandable
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:16,224	| serial-s01-e04 |	But summer significant and confounding
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:21,088	| serial-s01-e04 |	And that distance between wear a certain detail starts and where it ends up
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:22,880	| serial-s01-e04 |	How far it slides
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:23,904	| serial-s01-e04 |	Wyatt slides
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:28,000	| serial-s01-e04 |	I spent Untold hours trying to measure that distance
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:28,768	| serial-s01-e04 |	Trying to weigh it
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:31,584	| serial-s01-e04 |	4 Clues as to what might actually be true
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:35,680	| serial-s01-e04 |	This is from taped interview number one
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:39,264	| serial-s01-e04 |	The cops are asking about what he in a non did that morning of the 13th
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:41,824	| serial-s01-e04 |	Picture of where you get from that
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:43,872	| serial-s01-e04 |	Are we headed towards Russia Mall
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:47,712	| serial-s01-e04 |	Shopping together
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:50,528	| serial-s01-e04 |	Interview number two
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:51,552	| serial-s01-e04 |	March 15th
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:52,320	| serial-s01-e04 |	2 weeks later
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:54,368	| serial-s01-e04 |	And where did you go
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:56,672	| serial-s01-e04 |	We went to Security Square Mall
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:23:59,488	| serial-s01-e04 |	That's a different Mall Security Square Mall
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:00,512	| serial-s01-e04 |	Couple miles away
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:04,608	| serial-s01-e04 |	I put this one in the category of probably not a big deal right
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:07,424	| serial-s01-e04 |	Maybe Jay misspoke when he said Westview initially
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:09,472	| serial-s01-e04 |	They're a bunch of little things like this
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:15,360	| serial-s01-e04 |	For example when they're driving around that afternoon after they've ditched his car at the I-70 park and ride
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:18,688	| serial-s01-e04 |	For the first trial Jay says they both got high in a duns car
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:21,504	| serial-s01-e04 |	But the second trial he says only he smoke
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:22,528	| serial-s01-e04 |	Anon didn't want to
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:25,088	| serial-s01-e04 |	Then they're more significant changes
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:28,416	| serial-s01-e04 |	But still you can chop them up to Jay trying to protect his friends
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:30,464	| serial-s01-e04 |	Or trying to protect himself
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:33,024	| serial-s01-e04 |	And the first taped interview
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:37,888	| serial-s01-e04 |	Chase's they're grabbing some food at a restaurant when officer Adcock called and not asking if he's seen hey
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:40,192	| serial-s01-e04 |	The next time he tells it
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:42,496	| serial-s01-e04 |	He says it when that call comes that a friend's apartment
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:46,336	| serial-s01-e04 |	A friend whose father happens to be a homicide detective in another County
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:51,968	| serial-s01-e04 |	Jshealth akachi actually been to her house three different times that day but didn't want to get her in trouble
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:56,832	| serial-s01-e04 |	In the first tape statement Jay says he refused to help dig a grave for her
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:25:00,160	| serial-s01-e04 |	Two weeks later he says they both got the whole
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:01,952	| serial-s01-e04 |	But then
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:02,976	| serial-s01-e04 |	There are other changes
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:04,512	| serial-s01-e04 |	Bigger changes
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:07,072	| serial-s01-e04 |	Where is harder to judge why the details chef
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:09,120	| serial-s01-e04 |	This one for instance
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:15,520	| serial-s01-e04 |	In the first taped interview Jay says Adnan only told him that same day that he was going to kill her
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:20,128	| serial-s01-e04 |	AJ says that an ion has started talking about it beforehand
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:22,432	| serial-s01-e04 |	Four or five days before
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:24,736	| serial-s01-e04 |	I think I'm going to kill her
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:26,272	| serial-s01-e04 |	He said he said that a lot
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:29,344	| serial-s01-e04 |	Conversate with him several occasions you said that
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:33,952	| serial-s01-e04 |	And he says his help with the murder on the 12th
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:35,232	| serial-s01-e04 |	Night before he disappeared
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:37,280	| serial-s01-e04 |	In this version
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:39,328	| serial-s01-e04 |	Jay tells Jen about Advance 2
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:44,192	| serial-s01-e04 |	Take us back to the first version again
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:48,544	| serial-s01-e04 |	And then you didn't really take it seriously
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:26:01,600	| serial-s01-e04 |	There's a whole side tripping on Andreas probably take that afternoon after has been killed
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:03,904	| serial-s01-e04 |	Smoke some weed in Patapsco State Park
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:07,744	| serial-s01-e04 |	That trip disappears by trial just dropped out of the narrative
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:15,168	| serial-s01-e04 |	Whereabouts in between the time he drops it on back at school at midday and when he meets back up with him later that ass
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:15,936	| serial-s01-e04 |	Afternoon
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:21,568	| serial-s01-e04 |	The stories about where he is are so messy and so confusing that I can't even keep the different versions straight
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:24,640	| serial-s01-e04 |	But none of these discrepancies
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:26,944	| serial-s01-e04 |	Gives me or I think the cops
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:28,736	| serial-s01-e04 |	As much pause as its next one
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:32,832	| serial-s01-e04 |	This is the mother of what the cops called Jay's inconsistencies
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:37,696	| serial-s01-e04 |	It's about where it done first showed him his body in the trunk of a car
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:40,256	| serial-s01-e04 |	Here's from taped interview number one
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:44,608	| serial-s01-e04 |	Jay says Adnan called them about 3:45 p.m. saying come pick me up
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:46,400	| serial-s01-e04 |	I went to pick him up
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:50,496	| serial-s01-e04 |	Orthodontist Avenue strip and yeah
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:54,336	| serial-s01-e04 |	Pop the trunk opening
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:58,432	| serial-s01-e04 |	Edmondson Avenue off of the strip
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:27:03,808	| serial-s01-e04 |	Any cross streets on Edmondson Avenue where you go meeting I don't know my name
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:08,416	| serial-s01-e04 |	A strip is a small outdoor drug Market just like a block we can buy drugs
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:10,464	| serial-s01-e04 |	Jay tells the cops
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:14,048	| serial-s01-e04 |	But it takes me about 15 or 20 minutes to get to location on Edmondson
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:19,936	| serial-s01-e04 |	Later when the cops drive out with Jay to get his car chase chosen the spot on Edmondson Avenue
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:22,752	| serial-s01-e04 |	It's just a few blocks from where they ditched his car he said
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:25,824	| serial-s01-e04 |	Listen to what he says on March 15th
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:27,872	| serial-s01-e04 |	And why
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:31,200	| serial-s01-e04 |	In route to your house if you receive a phone call from Aetna
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:34,016	| serial-s01-e04 |	Yes on his cell phone which is in your possession
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:35,296	| serial-s01-e04 |	And
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:37,856	| serial-s01-e04 |	The conversation was what
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:41,440	| serial-s01-e04 |	That picture said
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:42,208	| serial-s01-e04 |	Come and get me
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:43,744	| serial-s01-e04 |	Best Buy
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:45,792	| serial-s01-e04 |	Best Buy
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:48,096	| serial-s01-e04 |	Just like John had originally told them
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:50,656	| serial-s01-e04 |	This is a problem for the cops
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:51,168	| serial-s01-e04 |	This change
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:53,472	| serial-s01-e04 |	Because it's not something you forget
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:57,056	| serial-s01-e04 |	Where you were when you saw a dead body in the trunk of a car
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:58,336	| serial-s01-e04 |	It's not a slip of the tongue
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:01,152	| serial-s01-e04 |	But it's not clear what the calculation is
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:04,224	| serial-s01-e04 |	Edmondson Avenue versus the Best Buy parking lot
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:07,040	| serial-s01-e04 |	What's the advantage of one place over the other
EDL	00:28:07,552	00:28:08,576	| serial-s01-e04 |	Why tell this lie
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:12,160	| serial-s01-e04 |	Maybe he's just saying it because it matches Jen Story
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:15,232	| serial-s01-e04 |	Or did he lie to Jen in the first place and then forget
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:19,840	| serial-s01-e04 |	Better friend whose work for a long time in the Baltimore judicial system
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:20,864	| serial-s01-e04 |	She knows a lot of cough
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:24,192	| serial-s01-e04 |	But you reminded me when I was telling you about this case
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:27,008	| serial-s01-e04 |	Cops are the most skeptical people in the world
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:30,080	| serial-s01-e04 |	They pretty much assume everyone is lying to them all the time
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:32,896	| serial-s01-e04 |	Richard macgillivray aren't newbies
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:37,760	| serial-s01-e04 |	Mcgillvary came from a law enforcement family his father had been catching the homicide unit in fact
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:44,160	| serial-s01-e04 |	And Ritz was known in the department and in the State's Attorney's office as a skilled and meticulous investigator
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:45,952	| serial-s01-e04 |	So they're not suckers
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:49,536	| serial-s01-e04 |	They're taking careful note of the changes and Jay stories
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:51,840	| serial-s01-e04 |	That's why they keep going back to him
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:53,632	| serial-s01-e04 |	Clear up the inconsistencies
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:57,984	| serial-s01-e04 |	In a second interview confronts J
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:29:00,544	| serial-s01-e04 |	Taking off a list of the main things he lied to them about
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:02,592	| serial-s01-e04 |	Enchantments to all the lies
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:07,200	| serial-s01-e04 |	But even so what struck me is that they don't really press him on any of it
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:11,040	| serial-s01-e04 |	The most forceful mcgillvary gets is in this Exchange
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:12,576	| serial-s01-e04 |	About the location of the trunk pop
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:13,600	| serial-s01-e04 |	He
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:16,672	| serial-s01-e04 |	Actually kill her
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:18,976	| serial-s01-e04 |	Add Best Buy to my house
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:19,488	| serial-s01-e04 |	Do you know
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:22,048	| serial-s01-e04 |	You weren't present for that picture
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:23,584	| serial-s01-e04 |	Why did you lie
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:24,864	| serial-s01-e04 |	About
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:26,912	| serial-s01-e04 |	The location
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:35,872	| serial-s01-e04 |	Somebody had spotted him doing what he was doing and what have you
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:36,896	| serial-s01-e04 |	Actually
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:39,712	| serial-s01-e04 |	Sister murder
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:42,016	| serial-s01-e04 |	Why would you lie about
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:44,832	| serial-s01-e04 |	Because I'm a location
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:47,392	| serial-s01-e04 |	But you did lie
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:54,048	| serial-s01-e04 |	Chasing I figured there were security cameras at Best Buy so that's why I lied
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:55,840	| serial-s01-e04 |	Has anyone be associated with a
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:29:58,400	| serial-s01-e04 |	What is he talking about
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:30:00,448	| serial-s01-e04 |	This is nonsensical
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:03,264	| serial-s01-e04 |	What he told the Edmondson Avenue version
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:05,824	| serial-s01-e04 |	He was already deeply associated with it
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:09,408	| serial-s01-e04 |	And if there were cameras at Best Buy parking lot
EDL	00:30:09,408	00:30:10,944	| serial-s01-e04 |	When that help his story
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:15,808	| serial-s01-e04 |	They showed his car or non walking around or putting his body in the trunk
EDL	00:30:16,576	00:30:18,368	| serial-s01-e04 |	But mcgilvery let's It Go
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:19,392	| serial-s01-e04 |	Lausanne to another point
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:25,280	| serial-s01-e04 |	Just so you know as best as we can tell from workers at the store and from the former landlord
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:30,144	| serial-s01-e04 |	There probably weren't security cameras in the Best Buy parking lot back in 1999
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:32,960	| serial-s01-e04 |	There's certainly no mention of any security footage in the police report
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:43,968	| serial-s01-e04 |	At the end of both of J's tape statements the detectives come out with it
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:46,528	| serial-s01-e04 |	Are you telling us the truth right now
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:52,928	| serial-s01-e04 |	On February 28th after Jay's told them off tape that he doesn't know anything about the murder
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:56,256	| serial-s01-e04 |	Your story has completely changed since you first came in this room
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:30:59,328	| serial-s01-e04 |	All the information that you provided during the center
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:01,632	| serial-s01-e04 |	Is it been a complete route
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:06,240	| serial-s01-e04 |	And then Jay reinforces at
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:08,032	| serial-s01-e04 |	All right
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:09,824	| serial-s01-e04 |	I believe that concludes his interview
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:14,432	| serial-s01-e04 |	Remember
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:17,760	| serial-s01-e04 |	Okay
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:24,160	| serial-s01-e04 |	But of course 2 weeks later big swaths of his story of changed
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:26,720	| serial-s01-e04 |	So I asked him again and March 15th
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:28,768	| serial-s01-e04 |	Detroit
EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:29,792	| serial-s01-e04 |	Interviews if you
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:30,816	| serial-s01-e04 |	He's giving us right now
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:32,096	| serial-s01-e04 |	Is that true
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:37,984	| serial-s01-e04 |	To the best that I can possibly human being at this point in time member that is true
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:40,032	| serial-s01-e04 |	Did you
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:42,080	| serial-s01-e04 |	Kill
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:42,848	| serial-s01-e04 |	Palin
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:46,176	| serial-s01-e04 |	Were You There When Adnan still there
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:59,232	| serial-s01-e04 |	I put it to Bill Ritz when I talked to him briefly on the phone
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:05,632	| serial-s01-e04 |	A story kept changing catching inconsistencies and he was having to explain them and clean up a store
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:06,144	| serial-s01-e04 |	Dory
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:08,704	| serial-s01-e04 |	Ultimately
EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:16,128	| serial-s01-e04 |	Chris said they believed a story because quote we were able to investigate and corroborate what he was saying I'm quote
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:18,688	| serial-s01-e04 |	So how exactly did they corroborate it
