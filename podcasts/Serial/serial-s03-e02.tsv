EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:36,160	| serial-s03-e02 |	The upshot
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:38,976	| serial-s03-e02 |	In a courthouse where the majority of the defendants
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:39,744	| serial-s03-e02 |	What is black
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:41,792	| serial-s03-e02 |	Out of the 34 felony judges
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:43,072	| serial-s03-e02 |	32r White
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:44,864	| serial-s03-e02 |	Two are
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:54,848	| serial-s03-e02 |	Early on in my reporting here I was on the 19th floor of the Justice Center
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:59,456	| serial-s03-e02 |	And I wandered into the courtroom of Judge Daniel Gaul just in time to hear him sentencing someone
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:01,248	| serial-s03-e02 |	Think was 4 years ago I was about to get
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:03,808	| serial-s03-e02 |	I didn't record it but I took notes
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:07,136	| serial-s03-e02 |	You're pathetic the judge will say you're pathetic dude
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:12,000	| serial-s03-e02 |	My father had a saying I shouldn't say this in court but I'm going to say it you're a b******* artist
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:15,328	| serial-s03-e02 |	Your criminal and a liar and have used the system all your life
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:19,680	| serial-s03-e02 |	Send the b******* artist says to judge golf a liar a cheater
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:21,728	| serial-s03-e02 |	That's not what I built my life on
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:26,848	| serial-s03-e02 |	Don't come in here and make these pretty speeches just call says you've got what's called a mortal character flaw
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:27,872	| serial-s03-e02 |	A man says
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:29,152	| serial-s03-e02 |	I'm not going to let you down
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:33,248	| serial-s03-e02 |	I left the courtroom a little wigged-out
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:39,648	| serial-s03-e02 |	I've never heard of Judge talk to a defendant quite like that raw and brutal and confusingly in
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:46,048	| serial-s03-e02 |	As if these two men were locked in a personal argument rather than a legal one the man up on the bench Titan
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:48,352	| serial-s03-e02 |	And small acting the enrage parents
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:51,424	| serial-s03-e02 |	The other chin-up but shamed trying to mollify
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:59,104	| serial-s03-e02 |	A judge's job here when it comes to sentencing is broadly speaking to punish the offender and protect the pub
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:04,992	| serial-s03-e02 |	Their sentencing guidelines of course spelled out in excruciating detail in the Ohio Revised Code
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:11,392	| serial-s03-e02 |	Assume the guidelines meant that sentencing with Fraley mechanical a certain kind of charge would produce a certain kind of sentence
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:16,000	| serial-s03-e02 |	Plus or minus a little Wiggly room in the margin to account for special circumstances or whatever else
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:18,559	| serial-s03-e02 |	But it's not like that
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:24,959	| serial-s03-e02 |	County judges in Ohio have a lot of leeway instead of saying a lot of discretion to interpret what punishment can
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:28,031	| serial-s03-e02 |	Consist of what danger to the public looks like
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:30,335	| serial-s03-e02 |	Leeway discretion
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:32,383	| serial-s03-e02 |	That's power by another name
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:37,503	| serial-s03-e02 |	Today's episode we're going to spend it all in one place in judge called courtroom
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:43,391	| serial-s03-e02 |	We chose Israel we is our producer manual Joe Chan died because frankly it sometimes thrilling in there
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:46,463	| serial-s03-e02 |	The shock Factor alone is worth the price of admission
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:52,351	| serial-s03-e02 |	But also because his room more than any we saw laid bare this prodigious power that judges hold
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:54,655	| serial-s03-e02 |	And the many ways they can wield that power
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:55,679	| serial-s03-e02 |	Try to get what they want
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:59,263	| serial-s03-e02 |	Emmanuel's going to tell part of today's episode

EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:13,343	| serial-s03-e02 |	But he sounds like an Englishman
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:14,111	| serial-s03-e02 |	Long story
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:15,647	| serial-s03-e02 |	Is Emmanuel

EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:24,863	| serial-s03-e02 |	I think we're going to let some record 6117 so I can say with confidence that this
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:25,631	| serial-s03-e02 |	Is a typical day

EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:42,527	| serial-s03-e02 |	Sentencing for 19 year old I'm going to call Tyrell is unusual anyway

EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:41,055	| serial-s03-e02 |	If I believe that most of the people are in here because of abuse or abandonment or neglect as a child and I do

EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:18,335	| serial-s03-e02 |	I believe it's a process
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:18,847	| serial-s03-e02 |	Decatur
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:23,199	| serial-s03-e02 |	Whittier judge calcite this statistic From the Bench several times as the months went on
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:32,671	| serial-s03-e02 |	Is one of the most transparent judges in the building his world using woven into every proceeding
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:34,975	| serial-s03-e02 |	He like the old days better

EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:53,407	| serial-s03-e02 |	All of this
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:54,431	| serial-s03-e02 |	The toll building
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:58,783	| serial-s03-e02 |	The 13,000 felony cases moving through the criminal court each year
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:01,343	| serial-s03-e02 |	Boat races at a frightful shortage
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:02,623	| serial-s03-e02 |	A personal responsibility
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:14,911	| serial-s03-e02 |	Sentencing in Ohio for recent history of it is similar with evolved all over the country
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:19,519	| serial-s03-e02 |	Back in the mid-1990s when we were freaking out about Rising violent crime
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:23,103	| serial-s03-e02 |	Ohio like many states revamp its sentencing laws
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:26,687	| serial-s03-e02 |	It redefined certain felonies made some punishments harsher
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:28,223	| serial-s03-e02 |	I got rid of parole for most cases
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:35,135	| serial-s03-e02 |	Animated shamelessly oversimplify for a second because the reasons why Ohio's prison population climb
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:39,999	| serial-s03-e02 |	Are complex and super interesting by the way it did climb
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:42,815	| serial-s03-e02 |	Mostly because people began serving longer sentences
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:47,423	| serial-s03-e02 |	In 1974 Ohio prisons held 10700 people
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:51,263	| serial-s03-e02 |	By 2011 they held almost 51,000 people
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:53,055	| serial-s03-e02 |	400% increase
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:54,591	| serial-s03-e02 |	That's expensive
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:56,895	| serial-s03-e02 |	More than a billion and a quarter dollars
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:57,663	| serial-s03-e02 |	Expensive
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:19:00,991	| serial-s03-e02 |	So that your 2011 Ohio again like other places
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:03,295	| serial-s03-e02 |	Swing back the other way
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:06,111	| serial-s03-e02 |	I passed new legislation aimed at unpacking the prison
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:10,719	| serial-s03-e02 |	Which has more options for diverting low-level felons to Alternative punishments
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:12,767	| serial-s03-e02 |	And broaden the opportunities
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:13,279	| serial-s03-e02 |	For probation
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:15,839	| serial-s03-e02 |	That suits judge called just
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:16,351	| serial-s03-e02 |	Spine
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:17,887	| serial-s03-e02 |	He likes probation
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:19,935	| serial-s03-e02 |	He likes lengthy probation
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:24,031	| serial-s03-e02 |	I probably put more people on probation than any other judge in this Courthouse
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:26,847	| serial-s03-e02 |	Yeah because I can always put him in prison later
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:29,151	| serial-s03-e02 |	And I keep my eye out
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:33,759	| serial-s03-e02 |	Probation gives judge Galan going control over people's lives
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:35,807	| serial-s03-e02 |	It does best hope for getting them to change
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:38,623	| serial-s03-e02 |	And I probably have at any one time
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:39,391	| serial-s03-e02 |	Anywhere between
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:40,671	| serial-s03-e02 |	I don't know
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:41,183	| serial-s03-e02 |	Kayak
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:44,255	| serial-s03-e02 |	Couple thousand people on probation
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:47,071	| serial-s03-e02 |	50% of people on probation
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:51,679	| serial-s03-e02 |	Probation what insiders call getting paper rather than time
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:53,215	| serial-s03-e02 |	Is what most defendants what
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:55,007	| serial-s03-e02 |	But probation has its own hazard
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:58,079	| serial-s03-e02 |	Probation here is actually called Community Control sanction
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:00,127	| serial-s03-e02 |	Emphasis on the control
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:05,759	| serial-s03-e02 |	What is why I have heard defendants tell judges they'd rather pay a big fine or just do some jail time and get it over with
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:07,295	| serial-s03-e02 |	Rather than be on probation
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:11,647	| serial-s03-e02 |	I'm probation you're out but you're not free you are still tethered
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:12,415	| serial-s03-e02 |	The courthouse
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:16,255	| serial-s03-e02 |	And the conditions of your release can worm their way into almost every aspect of your life
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:18,559	| serial-s03-e02 |	They can dictate who you live with
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:20,863	| serial-s03-e02 |	Where you work whether you can have a beer after
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:23,935	| serial-s03-e02 |	Whether you can go to your uncle's funeral or your niece's wedding
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:25,983	| serial-s03-e02 |	It's so easy to slip up
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:30,335	| serial-s03-e02 |	A dirty urine test and missed meeting maybe you get indicted on a new crime
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:31,871	| serial-s03-e02 |	And you're back before judge Gaul
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:35,455	| serial-s03-e02 |	That's why he's got more cases than most judges in the building
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:37,503	| serial-s03-e02 |	Because of all those probation violation
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:40,063	| serial-s03-e02 |	We watch one violation hearing
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:41,855	| serial-s03-e02 |	Four women named Vivian

EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:03,871	| serial-s03-e02 |	Got caught with a small amount of cocaine
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:10,527	| serial-s03-e02 |	Rather than convicted of the felony was called an ilc intervention in lieu of conviction
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:11,807	| serial-s03-e02 |	Work sort of like probation
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:16,159	| serial-s03-e02 |	The idea is a Vivian could do everything she supposed to her case will go away
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:18,720	| serial-s03-e02 |	The list of requirements is significant

EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:56,832	| serial-s03-e02 |	Ohio has been devastated by the opioid crisis
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:25:02,208	| serial-s03-e02 |	But research shows that programs like these are the best way we found to help people with drug problems
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:03,488	| serial-s03-e02 |	Stay out of the criminal justice
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:07,584	| serial-s03-e02 |	So Vivian's attorney asks for drug court

EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:11,680	| serial-s03-e02 |	Social workers
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:13,728	| serial-s03-e02 |	Well-regarded around here
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:16,288	| serial-s03-e02 |	They're also recommending Vivian for drug court
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:18,080	| serial-s03-e02 |	The judge called
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:19,104	| serial-s03-e02 |	Flix that idea side
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:22,944	| serial-s03-e02 |	As if drug court is going to do something different than what we've already
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:25,248	| serial-s03-e02 |	It's as if you saying I got this
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:27,296	| serial-s03-e02 |	I deal with addiction all day long
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:29,856	| serial-s03-e02 |	Vivian's just got a buckle down stay the course
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:31,904	| serial-s03-e02 |	She doesn't need drug court
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:32,672	| serial-s03-e02 |	She has me
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:36,256	| serial-s03-e02 |	Vivian's attorney doesn't push back much on this
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:39,072	| serial-s03-e02 |	Even seem to agree with judge call what difference would it make
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:40,864	| serial-s03-e02 |	One difference
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:44,448	| serial-s03-e02 |	In drug court she have one defense attorney dedicated to her case
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:46,240	| serial-s03-e02 |	Follow her progress and update the judge
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:48,544	| serial-s03-e02 |	The sky is her fifth attorney
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:52,384	| serial-s03-e02 |	Each time she has to appear before judge golf she's assigned someone new
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:56,480	| serial-s03-e02 |	First there's a public defender Linda Rico negotiated the ilc deal
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:59,040	| serial-s03-e02 |	Instead it's been assignment list attorneys
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:03,904	| serial-s03-e02 |	Is Charles Morgan than jimho slick and Aaron brockler. Presented her at 2 hearings actually
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:05,696	| serial-s03-e02 |	Today is Joseph O'Malley
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:09,280	| serial-s03-e02 |	Their goal all of them is to keep Vivian out of jail
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:11,840	| serial-s03-e02 |	Other than that they don't have much of a stake here
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:16,960	| serial-s03-e02 |	You're not thinking too hard about how she progresses with drug treatment or what would work best for her
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:19,776	| serial-s03-e02 |	They're getting paid a hundred bucks for this hearing
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:21,824	| serial-s03-e02 |	The moments over she's not their client anymore
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:26,944	| serial-s03-e02 |	Today judge call ends up putting Vivian on house arrest at her own suggestion
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:31,296	| serial-s03-e02 |	I'm sure Vivian would like this interaction with judge Gaul to be her last
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:33,088	| serial-s03-e02 |	The last she admits
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:33,600	| serial-s03-e02 |	Stream
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:36,160	| serial-s03-e02 |	A month from now she'll be indicted for theft
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:37,440	| serial-s03-e02 |	Freezing a friend's credit card
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:42,048	| serial-s03-e02 |	Set another hearing Jessica will tell Vivian she's out of control and he'll send her to jail
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:45,888	| serial-s03-e02 |	Just been 51 days there while the credit card case gets sorted out
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:48,704	| serial-s03-e02 |	She'll be guilty to a couple of first-degree misdemeanors
EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:50,752	| serial-s03-e02 |	God will tell her she's weak
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:51,520	| serial-s03-e02 |	Indulgent
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:52,288	| serial-s03-e02 |	Selfish
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:55,872	| serial-s03-e02 |	I'll tell her to quit the tears sweetheart and he'll give her a suspended jail sentence
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:58,432	| serial-s03-e02 |	More home detention plus two years probation
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:27:02,272	| serial-s03-e02 |	Now instead of three aana meetings a week she must go to for a week
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:05,344	| serial-s03-e02 |	She'll violate again
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:08,160	| serial-s03-e02 |	This time she'll beg for inpatient treatment
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:12,768	| serial-s03-e02 |	So tell Jessica her cousin died three weeks ago from an overdose and she's afraid
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:16,352	| serial-s03-e02 |	I need help I need help she'll say it seven times
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:22,752	| serial-s03-e02 |	I need to learn to get through this sickness you call it a sickness and I call it a crime he'll say will send her to jail
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:29,152	| serial-s03-e02 |	Once again she will leave her three sons who by this time are 9 years old 6 years old and 9 months old with their grass
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:32,992	| serial-s03-e02 |	Grandmother after Vivian has spent 66 days locked up
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:36,320	| serial-s03-e02 |	Her ninth assign lawyer will write to judge call asking him to let her out
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:38,624	| serial-s03-e02 |	Scala release Vivian from jail
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:41,440	| serial-s03-e02 |	I'll put her on probation for another year-and-a-half
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:44,512	| serial-s03-e02 |	Now she must attend V A N A meetings a week
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:49,120	| serial-s03-e02 |	I'll try to help Vivian least I think he is
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:51,936	| serial-s03-e02 |	But consider a drug court
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:55,008	| serial-s03-e02 |	That new stuff charge would have been rolled into her existing case
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:58,848	| serial-s03-e02 |	It would not have affected her status in drug court at all
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:28:04,992	| serial-s03-e02 |	But she been in drug court it's unlikely she would have spent even one day in the county jail much less 127.
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:12,160	| serial-s03-e02 |	What you been in drug court and if she's anything like the other drug court participants almost all of whom backslide and struggle
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:14,720	| serial-s03-e02 |	Twitter graduated from that program in about 13 months
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:19,584	| serial-s03-e02 |	As it stands she's been embroiled with judge Gaul for three and a half years and counting
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:21,632	| serial-s03-e02 |	Perkier than 5 grams of cocaine
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:32,384	| serial-s03-e02 |	This is possibly the most profound and least examined question in the building
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:33,664	| serial-s03-e02 |	What works
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:39,040	| serial-s03-e02 |	Court doesn't gather statistics on sentencing and that's true for most of the country by the way
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:45,952	| serial-s03-e02 |	No data that says defendants and Cuyahoga County do better after 6 months of probation then after 3 years of probation
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:48,000	| serial-s03-e02 |	In terms of reoffending
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:51,072	| serial-s03-e02 |	4 years in prison yields better results than 7 years in prison
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:52,608	| serial-s03-e02 |	We just don't know
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:56,704	| serial-s03-e02 |	Which I found rather astounding when I realize no one is tracking this
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:29:00,544	| serial-s03-e02 |	The court keeps extensive data regarding efficiency
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:03,616	| serial-s03-e02 |	How many cases are moving through who's dockets and how quickly
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:06,176	| serial-s03-e02 |	Which I'm not knocking efficiency it's important
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:09,248	| serial-s03-e02 |	People here are generally not waiting years and years for the KC
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:10,272	| serial-s03-e02 |	Test results and that's good
EDL	00:29:10,784	00:29:14,624	| serial-s03-e02 |	But there's no database locally or nationally that shows what works
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:18,464	| serial-s03-e02 |	To each judge in the building has to muddle it out for him or herself
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:21,536	| serial-s03-e02 |	Judge Cassandra collier-williams put it to me this way
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:24,864	| serial-s03-e02 |	There's 34 judges up here and it's like 34 different cities
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:29,472	| serial-s03-e02 |	Of course you're just here I'm just winging it mostly they're not winning it
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:32,288	| serial-s03-e02 |	They're basing their decisions on the sentencing guidelines
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:33,824	| serial-s03-e02 |	And on their professional experience
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:37,152	| serial-s03-e02 |	But they're also making decisions based on their life experience
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:41,248	| serial-s03-e02 |	And where they come from and who they know and where they live and what they read
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:42,528	| serial-s03-e02 |	And what it is they hold dear
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:45,600	| serial-s03-e02 |	Talking to various courtrooms and you feel it right away
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:47,648	| serial-s03-e02 |	Mr. cook how old are you
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:51,488	| serial-s03-e02 |	I need you to speak up just a little bit okay
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:54,304	| serial-s03-e02 |	That's Judge Collier Williams on the 23rd floor
EDL	00:29:54,304	00:29:55,328	| serial-s03-e02 |	Taking a plea
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:57,120	| serial-s03-e02 |	Case of felonious assault with a gun
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:30:02,240	| serial-s03-e02 |	He painstakingly list for Mr cook all the rights he's giving up by not going to trial
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:05,568	| serial-s03-e02 |	With gentleness she makes double sure he understands what she saying
EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:09,152	| serial-s03-e02 |	Okay so what's the total time you looking at the possibility
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:14,784	| serial-s03-e02 |	Understand
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:17,344	| serial-s03-e02 |	Okay finally she lectures him
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:24,256	| serial-s03-e02 |	Thank you I accept your plea of guilty to count three and find you guilty there on just kidding
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:25,536	| serial-s03-e02 |	No muss no fuss
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:27,840	| serial-s03-e02 |	We have seen her do this
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:31,168	| serial-s03-e02 |	You have 30 days to register to vote
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:33,728	| serial-s03-e02 |	Superbad to your probation officer
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:39,616	| serial-s03-e02 |	And now you are required to vote in elections in the reason why I do that is because people died for this right
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:43,712	| serial-s03-e02 |	Does Keller Williams wants felons to participate in democracy
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:44,480	| serial-s03-e02 |	Like everybody else

EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:09,248	| serial-s03-e02 |	What does that mean
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:10,784	| serial-s03-e02 |	What's that supposed to look like
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:11,808	| serial-s03-e02 |	It's subject
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:16,928	| serial-s03-e02 |	Some judges will say well you plead guilty so that's taking responsibility right there
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:17,696	| serial-s03-e02 |	That's enough for me
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:20,000	| serial-s03-e02 |	The girls room

EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:31,520	| serial-s03-e02 |	If you deflect responsibility
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:32,800	| serial-s03-e02 |	We're on the subject
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:34,592	| serial-s03-e02 |	The sentence could be heavier
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:39,200	| serial-s03-e02 |	The starkest example we saw this with the sentencing of a guy named Rayshawn Ellis
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:44,320	| serial-s03-e02 |	Rashawn is 31 he been a defendant in many cases ever since he was a teenager

EDL	00:37:52,256	00:37:54,304	| serial-s03-e02 |	Anyway Rayshawn caught a new case
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:57,376	| serial-s03-e02 |	Serious charges felonious assault weapons violations
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:38:04,032	| serial-s03-e02 |	Is a messy incident but the just was that a guy shot a gun out the window of Rayshon car while Rayshawn was driving
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:09,664	| serial-s03-e02 |	A fight a broken out early on Judge call me to claim he thought Rayshawn should plead guilty
EDL	00:38:10,176	00:38:16,576	| serial-s03-e02 |	Rayshawn said he wasn't the instigator of this debacle and what's more he tried to deescalate the situation to break up the fight
EDL	00:38:16,576	00:38:21,696	| serial-s03-e02 |	Fight even scared for his own life he said Rachel and took the case to trial

EDL	00:45:50,975	00:45:52,767	| serial-s03-e02 |	Try again in six months you told him
EDL	00:45:52,767	00:45:54,047	| serial-s03-e02 |	See if your attitude has changed
EDL	00:45:55,583	00:45:58,911	| serial-s03-e02 |	It was all over I talk to Rashaan about how this whole thing went down
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:01,727	| serial-s03-e02 |	He told me he still hadn't made sense of it
EDL	00:46:02,239	00:46:06,079	| serial-s03-e02 |	Just go ahead all the promised to shock him out if he did well in prison and he had done well
EDL	00:46:06,847	00:46:09,407	| serial-s03-e02 |	Six months earlier when he wrote the letter
EDL	00:46:09,407	00:46:12,479	| serial-s03-e02 |	He said it was partly sincere partly political
EDL	00:46:12,479	00:46:14,271	| serial-s03-e02 |	Annuity structured call Diego
EDL	00:46:14,783	00:46:15,807	| serial-s03-e02 |	He behaves like a king he
EDL	00:46:16,575	00:46:19,903	| serial-s03-e02 |	He wants you to do no honor him
EDL	00:46:19,903	00:46:21,695	| serial-s03-e02 |	So you can see from this picture yesterday
EDL	00:46:27,071	00:46:28,863	| serial-s03-e02 |	But at the hearing for shock release
EDL	00:46:28,863	00:46:31,423	| serial-s03-e02 |	He figured they were past the stage of flattery in theater
EDL	00:46:32,447	00:46:35,263	| serial-s03-e02 |	Who's taking a bath when judge calls started in on the details of his
EDL	00:46:35,263	00:46:35,775	| serial-s03-e02 |	Does case
EDL	00:46:36,287	00:46:37,823	| serial-s03-e02 |	Rayshawn said he kept trying to talk to
EDL	00:46:38,335	00:46:38,847	| serial-s03-e02 |	Man to man
EDL	00:46:39,615	00:46:42,431	| serial-s03-e02 |	Respect you as an individual in the position at
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:46:57,023	| serial-s03-e02 |	Vodka tonic
EDL	00:47:00,607	00:47:03,423	| serial-s03-e02 |	What you want me to tell you
EDL	00:47:04,191	00:47:08,799	| serial-s03-e02 |	Rashawn didn't feel as if judge kollra leading him down the road toward responsibility and Redemption
EDL	00:47:09,311	00:47:11,359	| serial-s03-e02 |	You felt as if dead girl simply wanted submission
EDL	00:47:11,871	00:47:12,639	| serial-s03-e02 |	Furzone sake
EDL	00:47:13,151	00:47:14,943	| serial-s03-e02 |	Rashawn surgical quotes
EDL	00:47:14,943	00:47:16,223	| serial-s03-e02 |	Struck me as nothing less
EDL	00:47:16,223	00:47:17,247	| serial-s03-e02 |	In a raging slave Mass
EDL	00:47:20,575	00:47:22,111	| serial-s03-e02 |	Such a nice way
EDL	00:47:25,183	00:47:28,255	| serial-s03-e02 |	I'm not scared of you
EDL	00:47:36,191	00:47:39,775	| serial-s03-e02 |	He wanted it this way or no way and it was just like
EDL	00:47:42,079	00:47:44,639	| serial-s03-e02 |	But it is Judge calls way or no way
EDL	00:47:45,151	00:47:47,967	| serial-s03-e02 |	That's the maddening Corkscrew operations position
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:50,783	| serial-s03-e02 |	Jungle shouldn't require him to grovel
EDL	00:47:50,783	00:47:52,063	| serial-s03-e02 |	Michelle's right about that
EDL	00:47:52,575	00:47:54,367	| serial-s03-e02 |	But there's nothing Rayshawn can do about it
EDL	00:47:54,879	00:47:56,927	| serial-s03-e02 |	Is Rayshawn is the one who broke the law
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:47:58,975	| serial-s03-e02 |	Everything judge calls doing
EDL	00:47:58,975	00:47:59,487	| serial-s03-e02 |	Is legal
EDL	00:48:06,911	00:48:08,959	| serial-s03-e02 |	What you're wondering
EDL	00:48:08,959	00:48:12,031	| serial-s03-e02 |	The judge call ever get in trouble for the way he runs his room
EDL	00:48:12,031	00:48:16,895	| serial-s03-e02 |	Is there a rain did well let me tell you about this one last case just quickly
EDL	00:48:16,895	00:48:20,479	| serial-s03-e02 |	Was back in 2015 so I wasn't there for it but I do have a transcript
EDL	00:48:20,991	00:48:23,807	| serial-s03-e02 |	A guy named Carlton heard with indicted for shooting
EDL	00:48:24,319	00:48:26,111	| serial-s03-e02 |	He said he didn't do it you want to go to trial
EDL	00:48:27,135	00:48:29,951	| serial-s03-e02 |	After being postponed a few times day of trial finally comes
EDL	00:48:30,463	00:48:32,255	| serial-s03-e02 |	Enchroma hurts attorney asks
EDL	00:48:32,255	00:48:33,279	| serial-s03-e02 |	For another continuance
EDL	00:48:33,791	00:48:36,351	| serial-s03-e02 |	Because he said Mr herd had just informed him
EDL	00:48:36,351	00:48:37,119	| serial-s03-e02 |	Half hour ago
EDL	00:48:37,631	00:48:39,423	| serial-s03-e02 |	But he's been covering up for the real shooter
EDL	00:48:39,935	00:48:41,727	| serial-s03-e02 |	So now they need more time to investigate
EDL	00:48:43,007	00:48:45,567	| serial-s03-e02 |	Judge Gaul does not take kindly to this motion to
EDL	00:48:45,567	00:48:46,335	| serial-s03-e02 |	Continue
EDL	00:48:46,335	00:48:49,407	| serial-s03-e02 |	He thinks his last-minute new evidence claim is bogus
EDL	00:48:49,407	00:48:50,943	| serial-s03-e02 |	He sure they're just trying to delay
EDL	00:48:51,455	00:48:52,479	| serial-s03-e02 |	He does what he does
EDL	00:48:52,479	00:48:54,527	| serial-s03-e02 |	Which is to excoriate Mr hard
EDL	00:48:54,527	00:48:56,319	| serial-s03-e02 |	For being black among other things
EDL	00:48:56,319	00:48:58,623	| serial-s03-e02 |	Your black life didn't matter to you did it and
EDL	00:48:58,623	00:49:02,719	| serial-s03-e02 |	Your child's going to grow up and I'm speculating now just like you did without a dad
EDL	00:49:02,719	00:49:03,743	| serial-s03-e02 |	Did you have a father
EDL	00:49:04,511	00:49:05,535	| serial-s03-e02 |	Knossos Carlton heard
EDL	00:49:06,047	00:49:07,071	| serial-s03-e02 |	No of course not
EDL	00:49:09,119	00:49:12,959	| serial-s03-e02 |	But then even by judge Gaul standards judge Gaul veers out of bounds
EDL	00:49:13,471	00:49:14,751	| serial-s03-e02 |	He says to Colin herd
EDL	00:49:14,751	00:49:16,799	| serial-s03-e02 |	You're either going to go to trial right now
EDL	00:49:16,799	00:49:17,823	| serial-s03-e02 |	Are you going to plead guilty
EDL	00:49:18,847	00:49:21,407	| serial-s03-e02 |	Current herd hadn't asked for a plea deal
EDL	00:49:21,407	00:49:22,431	| serial-s03-e02 |	The state had not offered
EDL	00:49:23,199	00:49:24,223	| serial-s03-e02 |	No matter
EDL	00:49:24,223	00:49:26,783	| serial-s03-e02 |	Judge call comes up with his own deal for cotton hurt
EDL	00:49:27,551	00:49:29,599	| serial-s03-e02 |	He says if you plead no contest
EDL	00:49:29,599	00:49:31,135	| serial-s03-e02 |	To the indictment right now
EDL	00:49:31,135	00:49:32,415	| serial-s03-e02 |	I'll sentence you to 14 years
EDL	00:49:33,439	00:49:35,999	| serial-s03-e02 |	Quote if you take the case to trial and are convicted
EDL	00:49:35,999	00:49:38,047	| serial-s03-e02 |	You will do multiples of 14 years
EDL	00:49:38,559	00:49:41,375	| serial-s03-e02 |	Because if you're convicted of these charges that's what you deserve
EDL	00:49:41,887	00:49:45,471	| serial-s03-e02 |	You deserve to spend what could be the rest of your life in the state penal Institution
EDL	00:49:46,751	00:49:47,263	| serial-s03-e02 |	What's it going to be
EDL	00:49:49,055	00:49:50,079	| serial-s03-e02 |	Colin herd says
EDL	00:49:50,079	00:49:51,103	| serial-s03-e02 |	I'll go to trial
EDL	00:49:51,103	00:49:52,383	| serial-s03-e02 |	His mom works out no
EDL	00:49:52,895	00:49:54,943	| serial-s03-e02 |	Carlton says to her listen to what he just said
EDL	00:49:55,711	00:49:57,759	| serial-s03-e02 |	14 years seems like forever to Carlton
EDL	00:49:57,759	00:49:59,551	| serial-s03-e02 |	Little daughter will be 18 when it
EDL	00:49:59,551	00:50:00,319	| serial-s03-e02 |	Got out
EDL	00:50:00,319	00:50:01,855	| serial-s03-e02 |	But his mom was hearing the other number
EDL	00:50:02,367	00:50:03,135	| serial-s03-e02 |	Multiples
EDL	00:50:03,647	00:50:05,183	| serial-s03-e02 |	14 if he's convicted at trial
EDL	00:50:05,951	00:50:07,487	| serial-s03-e02 |	They confer for bit off the Record
EDL	00:50:07,999	00:50:13,631	| serial-s03-e02 |	Ended girl tells them at length about another case he had in which he offered a couple of knuckleheads
EDL	00:50:13,631	00:50:14,399	| serial-s03-e02 |	Ideal they didn't take
EDL	00:50:15,167	00:50:19,007	| serial-s03-e02 |	I had the same conversation with them and having with you they said right there right in that chair
EDL	00:50:19,519	00:50:23,615	| serial-s03-e02 |	I told him I said look you can do 15 years or if you're convicted of all this other stuff
EDL	00:50:23,615	00:50:25,407	| serial-s03-e02 |	You're going to get consecutive time
EDL	00:50:25,407	00:50:27,967	| serial-s03-e02 |	They both got sentenced to 78 years
EDL	00:50:28,991	00:50:31,039	| serial-s03-e02 |	Just relax again weather Carlton wants to
EDL	00:50:31,039	00:50:31,807	| serial-s03-e02 |	To plead
EDL	00:50:31,807	00:50:32,831	| serial-s03-e02 |	I didn't do it
EDL	00:50:32,831	00:50:33,343	| serial-s03-e02 |	Colin herd
EDL	00:50:34,111	00:50:36,671	| serial-s03-e02 |	The girl says look you want to go to trial go to trial
EDL	00:50:37,183	00:50:42,047	| serial-s03-e02 |	You have a beautiful suit on you can sit there and maybe the jury will think you're a great guy and you're not guilty
EDL	00:50:42,047	00:50:42,815	| serial-s03-e02 |	What do you want to do
EDL	00:50:43,583	00:50:44,095	| serial-s03-e02 |	There's a pause
EDL	00:50:45,119	00:50:46,911	| serial-s03-e02 |	Alright let's bring the jury up
EDL	00:50:46,911	00:50:47,423	| serial-s03-e02 |	Circle says
EDL	00:50:48,191	00:50:49,471	| serial-s03-e02 |	The jury is on its way
EDL	00:50:49,471	00:50:51,775	| serial-s03-e02 |	They walk into this room I deal with you is off
EDL	00:50:52,799	00:50:53,567	| serial-s03-e02 |	I'll take it
EDL	00:50:53,567	00:50:54,079	| serial-s03-e02 |	Mountain heart
EDL	00:50:54,591	00:50:56,383	| serial-s03-e02 |	It was like an hour and everything
EDL	00:50:57,151	00:50:57,919	| serial-s03-e02 |	Ritz Carlton
EDL	00:50:58,431	00:51:00,223	| serial-s03-e02 |	I asked him why he said yes.
EDL	00:51:00,223	00:51:02,783	| serial-s03-e02 |	He told me his mother persuaded him they could fight it
EDL	00:51:03,295	00:51:04,063	| serial-s03-e02 |	But they could appeal
EDL	00:51:04,575	00:51:05,087	| serial-s03-e02 |	But they did
EDL	00:51:05,599	00:51:07,903	| serial-s03-e02 |	Cuz it was like what he was saying
EDL	00:51:08,415	00:51:12,767	| serial-s03-e02 |	We just know that's not nothing that a judge really could be saying he ain't going to be
EDL	00:51:13,279	00:51:14,559	| serial-s03-e02 |	Saying and doing none of that
EDL	00:51:15,583	00:51:16,863	| serial-s03-e02 |	The court of appeals agreed
EDL	00:51:17,631	00:51:22,239	| serial-s03-e02 |	I got the sense reading their decision that the justices restraining to contain their displeasure
EDL	00:51:22,239	00:51:26,591	| serial-s03-e02 |	Aplia supposed to be knowingly intelligently and voluntarily made
EDL	00:51:26,591	00:51:32,991	| serial-s03-e02 |	That's the standard the fact that judge Gaul participated in the play by itself that's not necessarily unconscious
EDL	00:51:32,991	00:51:33,759	| serial-s03-e02 |	Traditional
EDL	00:51:33,759	00:51:35,295	| serial-s03-e02 |	The way judge called today
EDL	00:51:35,295	00:51:40,159	| serial-s03-e02 |	Can caulking the flea on his own without even asking the prosecutor the defense attorney
EDL	00:51:40,159	00:51:42,207	| serial-s03-e02 |	When you add in the pressure that threats
EDL	00:51:42,207	00:51:46,815	| serial-s03-e02 |	The way he made it obvious he thought Carlton was guilty before even seeing a scrap of evidence
EDL	00:51:46,815	00:51:51,167	| serial-s03-e02 |	The only thing Carlton heard could have knowingly and intelligently concluded the court said
EDL	00:51:51,167	00:51:55,775	| serial-s03-e02 |	Was that he was unlikely to get either a fair trial or a fair sentence after trial
EDL	00:51:55,775	00:51:57,311	| serial-s03-e02 |	Hermitage Golf
EDL	00:51:57,311	00:52:00,639	| serial-s03-e02 |	Under those circumstances they said the plea was not voluntary
EDL	00:52:01,151	00:52:02,431	| serial-s03-e02 |	It was coerced
EDL	00:52:02,431	00:52:03,455	| serial-s03-e02 |	Unconstitutional
EDL	00:52:03,967	00:52:10,367	| serial-s03-e02 |	And then took the extraordinary step of ordering that Carlton hurts case be reassigned
EDL	00:52:10,367	00:52:11,391	| serial-s03-e02 |	To a different judge
EDL	00:52:11,903	00:52:16,255	| serial-s03-e02 |	Forcefulness of the court of appeals decision was remarkable
EDL	00:52:16,255	00:52:18,303	| serial-s03-e02 |	Then something more remarkable happen
EDL	00:52:18,303	00:52:21,375	| serial-s03-e02 |	This summer almost 3 years after being locked up
EDL	00:52:21,375	00:52:25,215	| serial-s03-e02 |	Carlton heard went to trial this time in front of Judge John Russo
EDL	00:52:25,983	00:52:27,775	| serial-s03-e02 |	He was acquitted of all charges
EDL	00:52:29,823	00:52:30,335	| serial-s03-e02 |	So
EDL	00:52:30,847	00:52:32,383	| serial-s03-e02 |	What is this mean for judge call
EDL	00:52:33,151	00:52:33,919	| serial-s03-e02 |	For the moment
EDL	00:52:34,431	00:52:34,943	| serial-s03-e02 |	Nothing
EDL	00:52:35,967	00:52:39,039	| serial-s03-e02 |	I asked her to go whether he felt he'd screwed up and crawling hurts case
EDL	00:52:39,551	00:52:40,319	| serial-s03-e02 |	An answer
EDL	00:52:40,319	00:52:40,831	| serial-s03-e02 |	No
EDL	00:52:41,343	00:52:42,367	| serial-s03-e02 |	To me he said
EDL	00:52:42,367	00:52:45,439	| serial-s03-e02 |	This isn't a case about an innocent man being railroaded by the system
EDL	00:52:45,951	00:52:52,095	| serial-s03-e02 |	It's a case that clearly demonstrates how defendant and his attorney manipulated the system of justice to their benefit and betta murder
EDL	00:52:53,119	00:52:53,887	| serial-s03-e02 |	Attempted murder
EDL	00:52:55,679	00:52:58,239	| serial-s03-e02 |	Today Carlton was acquitted I called judge Russo
EDL	00:52:58,239	00:53:03,871	| serial-s03-e02 |	He presided over the trial but he's also the administrative judge for the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas
EDL	00:53:03,871	00:53:07,199	| serial-s03-e02 |	He's not just ghost boss but he is the public face of
EDL	00:53:07,199	00:53:07,711	| serial-s03-e02 |	At the court
EDL	00:53:08,223	00:53:10,783	| serial-s03-e02 |	I called him on his cell right when you got home from the trial
EDL	00:53:11,551	00:53:12,575	| serial-s03-e02 |	Is there any
EDL	00:53:13,599	00:53:14,879	| serial-s03-e02 |	Consequence
EDL	00:53:14,879	00:53:16,671	| serial-s03-e02 |	For judge Gaul because of
EDL	00:53:16,671	00:53:17,183	| serial-s03-e02 |	Desk
EDL	00:53:17,951	00:53:19,487	| serial-s03-e02 |	I mean there isn't from me
EDL	00:53:20,255	00:53:22,559	| serial-s03-e02 |	So I don't know he's a colleague
EDL	00:53:22,559	00:53:23,583	| serial-s03-e02 |	Until I die
EDL	00:53:24,095	00:53:27,423	| serial-s03-e02 |	I don't reprimand or sanction him as in any way
EDL	00:53:28,191	00:53:30,751	| serial-s03-e02 |	After the verdict when Carlton heard was acquitted
EDL	00:53:30,751	00:53:32,799	| serial-s03-e02 |	Did Rousseau had apologized to him
EDL	00:53:32,799	00:53:35,103	| serial-s03-e02 |	Said coercion has no place in the system
EDL	00:53:35,103	00:53:35,615	| serial-s03-e02 |	Etc
EDL	00:53:36,127	00:53:39,199	| serial-s03-e02 |	Teresa clearly disapproved of how judge Gaul had handled the case
EDL	00:53:39,967	00:53:43,039	| serial-s03-e02 |	But now on the phone with me he was having rather me lie about that
EDL	00:53:43,807	00:53:49,183	| serial-s03-e02 |	What seems frustrating is that there isn't some automatic now review or some automatic
EDL	00:53:49,695	00:53:53,535	| serial-s03-e02 |	Yeah something vestigation something I mean
EDL	00:53:53,535	00:53:55,071	| serial-s03-e02 |	I've seen him do this and
EDL	00:53:55,071	00:53:56,095	| serial-s03-e02 |	His courtroom to other people
EDL	00:53:59,679	00:54:01,727	| serial-s03-e02 |	And if you're just doing that
EDL	00:54:01,727	00:54:03,263	| serial-s03-e02 |	Somebody needs to be later
EDL	00:54:04,287	00:54:06,335	| serial-s03-e02 |	There's a process
EDL	00:54:07,871	00:54:09,663	| serial-s03-e02 |	Whatever that's why I said says it has
EDL	00:54:09,663	00:54:10,687	| serial-s03-e02 |	By somebody
EDL	00:54:12,991	00:54:15,807	| serial-s03-e02 |	I would argue that judge Russo is a somebody
EDL	00:54:15,807	00:54:19,391	| serial-s03-e02 |	I talked to another Cuyahoga County Judge who was outraged by this case
EDL	00:54:19,391	00:54:20,415	| serial-s03-e02 |	He's a somebody
EDL	00:54:20,927	00:54:23,487	| serial-s03-e02 |	A couple of attorneys on this case whom I also spoke to
EDL	00:54:23,999	00:54:25,023	| serial-s03-e02 |	There's somebody's
EDL	00:54:25,535	00:54:29,119	| serial-s03-e02 |	The court of appeals judges who ruled in this case one of those somebody's
EDL	00:54:29,631	00:54:34,751	| serial-s03-e02 |	If any of these somebody's is afraid of reprisal from Judge Gall they can even complain anonymously
EDL	00:54:34,751	00:54:36,287	| serial-s03-e02 |	Did the Ohio Supreme Court
EDL	00:54:36,799	00:54:42,943	| serial-s03-e02 |	There's a state board on Grievances and discipline that has the authority to investigate and sanction judges just farther Madness
EDL	00:54:43,967	00:54:48,063	| serial-s03-e02 |	There goes actually been through that process once before in 2010
EDL	00:54:48,063	00:54:54,207	| serial-s03-e02 |	I won't give you the details but suffice it to say the Supreme Court Justices were appalled by what judge call had done and said in that
EDL	00:54:55,231	00:54:55,999	| serial-s03-e02 |	And then
EDL	00:54:55,999	00:54:58,303	| serial-s03-e02 |	They gave him a fairly minor reprimand
EDL	00:54:58,303	00:55:01,631	| serial-s03-e02 |	A six-month suspended suspension of his law license
EDL	00:55:01,631	00:55:03,167	| serial-s03-e02 |	Meaning he was able to stay on the bed
EDL	00:55:04,191	00:55:09,823	| serial-s03-e02 |	As of right now I've not heard that anyone has filed a complaint with the Supreme Court against judge Gaul because of hurricane
EDL	00:55:10,591	00:55:14,431	| serial-s03-e02 |	Nothing about the case has been reported in the local newspaper or on TV
EDL	00:55:14,943	00:55:16,223	| serial-s03-e02 |	No one's picketing outside
EDL	00:55:16,223	00:55:16,735	| serial-s03-e02 |	This courtroom
EDL	00:55:17,759	00:55:19,039	| serial-s03-e02 |	So just cause not to worry
EDL	00:55:19,551	00:55:21,855	| serial-s03-e02 |	He's been on the bench for 27 plus years
EDL	00:55:22,623	00:55:23,647	| serial-s03-e02 |	I take my role as per
EDL	00:55:23,647	00:55:29,023	| serial-s03-e02 |	Protecting the peace and dignity of the state of Ohio very very seriously and I wasn't elected to be stupid
EDL	00:55:30,303	00:55:33,119	| serial-s03-e02 |	He's being lied to is not going to sit back and pretend it's not happening
EDL	00:55:33,887	00:55:34,655	| serial-s03-e02 |	I wasn't
EDL	00:55:34,655	00:55:35,935	| serial-s03-e02 |	6 * to be a dumbass
EDL	00:55:38,239	00:55:41,567	| serial-s03-e02 |	As long as the voters keep voting for him then he's going to Keep On Keepin On
EDL	00:55:42,335	00:55:43,359	| serial-s03-e02 |	He's right
EDL	00:55:43,359	00:55:46,175	| serial-s03-e02 |	Yes there's the appeals court and the discipline board
EDL	00:55:46,175	00:55:50,015	| serial-s03-e02 |	But really every 6 years it's the voters who had the final say
EDL	00:55:50,527	00:55:53,087	| serial-s03-e02 |	Voters here. Everywhere
EDL	00:55:53,087	00:55:54,367	| serial-s03-e02 |	It's understood that
EDL	00:55:54,367	00:55:55,647	| serial-s03-e02 |	What are they now
EDL	00:55:56,415	00:56:01,023	| serial-s03-e02 |	For decades facing the same Irish and Italian names on the ballot almost all Democrats
EDL	00:56:01,023	00:56:03,583	| serial-s03-e02 |	What's a Russo / a Corrigan / Gallagher
EDL	00:56:04,095	00:56:05,375	| serial-s03-e02 |	I could even keep them straight
EDL	00:56:06,143	00:56:08,191	| serial-s03-e02 |	Mostly the voters are casting their ballots
EDL	00:56:08,191	00:56:11,775	| serial-s03-e02 |	And then staying far far away from the felony Courthouse
EDL	00:56:11,775	00:56:13,055	| serial-s03-e02 |	It doesn't touch that
EDL	00:56:13,055	00:56:14,335	| serial-s03-e02 |	And they don't touch it
