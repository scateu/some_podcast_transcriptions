EDL	00:00:42,752	00:00:44,032	| serial-s01-e12 |	Previously on serial
EDL	00:00:44,544	00:00:46,080	| serial-s01-e12 |	You left your cell phone in car with me
EDL	00:00:46,080	00:00:47,360	| serial-s01-e12 |	Call me call me
EDL	00:00:47,360	00:00:48,384	| serial-s01-e12 |	Hey now at this point
EDL	00:00:48,896	00:00:51,456	| serial-s01-e12 |	You know why he's leaving the car with you yes
EDL	00:00:52,224	00:00:52,992	| serial-s01-e12 |	And why is that
EDL	00:00:53,760	00:00:55,040	| serial-s01-e12 |	Hey
EDL	00:00:57,088	00:01:00,672	| serial-s01-e12 |	I just and it's going to look at this and stay all night. He must be lying
EDL	00:01:00,672	00:01:01,952	| serial-s01-e12 |	So coincidental
EDL	00:01:01,952	00:01:04,512	| serial-s01-e12 |	He told me to speak with Jay and I was like okay
EDL	00:01:04,512	00:01:07,584	| serial-s01-e12 |	Cuz they wanted to say hi so I said hi to Jay
EDL	00:01:07,584	00:01:09,632	| serial-s01-e12 |	And that's all I can barely recall
EDL	00:01:09,632	00:01:16,032	| serial-s01-e12 |	The uselessness of what we're trying to do by recreating something that doesn't fit
EDL	00:01:16,032	00:01:22,432	| serial-s01-e12 |	It's like trying to plot the coordinates of someone's dream or something
EDL	00:01:22,432	00:01:28,832	| serial-s01-e12 |	It is what it is. You don't have no control over
EDL	00:01:28,832	00:01:35,232	| serial-s01-e12 |	This is a Global Tel Link prepaid call from
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:41,376	| serial-s01-e12 |	Maryland Correctional Facility
EDL	00:01:42,912	00:01:49,312	| serial-s01-e12 |	From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago is cereal once
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:53,152	| serial-s01-e12 |	Story told week by week and this episode 12 is the final week
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:55,456	| serial-s01-e12 |	Final episode of season 1 of this podcast
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:02:00,576	| serial-s01-e12 |	It's been a year since I first contacted at 9 and I'm still talking to him regularly
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:02,624	| serial-s01-e12 |	I'm still asking him the basics
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:08,512	| serial-s01-e12 |	Still thinking I don't know that he'll remember something or maybe he'll just get so frustrated with me that he'll crack
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:11,840	| serial-s01-e12 |	I still want to know what you were doing that afternoon
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:15,424	| serial-s01-e12 |	I want to know who had your phone
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:17,984	| serial-s01-e12 |	I want to know what you were doing that afternoon
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:20,544	| serial-s01-e12 |	I don't I don't remember anything more
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:24,640	| serial-s01-e12 |	This is from Saturday night just this past Saturday
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:25,920	| serial-s01-e12 |	I mean we're down to the wire here
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:27,456	| serial-s01-e12 |	Oh man
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:32,064	| serial-s01-e12 |	We have no ending
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:37,952	| serial-s01-e12 |	Do I have an ending
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:47,936	| serial-s01-e12 |	Of course I have an ending we're going to come to an ending today
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:53,568	| serial-s01-e12 |	Plus a smattering of new information a review of old information cast under different light
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:54,848	| serial-s01-e12 |	And an ending
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:03:00,480	| serial-s01-e12 |	Even notice my thoughts about Adnan case about who is lying and why
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:02,528	| serial-s01-e12 |	Have not been fixed over the course of the story
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:07,136	| serial-s01-e12 |	Several times I have landed on a decision I've made up my mind
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:08,672	| serial-s01-e12 |	And stay there with relief
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:13,024	| serial-s01-e12 |	And then inevitably I learned something I didn't know before
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:14,048	| serial-s01-e12 |	And I'm up ended
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:16,352	| serial-s01-e12 |	Sometimes the reversal takes a few weeks
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:18,656	| serial-s01-e12 |	Sometimes it happens within hours
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:23,264	| serial-s01-e12 |	What's been astonishing to me is how the back-and-forth hasn't let up
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:24,544	| serial-s01-e12 |	After all of this time
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:28,896	| serial-s01-e12 |	Even if it is very weak and I kid you not into this very day that I'm writing this
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:32,224	| serial-s01-e12 |	Because I'm learning new information all the time
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:34,016	| serial-s01-e12 |	For instance
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:35,040	| serial-s01-e12 |	I talked to Don
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:39,648	| serial-s01-e12 |	8 months ago he told me he did not want to talk to me for the story
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,672	| serial-s01-e12 |	And then last week
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:41,952	| serial-s01-e12 |	He talked to me for the story
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:46,048	| serial-s01-e12 |	Do you want me to use tape of his voice or his last name
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:47,328	| serial-s01-e12 |	But he said I could use what he said
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:49,376	| serial-s01-e12 |	Spoiler here
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:55,008	| serial-s01-e12 |	Does not appear to know what happened to hey or why it happened to her or whether Adnan is guilty
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:58,080	| serial-s01-e12 |	It was interesting to hear what he said he remembered
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:59,872	| serial-s01-e12 |	About the day he disappeared
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:01,920	| serial-s01-e12 |	And about her and about the trial
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:03,456	| serial-s01-e12 |	Here's what he told me
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:08,064	| serial-s01-e12 |	Don said he was at his house in a town north of Baltimore City
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:10,880	| serial-s01-e12 |	On the night of January 12th the night before she went missing
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:14,720	| serial-s01-e12 |	He said she wanted to spend the whole next day with him too
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:18,303	| serial-s01-e12 |	She wanted to call Woodlawn High School and pretend to be some authority figure
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:20,351	| serial-s01-e12 |	Tell the office he couldn't be in school that day
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:23,935	| serial-s01-e12 |	She wanted it to be an excused absence rather than just playing hooky
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:25,215	| serial-s01-e12 |	But he didn't
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:27,263	| serial-s01-e12 |	He says he thought you should go to school
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:30,079	| serial-s01-e12 |	And besides he told her he had to work the next day at 9 a.m.
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:34,687	| serial-s01-e12 |	It was supposed to be his day off from the LensCrafters at the Owings Mills mall where they both worked
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:39,039	| serial-s01-e12 |	But John said he'd arranged to fill in for a friend at the store in Hunt Valley
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:43,903	| serial-s01-e12 |	John said he had made plans to meet up later that night of the 13th
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:45,951	| serial-s01-e12 |	After her work shift ended at 10 p.m.
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:50,815	| serial-s01-e12 |	When the cops recovered his car there was a note inside with Dawn's name on it
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:52,351	| serial-s01-e12 |	Hey cutie
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,631	| serial-s01-e12 |	Sorry I couldn't stay
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:56,191	| serial-s01-e12 |	I have to go to a wrestling match at Randallstown High
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:58,751	| serial-s01-e12 |	But I promise to page you as soon as I get home okay
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:01,567	| serial-s01-e12 |	Take care and drive safely
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:02,335	| serial-s01-e12 |	Always
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:02,847	| serial-s01-e12 |	Hey
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:08,223	| serial-s01-e12 |	UPS on the note he mentions a TV interview that have been taped at day
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:10,783	| serial-s01-e12 |	A local station it done as soon as Elite segment on her
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:14,367	| serial-s01-e12 |	So the note was written on the 13th the day she went missing
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:18,463	| serial-s01-e12 |	The snow was one of the reasons I'd initially written to Don way back when
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:21,535	| serial-s01-e12 |	Sorry I couldn't stay is confusing
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:24,351	| serial-s01-e12 |	I didn't understand what you plan to do with the note
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:25,887	| serial-s01-e12 |	Put it on his car maybe
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:28,191	| serial-s01-e12 |	But his car was so far away in Hunt Valley
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:31,007	| serial-s01-e12 |	But the notes dumped onto
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:33,311	| serial-s01-e12 |	He said he didn't know about it until I sent it to him
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:35,871	| serial-s01-e12 |	He didn't have a guess as to what our plan was for that afternoon
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:41,759	| serial-s01-e12 |	When he went missing Don was one of the first people the cops called
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:43,807	| serial-s01-e12 |	He said he knew immediately suspect
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:47,391	| serial-s01-e12 |	He said quote that was the first thought when they said she's missing
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:49,695	| serial-s01-e12 |	I said well okay they're going to try to blame it on me
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:52,511	| serial-s01-e12 |	Because she was with me last night I'm the new boyfriend
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:55,583	| serial-s01-e12 |	I'm obviously going to be one of the first suspect me and Anon
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:59,679	| serial-s01-e12 |	He said he immediately made sure he knew where he was
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:05,567	| serial-s01-e12 |	Have you seen this person they went missing they haven't been seen since school
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:08,895	| serial-s01-e12 |	You automatically retrace everything you did that day
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:15,295	| serial-s01-e12 |	Did I see them did I hear from them that they page me that they call me where was I at this time what was I doing at that time
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:15,807	| serial-s01-e12 |	Yeah
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:21,951	| serial-s01-e12 |	But that wasn't enough
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:24,511	| serial-s01-e12 |	State of reaction to getting called by the cops on the 13th
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:27,327	| serial-s01-e12 |	I'm tempted to make a judgment right here
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:29,631	| serial-s01-e12 |	But I'm going to pull a benefit of the doubt
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:31,935	| serial-s01-e12 |	Because Anan was 17
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:32,959	| serial-s01-e12 |	He was stoned
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:39,359	| serial-s01-e12 |	He's a different person but noted right
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:44,479	| serial-s01-e12 |	Also know there was one similarity and how they reacted to his disappearance
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:48,575	| serial-s01-e12 |	He doesn't remember calling her after the 13th
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:51,903	| serial-s01-e12 |	Guess who else doesn't remember try to call her after the 13th
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:53,183	| serial-s01-e12 |	Don
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:59,071	| serial-s01-e12 |	Like everyone else he said he wondered whether maybe she's going to California she told him her father live there
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:02,911	| serial-s01-e12 |	He says it's something he didn't think about what it happened or didn't worry
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:04,447	| serial-s01-e12 |	It's just I didn't know what to do
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:07,775	| serial-s01-e12 |	Don's Alibi was solid
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:12,383	| serial-s01-e12 |	His computer-generated timecard said he'd arrived at work at 9:02 a.m. on the 13th
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:15,199	| serial-s01-e12 |	Taking lunch from 1:10 to 1:42
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:16,479	| serial-s01-e12 |	Clocked out at 6 p.m.
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:20,575	| serial-s01-e12 |	Don's manager at the valley store with his mom
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:21,599	| serial-s01-e12 |	So that didn't look great
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:25,183	| serial-s01-e12 |	He was anxious throughout the investigation
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:27,999	| serial-s01-e12 |	Quote the never up until the day they arrested in
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:29,791	| serial-s01-e12 |	I had no idea what was going on
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:32,607	| serial-s01-e12 |	He said they never said okay you're cleared as a suspect
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:36,191	| serial-s01-e12 |	Who's left hanging and until they arrested him I had no idea
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:39,775	| serial-s01-e12 |	I suspected they might try to say that we were in on it together
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:42,335	| serial-s01-e12 |	I didn't know Jay existed until I started listening to
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:42,847	| serial-s01-e12 |	Podcast
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:49,247	| serial-s01-e12 |	According to his diary it was December 23rd
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:52,831	| serial-s01-e12 |	The snowy day and she'd had a minor car accident on the way into work

EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:36,863	| serial-s01-e12 |	Just really the typical what you would expect of the ex-boyfriend meeting the new boyfriend sizing each other up
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:40,959	| serial-s01-e12 |	We joked we spent a good 10-15 minutes talking after we checked out the car
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:48,639	| serial-s01-e12 |	A trial for whatever reason this episode is firmly time-stamped as having happened in January after hey

EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:04,511	| serial-s01-e12 |	Which made me wonder why the state even called Don
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:08,351	| serial-s01-e12 |	But according to Don prosecutor Kevin urick might have been wondering the same thing
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:09,887	| serial-s01-e12 |	Don said quotes
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:16,287	| serial-s01-e12 |	When I testified they pulled me in a back room and let me tell you how fun that was. The prosecutor afterwards yelling at me because I did

EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:18,591	| serial-s01-e12 |	He said
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:20,383	| serial-s01-e12 |	They wanted me to make him sound creepy
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:22,943	| serial-s01-e12 |	So creepy that I felt intimidated which I did not
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:28,575	| serial-s01-e12 |	He just was very personable he was funny he was everything that I already said
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:31,135	| serial-s01-e12 |	He was somebody that I would have hung out with if I knew him in school
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:36,767	| serial-s01-e12 |	Don's memory is that you're a gelded him after both the first and second trials
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:39,071	| serial-s01-e12 |	Oh he was irate done said
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:41,887	| serial-s01-e12 |	When I say yelling he was literally yelling about it at me
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:46,751	| serial-s01-e12 |	I ran this by Kevin urick but he said he was not authorized to talk about the case
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:50,591	| serial-s01-e12 |	Don says he loves her
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,615	| serial-s01-e12 |	But he still loves her
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:53,919	| serial-s01-e12 |	Is that something that goes away he said
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:58,015	| serial-s01-e12 |	Even though they only officially dated for 13 days
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:59,295	| serial-s01-e12 |	He said she meant a lot to him
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:01,599	| serial-s01-e12 |	She was totally unshy he said
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:02,623	| serial-s01-e12 |	Confident
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:07,487	| serial-s01-e12 |	She pursued him he said for all of December whenever she saw him at work
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:10,815	| serial-s01-e12 |	He said she'd ask him when he was going to take her out constantly she asked him
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:14,143	| serial-s01-e12 |	Followed him into the lunchroom on his brake tester damn
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:16,959	| serial-s01-e12 |	Using someone else at the time but then that ended
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:20,543	| serial-s01-e12 |	And so on New Year's Eve they made their first date for the next day
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:23,103	| serial-s01-e12 |	He fell for a pretty quickly says
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:25,663	| serial-s01-e12 |	Not not like this girl
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:28,223	| serial-s01-e12 |	Choose aggressive intelligent
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:30,271	| serial-s01-e12 |	Assertive is a better word than aggressive
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:31,551	| serial-s01-e12 |	Genuine nice person
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:34,623	| serial-s01-e12 |	Anything I've heard anybody say about our sins
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:38,463	| serial-s01-e12 |	It's not like I want to talk bad about the dead it's just being honest it's
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:39,999	| serial-s01-e12 |	Hard for me to explain
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:43,839	| serial-s01-e12 |	You didn't like her you didn't like her because she was so likeable
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:47,679	| serial-s01-e12 |	But then you couldn't even be annoyed because she wasn't annoying
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:51,263	| serial-s01-e12 |	Thompson hay actually change them
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:53,055	| serial-s01-e12 |	Change the way he thought about himself
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:57,407	| serial-s01-e12 |	He said he'd come off a couple of bad relationships girls who cheated on them
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:11:02,015	| serial-s01-e12 |	She basically in no uncertain terms told me to knock it off he said
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:04,063	| serial-s01-e12 |	I have worth
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:05,599	| serial-s01-e12 |	I don't remember the word she used
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:09,439	| serial-s01-e12 |	I can't paraphrase it at this point but I am worth having self-esteem
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:11,231	| serial-s01-e12 |	But I should think that I am good enough
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:12,767	| serial-s01-e12 |	And I took it to heart
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:15,071	| serial-s01-e12 |	Especially after I found out that she had died
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:30,687	| serial-s01-e12 |	I'm sorry that it's so late in the game here
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:32,479	| serial-s01-e12 |	I didn't even know that this exists
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:35,295	| serial-s01-e12 |	Yeah that's okay that's okay
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:38,367	| serial-s01-e12 |	Just heard from
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:41,695	| serial-s01-e12 |	And speaking to him all the sudden I was hearing J's perspective
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:43,999	| serial-s01-e12 |	At least this guy's perspective of Jays perspective
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:45,791	| serial-s01-e12 |	He was scared
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:48,351	| serial-s01-e12 |	I mean like terrified
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:52,191	| serial-s01-e12 |	This guy's name is Josh yesterday not use his last name
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:57,311	| serial-s01-e12 |	He said he worked with Jas Southwest video cornstore Josh's 21 at the time
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:12:02,687	| serial-s01-e12 |	They were close friends he said but Josh would give Jay rides and they smoke weed together and hang out a little bit
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:06,783	| serial-s01-e12 |	Just said that on the night table first picked up by the cops
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:10,111	| serial-s01-e12 |	So late at night on February 27th and to the morning of the 28th
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:12,415	| serial-s01-e12 |	Jay called him at home
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:15,743	| serial-s01-e12 |	And ask him to come into the store cuz he didn't want to be alone there
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:17,023	| serial-s01-e12 |	He was that scared
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:18,559	| serial-s01-e12 |	He was
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,327	| serial-s01-e12 |	I mean
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:22,143	| serial-s01-e12 |	Frightened out of his mind and not of the police
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:24,191	| serial-s01-e12 |	Like they were the
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:28,543	| serial-s01-e12 |	The secondary fear I mean he he was afraid to go in the jail but not like
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:30,591	| serial-s01-e12 |	Like he was afraid
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:38,271	| serial-s01-e12 |	Admin I guess it's how you say his name I don't know that's it
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:42,111	| serial-s01-e12 |	Josh does Jay actually never told him a nun's name
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:45,695	| serial-s01-e12 |	But Josh is listen to the podcast so he knows the name now
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:46,719	| serial-s01-e12 |	The back and you didn't
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:51,327	| serial-s01-e12 |	He says Jay told him he was afraid that people were after him
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:52,863	| serial-s01-e12 |	People connected to the murderer
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:56,191	| serial-s01-e12 |	Across the street from the video store was
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:12:59,775	| serial-s01-e12 |	Parking lot for the Amtrak commuter train
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:00,799	| serial-s01-e12 |	And
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:03,871	| serial-s01-e12 |	Parking lot was usually empty in
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:04,383	| serial-s01-e12 |	In the evening
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:08,735	| serial-s01-e12 |	Well that particular night there was a van
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:09,759	| serial-s01-e12 |	In that parking lot
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,295	| serial-s01-e12 |	Which I'm
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:13,855	| serial-s01-e12 |	Pretty positive had nobody in it but
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:15,903	| serial-s01-e12 |	Jay was afraid
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:18,207	| serial-s01-e12 |	I mean like to the female almost in tears
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:19,999	| serial-s01-e12 |	You didn't
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:21,279	| serial-s01-e12 |	Want to go outside
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:23,839	| serial-s01-e12 |	It didn't even want to look out the door
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:28,959	| serial-s01-e12 |	Because he really thought the van that was across the street was like people waiting to get it
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:32,543	| serial-s01-e12 |	But the people you're talking about
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:38,687	| serial-s01-e12 |	Like is it only in retrospect that you're that you're thinking it's like Adnan people or did he say that to you
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:41,503	| serial-s01-e12 |	He said it was
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:42,271	| serial-s01-e12 |	Today's date
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:43,551	| serial-s01-e12 |	I guess at 9
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:45,343	| serial-s01-e12 |	Threatened
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:50,463	| serial-s01-e12 |	Right but you're saying you didn't know he never told you the name of the
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:55,071	| serial-s01-e12 |	I'm just trying to imagine is it possible that it was somebody else entirely who he was
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:55,583	| serial-s01-e12 |	Afraid of
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:58,143	| serial-s01-e12 |	I guess it could have been
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:13:59,423	| serial-s01-e12 |	But I mean
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:03,263	| serial-s01-e12 |	Whoever you was afraid of his obviously the person that committed the crime
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:04,799	| serial-s01-e12 |	Right
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:06,591	| serial-s01-e12 |	So I'm saying
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:07,359	| serial-s01-e12 |	Did you
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:11,455	| serial-s01-e12 |	Did he express to you at the time that this was
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:13,247	| serial-s01-e12 |	A person with Pakistani
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:20,159	| serial-s01-e12 |	Relatives or I definitely said that it was somebody to
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:20,671	| serial-s01-e12 |	You think I was
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:22,207	| serial-s01-e12 |	Middle Eastern
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:26,303	| serial-s01-e12 |	Josh says Jay told him it was the ex-boyfriend who killed Hae
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:30,655	| serial-s01-e12 |	Was Josh's impression that Jay had called the cops himself at night
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:32,703	| serial-s01-e12 |	Because he told Josh the cops are coming to get him
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:36,031	| serial-s01-e12 |	He seemed anxious that it was taking him so long to get there
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:41,663	| serial-s01-e12 |	Ssj was pacing checking his watch they kept asking him to look outside and see if the van was still there
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:47,551	| serial-s01-e12 |	I tried J testifies that the cops showed up at the video store on their own that he didn't know they were coming
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:51,903	| serial-s01-e12 |	It is taped interview with the police that same night February 28th
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:55,487	| serial-s01-e12 |	Jay doesn't mention a white van or that he's terrified of a nun's people
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:59,839	| serial-s01-e12 |	Just tell the cops that he talked to Adnan either yesterday or the day before
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:02,911	| serial-s01-e12 |	And then turn on was threatening him in a general way

EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:57,695	| serial-s01-e12 |	Not going to happen they don't know s***
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:05,375	| serial-s01-e12 |	Drinking all said during that conversation
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:13,311	| serial-s01-e12 |	He told me that he knew somebody I mean
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:19,455	| serial-s01-e12 |	Icing involving lightly whacktivity
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:24,831	| serial-s01-e12 |	Keep on the west side
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:31,231	| serial-s01-e12 |	The gist of what he told me was that you need Westside Hitman so I mean
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:33,535	| serial-s01-e12 |	Olin College
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:34,815	| serial-s01-e12 |	You let me know
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:36,863	| serial-s01-e12 |	Around about weighted
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:38,655	| serial-s01-e12 |	What if you said something for the police that
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:40,959	| serial-s01-e12 |	Yeah cuz I told him I mean I was like
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:57,343	| serial-s01-e12 |	Okay so the Westside Hitman
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:17:01,439	| serial-s01-e12 |	It's so strange I find Josh's version of J's fear
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:04,255	| serial-s01-e12 |	How much more believable than J's version of J's fear
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:07,583	| serial-s01-e12 |	Which makes me wonder if it's all just in the delivery
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:13,727	| serial-s01-e12 |	When she first told Josh weeks before that he knew something about the missing girl who was all over the news
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:18,847	| serial-s01-e12 |	I said something about you know
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:26,527	| serial-s01-e12 |	Like him not being really involved or whatever you know and then he's like dumb and you understand I helped
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:27,551	| serial-s01-e12 |	Bury the body
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:31,391	| serial-s01-e12 |	It seemed like he was kind of bragging in
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:32,159	| serial-s01-e12 |	And I mean that
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:33,439	| serial-s01-e12 |	Kind of the guy that Jay was
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:35,743	| serial-s01-e12 |	It's not that
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:37,535	| serial-s01-e12 |	He bragged about
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:39,071	| serial-s01-e12 |	Stuff that he did it
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:40,607	| serial-s01-e12 |	Sometimes he made up things that
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:44,959	| serial-s01-e12 |	And so that's kind of what I thought he was doing
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:47,007	| serial-s01-e12 |	Now it's like why would you say that
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:47,775	| serial-s01-e12 |	Did you tell
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:50,079	| serial-s01-e12 |	Somebody that you really don't know that well
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:52,639	| serial-s01-e12 |	How do I didn't believe in
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:54,943	| serial-s01-e12 |	If I had done it I certainly wouldn't
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:56,479	| serial-s01-e12 |	Me
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:58,015	| serial-s01-e12 |	Didn't you know maybe like my best friend
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:00,063	| serial-s01-e12 |	Tonight
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:01,343	| serial-s01-e12 |	That's somebody that you
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:02,367	| serial-s01-e12 |	You work with it a p*** store
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:17,215	| serial-s01-e12 |	The virgin of the crime that Josh has Jay eventually told them it's pretty close to the version that Jay's friend Chris told me
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:17,727	| serial-s01-e12 |	2
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:21,567	| serial-s01-e12 |	That Jay was out somewhere and that Adnan came to him
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:24,895	| serial-s01-e12 |	And show them the body and said something to the effect of you got to help me
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:32,063	| serial-s01-e12 |	Josh says you can't remember where Jay said he was when this happened but he is certain the words Best Buy we're never attached to the store
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:35,135	| serial-s01-e12 |	Josh went to that Best Buy all the time
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:36,927	| serial-s01-e12 |	And he says he definitely would have remembered that
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:41,535	| serial-s01-e12 |	He said when you heard in the podcast that Chris had mentioned the pool hall thing
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:44,095	| serial-s01-e12 |	That sounded right to him but he can't say for sure
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:47,679	| serial-s01-e12 |	Josh says he also had the impression like Chris
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:51,263	| serial-s01-e12 |	Trade it all gone down later in the day not mid-afternoon
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:58,431	| serial-s01-e12 |	Cast of the first Jason afraid the cops were going to figure out he was involved through fingerprints or DNA or something
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:02,527	| serial-s01-e12 |	But this time went on he seems more and more afraid of the guy who did it
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:04,319	| serial-s01-e12 |	That he was threatening Stephanie
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:06,367	| serial-s01-e12 |	It was you better keep your mouth shut or else
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:09,183	| serial-s01-e12 |	He says J told him the threats were getting more forceful
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:13,791	| serial-s01-e12 |	The Josh J was so not the type to be involved in a murder
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:16,351	| serial-s01-e12 |	Baby tried to act tough he said but he wasn't
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:22,239	| serial-s01-e12 |	He said he himself had friends who got in serious fights or who been locked up for Grand Theft Auto
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:24,799	| serial-s01-e12 |	But Jay was not in that category at all he said
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:26,079	| serial-s01-e12 |	He's a nice guy
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:29,919	| serial-s01-e12 |	It wasn't the type of guy that you
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:32,223	| serial-s01-e12 |	Did you really got the
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:35,039	| serial-s01-e12 |	To do something real
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:37,855	| serial-s01-e12 |	He wants in the Killer
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:39,391	| serial-s01-e12 |	And he wasn't
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:40,927	| serial-s01-e12 |	A song
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:44,511	| serial-s01-e12 |	If anything he was kind of the opposite
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:47,327	| serial-s01-e12 |	Like you feel like he was
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:48,863	| serial-s01-e12 |	In way over his head
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:50,399	| serial-s01-e12 |	Yeah
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:53,471	| serial-s01-e12 |	Remember feeling bad for him
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:56,543	| serial-s01-e12 |	And it was there any point made out of meat
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:59,359	| serial-s01-e12 |	Sound energy or something but like was there any point where you like
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:02,175	| serial-s01-e12 |	Go you should go tell the cops then if you know who did this
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:02,943	| serial-s01-e12 |	Go tell the cops
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:06,015	| serial-s01-e12 |	No not really
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:10,111	| serial-s01-e12 |	I know it's probably what I should have said but I didn't really believe him
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:11,135	| serial-s01-e12 |	And
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:13,183	| serial-s01-e12 |	Like I said
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:14,463	| serial-s01-e12 |	Comes to life
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:16,767	| serial-s01-e12 |	Reputation
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:21,375	| serial-s01-e12 |	I am on the street you don't want to be the guy that's like I'll go snitch
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:25,471	| serial-s01-e12 |	You know you don't want anybody see your week and all that stuff in the cell
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:28,287	| serial-s01-e12 |	I didn't ever say go to the cops
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:29,823	| serial-s01-e12 |	I mean that would be like
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:31,871	| serial-s01-e12 |	Best thing to do
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:37,247	| serial-s01-e12 |	Justice would never quite made sense to him when he never entirely understood
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:40,063	| serial-s01-e12 |	Was YJ would help Adnan bury hay
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:42,367	| serial-s01-e12 |	Even if I didn't call the cops but definitely wouldn't
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:45,951	| serial-s01-e12 |	Rio grab a shovel and help him Dig A Grave
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:48,767	| serial-s01-e12 |	I know that's that's what
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:52,863	| serial-s01-e12 |	Part about the story is you just figure like there's something that's not computing
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:57,983	| serial-s01-e12 |	Hear it. Definitely never sounded right which is why I never believed him
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:59,007	| serial-s01-e12 |	Until the cops actually picked
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:03,615	| serial-s01-e12 |	Josh says he only remembers seeing j one more time after that
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:05,663	| serial-s01-e12 |	Play DJ came by the store to pick up his check
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:08,479	| serial-s01-e12 |	When Josh asked him so what happened
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:11,295	| serial-s01-e12 |	Josh says Jay told him he couldn't talk about it
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:20,000	| serial-s01-e12 |	In preparation for this episode
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:22,304	| serial-s01-e12 |	Julian Dana the producers of the show
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:24,352	| serial-s01-e12 |	Went back over everything we had
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:29,216	| serial-s01-e12 |	All the police files the attorney files the interviews I've done sell records
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:33,056	| serial-s01-e12 |	They did one final sweep just to be sure weed Wade everything
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:36,384	| serial-s01-e12 |	Because old details can have startling new meeting
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:38,176	| serial-s01-e12 |	After a Year's worth of research is behind us
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:41,504	| serial-s01-e12 |	They came across a couple of things they wanted me to know
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:43,296	| serial-s01-e12 |	First and foremost
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:44,064	| serial-s01-e12 |	Anisha call
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:45,856	| serial-s01-e12 |	I'd ask them
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:50,464	| serial-s01-e12 |	Is there any other viable explanation for the Nisha call uninstall record
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:51,488	| serial-s01-e12 |	Hey Julie
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:57,888	| serial-s01-e12 |	We had always been under the impression that the Nisha call was a No Way Around It call looks terrible for his looks
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:59,680	| serial-s01-e12 |	Terrible for him it's
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:00,960	| serial-s01-e12 |	2 minutes and 22 seconds
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:06,848	| serial-s01-e12 |	Remind you the musical is the one that happens at 3:32 p.m. on January 13th
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:09,920	| serial-s01-e12 |	Is that girl in 9 ad been flirting with who live near Silver Spring
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:16,832	| serial-s01-e12 |	Keyshia Cole is the one that's always stuck out to me and I think most people who've looked at in on case closely
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:23,232	| serial-s01-e12 |	Because it happens on the afternoon that hate has appeared at a time when a non has said insisted even that he were
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:24,512	| serial-s01-e12 |	Was not with his phone
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:26,560	| serial-s01-e12 |	The Jay had his phone while he was in school
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:32,448	| serial-s01-e12 |	I told the detectives that I had called some girl in Silver Spring that afternoon
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:34,240	| serial-s01-e12 |	And briefly put on the phone with her
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:37,312	| serial-s01-e12 |	That's why the call is so important
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:41,920	| serial-s01-e12 |	Not only does it put together with his phone in the middle of the afternoon
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:45,504	| serial-s01-e12 |	It puts together with j in the middle of the afternoon
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:47,040	| serial-s01-e12 |	Corroborate Jay's story
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:52,672	| serial-s01-e12 |	I've always had some suspicions about this call because Nisha said to the cops and a trial
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:55,488	| serial-s01-e12 |	But there was a day when on the phone
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:23:00,352	| serial-s01-e12 |	Benicia has consistently said it happened toward the evening at the video store where they worked
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:03,936	| serial-s01-e12 |	Jaden have the video store job on January 13th
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:06,240	| serial-s01-e12 |	He started that job at the end of the month
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:11,872	| serial-s01-e12 |	So I never bought the idea that the 13th was the day she talked to Jay
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:14,944	| serial-s01-e12 |	But even so it didn't look good for an ion
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:17,760	| serial-s01-e12 |	Because who was calling Misha in the middle of the afternoon then
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:19,040	| serial-s01-e12 |	Jaden Anisha
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:23,904	| serial-s01-e12 |	So for me this call has remained one of the pillars of the case against Adnan
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:26,720	| serial-s01-e12 |	That's what Julie means when she says no way around it
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:33,632	| serial-s01-e12 |	But now I think that you should call might be moving from the No Way Around It this looks bad for add-on column
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:34,400	| serial-s01-e12 |	Into
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:36,192	| serial-s01-e12 |	No I'm not too sure
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:41,056	| serial-s01-e12 |	Announces niches number was programmed into his cell phone
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:42,336	| serial-s01-e12 |	So he's always said to me
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:44,640	| serial-s01-e12 |	Maybe the button got pushed accidentally
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:45,664	| serial-s01-e12 |	Like a butt dial
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:47,200	| serial-s01-e12 |	And then the answering machine picked up
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:51,808	| serial-s01-e12 |	The problem with that explanation besides how convenient it sounds
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:54,368	| serial-s01-e12 |	Is it there was no answering machine on that line
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:55,904	| serial-s01-e12 |	That's what niches has a trial
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:24:02,816	| serial-s01-e12 |	This call shows up not just on the call log but on an AT&T bill he got charged for it
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:06,656	| serial-s01-e12 |	So this was our Quest or really dating Julia Quest
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:13,312	| serial-s01-e12 |	Define out is it possible this call would have shown up in an oz Bill even if it went unanswered
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:16,128	| serial-s01-e12 |	This proved so elusive
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:20,480	| serial-s01-e12 |	First we got one answered then another and another then another
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:23,040	| serial-s01-e12 |	AT&T was not helping us
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:27,904	| serial-s01-e12 |	Finally figured out exactly what they needed to answer this question
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:32,256	| serial-s01-e12 |	An AT&T customer service agreement Circa 1999
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:33,792	| serial-s01-e12 |	They found one
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:38,400	| serial-s01-e12 |	In a class action lawsuit against AT&T that included as an exhibit
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:40,192	| serial-s01-e12 |	The very document we need it
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:46,848	| serial-s01-e12 |	Luckily that class action lawsuit was filed in New York so Dana was able to go down to the
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:50,944	| serial-s01-e12 |	The old records
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:52,480	| serial-s01-e12 |	Department
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:54,272	| serial-s01-e12 |	Supreme Court
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:55,552	| serial-s01-e12 |	Or something like that yeah
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:57,856	| serial-s01-e12 |	It look like like a Mad Hatter's
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:58,880	| serial-s01-e12 |	Like the archive
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:05,792	| serial-s01-e12 |	Are you the first humanoid
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:10,144	| serial-s01-e12 |	The Dana goes down there pulls the service agreement takes pictures of
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:11,168	| serial-s01-e12 |	The contract
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:16,800	| serial-s01-e12 |	Send the first picture the first picture says on the contract that says we do not bill
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:18,336	| serial-s01-e12 |	For unanswered calls
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:22,944	| serial-s01-e12 |	The Nisha call had to have been answered
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:24,736	| serial-s01-e12 |	If it shows up on the bill
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:28,832	| serial-s01-e12 |	There was fine print to the fine print
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:33,184	| serial-s01-e12 |	And when did a flip through the contract the last page she found
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:33,952	| serial-s01-e12 |	A loophole
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:36,512	| serial-s01-e12 |	The loophole says
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:39,840	| serial-s01-e12 |	AT&T won't charge for unanswered calls
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:44,192	| serial-s01-e12 |	Unless the call isn't terminated within a quote reasonable time
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:49,824	| serial-s01-e12 |	So if you call someone and it rings and rings and don't hang up within a reasonable time
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:52,640	| serial-s01-e12 |	AT&T will charge you for that call
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:53,664	| serial-s01-e12 |	Even if it's not answered
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:57,248	| serial-s01-e12 |	So what is a reasonable amount of time
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:59,296	| serial-s01-e12 |	Or rather an unreasonable amount of time
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:04,928	| serial-s01-e12 |	That loophole actually still exist today and the unreasonable amount of time today
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:07,744	| serial-s01-e12 |	Is 30 seconds or longer they'll charge
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:12,096	| serial-s01-e12 |	We saw one contract from 99 that specified 60 seconds or longer
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:15,168	| serial-s01-e12 |	So it stands to reason that 2 minutes
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:16,704	| serial-s01-e12 |	We're probably covered
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:18,240	| serial-s01-e12 |	They probably did charge
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:25,408	| serial-s01-e12 |	The folks at AT&T told us the only reason a contract with a very back then in 99 was if the state had passport
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:27,200	| serial-s01-e12 |	Make it there legislation to address it
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:29,760	| serial-s01-e12 |	We didn't find anything in the Maryland rules about it
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:35,136	| serial-s01-e12 |	So after all this work we feel pretty confident that AT&T would have charged
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:38,720	| serial-s01-e12 |	Furcal that rang and rang for more than 2 minutes in Maryland
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:41,280	| serial-s01-e12 |	In 1999
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:43,840	| serial-s01-e12 |	So either way it's if it's 2 minutes
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:44,608	| serial-s01-e12 |	2 seconds
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:46,144	| serial-s01-e12 |	It's probably unreasonable
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:49,728	| serial-s01-e12 |	It's probably time to be listening to
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:52,544	| serial-s01-e12 |	The phone rang I got to say without
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:57,408	| serial-s01-e12 |	Trying to figure this out
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:01,504	| serial-s01-e12 |	I know that's a long and perhaps
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:03,552	| serial-s01-e12 |	Way too detailed way of explaining it
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:05,856	| serial-s01-e12 |	All this adds up to something important
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:11,488	| serial-s01-e12 |	It means the Nisha call could conceivably have been a butt dial but no one answered
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:15,328	| serial-s01-e12 |	It means there isn't only one explanation for the Nisha call
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:16,608	| serial-s01-e12 |	There alternative scenarios
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:19,168	| serial-s01-e12 |	It could be that a non called Misha
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:22,496	| serial-s01-e12 |	With somebody else to call Nisha
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:27,616	| serial-s01-e12 |	Or maybe or someone else call Nisha by accident
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:28,640	| serial-s01-e12 |	A butt dial
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:29,920	| serial-s01-e12 |	And no one was ever the wiser
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:31,456	| serial-s01-e12 |	Because no one ever picked up
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:39,392	| serial-s01-e12 |	And if there are alternative scenarios then that means the list of things we know actually definitively know
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:42,464	| serial-s01-e12 |	Facts we can show about the evidence against Adnan
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:43,744	| serial-s01-e12 |	That list
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:49,888	| serial-s01-e12 |	Just got shorter
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:54,496	| serial-s01-e12 |	The only hard evidence in the case against Adnan
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:56,800	| serial-s01-e12 |	Is his cell phone record for January 13th
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:28:00,384	| serial-s01-e12 |	That's what the cops and prosecutors used to corroborate Jay statements
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:06,528	| serial-s01-e12 |	Julie looked at that same record all over again the call log and the cell tower map
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:07,552	| serial-s01-e12 |	Teased it all apart
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:10,112	| serial-s01-e12 |	To see if they could figure out what happened
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:15,488	| serial-s01-e12 |	To figure out if there was anything else I could know about what Jay and Adnan were doing that day
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:18,560	| serial-s01-e12 |	We talked about the call out a lot already
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:22,400	| serial-s01-e12 |	We already knew it didn't match Jays explanations of where they went and when
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:29,312	| serial-s01-e12 |	But when Julie left again she realized when she tried to assign the calls some semblance of a narrative
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:31,616	| serial-s01-e12 |	Her picture of the day crumbled even more
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:35,456	| serial-s01-e12 |	Instead of answering any of her questions the call log raise the bigger ones
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:38,528	| serial-s01-e12 |	Such as was everyone lying about that day
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:43,136	| serial-s01-e12 |	My original question going into this whole Endeavor this whole story
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:43,904	| serial-s01-e12 |	Was
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:46,208	| serial-s01-e12 |	Either json or anions lying
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:48,512	| serial-s01-e12 |	But what if it's not either or
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:50,304	| serial-s01-e12 |	What if it's both
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:50,816	| serial-s01-e12 |	And
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:54,912	| serial-s01-e12 |	The college evidence is screwy right from the beginning
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:29:01,824	| serial-s01-e12 |	Jay said that when he had an unmet up that morning when a non drove over to Jay's to give him his car they done shopping at the mall
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:05,920	| serial-s01-e12 |	Various things but not that they went shopping
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:09,504	| serial-s01-e12 |	What seems most likely according to what an Untold his
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:10,784	| serial-s01-e12 |	Attorney at the time
EDL	00:29:10,784	00:29:13,088	| serial-s01-e12 |	Is it an on Hangout with Jay until about
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:15,392	| serial-s01-e12 |	12:45 1 p.m. and then went back to
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:15,904	| serial-s01-e12 |	School
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:19,744	| serial-s01-e12 |	There's a 12:07 call and a1241 call
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:23,072	| serial-s01-e12 |	The first thing that our out west in Ellicott City
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:26,912	| serial-s01-e12 |	The next exit our back East for Baltimore City
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:28,192	| serial-s01-e12 |	They're pretty far apart from each other
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:29,472	| serial-s01-e12 |	Text Julie
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:32,288	| serial-s01-e12 |	Going to Ellicott City
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:38,688	| serial-s01-e12 |	And then going into Baltimore city where the phone is pinging off of like Edmondson Avenue area which
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:39,456	| serial-s01-e12 |	Actually
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:39,968	| serial-s01-e12 |	Assertive
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:41,248	| serial-s01-e12 |	Near
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:43,552	| serial-s01-e12 |	Drug strips
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:45,856	| serial-s01-e12 |	Where his car was dumped
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:48,928	| serial-s01-e12 |	That sort of area of Baltimore
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:51,232	| serial-s01-e12 |	That's not mentioned
EDL	00:29:51,232	00:29:51,744	| serial-s01-e12 |	Buy at 9
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:58,400	| serial-s01-e12 |	So I don't remember what we did I know we didn't go shopping
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:29:59,680	| serial-s01-e12 |	I'm not really sure
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:01,728	| serial-s01-e12 |	I feel
EDL	00:30:01,728	00:30:02,496	| serial-s01-e12 |	More
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:03,520	| serial-s01-e12 |	Concerned
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:05,824	| serial-s01-e12 |	And suspicious I feel suspicious
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:07,616	| serial-s01-e12 |	Okay have being like
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:08,384	| serial-s01-e12 |	Huh
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:12,480	| serial-s01-e12 |	Cuz I can back where I can see where the phone was moving
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:15,296	| serial-s01-e12 |	I know Jay story about
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:18,112	| serial-s01-e12 |	Security Square Mall is not true
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:20,416	| serial-s01-e12 |	Because of the phone if they had the phone
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:23,488	| serial-s01-e12 |	But I don't think it done gif
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:24,000	| serial-s01-e12 |	Is true either
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:25,280	| serial-s01-e12 |	Yeah
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:27,072	| serial-s01-e12 |	End end
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:29,376	| serial-s01-e12 |	Can I also add that at
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:34,240	| serial-s01-e12 |	At one point John says to the detectives that she remembers
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:39,616	| serial-s01-e12 |	One of those phone calls she answered and talked to J&J it said that she was downtown with an on
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:44,480	| serial-s01-e12 |	The prosecutor at trial said we don't really know what they were doing
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:45,760	| serial-s01-e12 |	But it doesn't matter
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:48,320	| serial-s01-e12 |	Because he was in school at that time alive
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:49,856	| serial-s01-e12 |	And that's true
EDL	00:30:50,880	00:30:54,976	| serial-s01-e12 |	But still the phone record tells us that there's something they're not telling us
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:56,256	| serial-s01-e12 |	Why
EDL	00:30:57,024	00:30:58,816	| serial-s01-e12 |	And is it related to what happened later
EDL	00:31:00,096	00:31:04,704	| serial-s01-e12 |	The next call is the incoming 236 call the supposed Best Buy call from the phone booth
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:08,544	| serial-s01-e12 |	That were pretty solidly convinced wasn't the come and get me call
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:11,104	| serial-s01-e12 |	I do have something of an update there
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:16,992	| serial-s01-e12 |	We've not found evidence of a phone booth outside the Best Buy on the sidewalk like Jade rosin is Matt for the cops
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:20,576	| serial-s01-e12 |	Anecdotal reports
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:22,624	| serial-s01-e12 |	That there was a payphone inside the best
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:26,208	| serial-s01-e12 |	We haven't been able to verify these reports but
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:30,816	| serial-s01-e12 |	We did get a look at the 1994 architectural plans for that Best Buy
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:36,448	| serial-s01-e12 |	The plants are the teeny little rectangle on the left as you walk in
EDL	00:31:36,448	00:31:37,216	| serial-s01-e12 |	Labeled
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:37,728	| serial-s01-e12 |	Payphone
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:40,032	| serial-s01-e12 |	So maybe there was one
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:40,544	| serial-s01-e12 |	Inside
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:42,848	| serial-s01-e12 |	The call log
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:49,504	| serial-s01-e12 |	Julie spent a long time thinking about the 321 call it opened a whole new mystery for her
EDL	00:31:49,504	00:31:52,576	| serial-s01-e12 |	Because it's confusing on about three different levels
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:56,160	| serial-s01-e12 |	It's an outgoing call from a non cell
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:31:57,440	| serial-s01-e12 |	To Jen's house phone
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:32:02,048	| serial-s01-e12 |	Jay and Jen both talked about some call that afternoon that comes into her landline
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:04,608	| serial-s01-e12 |	Someone supposedly Looking for Jay
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:08,192	| serial-s01-e12 |	Jen said she remembers Jake getting phone calls while he's at our house
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:11,008	| serial-s01-e12 |	Jay says he remembers getting phone calls
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:11,776	| serial-s01-e12 |	While at the house
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:13,568	| serial-s01-e12 |	Both of them also reference
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:14,592	| serial-s01-e12 |	A landline
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:18,944	| serial-s01-e12 |	Jay says I get a call on the landline and that's when I leave
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:23,808	| serial-s01-e12 |	Meaning write this incoming landline call is Adnan calling in
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:25,088	| serial-s01-e12 |	Looking for Jay
EDL	00:32:25,088	00:32:31,232	| serial-s01-e12 |	Why would it not be calling you on the landline the whole point of him giving you the cell phone was so that he could call you on the cell phone
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:32,768	| serial-s01-e12 |	It doesn't make any sense
EDL	00:32:33,792	00:32:36,864	| serial-s01-e12 |	But there is a 321
EDL	00:32:36,864	00:32:37,376	| serial-s01-e12 |	Call
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:39,936	| serial-s01-e12 |	Made from the cell phone
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:40,960	| serial-s01-e12 |	To Jen's house
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:43,008	| serial-s01-e12 |	Here's the second confusing thing
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:47,872	| serial-s01-e12 |	Jay eventually told the cops the 321 call was a call he made
EDL	00:32:47,872	00:32:48,384	| serial-s01-e12 |	Did Jen
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:51,456	| serial-s01-e12 |	Asking if she knew whether this guy Patrick was around
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:52,992	| serial-s01-e12 |	Jay was looking for weed from Patrick
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:58,368	| serial-s01-e12 |	Jen by the way testified this never would have happened that Jay would never call her asking about Patrick
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:32:58,880	| serial-s01-e12 |	But anyway
EDL	00:32:59,392	00:33:01,184	| serial-s01-e12 |	And here's the third thing
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:02,464	| serial-s01-e12 |	The confusing kicker
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:06,304	| serial-s01-e12 |	Both Jay and Jen also say Jay was at Jen's house
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:09,376	| serial-s01-e12 |	Until about 3:45 p.m. that day
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:11,936	| serial-s01-e12 |	That also has always confused me
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:14,496	| serial-s01-e12 |	AJ is still at Jen's house until 3:45
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:16,800	| serial-s01-e12 |	How is he calling John's house at
EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:17,824	| serial-s01-e12 |	321
EDL	00:33:17,824	00:33:19,360	| serial-s01-e12 |	Why would he be calling the house that is
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:19,872	| serial-s01-e12 |	Sitting in
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:22,432	| serial-s01-e12 |	Unless Adnan has
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:24,992	| serial-s01-e12 |	Unless a dozen
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:27,040	| serial-s01-e12 |	MSU doesn't have
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:30,112	| serial-s01-e12 |	I'm not saying who has the phone right now
EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:31,136	| serial-s01-e12 |	The founder
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:35,488	| serial-s01-e12 |	But it leads me to believe that there is a possibility that Jay doesn't have it
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:36,000	| serial-s01-e12 |	Phone
EDL	00:33:37,280	00:33:39,840	| serial-s01-e12 |	So what's the evidence that Jay does have the phone
EDL	00:33:40,352	00:33:45,728	| serial-s01-e12 |	Jen tells the police that she saw Jay with the phone that afternoon she's an image of the cell phone in her mind
EDL	00:33:46,240	00:33:48,032	| serial-s01-e12 |	Sitting on the coffee table at her house
EDL	00:33:48,800	00:33:53,152	| serial-s01-e12 |	At 3:21 the tower that spanked isn't the one that covers Jen's house
EDL	00:33:54,176	00:33:55,712	| serial-s01-e12 |	If she doesn't have the phone though
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:57,760	| serial-s01-e12 |	Then who was the phone
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:34:01,088	| serial-s01-e12 |	And more to the point if Jade doesn't have the phone
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:03,136	| serial-s01-e12 |	And what was going on that afternoon
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:05,952	| serial-s01-e12 |	Then I have no idea what was going on
EDL	00:34:08,512	00:34:11,072	| serial-s01-e12 |	There were discrepancies unresolved
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:17,472	| serial-s01-e12 |	All throughout the afternoon and evening right up until the end of the night when there's a big one
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:22,080	| serial-s01-e12 |	Beginning and he does bring it up at trial on it too long
EDL	00:34:22,080	00:34:22,848	| serial-s01-e12 |	What is odd
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:28,480	| serial-s01-e12 |	Jen and Jay tell different stories about where she picked him up on the night of the 13th
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:31,296	| serial-s01-e12 |	And about where and when they got rid of his clothes and Boots
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:35,904	| serial-s01-e12 |	Jen says she picked her up at Westview Mall where she saw Adnan to
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:38,208	| serial-s01-e12 |	That didn't happen
EDL	00:34:38,720	00:34:43,328	| serial-s01-e12 |	He says she picked him up at his house and he dumped his clothes that same night the 13th
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:47,424	| serial-s01-e12 |	The first time he tells that he says he threw them out in the trash at his own house
EDL	00:34:48,192	00:34:52,288	| serial-s01-e12 |	But Jen says she tossed his clothes and some dumpsters the next day
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:55,104	| serial-s01-e12 |	There would have been a terrible ice storm happening but maybe
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:57,408	| serial-s01-e12 |	Different stories
EDL	00:34:58,176	00:35:01,504	| serial-s01-e12 |	Unreconciled
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:03,040	| serial-s01-e12 |	And they actually assertive
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:05,088	| serial-s01-e12 |	Both kind of digging on it
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:07,392	| serial-s01-e12 |	Yeah I know it to it
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:08,672	| serial-s01-e12 |	And I
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:09,952	| serial-s01-e12 |	Somebody's wrong
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:11,744	| serial-s01-e12 |	And I
EDL	00:35:12,256	00:35:14,048	| serial-s01-e12 |	Don't believe it's an oversight
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:17,376	| serial-s01-e12 |	But I cannot work my head around
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:19,680	| serial-s01-e12 |	What is the
EDL	00:35:20,960	00:35:23,520	| serial-s01-e12 |	What is the lie that is minimizing what
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:24,032	| serial-s01-e12 |	Right
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:28,128	| serial-s01-e12 |	What's the utility of which liability of which lies yeah
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:33,760	| serial-s01-e12 |	You can fly that same question what's the utility of which lie to this entire case
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:36,064	| serial-s01-e12 |	There's so much that is murky
EDL	00:35:36,064	00:35:37,600	| serial-s01-e12 |	All you can do at a certain point
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:38,112	| serial-s01-e12 |	Speculate
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:39,904	| serial-s01-e12 |	And believe me we have
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:43,488	| serial-s01-e12 |	Angelina I speculate about all sorts of things
EDL	00:35:43,488	00:35:44,768	| serial-s01-e12 |	Like crazy we speculate
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:47,840	| serial-s01-e12 |	Rest assured that in the privacy of our office
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:50,912	| serial-s01-e12 |	We turned over every possibility no matter how remote
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:55,008	| serial-s01-e12 |	99% of what we speculate I cannot report
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:55,776	| serial-s01-e12 |	Because
EDL	00:35:55,776	00:35:57,568	| serial-s01-e12 |	But we can't back it up speculation
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:36:00,640	| serial-s01-e12 |	But here's one I can tell you if recently discussed
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:03,712	| serial-s01-e12 |	We loop-de-loop all the way back to motive
EDL	00:36:04,736	00:36:08,320	| serial-s01-e12 |	I know I dismissed the mode of the state supplied way back in episode 2
EDL	00:36:08,320	00:36:11,136	| serial-s01-e12 |	But we put it back on the table just to see where it took us
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:12,416	| serial-s01-e12 |	Here we got
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:15,488	| serial-s01-e12 |	We've always said Anan was over The breakup
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:16,512	| serial-s01-e12 |	11 a month already
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:19,584	| serial-s01-e12 |	I just for argument's sake let's say he wasn't over it
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:22,912	| serial-s01-e12 |	Inanna hey broken up and gotten back together a few times
EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:27,008	| serial-s01-e12 |	Break up in mid-December maybe a non-sexual change your mind again
EDL	00:36:27,776	00:36:32,896	| serial-s01-e12 |	They're still friendly several people said to me they couldn't tell or didn't even know that had another broken up
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:36,224	| serial-s01-e12 |	Or said and I was still referring to her as his girlfriend
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:38,784	| serial-s01-e12 |	Or said he told them he thought they get back together
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:41,344	| serial-s01-e12 |	Don said he never quite knew what the deal was between them
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:48,000	| serial-s01-e12 |	But judging from his diary by January her romantic feelings are completely absorbed by Don
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:50,048	| serial-s01-e12 |	Remember the first date is January 1st
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:53,632	| serial-s01-e12 |	But maybe a non didn't feel the full force
EDL	00:36:53,632	00:36:57,216	| serial-s01-e12 |	How she moved on until they got back to school after Christmas break
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:37:00,032	| serial-s01-e12 |	Richard Dana realized recently
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:02,592	| serial-s01-e12 |	That first week of school in 99
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:06,688	| serial-s01-e12 |	Anon was absent two out of four days and then Friday was a snow day
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:09,760	| serial-s01-e12 |	So maybe he doesn't get it that he's really lost
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:12,576	| serial-s01-e12 |	Until that first or second week back at
EDL	00:37:12,576	00:37:13,344	| serial-s01-e12 |	School
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:14,368	| serial-s01-e12 |	Christina
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:17,696	| serial-s01-e12 |	Maybe that's when reality sets in for him and maybe that's when
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:20,512	| serial-s01-e12 |	Yeah maybe that's when the
EDL	00:37:20,512	00:37:21,536	| serial-s01-e12 |	The emotion synonym
EDL	00:37:22,304	00:37:23,584	| serial-s01-e12 |	And so does kind of lose it
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:25,888	| serial-s01-e12 |	And so maybe he doesn't lose it
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:28,192	| serial-s01-e12 |	But who else does this
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:32,032	| serial-s01-e12 |	Hayes Ordnance friends whom I spoke to
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:33,312	| serial-s01-e12 |	Says they saw it like this
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:34,080	| serial-s01-e12 |	Set the time
EDL	00:37:34,080	00:37:37,664	| serial-s01-e12 |	I don't even speculate now that they're adults that maybe it could have been like this
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:40,224	| serial-s01-e12 |	So who are we to put this Theory forward
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:45,856	| serial-s01-e12 |	This is a very obvious problem with speculation especially of the emotional variety
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:47,648	| serial-s01-e12 |	You can't prove it
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:48,672	| serial-s01-e12 |	So you have to drop it
EDL	00:37:55,328	00:37:56,864	| serial-s01-e12 |	So where does this leave us
EDL	00:37:57,376	00:38:02,496	| serial-s01-e12 |	There's no point in trying to come up with a most likely scenario for what happened to hey
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:05,312	| serial-s01-e12 |	Because you could pause it a hundred scenarios
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:06,080	| serial-s01-e12 |	And so what
EDL	00:38:06,592	00:38:09,152	| serial-s01-e12 |	Arrest of more facts that are facts
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:12,224	| serial-s01-e12 |	Even the soberest most likely scenario
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:14,272	| serial-s01-e12 |	Holds no more water than the most hare-brained
EDL	00:38:15,040	00:38:16,832	| serial-s01-e12 |	An equation of a nonce case
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:19,136	| serial-s01-e12 |	All speculation is equally speculative
EDL	00:38:20,672	00:38:22,464	| serial-s01-e12 |	Most likely
EDL	00:38:22,464	00:38:23,488	| serial-s01-e12 |	How about most logical
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:28,864	| serial-s01-e12 |	Dana has always been very logical about a Nas case she's the mr. Spock of our staff
EDL	00:38:29,376	00:38:30,400	| serial-s01-e12 |	Herzing is
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:32,448	| serial-s01-e12 |	Let's say you didn't do it
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:33,984	| serial-s01-e12 |	But if you didn't do it
EDL	00:38:33,984	00:38:36,800	| serial-s01-e12 |	And my God that guy is ridiculously unlucky
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:38,336	| serial-s01-e12 |	Imma let her lay it out
EDL	00:38:38,848	00:38:39,872	| serial-s01-e12 |	Nonna's always sad
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:42,432	| serial-s01-e12 |	It was his idea to loan Jay the car
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:43,200	| serial-s01-e12 |	Because
EDL	00:38:43,200	00:38:44,992	| serial-s01-e12 |	He wanted dad to go get Stephanie
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:46,016	| serial-s01-e12 |	A birthday present right
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:50,624	| serial-s01-e12 |	So that's pretty crappy lot that you loaned this guy who ends up
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:54,208	| serial-s01-e12 |	Pointing finger at you for the murder that you loaned him your car
EDL	00:38:54,720	00:38:56,768	| serial-s01-e12 |	And cell phone the day that your ex girlfriend goes with
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:39:01,632	| serial-s01-e12 |	The next thing is that it seems pretty clear to me
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:04,448	| serial-s01-e12 |	They did not have to pay for a ride after
EDL	00:39:04,448	00:39:04,960	| serial-s01-e12 |	High School
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:06,240	| serial-s01-e12 |	Because
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:07,008	| serial-s01-e12 |	We've got
EDL	00:39:08,032	00:39:09,568	| serial-s01-e12 |	At least two of
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:12,128	| serial-s01-e12 |	Their friends saying they overheard him ask
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:13,152	| serial-s01-e12 |	Four rides okay
EDL	00:39:13,920	00:39:16,992	| serial-s01-e12 |	Did not himself tell the cop that died he asked
EDL	00:39:16,992	00:39:17,760	| serial-s01-e12 |	Center for a ride
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:20,832	| serial-s01-e12 |	And in his first interview with the detective
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:22,368	| serial-s01-e12 |	She says to them
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:24,160	| serial-s01-e12 |	Anon plan
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:27,488	| serial-s01-e12 |	Was he getting his car by telling her that
EDL	00:39:28,000	00:39:30,304	| serial-s01-e12 |	His car was broken down and asking
EDL	00:39:30,304	00:39:30,816	| serial-s01-e12 |	Perfect ride
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:37,472	| serial-s01-e12 |	When's the next the next piece of bad luck is the Nisha call I mean even if the Nisha call could
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:39,520	| serial-s01-e12 |	Potentially be a butt dial
EDL	00:39:39,520	00:39:43,360	| serial-s01-e12 |	It's still a possibility
EDL	00:39:44,128	00:39:48,480	| serial-s01-e12 |	That sucks for you that your phone butt dialed a girl that only you
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:50,016	| serial-s01-e12 |	No one would call
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:56,672	| serial-s01-e12 |	On this day that your ex-girlfriend goes missing that you happen to loan your car and your phone out to the guy who end up pointing the finger at you
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:39:57,952	| serial-s01-e12 |	That sucks
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:03,072	| serial-s01-e12 |	And then the last thing that I think really sucks
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:04,608	| serial-s01-e12 |	For him if he's innocent
EDL	00:40:05,120	00:40:05,888	| serial-s01-e12 |	Is
EDL	00:40:07,424	00:40:09,984	| serial-s01-e12 |	Jstory and the cell phone records
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:10,752	| serial-s01-e12 |	Matchup
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:14,080	| serial-s01-e12 |	From about 6 to about 8
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:18,432	| serial-s01-e12 |	Which is when Jay is saying that you are burying the body
EDL	00:40:18,944	00:40:19,712	| serial-s01-e12 |	And
EDL	00:40:19,712	00:40:22,528	| serial-s01-e12 |	That's the time of the day when you just have no memory
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:23,552	| serial-s01-e12 |	Of where you are
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:26,624	| serial-s01-e12 |	And you have your dad saying you were at the mosque
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:29,696	| serial-s01-e12 |	And maybe Bilal your your
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:31,232	| serial-s01-e12 |	You're useless eater
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:31,744	| serial-s01-e12 |	Panera test
EDL	00:40:32,256	00:40:37,120	| serial-s01-e12 |	You never testified at the trial with testifies in Grand Prairie
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:38,144	| serial-s01-e12 |	After Dark
EDL	00:40:38,144	00:40:38,656	| serial-s01-e12 |	At the mosque
EDL	00:40:39,936	00:40:43,264	| serial-s01-e12 |	But you would not you don't really remember where you were that evening
EDL	00:40:43,264	00:40:47,104	| serial-s01-e12 |	And that Blank Spot in your memory
EDL	00:40:47,104	00:40:52,480	| serial-s01-e12 |	That's the that's the window of time when J story actually does seem to be corroborated by the cell phone records
EDL	00:40:53,760	00:40:59,904	| serial-s01-e12 |	Seem to be corroborated yes but J statement only roughly matches the leakin park calls and 8 calls
EDL	00:40:59,904	00:41:00,928	| serial-s01-e12 |	Really roughly
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:03,744	| serial-s01-e12 |	The geography matches but not the timing
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:05,280	| serial-s01-e12 |	But I take your point
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:06,560	| serial-s01-e12 |	So I guess
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:07,072	| serial-s01-e12 |	I guess
EDL	00:41:08,096	00:41:11,680	| serial-s01-e12 |	It just it in order to make him completely innocent of this
EDL	00:41:12,192	00:41:17,824	| serial-s01-e12 |	You just have to thank God that is like you had so many terrible coincidences that day there were so many
EDL	00:41:17,824	00:41:18,592	| serial-s01-e12 |	You had such
EDL	00:41:18,592	00:41:19,360	| serial-s01-e12 |	Padlock
EDL	00:41:19,360	00:41:20,128	| serial-s01-e12 |	That day is not on
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:26,528	| serial-s01-e12 |	A lot of people sent this way
EDL	00:41:26,528	00:41:29,856	| serial-s01-e12 |	I've heard from people who say just so quickly
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:31,392	| serial-s01-e12 |	Is Tony guilty
EDL	00:41:31,392	00:41:33,696	| serial-s01-e12 |	Newsflash people lie in murder cases
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:35,232	| serial-s01-e12 |	On the witness stand what to do
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:41,888	| serial-s01-e12 |	Did we just spend a year applying excessive scrutiny to a perfectly ordinary case
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:47,520	| serial-s01-e12 |	Call Jim training back up he's the former homicide detective we hired to review the investigation
EDL	00:41:48,032	00:41:50,848	| serial-s01-e12 |	Unremarkable
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:57,503	| serial-s01-e12 |	We took a magnifying glass to any murder case would we find similar questions similar whole similar inconsistent
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:04,159	| serial-s01-e12 |	He said most cases sure they have some ambiguity
EDL	00:42:04,159	00:42:05,695	| serial-s01-e12 |	But overall they're fairly clear
EDL	00:42:06,719	00:42:07,999	| serial-s01-e12 |	This one is a mess
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:08,767	| serial-s01-e12 |	She said
EDL	00:42:08,767	00:42:10,559	| serial-s01-e12 |	The holes are bigger than they should be
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:13,887	| serial-s01-e12 |	Review cases lawyers
EDL	00:42:13,887	00:42:15,167	| serial-s01-e12 |	The forensic psychologist
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:16,447	| serial-s01-e12 |	They told us the same thing
EDL	00:42:16,959	00:42:17,983	| serial-s01-e12 |	This case is a mess
EDL	00:42:28,735	00:42:31,039	| serial-s01-e12 |	Rabbit holding in our office
EDL	00:42:31,551	00:42:36,415	| serial-s01-e12 |	Back out in the world those lawyers from the University of Virginia law school Innocence Project Clinic
EDL	00:42:36,415	00:42:39,487	| serial-s01-e12 |	I've been coming up with their own most logical explanation
EDL	00:42:39,487	00:42:41,279	| serial-s01-e12 |	But you couldn't be more different from Dana's
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:47,423	| serial-s01-e12 |	I haven't reported anything about it up to now but over the weekend there was a development of sorts so now I can tell you
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:51,519	| serial-s01-e12 |	Deirdre Enright and her students have a motion in the works
EDL	00:42:51,519	00:42:54,079	| serial-s01-e12 |	To test the DNA from anons case that wasn't tested
EDL	00:42:55,871	00:42:57,407	| serial-s01-e12 |	The swabs from his body
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:43:00,735	| serial-s01-e12 |	The material from under her fingernails the hair is found on her body
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:04,575	| serial-s01-e12 |	Emotion like this you have to give a viable reason to test the
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:07,647	| serial-s01-e12 |	The stuff you have to show how it could potentially exculpate you
EDL	00:43:08,159	00:43:09,695	| serial-s01-e12 |	And deirdre's reason is
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:11,999	| serial-s01-e12 |	She thinks the DNA might not some other guy
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:17,887	| serial-s01-e12 |	The other guy started way back when date and I went down to Charlottesville last February
EDL	00:43:18,399	00:43:20,191	| serial-s01-e12 |	Mario one of her students
EDL	00:43:20,191	00:43:21,983	| serial-s01-e12 |	Start looking online for
EDL	00:43:21,983	00:43:24,031	| serial-s01-e12 |	Possible signs of a serial killer basically
EDL	00:43:24,543	00:43:29,663	| serial-s01-e12 |	I already told him about another strangling of young woman who was also found in the Baltimore Park different Park
EDL	00:43:30,175	00:43:33,247	| serial-s01-e12 |	Thing led to another and It Came Upon yet another case
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:34,271	| serial-s01-e12 |	Cold Case
EDL	00:43:34,783	00:43:36,319	| serial-s01-e12 |	I stumbled Upon a
EDL	00:43:36,319	00:43:37,087	| serial-s01-e12 |	A website
EDL	00:43:37,087	00:43:37,599	| serial-s01-e12 |	That
EDL	00:43:38,623	00:43:40,671	| serial-s01-e12 |	Categorize all the unsolved murders in
EDL	00:43:41,183	00:43:43,487	| serial-s01-e12 |	In Baltimore County and she was there
EDL	00:43:43,999	00:43:48,607	| serial-s01-e12 |	I know your computer's not open now.
EDL	00:43:49,887	00:43:50,655	| serial-s01-e12 |	Anneliese
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:51,423	| serial-s01-e12 |	Young Circle
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:53,471	| serial-s01-e12 |	I believe she was also Korean
EDL	00:43:54,239	00:43:57,823	| serial-s01-e12 |	227 when she was killed strangled in her apartment
EDL	00:43:57,823	00:43:58,847	| serial-s01-e12 |	In Owings Mills
EDL	00:43:59,615	00:44:02,943	| serial-s01-e12 |	Tucson on December 13th 1999
EDL	00:44:02,943	00:44:05,247	| serial-s01-e12 |	Exactly 11 months after he disappeared
EDL	00:44:05,759	00:44:07,807	| serial-s01-e12 |	I can see why Mario was interested
EDL	00:44:07,807	00:44:09,855	| serial-s01-e12 |	So is that your get so will you look into that now
EDL	00:44:09,855	00:44:10,879	| serial-s01-e12 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:44:11,903	00:44:14,975	| serial-s01-e12 |	Slater I got a message to call Deirdre
EDL	00:44:14,975	00:44:15,999	| serial-s01-e12 |	Huge news
EDL	00:44:19,071	00:44:20,863	| serial-s01-e12 |	Deirdre Enright Sarah
EDL	00:44:24,703	00:44:29,567	| serial-s01-e12 |	Huge news in this is attorney huge not necessarily reporter huge but anyway
EDL	00:44:29,567	00:44:35,967	| serial-s01-e12 |	The news was that she spoken to someone in the Baltimore County Police Department to ask about this unsolved case of
EDL	00:44:35,967	00:44:36,735	| serial-s01-e12 |	Anneliese Lee
EDL	00:44:36,735	00:44:40,575	| serial-s01-e12 |	So I'm going to tell you quickly because I have to get on the call at 2:30 okay
EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:44,159	| serial-s01-e12 |	But so I called Sergeant something
EDL	00:44:44,671	00:44:50,047	| serial-s01-e12 |	Sergeant something told her that they now had a suspect for this Owings Mills case from 15 years ago
EDL	00:44:50,047	00:44:52,863	| serial-s01-e12 |	They tested similar DNA and a match came back
EDL	00:44:52,863	00:44:56,959	| serial-s01-e12 |	Tube this other guy who done other crimes mostly burglaries
EDL	00:44:56,959	00:44:59,007	| serial-s01-e12 |	These at my guy was in prison a lot
EDL	00:44:59,519	00:45:05,919	| serial-s01-e12 |	And he said he had a really tiny window of being out and about and he was very active while he was out and about
EDL	00:45:05,919	00:45:07,711	| serial-s01-e12 |	And so
EDL	00:45:07,711	00:45:08,479	| serial-s01-e12 |	He said
EDL	00:45:08,479	00:45:12,575	| serial-s01-e12 |	During that time that he was out we linked him to to rape
EDL	00:45:12,575	00:45:13,599	| serial-s01-e12 |	Anna murder
EDL	00:45:14,111	00:45:15,135	| serial-s01-e12 |	Animoto
EDL	00:45:15,135	00:45:20,511	| serial-s01-e12 |	And all of them appeared to be burglary but he always have sex with people
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:22,047	| serial-s01-e12 |	And he said
EDL	00:45:22,047	00:45:25,119	| serial-s01-e12 |	That he got out and became active
EDL	00:45:25,119	00:45:28,703	| serial-s01-e12 |	14 months his release date is January 1
EDL	00:45:28,703	00:45:29,727	| serial-s01-e12 |	99
EDL	00:45:30,495	00:45:31,263	| serial-s01-e12 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:45:32,031	00:45:32,543	| serial-s01-e12 |	Right
EDL	00:45:33,311	00:45:35,103	| serial-s01-e12 |	So what's his name
EDL	00:45:35,615	00:45:38,943	| serial-s01-e12 |	He wouldn't tell me his name out loud
EDL	00:45:38,943	00:45:42,783	| serial-s01-e12 |	But I'm already accidentally referred to him as Ronald
EDL	00:45:42,783	00:45:44,575	| serial-s01-e12 |	And did he bury his victims
EDL	00:45:44,575	00:45:49,695	| serial-s01-e12 |	I didn't he was like he I think he felt like he was telling me too much already
EDL	00:45:50,719	00:45:53,535	| serial-s01-e12 |	Deirdre later learn this guy's name was Ronald Lee Moore
EDL	00:45:54,047	00:45:56,095	| serial-s01-e12 |	Ronald Morris dead now he killed himself
EDL	00:45:56,863	00:45:58,655	| serial-s01-e12 |	But it seems like he committed lots of crimes
EDL	00:45:59,935	00:46:03,775	| serial-s01-e12 |	He been in prison in Baltimore for a while on assault and burglary convictions
EDL	00:46:04,287	00:46:10,431	| serial-s01-e12 |	According to a Baltimore Sun article in 2007 he was supposed to get transferred to a different jail in Anne Arundel County
EDL	00:46:10,943	00:46:12,735	| serial-s01-e12 |	So you can be prosecuted for a different crime
EDL	00:46:13,247	00:46:16,063	| serial-s01-e12 |	But the Baltimore officials released him by accident
EDL	00:46:16,831	00:46:19,647	| serial-s01-e12 |	He was arrested about a month later in Louisiana
EDL	00:46:19,647	00:46:20,159	| serial-s01-e12 |	Burglary
EDL	00:46:20,671	00:46:23,487	| serial-s01-e12 |	I figured out who he was and that he was wanted back in Maryland
EDL	00:46:25,023	00:46:28,863	| serial-s01-e12 |	This is the guy the Baltimore County cops linked through DNA
EDL	00:46:28,863	00:46:31,167	| serial-s01-e12 |	To the death of Anneliese in Owings Mills
EDL	00:46:31,679	00:46:36,799	| serial-s01-e12 |	And this is the guy that Deirdre and her gang are naming in their motion to test the DNA from a nonce case
EDL	00:46:38,079	00:46:41,151	| serial-s01-e12 |	It's a long shot that they'll be anything testable in those samples
EDL	00:46:41,663	00:46:44,735	| serial-s01-e12 |	And it's a long shot that if there is it'll match anyone but hey
EDL	00:46:45,247	00:46:48,319	| serial-s01-e12 |	And most long shot of all that if it does match someone else
EDL	00:46:48,319	00:46:51,135	| serial-s01-e12 |	That someone else happens to be Ronald Lee Moore
EDL	00:46:52,159	00:46:56,511	| serial-s01-e12 |	As I have several times she always shoots right back
EDL	00:46:57,023	00:46:57,791	| serial-s01-e12 |	What makes more sense
EDL	00:46:58,303	00:47:02,143	| serial-s01-e12 |	That little 17 year old never been in trouble with the law Adnan kill someone
EDL	00:47:02,655	00:47:07,775	| serial-s01-e12 |	Or that Ronald more rapist and murderer who got out of prison 13 days before he disappeared
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:09,311	| serial-s01-e12 |	But he killed someone
EDL	00:47:10,335	00:47:11,615	| serial-s01-e12 |	Right I know I say
EDL	00:47:12,383	00:47:13,407	| serial-s01-e12 |	What about Jay
EDL	00:47:14,175	00:47:15,967	| serial-s01-e12 |	He knew where his car was
EDL	00:47:15,967	00:47:16,991	| serial-s01-e12 |	He had to be involved
EDL	00:47:17,759	00:47:19,039	| serial-s01-e12 |	How does that account for J
EDL	00:47:20,831	00:47:22,111	| serial-s01-e12 |	Big picture Sarah
EDL	00:47:22,111	00:47:22,879	| serial-s01-e12 |	Take picture
EDL	00:47:25,183	00:47:29,791	| serial-s01-e12 |	Meanwhile Adnan post-conviction petition is still alive in the Maryland Court of special Appeals
EDL	00:47:30,303	00:47:35,423	| serial-s01-e12 |	His attorney Justin Brown is working on a way to bring the issue of the Asia Alibi before the court again
EDL	00:47:36,447	00:47:37,727	| serial-s01-e12 |	I spoke to Asia recently
EDL	00:47:38,239	00:47:43,359	| serial-s01-e12 |	She told me she stand by her memories of seeing an on that January afternoon in the public library
EDL	00:47:43,871	00:47:45,407	| serial-s01-e12 |	And she stands by her affidavit
EDL	00:47:47,199	00:47:48,735	| serial-s01-e12 |	Post-conviction purposes
EDL	00:47:49,247	00:47:51,807	| serial-s01-e12 |	Asia's Alibi is still a big deal
EDL	00:47:51,807	00:47:54,367	| serial-s01-e12 |	It sure would seem to point ineffective assistance of counsel
EDL	00:47:55,135	00:48:01,535	| serial-s01-e12 |	It's funny though knowing what we now know about the state's garble timeline and that he was maybe still alive at 2:45 or 2
EDL	00:48:01,535	00:48:02,047	| serial-s01-e12 |	3 p.m.
EDL	00:48:02,559	00:48:05,887	| serial-s01-e12 |	Aces Library Alibi doesn't pack the same punch for me
EDL	00:48:05,887	00:48:06,655	| serial-s01-e12 |	As it once did
EDL	00:48:07,935	00:48:12,543	| serial-s01-e12 |	Deirdre and Justin Brown have been giving it done conflicting advice lately about how best to
EDL	00:48:12,543	00:48:13,311	| serial-s01-e12 |	Proceed
EDL	00:48:13,311	00:48:15,103	| serial-s01-e12 |	What to push for and when
EDL	00:48:15,615	00:48:19,967	| serial-s01-e12 |	But on Saturday is for the go-ahead to file the motion to test DNA
EDL	00:48:20,735	00:48:22,271	| serial-s01-e12 |	It was an emotional decision for him
EDL	00:48:22,783	00:48:25,087	| serial-s01-e12 |	Anything about my case I want to know it
EDL	00:48:25,599	00:48:31,487	| serial-s01-e12 |	I don't want anyone to be able to say what you do want to know so boom we went and found out I want to know
EDL	00:48:31,999	00:48:35,583	| serial-s01-e12 |	And I wanted you to
EDL	00:48:35,583	00:48:37,375	| serial-s01-e12 |	But I'm the one that asked for this
EDL	00:48:37,375	00:48:39,679	| serial-s01-e12 |	You guys had it sitting for 16 years
EDL	00:48:39,679	00:48:40,959	| serial-s01-e12 |	You never tested it
EDL	00:48:41,727	00:48:43,775	| serial-s01-e12 |	It's impossible
EDL	00:48:43,775	00:48:45,311	| serial-s01-e12 |	You guys never tested it
EDL	00:48:47,871	00:48:49,407	| serial-s01-e12 |	I want to see what it says
EDL	00:48:50,431	00:48:52,479	| serial-s01-e12 |	Just nothing about my case and I'm afraid of
EDL	00:49:03,231	00:49:05,535	| serial-s01-e12 |	Back to a non question
EDL	00:49:06,047	00:49:06,815	| serial-s01-e12 |	Do I have an ending
EDL	00:49:07,327	00:49:11,423	| serial-s01-e12 |	I was just thinking about everything I said I'm pretty sure she probably has people telling her like look
EDL	00:49:11,935	00:49:12,703	| serial-s01-e12 |	You know you know this
EDL	00:49:16,031	00:49:19,359	| serial-s01-e12 |	You're going to try to find out
EDL	00:49:19,871	00:49:22,175	| serial-s01-e12 |	I don't think you'll ever have 100%
EDL	00:49:22,687	00:49:27,551	| serial-s01-e12 |	Or you not inside any type of certainty about the only person in the whole world you can have that
EDL	00:49:27,551	00:49:29,855	| serial-s01-e12 |	And I mean for what it's worth whoever did it
EDL	00:49:29,855	00:49:31,391	| serial-s01-e12 |	And I will never have that I don't
EDL	00:49:34,207	00:49:39,839	| serial-s01-e12 |	Anon told me all I wanted was to take the narrative back from the prosecution just as an exercise
EDL	00:49:40,351	00:49:42,655	| serial-s01-e12 |	People could see his case without makeup on
EDL	00:49:43,167	00:49:45,471	| serial-s01-e12 |	Look at it in the eye up close
EDL	00:49:45,471	00:49:46,495	| serial-s01-e12 |	And make your own judgment
EDL	00:49:47,519	00:49:48,543	| serial-s01-e12 |	He told me
EDL	00:49:48,543	00:49:51,359	| serial-s01-e12 |	I don't think I should weigh in the middle
EDL	00:50:01,087	00:50:02,879	| serial-s01-e12 |	Just go down the middle that you know
EDL	00:50:02,879	00:50:05,695	| serial-s01-e12 |	Already but I check these things out and do things
EDL	00:50:06,207	00:50:07,743	| serial-s01-e12 |	These are the things that look bad against us
EDL	00:50:08,255	00:50:11,071	| serial-s01-e12 |	The things that you noticed a cousin really have an answer for
EDL	00:50:11,839	00:50:14,911	| serial-s01-e12 |	You can even go point-for-point
EDL	00:50:14,911	00:50:17,983	| serial-s01-e12 |	Lssu leave it up to the volume
EDL	00:50:20,031	00:50:23,871	| serial-s01-e12 |	Appreciate announce blessing to take a powder I'm not going to
EDL	00:50:25,663	00:50:27,455	| serial-s01-e12 |	Janus right to be skeptical
EDL	00:50:27,455	00:50:29,759	| serial-s01-e12 |	What are the chances one guy got so unlucky
EDL	00:50:30,271	00:50:32,575	| serial-s01-e12 |	But everything lined up against him just so
EDL	00:50:33,343	00:50:36,159	| serial-s01-e12 |	Because yes there's a police file full of information
EDL	00:50:36,159	00:50:37,695	| serial-s01-e12 |	Circumstantial information
EDL	00:50:40,255	00:50:43,071	| serial-s01-e12 |	Let's put another file next to that one side by side
EDL	00:50:44,095	00:50:49,215	| serial-s01-e12 |	In that second file let's put all the other evidence we have linking and onto the actual crime
EDL	00:50:49,215	00:50:50,239	| serial-s01-e12 |	The actual killing
EDL	00:50:51,263	00:50:52,287	| serial-s01-e12 |	What do we have
EDL	00:50:52,287	00:50:55,103	| serial-s01-e12 |	What do we know not what we think we know
EDL	00:50:55,103	00:50:55,871	| serial-s01-e12 |	What do we know
EDL	00:50:56,895	00:50:59,455	| serial-s01-e12 |	If a college does not back up Jay story
EDL	00:50:59,967	00:51:02,527	| serial-s01-e12 |	Phoenicia call is no longer set in stone
EDL	00:51:03,039	00:51:03,807	| serial-s01-e12 |	Don't think about it
EDL	00:51:06,111	00:51:07,647	| serial-s01-e12 |	All we're left with is
EDL	00:51:07,647	00:51:09,183	| serial-s01-e12 |	Jay knew where the car was
EDL	00:51:09,695	00:51:10,207	| serial-s01-e12 |	That's it
EDL	00:51:11,231	00:51:13,023	| serial-s01-e12 |	And that all by itself
EDL	00:51:13,023	00:51:14,047	| serial-s01-e12 |	This is not a story
EDL	00:51:14,559	00:51:17,631	| serial-s01-e12 |	It's a beginning but it's not a story it's not enough
EDL	00:51:17,631	00:51:21,215	| serial-s01-e12 |	To me to send anyone to prison for life nevermind a seventeen-year-old kid
EDL	00:51:21,983	00:51:24,799	| serial-s01-e12 |	Because you mean the state of Maryland
EDL	00:51:24,799	00:51:27,359	| serial-s01-e12 |	Based on the information we have before us
EDL	00:51:27,359	00:51:29,919	| serial-s01-e12 |	Don't believe any of us can say what really happened to her
EDL	00:51:31,199	00:51:34,015	| serial-s01-e12 |	As a juror I vote to acquit Adnan Syed
EDL	00:51:34,527	00:51:35,551	| serial-s01-e12 |	I have to acquit
EDL	00:51:36,319	00:51:39,391	| serial-s01-e12 |	Even if in my heart of hearts I think Adnan killed Hae
EDL	00:51:39,391	00:51:40,671	| serial-s01-e12 |	I still have to acquit
EDL	00:51:41,183	00:51:42,719	| serial-s01-e12 |	That's what the law requires of jurors
EDL	00:51:43,999	00:51:45,279	| serial-s01-e12 |	I'm not a juror
EDL	00:51:46,303	00:51:49,887	| serial-s01-e12 |	So just as a human being walking down the street next week what do I think
EDL	00:51:51,167	00:51:53,983	| serial-s01-e12 |	Do you want me to swear that Adnan Syed is innocent
EDL	00:51:53,983	00:51:54,751	| serial-s01-e12 |	I couldn't do it
EDL	00:51:55,263	00:51:56,287	| serial-s01-e12 |	I nursed out
EDL	00:51:56,799	00:51:58,591	| serial-s01-e12 |	I don't like that but I do
EDL	00:51:59,103	00:52:01,407	| serial-s01-e12 |	I mean most of the time I think he didn't do it
EDL	00:52:02,175	00:52:04,735	| serial-s01-e12 |	Four big reasons like the utter lack of evidence
EDL	00:52:05,247	00:52:06,783	| serial-s01-e12 |	But also small reasons
EDL	00:52:06,783	00:52:12,415	| serial-s01-e12 |	Things he said to me just off-the-cuff for moments when he's crying on the phone and tried to stifle it so I wouldn't hear
EDL	00:52:12,927	00:52:14,207	| serial-s01-e12 |	I just a bear fact
EDL	00:52:14,207	00:52:17,535	| serial-s01-e12 |	Why on Earth would a guilty man agree to let me do this story
EDL	00:52:17,535	00:52:19,583	| serial-s01-e12 |	Unless he was cocky to the point of delusion
EDL	00:52:20,863	00:52:23,167	| serial-s01-e12 |	I used to think that one has friends told me
EDL	00:52:23,167	00:52:27,519	| serial-s01-e12 |	I can't say for sure if he's innocent but the guy I knew there's no way he could have done this
EDL	00:52:28,287	00:52:29,823	| serial-s01-e12 |	I still think that was a cop out
EDL	00:52:30,335	00:52:35,199	| serial-s01-e12 |	Way to avoid asking yourself uncomfortable disloyal disheartening questions
EDL	00:52:35,967	00:52:37,759	| serial-s01-e12 |	But I think I'm there now too
EDL	00:52:37,759	00:52:40,319	| serial-s01-e12 |	And not for lack of asking myself those hard questions
EDL	00:52:40,831	00:52:43,135	| serial-s01-e12 |	But because as much as I want to be sure
EDL	00:52:43,903	00:52:44,415	| serial-s01-e12 |	I'm not
EDL	00:52:48,255	00:52:50,559	| serial-s01-e12 |	First told me about Adnan case
EDL	00:52:51,071	00:52:54,399	| serial-s01-e12 |	Certainty one way or the other seems so attainable
EDL	00:52:55,167	00:52:56,959	| serial-s01-e12 |	We just needed to get the right documents
EDL	00:52:57,471	00:53:00,287	| serial-s01-e12 |	Spend enough time talk to the right people find us a lullaby
EDL	00:53:00,799	00:53:04,895	| serial-s01-e12 |	And then I did find Asia and she was real and she remembered and we all thought
EDL	00:53:04,895	00:53:06,687	| serial-s01-e12 |	How hard could this possibly be
EDL	00:53:06,687	00:53:07,711	| serial-s01-e12 |	We just have to keep going
EDL	00:53:08,991	00:53:10,783	| serial-s01-e12 |	And now I'm more than a year later
EDL	00:53:10,783	00:53:14,111	| serial-s01-e12 |	I feel like shaking Everyone by the shoulders like an aggravated cop
EDL	00:53:15,135	00:53:16,927	| serial-s01-e12 |	Don't tell me it's a nice guy
EDL	00:53:17,439	00:53:18,975	| serial-s01-e12 |	Don't tell me Jay was scared
EDL	00:53:19,487	00:53:22,047	| serial-s01-e12 |	Don't tell me you might have made some 5 Second phone call
EDL	00:53:22,559	00:53:23,839	| serial-s01-e12 |	Just tell me the facts ma'am
EDL	00:53:24,607	00:53:26,655	| serial-s01-e12 |	Cuz we didn't have them 15 years ago
