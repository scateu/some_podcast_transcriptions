EDL	00:01:01,440	00:01:05,280	| serial-s03-e06 |	I probably put more people on probation than any other judge in his Courthouse
EDL	00:01:05,280	00:01:08,352	| serial-s03-e06 |	Yeah because I can always put in a prison life
EDL	00:01:08,864	00:01:15,264	| serial-s03-e06 |	I don't think he had anything to do with officer

EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:47,776	| serial-s03-e06 |	I was talking to this guy Kevin
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:52,384	| serial-s03-e06 |	40 years old he's been busted for giving someone out of college a marijuana cookie
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:55,968	| serial-s03-e06 |	It operated as a nice gesture really just pay have one
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:59,296	| serial-s03-e06 |	I thought the guy understood what it was ;-)
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:01,344	| serial-s03-e06 |	But he didn't know went wrong
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:04,160	| serial-s03-e06 |	Kevin ended up with a felony conviction
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:05,952	| serial-s03-e06 |	Another felony conviction
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:08,256	| serial-s03-e06 |	They sounded absurd
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:10,560	| serial-s03-e06 |	It been a trial over this cookie
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:11,584	| serial-s03-e06 |	That's funny right
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:14,400	| serial-s03-e06 |	I want to talk to Kevin the cookie Baker
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:17,472	| serial-s03-e06 |	In the hallway outside the courtroom in the Justice Center right after the verdict
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:19,008	| serial-s03-e06 |	Not funny
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:21,312	| serial-s03-e06 |	He was in what my mother would call us with it
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:25,408	| serial-s03-e06 |	Cracking angry jokes but also desperately upset have crying
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:28,736	| serial-s03-e06 |	Kevin said he been a drug dealer when he was young but he change
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:33,088	| serial-s03-e06 |	He was in school volunteering in a community trying to start his own business

EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:35,904	| serial-s03-e06 |	And now this
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:38,720	| serial-s03-e06 |	What Kevin called felonious childish stupidness
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:44,864	| serial-s03-e06 |	I got him kicked out of his college and it also triggered a probation violation on a case from a few years earlier
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:48,448	| serial-s03-e06 |	Kevin has been just two months shy of completing that probation
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:49,728	| serial-s03-e06 |	Is almost done
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:51,008	| serial-s03-e06 |	And now this
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:54,080	| serial-s03-e06 |	I'm sorry I said this is a rough day
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:56,640	| serial-s03-e06 |	He said it's alright it's alright
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:57,152	| serial-s03-e06 |	It's all right
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:02:59,200	| serial-s03-e06 |	I'm starting to get used to it actually
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:03,808	| serial-s03-e06 |	It started right about 16 17 in it
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:04,576	| serial-s03-e06 |	Kate
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:06,112	| serial-s03-e06 |	I Got Roots here
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:11,488	| serial-s03-e06 |	Just like a bad relationship I can't get out of there
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:17,888	| serial-s03-e06 |	So far in this series we've talked a lot about the system aspect of the justices
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:20,448	| serial-s03-e06 |	Other Machinery of it works
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:20,960	| serial-s03-e06 |	Or does it
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:26,080	| serial-s03-e06 |	Now for the rest of the series we want to look at the criminal justice system whole other way
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:29,152	| serial-s03-e06 |	We want to follow people who are like heaven
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:31,456	| serial-s03-e06 |	People who feel like they have roots in the system
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:35,040	| serial-s03-e06 |	I've been in it for years and who been shaped by its machinery
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:38,112	| serial-s03-e06 |	Probably nothing we've reported so far would be news to them
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:39,392	| serial-s03-e06 |	I know it
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:41,440	| serial-s03-e06 |	I know it's pretentious
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:43,744	| serial-s03-e06 |	To say this but I keep thinking of this Russian word
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:44,256	| serial-s03-e06 |	Choose two of us
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:47,584	| serial-s03-e06 |	It means to feel something almost sensually
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:48,608	| serial-s03-e06 |	To the point where you can taste
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,656	| serial-s03-e06 |	You know it in your bones
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:54,752	| serial-s03-e06 |	So now we're going to follow people out of the Justice Center
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:57,056	| serial-s03-e06 |	Out into the world into their normal lives
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:59,104	| serial-s03-e06 |	The guy we're going to start with
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:00,640	| serial-s03-e06 |	His name is Jesse Nickerson
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:08,320	| serial-s03-e06 |	Back in the summer of 2016 before we got to Cleveland

EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:12,928	| serial-s03-e06 |	I'm allowed to call it that
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:16,512	| serial-s03-e06 |	Two officers had arrested this guy Jesse Nickerson
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:21,887	| serial-s03-e06 |	And instead of taking him back to the station they drove to a city park took off Jesse's handcuffed

EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:30,335	| serial-s03-e06 |	6 foot four former linebacker in the arena football league challenge Jesse to a fight
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:34,943	| serial-s03-e06 |	Jesse squared off with denayne Dixon for a second but then he took off
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:37,247	| serial-s03-e06 |	Ran into the woods
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:39,551	| serial-s03-e06 |	The officers eventually found in cuff them
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:41,343	| serial-s03-e06 |	Jesse said they betta
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:43,135	| serial-s03-e06 |	The officers said he hurt himself
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:44,927	| serial-s03-e06 |	Story made the news
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:46,719	| serial-s03-e06 |	Absolutely second

EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:06,943	| serial-s03-e06 |	17000 people in government and some Police Department
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:13,343	| serial-s03-e06 |	It seemed refreshingly as if those entities were taking responsibility for what happened and swiftly
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:16,415	| serial-s03-e06 |	Excuses police officers were fired within days
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:19,231	| serial-s03-e06 |	The police chief referred the case to State investigators

EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:54,559	| serial-s03-e06 |	But then tried to cover up cover it up by turning off their body
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:06:00,191	| serial-s03-e06 |	A police officer convicted for bad behavior on the job already unusual in this Courthouse
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:03,775	| serial-s03-e06 |	I'm here Ashley Cobain was arguing forcefully
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:05,311	| serial-s03-e06 |	For the harshest possible punishment
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:07,615	| serial-s03-e06 |	Who's pitching consecutive sentences
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:10,175	| serial-s03-e06 |	Minimum sentence for each crime would run back to back
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:12,735	| serial-s03-e06 |	The judge Nancy fuerst
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:14,271	| serial-s03-e06 |	Invited officer Dixon to speak

EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:19,135	| serial-s03-e06 |	And he did
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:20,159	| serial-s03-e06 |	He apologized
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:25,023	| serial-s03-e06 |	He said I understand I was put in a position of authority and I was entrusted with a public Trust
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:26,559	| serial-s03-e06 |	To make a difference
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:28,607	| serial-s03-e06 |	To be part of the solution and not part of the problem
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:30,143	| serial-s03-e06 |	And then he said
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:31,935	| serial-s03-e06 |	I know intention of assaulting anyone
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:34,751	| serial-s03-e06 |	Before

EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:43,199	| serial-s03-e06 |	You know take a guy out of cuffs and get him to stop running his mouth or whatever
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:47,551	| serial-s03-e06 |	Officer Dixon's lawyer told the court that Dixon told him the same thing
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:49,087	| serial-s03-e06 |	Which is kind of disturbing
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:51,647	| serial-s03-e06 |	Other than that no one remarks on this
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:53,439	| serial-s03-e06 |	Kind of disturbing information
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,207	| serial-s03-e06 |	Just let it go
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:58,047	| serial-s03-e06 |	The judge sentenced today in Dixon to 2 years in prison
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:06:58,815	| serial-s03-e06 |	And it was over

EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:12,383	| serial-s03-e06 |	Kind of disturbing
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:14,175	| serial-s03-e06 |	The prosecutor
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:15,711	| serial-s03-e06 |	And
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:17,247	| serial-s03-e06 |	Now they told me
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:19,039	| serial-s03-e06 |	They telling me to stay out of East Cleveland
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:22,879	| serial-s03-e06 |	Jesse said they told him remember the name Dixon's got friends

EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:21,152	| serial-s03-e06 |	Because I'll help you understand some of what's going to happen to Jesse
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:24,224	| serial-s03-e06 |	And also because a case of Arnold black is
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:24,736	| serial-s03-e06 |	Crazy
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:29,344	| serial-s03-e06 |	I want to reach for another descriptor it starts out crazy and then it gets more crazy
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:32,160	| serial-s03-e06 |	First a caveat
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:34,464	| serial-s03-e06 |	Arnold black suit is Cleveland
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:37,024	| serial-s03-e06 |	I read the court transcript I interviewed his attorney
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:40,864	| serial-s03-e06 |	There was a trial but he's Cleveland the defendant
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:42,400	| serial-s03-e06 |	Did not defend itself
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:46,496	| serial-s03-e06 |	They did not offer evidence or Witnesses they did not cross-examine anyone
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:49,312	| serial-s03-e06 |	So what I'm going to tell you is one-sided
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:51,104	| serial-s03-e06 |	Which doesn't make it untrue
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:55,968	| serial-s03-e06 |	Everything I'm telling you now was testify to Underoath in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:59,040	| serial-s03-e06 |	And again was not challenged by the city
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:00,832	| serial-s03-e06 |	Here's the story
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:04,416	| serial-s03-e06 |	This guy Arnold black East 44th
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:07,744	| serial-s03-e06 |	The time is driving down Euclid Avenue in the middle of East Cleveland
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:08,512	| serial-s03-e06 |	Nighttime
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:11,328	| serial-s03-e06 |	He done a landscaping job near where his mother lived
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:14,144	| serial-s03-e06 |	They got over to her house afterwards for dinner
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:15,168	| serial-s03-e06 |	Now he was heading home
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:17,472	| serial-s03-e06 |	He's driving his truck
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:19,264	| serial-s03-e06 |	A green Chevy Silverado
EDL	00:26:19,264	00:26:22,336	| serial-s03-e06 |	Equipment in the back weed wacker leaf blower lawn mower
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:23,616	| serial-s03-e06 |	And the cops
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:24,128	| serial-s03-e06 |	Poem over
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:27,200	| serial-s03-e06 |	One uniformed officer in a cruiser
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:29,760	| serial-s03-e06 |	The other officer is a detective in normal clothes
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:30,784	| serial-s03-e06 |	I was driving his normal car
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:33,344	| serial-s03-e06 |	The uniformed officer
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:34,368	| serial-s03-e06 |	Jonathan O'Leary
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:36,416	| serial-s03-e06 |	Tells Arnold to get out of the truck
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:37,440	| serial-s03-e06 |	Possumdown
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:37,952	| serial-s03-e06 |	Topsham
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:41,536	| serial-s03-e06 |	I take Arnold black to the rear of his truck sitting down on the bumper
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:46,400	| serial-s03-e06 |	The cop in street clothes detective Randy Hicks aggressively searches the truck
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:47,936	| serial-s03-e06 |	Ripped out the inside door panels
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:50,752	| serial-s03-e06 |	In court Arnold black testified to the following
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:52,544	| serial-s03-e06 |	He said detective Hicks
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:54,592	| serial-s03-e06 |	Start asking him about drugs and he's Cleveland
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:56,384	| serial-s03-e06 |	They told him he didn't know
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:59,968	| serial-s03-e06 |	Because I don't sell drugs I don't do drugs and I don't live in East Cleveland
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:05,344	| serial-s03-e06 |	He said he was looking for a kilo of cocaine and he said to me that I wasn't in the right truck
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:09,696	| serial-s03-e06 |	I don't lie detective Hicks was looking for a drug dealer and a green truck
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:10,720	| serial-s03-e06 |	But Arnold wasn't him
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:11,744	| serial-s03-e06 |	Not annoyed
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:14,560	| serial-s03-e06 |	He said you messed my night up
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:17,632	| serial-s03-e06 |	Arnold's that detective Hicks seemed off
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:18,400	| serial-s03-e06 |	Drunk probably
EDL	00:27:18,912	00:27:22,752	| serial-s03-e06 |	It keeps asking Arnold about drugs Arnold the saying why you keep asking me that
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:24,032	| serial-s03-e06 |	Then
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:24,800	| serial-s03-e06 |	Wham
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:25,824	| serial-s03-e06 |	Detective Hicks
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:27,104	| serial-s03-e06 |	Punches Arnold in the face
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:31,456	| serial-s03-e06 |	Arnold testified that he then starts to cut a slide off the bumper
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:33,248	| serial-s03-e06 |	Officer O'Leary props him up
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:35,296	| serial-s03-e06 |	Detective Hicks hits him again in the head
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:37,088	| serial-s03-e06 |	These are hard hits
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:42,720	| serial-s03-e06 |	Hard enough that three years later Arnold Blackwood need brain surgery to drain the fluid and blood from a skull
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:45,792	| serial-s03-e06 |	Even now he can't remember things properly his speech has slowed
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:48,096	| serial-s03-e06 |	Is trouble controlling his anger
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:51,168	| serial-s03-e06 |	His mother and fiance say his personality is changed
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:54,240	| serial-s03-e06 |	The officers put him in the cruiser
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:56,800	| serial-s03-e06 |	Take him back to the East Cleveland Police Department where the jail is
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:28:03,712	| serial-s03-e06 |	And they put him in a room that Arnold's attorney calls a storage locker East Cleveland police called it a holding cell tomato tomato
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:07,808	| serial-s03-e06 |	So no one can decide what this room is called but whatever it is it is not a proper jail cell
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:10,880	| serial-s03-e06 |	No bad no toilet no window no water
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:14,208	| serial-s03-e06 |	Going to bench fuel lockers the tall kind
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:15,232	| serial-s03-e06 |	And some cleaning supplies
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:16,512	| serial-s03-e06 |	Brooms mops
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:19,328	| serial-s03-e06 |	They lock Arnold in there
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:20,864	| serial-s03-e06 |	That's according to his testimony
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:28,032	| serial-s03-e06 |	And now the timeline of all this is a little unclear the police and County records say one thing the trial transcript says another
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:29,824	| serial-s03-e06 |	If we go by the Wreckers at least
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:31,616	| serial-s03-e06 |	This began on a Friday night
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:35,712	| serial-s03-e06 |	Arnold says he could hear people talking and hollering walking around he could
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:36,992	| serial-s03-e06 |	Cheese
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:42,112	| serial-s03-e06 |	I knocked on the door and was screaming like I told him I had to use the bathroom and I said anybody
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:43,392	| serial-s03-e06 |	Anybody
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:44,160	| serial-s03-e06 |	No one comes
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:45,696	| serial-s03-e06 |	Arnold peas in a locker
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:49,024	| serial-s03-e06 |	Meanwhile his girlfriend Erica is getting worried
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:51,328	| serial-s03-e06 |	Where is he supposed to hear from him
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:54,144	| serial-s03-e06 |	Just calling around to friends she called the hospital
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:55,936	| serial-s03-e06 |	Sunday Times
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:59,008	| serial-s03-e06 |	Arnold's has an officer opens a door to the room
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:29:01,568	| serial-s03-e06 |	And ask him does anyone know you're in here
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:04,128	| serial-s03-e06 |	Arnold says no the guy says
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:05,664	| serial-s03-e06 |	And points to the ceiling
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:10,016	| serial-s03-e06 |	There's a microphone up there he says step back they won't pick up Whispers
EDL	00:29:10,784	00:29:17,184	| serial-s03-e06 |	Send text to Zone cell phone from his back pocket Arnold gives the guard Erica's number the guard dial to phone and the
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:18,464	| serial-s03-e06 |	Arnold and tell them to make it quick
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:23,584	| serial-s03-e06 |	Arnold tells Erica the cops beat me up I'm in East Cleveland jail come get me
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:26,912	| serial-s03-e06 |	Colonel says a bit later that same guy comes back
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:30,240	| serial-s03-e06 |	Houses in one of those little milk cartons like from a school cafeteria
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:32,544	| serial-s03-e06 |	Erica arrives
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:34,336	| serial-s03-e06 |	Ask to see Arnold
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:37,152	| serial-s03-e06 |	Now this is according to her testimony
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:40,992	| serial-s03-e06 |	The cops at the reception window, look at each other for a while
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:42,272	| serial-s03-e06 |	Finally someone says
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:43,808	| serial-s03-e06 |	He's under investigation
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:44,832	| serial-s03-e06 |	You can't see him
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:46,112	| serial-s03-e06 |	He's under investigation
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:49,440	| serial-s03-e06 |	She feels like something's wrong like they're lying to her
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:54,304	| serial-s03-e06 |	She called Arnold Family Arnold's brother he took the stand at trial to
EDL	00:29:54,304	00:29:58,912	| serial-s03-e06 |	Arnold's brother says he goes to East Cleveland and they tell him Arnold's in Cleveland jail
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:00,960	| serial-s03-e06 |	He drives over to Cleveland
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:02,752	| serial-s03-e06 |	Tell him there's no Arnold black here
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:04,544	| serial-s03-e06 |	And he's like I was just
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:06,080	| serial-s03-e06 |	They just told me to come here
EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:06,848	| serial-s03-e06 |	Paycheck
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:07,616	| serial-s03-e06 |	Check again
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:13,248	| serial-s03-e06 |	He goes back to East Cleveland again where they again safe we don't know what to tell you
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:13,760	| serial-s03-e06 |	Get here
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:16,064	| serial-s03-e06 |	It's now Monday
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:17,856	| serial-s03-e06 |	Day 3 of the storage room
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:21,440	| serial-s03-e06 |	Arnold is in terrible pain from his head injuries he can't sleep really
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:22,464	| serial-s03-e06 |	Hungry
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:27,584	| serial-s03-e06 |	Cortana said that aside from that one little milk carton they gave him nothing to eat or drink
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:33,728	| serial-s03-e06 |	The p in the locker is stinking he's intensely anxious is where the cops are going to do something to Erica because he called
EDL	00:30:34,240	00:30:36,288	| serial-s03-e06 |	Feels like the room is closing in on him
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:40,640	| serial-s03-e06 |	Finally I got if I'm reading the records right on day 5
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:44,736	| serial-s03-e06 |	He's put in a van and taken to the county jail at the Justice Center
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:47,040	| serial-s03-e06 |	He's held there a couple days
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:50,112	| serial-s03-e06 |	Until Erica comes to get him paises Bond 250 bucks
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:55,488	| serial-s03-e06 |	But you see them walking out of the county jail she says his head is so swollen he looks like he's wearing a helmet
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:56,768	| serial-s03-e06 |	Take them home
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:31:03,424	| serial-s03-e06 |	Sometime later Arnold gets a letter in the mail telling him he's been indicted by a grand jury for possessing crack cocaine
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:09,056	| serial-s03-e06 |	I was like charged with cocaine Arnold said I never had no cocaine charge with that
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:16,224	| serial-s03-e06 |	In the police report officer O'Leary claims he found a baggie of crack under Arnold's tongue and also that he had a baggie of marijuana
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:17,248	| serial-s03-e06 |	Moana
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:23,648	| serial-s03-e06 |	I'll point out that the East Cleveland detective who testified about the crack before the grand jury Eric Jones was at that
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:30,048	| serial-s03-e06 |	That time part of a couple of East Cleveland cops who were shaking down drug dealers stealing their money and falsifying evidence
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:31,584	| serial-s03-e06 |	Is now in federal prison
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:32,352	| serial-s03-e06 |	But I digress
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:39,008	| serial-s03-e06 |	In any case the prosecutor could see the circumstances of Arnold arrest or shady she been told about the beating
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:40,288	| serial-s03-e06 |	This file was going to be trouble
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:42,080	| serial-s03-e06 |	They dropped the charges
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:47,200	| serial-s03-e06 |	Arnold hires a civil rights lawyer Bobby the cello

EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:08,448	| serial-s03-e06 |	There's only so much we can afford
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:10,752	| serial-s03-e06 |	Detellos response
EDL	00:32:10,752	00:32:11,520	| serial-s03-e06 |	Very different

EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:39,936	| serial-s03-e06 |	Would that be good enough
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:41,728	| serial-s03-e06 |	And I would respond
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:43,008	| serial-s03-e06 |	Let me get this straight
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:48,128	| serial-s03-e06 |	You guys beat up my client put them in a in a locker storage locker made him pee

EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:54,528	| serial-s03-e06 |	Billy
EDL	00:32:55,552	00:32:59,392	| serial-s03-e06 |	I'm going to ask you to bear with me a little longer here because the story gets better
EDL	00:32:59,392	00:32:59,904	| serial-s03-e06 |	Flash worse
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:05,024	| serial-s03-e06 |	Are they prepare for trial tuccillo finds out there was dash cam footage of the arrest
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:07,328	| serial-s03-e06 |	The shows detective Hicks beating Arnold
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:12,448	| serial-s03-e06 |	And they also discover that that same raw video with later edited by the police
EDL	00:33:12,960	00:33:13,728	| serial-s03-e06 |	Altered
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:14,496	| serial-s03-e06 |	So is not
EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:15,008	| serial-s03-e06 |	Cheshire the beating
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:17,312	| serial-s03-e06 |	And listen up here
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:19,616	| serial-s03-e06 |	At the police chief and the mayor knew about it
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:22,944	| serial-s03-e06 |	They discovered that the East Cleveland Police did this all the time
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:28,832	| serial-s03-e06 |	In fact they discover that nothing that happened to Arnold black during the time he was secretly in East Cleveland's custody was unusual
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:32,416	| serial-s03-e06 |	Police in East Cleveland routinely pull people over in rough them up
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:34,208	| serial-s03-e06 |	Badminton practice for decades
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:37,536	| serial-s03-e06 |	Routinely held them in jail for no reason routinely altered evidence
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:42,144	| serial-s03-e06 |	The police chief routinely told officers to keep quiet about abuse to avoid lawsuit
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:47,520	| serial-s03-e06 |	Dichello had found out about almost all this stuff from a most unlikely source
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:49,056	| serial-s03-e06 |	Detective Randy Hicks
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:50,592	| serial-s03-e06 |	The guy who beat Arnold black
EDL	00:33:51,360	00:33:54,432	| serial-s03-e06 |	Pics of walked off the job within days of Arnold arrest he said
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:56,992	| serial-s03-e06 |	Soon as he realized his bosses were going to blame everything on him
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:34:00,064	| serial-s03-e06 |	Event at the department for about 15 years
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:02,112	| serial-s03-e06 |	Head of the narcotics unit for 6
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:03,136	| serial-s03-e06 |	Modern commendation
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:05,440	| serial-s03-e06 |	He wasn't a rogue cop
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:08,256	| serial-s03-e06 |	He said he was doing what they'd all been taught to do in East Cleveland
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:12,352	| serial-s03-e06 |	We asked the city law director to respond to the story
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:12,864	| serial-s03-e06 |	She didn't
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:15,680	| serial-s03-e06 |	Neither did Officer O'Leary or detective Hicks
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:18,496	| serial-s03-e06 |	Then Mayor Gary Norton did respond
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:23,104	| serial-s03-e06 |	He's at the characterization from the Civil Trial are 1000% false
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:25,664	| serial-s03-e06 |	Is that all I knew about the dash cam video
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:28,224	| serial-s03-e06 |	Was that quote there was a gap in the tape on quote
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:29,504	| serial-s03-e06 |	Gap
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:33,856	| serial-s03-e06 |	And he said he didn't know about the holding cells / storage locker at the jail
EDL	00:34:33,856	00:34:35,392	| serial-s03-e06 |	Which is downstairs from his office
EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:36,928	| serial-s03-e06 |	I just didn't know
EDL	00:34:36,928	00:34:37,696	| serial-s03-e06 |	I really didn't
EDL	00:34:38,720	00:34:41,792	| serial-s03-e06 |	The den police chief Ralph Spotts also called us back
EDL	00:34:41,792	00:34:42,816	| serial-s03-e06 |	He said ditto
EDL	00:34:43,328	00:34:46,656	| serial-s03-e06 |	There was no such culture of aggression within the police department he said
EDL	00:34:46,656	00:34:49,472	| serial-s03-e06 |	No pattern of altering evidence or hiding abuse
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:55,360	| serial-s03-e06 |	Mister spots at detective Hicks was just shifting blame for his own personal wrongdoing
EDL	00:34:56,384	00:34:57,920	| serial-s03-e06 |	The civil lawsuit drag on
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:34:58,688	| serial-s03-e06 |	Years go by
EDL	00:34:59,200	00:35:02,016	| serial-s03-e06 |	No point is East Cleveland ever hand over discovery
EDL	00:35:02,528	00:35:03,552	| serial-s03-e06 |	That one piece of paper
EDL	00:35:04,064	00:35:10,464	| serial-s03-e06 |	Nevermind the dashcam video or Personnel records or logs from the jail the cello never even gets a police report
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:15,584	| serial-s03-e06 |	City law director claims she doesn't know where anything is they simply have nothing to Handover
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:22,496	| serial-s03-e06 |	Is egregious enough this refusal to engage but the judge finally issued a ruling saying okay is Cleveland
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:25,312	| serial-s03-e06 |	You are now barred from introducing any evidence in trial
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:30,176	| serial-s03-e06 |	So we're going to have a trial but you cannot defend yourself you forfeited that right
EDL	00:35:30,176	00:35:31,968	| serial-s03-e06 |	City appeals this ruling
EDL	00:35:31,968	00:35:34,016	| serial-s03-e06 |	Once twice they get denied
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:39,392	| serial-s03-e06 |	In 2016 four years after Arnold's beating and arrest they finally go to trial
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:45,280	| serial-s03-e06 |	And the only person who shows up for the other side the only person is former East Cleveland Detective
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:46,304	| serial-s03-e06 |	Randy Hicks
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:49,120	| serial-s03-e06 |	No city law director no police chief no mayor
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:52,448	| serial-s03-e06 |	Just Randy hex all by himself and he admits everything
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:55,520	| serial-s03-e06 |	There's this extraordinary part of the trial transfer
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:36:00,384	| serial-s03-e06 |	In which two cello reads a long list of all the things officers in East Cleveland dead
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:01,920	| serial-s03-e06 |	And Hicks confirmed
EDL	00:36:01,920	00:36:02,688	| serial-s03-e06 |	All of it
EDL	00:36:03,456	00:36:04,224	| serial-s03-e06 |	The cello
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:05,248	| serial-s03-e06 |	Number for
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:11,648	| serial-s03-e06 |	Officer Hicks was and his fellow officers were required by Chief spots to follow a custom of using violence in the city of
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:12,416	| serial-s03-e06 |	East Cleveland
EDL	00:36:12,416	00:36:14,976	| serial-s03-e06 |	We had officers using force on civilians
EDL	00:36:14,976	00:36:17,792	| serial-s03-e06 |	To compel statements from them to establish control
EDL	00:36:17,792	00:36:21,888	| serial-s03-e06 |	To instill fear and submission and to show dominance during arrest in traffic stop
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:22,656	| serial-s03-e06 |	The judge
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:24,192	| serial-s03-e06 |	That true
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:25,472	| serial-s03-e06 |	Text yes your honor
EDL	00:36:26,240	00:36:32,640	| serial-s03-e06 |	A jury awarded Arnold black 22 million dollars in compensatory and punitive damages
EDL	00:36:32,640	00:36:33,664	| serial-s03-e06 |	22 million-dollar judgement
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:35,456	| serial-s03-e06 |	Victory right
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:37,760	| serial-s03-e06 |	Not exactly
EDL	00:36:37,760	00:36:38,784	| serial-s03-e06 |	Because got this
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:40,832	| serial-s03-e06 |	The morning of trial
EDL	00:36:40,832	00:36:46,720	| serial-s03-e06 |	About an hour and a half before it started the city's lawyer filed a notice of appeal with the Ohio Supreme Court
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:51,072	| serial-s03-e06 |	It's a notice saying hey we're planning on filing something with you guys
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:56,960	| serial-s03-e06 |	The city had assumed that the notice would stop the clock on the trial and retroactively it did
EDL	00:36:56,960	00:37:03,360	| serial-s03-e06 |	An appeals court later ruled that the trial should not have gone forward with that notice pending so now as I write this
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:07,200	| serial-s03-e06 |	In 2018 the verdict in Arnold glass case has been overturned
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:11,552	| serial-s03-e06 |	Now the cello is Awana peeling he's not sure if he'll prevail
EDL	00:37:11,552	00:37:13,344	| serial-s03-e06 |	He might have to retry this case
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:20,512	| serial-s03-e06 |	Civil lawsuits are supposed to lead to reform that's the hope the city will fix the problems that are costing it
EDL	00:37:20,512	00:37:26,144	| serial-s03-e06 |	A lot of money we talked to 11 attorneys who do civil rights cases in Cuyahoga County
EDL	00:37:26,144	00:37:27,936	| serial-s03-e06 |	What attorney said yeah bring it
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:30,240	| serial-s03-e06 |	I have no problem pulling the trigger against East Cleveland
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:32,544	| serial-s03-e06 |	The other 10 attorneys
EDL	00:37:32,544	00:37:35,616	| serial-s03-e06 |	No way they said not worth it said one
EDL	00:37:35,616	00:37:39,712	| serial-s03-e06 |	Add a business to run to another we heard there's no reward we heard
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:40,480	| serial-s03-e06 |	It's a b****
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:41,248	| serial-s03-e06 |	You heard
EDL	00:37:41,248	00:37:44,064	| serial-s03-e06 |	I turned out any case that comes from East Cleveland
EDL	00:37:44,064	00:37:44,832	| serial-s03-e06 |	And it's heartbreaking
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:48,672	| serial-s03-e06 |	In other words Arnold black is a cautionary Tale
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:50,464	| serial-s03-e06 |	What makes the cello nuts
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:51,488	| serial-s03-e06 |	He doesn't see it that way
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:54,048	| serial-s03-e06 |	Mrs. Arnold black doesn't either
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:59,936	| serial-s03-e06 |	The city hasn't paid Arnold like a dime but he has gotten quite a bit of money as a result of a lawsuit
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:05,056	| serial-s03-e06 |	Chroma funding company that loans plaintiffs Money based on likely verdict I told financial industry apparel
EDL	00:38:05,824	00:38:11,712	| serial-s03-e06 |	But more to the point dichello says there's no public record of how he's Cleveland was running as Police Department
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:14,528	| serial-s03-e06 |	This case this verdict was national news
EDL	00:38:15,040	00:38:16,576	| serial-s03-e06 |	Because it went to trial
EDL	00:38:16,576	00:38:17,856	| serial-s03-e06 |	I'm talking about it right now
EDL	00:38:20,672	00:38:26,304	| serial-s03-e06 |	I asked a cello can you understand though how someone like Jesse Nickerson might not want to spend six
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:27,584	| serial-s03-e06 |	Plus years fighting the city
EDL	00:38:28,096	00:38:29,120	| serial-s03-e06 |	Especially if they live there
EDL	00:38:29,632	00:38:33,216	| serial-s03-e06 |	Mitchell said yeah but if a client did tell him that he pushed back
EDL	00:38:33,728	00:38:35,520	| serial-s03-e06 |	With a speech that goes something like this
EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:38,336	| serial-s03-e06 |	We are the police of the police
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:39,872	| serial-s03-e06 |	By constitutional mandate
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:41,408	| serial-s03-e06 |	Thank God
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:44,992	| serial-s03-e06 |	This is got to be about you understand what's happening
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:47,808	| serial-s03-e06 |	Do you understand what their lives are there that are at stake here
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:49,088	| serial-s03-e06 |	It does impact us all
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:51,648	| serial-s03-e06 |	You're the guy you sneaked out and you know
EDL	00:38:51,648	00:38:53,952	| serial-s03-e06 |	Got out of the way the bully for a few bucks good job
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:59,328	| serial-s03-e06 |	Disappointed but did your community matter to you and if it didn't get the response comes back no
EDL	00:38:59,328	00:39:02,656	| serial-s03-e06 |	It doesn't I don't do it then I'm duty-bound to listen to my client
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:04,192	| serial-s03-e06 |	I get that
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:07,264	| serial-s03-e06 |	But I understand what's going to continue and we'll have that Converse
