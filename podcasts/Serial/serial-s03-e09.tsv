EDL	00:00:57,600	00:00:59,392	| serial-s03-e09 |	Previously on serial
EDL	00:01:01,696	00:01:03,744	| serial-s03-e09 |	That's fine but you still have to go through this
EDL	00:01:10,656	00:01:13,216	| serial-s03-e09 |	I have talked that they would check in on him and
EDL	00:01:13,216	00:01:15,264	| serial-s03-e09 |	Hope that that means
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:19,104	| serial-s03-e09 |	Somehow protecting him
EDL	00:01:21,920	00:01:23,712	| serial-s03-e09 |	Why would you have any court dates
EDL	00:01:23,712	00:01:25,248	| serial-s03-e09 |	Why would you have a court date coming up
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:32,672	| serial-s03-e09 |	From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago
EDL	00:01:32,672	00:01:38,816	| serial-s03-e09 |	It's serial one Courthouse told week by week I'm Sarah Koenig
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:48,544	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua was correct
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:53,664	| serial-s03-e09 |	The state was trying to invoke his syo they wanted to send them to adult prison
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:57,760	| serial-s03-e09 |	The morning after he called me I did inquire Dover at the Juvenile Justice Center
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:59,040	| serial-s03-e09 |	See what was what
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:02,112	| serial-s03-e09 |	So I'm actually have to
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:03,392	| serial-s03-e09 |	Courthouse right now
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:05,952	| serial-s03-e09 |	Are you at
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:09,536	| serial-s03-e09 |	So they're just going to set a date for
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:13,376	| serial-s03-e09 |	I guess hearing or the next whatever is going to happen next
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:15,424	| serial-s03-e09 |	But
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:17,216	| serial-s03-e09 |	But yeah how are you doing
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:21,568	| serial-s03-e09 |	I was up all night last night
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:26,944	| serial-s03-e09 |	I was thinking about last night
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:30,784	| serial-s03-e09 |	All I can muster was a solution that when I was Joshua's age
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:32,832	| serial-s03-e09 |	I was on irritating
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:33,856	| serial-s03-e09 |	Baidu
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:38,208	| serial-s03-e09 |	Alright try to get some sleep it's nothing's going to be better if you don't get sleep
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:48,448	| serial-s03-e09 |	I know you're worried I know you're worried
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:49,472	| serial-s03-e09 |	I know
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:53,056	| serial-s03-e09 |	It's not my job to comfort Joshua
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:54,848	| serial-s03-e09 |	Certainly not my job to tell him to go to bed
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:57,920	| serial-s03-e09 |	But I happen to be the one on the phone right now
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:00,736	| serial-s03-e09 |	Out of all the cases we watched
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:02,272	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua's got me most
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:05,344	| serial-s03-e09 |	I could not fathom that the state would give up on him
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:07,648	| serial-s03-e09 |	After all he dressed for law enforcement
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:09,440	| serial-s03-e09 |	I'd rather beat down teams org
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:10,464	| serial-s03-e09 |	A 19 year old kid
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:13,280	| serial-s03-e09 |	I did what I knew how to do
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:15,584	| serial-s03-e09 |	I reported out every beat of this sucker
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:16,608	| serial-s03-e09 |	Every turn
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:18,912	| serial-s03-e09 |	Go to Joshua almost everyday sometimes twice a day
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:20,448	| serial-s03-e09 |	For year-and-a-half
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:23,008	| serial-s03-e09 |	So that the story of Joshua would exist
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:25,056	| serial-s03-e09 |	Not for posterity sake
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:27,104	| serial-s03-e09 |	But for the sake of straight-up fairness
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:34,016	| serial-s03-e09 |	First thing I wanted to know
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:37,600	| serial-s03-e09 |	Why Joshua what was odys saying he done
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:41,696	| serial-s03-e09 |	I met the one with Jackson from their facilities and put them into the adult system
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:47,584	| serial-s03-e09 |	I got a copy of the motion to invoke Joshua's syo filed by the County prosecutor's office
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:50,656	| serial-s03-e09 |	Are the requests of the juvenile prison Indian River
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:56,288	| serial-s03-e09 |	Emotion claimed that Joshua created a substantial risk to the safety or security of the institution
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:59,360	| serial-s03-e09 |	But despite all the therapeutic programming Joshua completed
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:02,432	| serial-s03-e09 |	He consistently chooses to make criminal decisions
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:09,856	| serial-s03-e09 |	Then there's a list of about a dozen specific incidents just from the past 6 months assaults fights disruptive
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:12,160	| serial-s03-e09 |	Behaviors its own urine on a kid
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:14,464	| serial-s03-e09 |	It's on a remote control at a female guard
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:16,256	| serial-s03-e09 |	Get smashed video game console
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:19,839	| serial-s03-e09 |	Add later find out the incident that triggered the motion to invoke
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:23,167	| serial-s03-e09 |	Apparently Joshua had put out a hit on another kid
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:25,727	| serial-s03-e09 |	But usually means arranging for other kids to jump someone
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:30,335	| serial-s03-e09 |	The kid wasn't jumped but still the prosecutors considered it a serious threat
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:36,479	| serial-s03-e09 |	I got to say I was taken aback by the list I had that anxious jolt of hold up
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:41,087	| serial-s03-e09 |	Have I completely misunderstood who this person is Elizabeth bad
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:43,647	| serial-s03-e09 |	The summer at the end extensive
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:46,463	| serial-s03-e09 |	16 fights 6 menacing threats
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:47,999	| serial-s03-e09 |	21 disruptive behaviors
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:50,559	| serial-s03-e09 |	Etc but
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:52,095	| serial-s03-e09 |	I have another report
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:54,143	| serial-s03-e09 |	An internal odys report
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:59,007	| serial-s03-e09 |	The documents every incident involving Joshua whether as victim or aggressor
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:01,311	| serial-s03-e09 |	Promised all his time and odys custody
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:08,479	| serial-s03-e09 |	I want to cross reference request to invoke Joshua's syo with that internal odys report
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:09,247	| serial-s03-e09 |	I realized
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:12,575	| serial-s03-e09 |	These aren't isolated incidents
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:14,623	| serial-s03-e09 |	Many of them are connected
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:17,951	| serial-s03-e09 |	There's an assault
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:19,999	| serial-s03-e09 |	When Joshua hit a kid on February 3rd
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:21,791	| serial-s03-e09 |	What's missing
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:23,071	| serial-s03-e09 |	Is February 2nd
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:25,119	| serial-s03-e09 |	What you can see on that internal report
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:29,215	| serial-s03-e09 |	February 2nd that same kid walked up to Joshua the water fountain
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:30,239	| serial-s03-e09 |	And punched him in the face
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:32,799	| serial-s03-e09 |	There are few sequences like this
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:36,895	| serial-s03-e09 |	Tit for Tat sandwich only the top was included in the request to invoke his that's why I O
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:40,991	| serial-s03-e09 |	Yes indeed Joshua did throw pee at a kid on March 27th
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:44,575	| serial-s03-e09 |	3 before the same kid had assaulted Joshua
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:45,599	| serial-s03-e09 |	Entropy on him
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,647	| serial-s03-e09 |	Common weapon in juvenile
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:54,047	| serial-s03-e09 |	I'm in the list of Joshua's offenses by people who either work in odys
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:56,095	| serial-s03-e09 |	On behalf of kids inside odys
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:57,631	| serial-s03-e09 |	And I said
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:58,911	| serial-s03-e09 |	Sounds great but
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:01,215	| serial-s03-e09 |	Yeah for a kid who's been in there 3 years
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:01,983	| serial-s03-e09 |	Exceptional
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:06,079	| serial-s03-e09 |	Is cardhu known Joshua for a couple of years
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:08,639	| serial-s03-e09 |	She told me overall not a troublemaker
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:11,711	| serial-s03-e09 |	Not even on the radar in terms of major threats inside the facility
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:14,271	| serial-s03-e09 |	He gets mad sometimes you said
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:16,063	| serial-s03-e09 |	But usually for a legitimate reason
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:19,391	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua did throw a video gamer motor guard for instance
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:23,487	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua told me that's because the guard discussed his case in front of other kids
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:25,279	| serial-s03-e09 |	Snitches get stitches
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:28,607	| serial-s03-e09 |	Isn't she apologized later and they were cool after that
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:31,423	| serial-s03-e09 |	But there it was in their quest to invoke
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:33,727	| serial-s03-e09 |	Another incident on the list
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:37,823	| serial-s03-e09 |	Sounded as if Joshua had caused a car to get hurt during a fight
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:40,383	| serial-s03-e09 |	He said not accurate he was trying to defend the guard
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:43,199	| serial-s03-e09 |	The one time I visited Indian River
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:45,759	| serial-s03-e09 |	I'm at the same Garden passing she confirmed it
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:47,807	| serial-s03-e09 |	He was trying to protect me she said
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:49,343	| serial-s03-e09 |	Call Joshua honey
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:55,743	| serial-s03-e09 |	Again I couldn't interview anyone at odys on the record they don't participate in stories about specific youth
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:07:02,143	| serial-s03-e09 |	But in a statement they reiterated that they do investigate allegations of misconduct and take action when necessary
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:05,983	| serial-s03-e09 |	When I put the two reports side by side
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:12,895	| serial-s03-e09 |	What I saw was the Raggedy morally compromised Chronicle for the kid at War Joshua wasn't only a victim
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:14,687	| serial-s03-e09 |	Store with the only a perpetrator
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:17,247	| serial-s03-e09 |	Like a lot of kids inside odys
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:21,599	| serial-s03-e09 |	He was both the most powerful gang in juvenile prison was after him
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:24,415	| serial-s03-e09 |	Color guards couldn't be trusted everyday
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:25,439	| serial-s03-e09 |	He felt unsafe
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:31,071	| serial-s03-e09 |	So we created alliances where he could dominated where he could took advantage where you could
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:37,471	| serial-s03-e09 |	Sun protection where I could but didn't make his behavior right then again odys prison
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:40,031	| serial-s03-e09 |	Really spin on an axis of right and wrong
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:43,103	| serial-s03-e09 |	See previous episode
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:48,223	| serial-s03-e09 |	The prosecutors offer Joshua deal
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:50,527	| serial-s03-e09 |	He didn't fight the vine over
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:52,319	| serial-s03-e09 |	And transferred to adult prison
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:53,343	| serial-s03-e09 |	Ticket 9 years
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:55,647	| serial-s03-e09 |	It went forward with the hearing
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:58,463	| serial-s03-e09 |	Set up an argument he could end up with more than that
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:07:59,743	| serial-s03-e09 |	As many as 18 years
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:03,583	| serial-s03-e09 |	Josh was assigned attorney with a guy named Jim whole flick
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:07,423	| serial-s03-e09 |	Jim hosek hadn't done one of these syo invocations before
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:08,959	| serial-s03-e09 |	How many people in the county had
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:11,775	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua didn't know whether to take the deal
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:14,335	| serial-s03-e09 |	What's the westhouse hotel Nia
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:25,343	| serial-s03-e09 |	But he said he's inclined to fight it

EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:50,943	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua tried to Marshal support
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:55,295	| serial-s03-e09 |	He has some odys staff members to write letters to the court on his behalf
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:57,343	| serial-s03-e09 |	Cuz if you told them they were willing
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:09:02,975	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua's father who was in Jamaica pledge to hire Josh a private attorney just needed to arrange for payment
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:08,095	| serial-s03-e09 |	In the meantime Indian River declare that it wanted Joshua out now
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:10,399	| serial-s03-e09 |	While they waited for the final hearing on his ass yo
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:13,215	| serial-s03-e09 |	The superintendent claim Joshua is causing
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:15,775	| serial-s03-e09 |	Environment of constant response and panic
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:18,847	| serial-s03-e09 |	Court magistrate okay the transfer
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:20,639	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua was delivered to county jail
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:22,175	| serial-s03-e09 |	Adult County Jail
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:29,343	| serial-s03-e09 |	A couple of weeks went by and I can hear on the phone that Joshua was acclimating to the idea of an adult sentence
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:30,367	| serial-s03-e09 |	In adult prison
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:33,439	| serial-s03-e09 |	Decompress the nine years in his head
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:35,231	| serial-s03-e09 |	It really be 6 years
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:37,279	| serial-s03-e09 |	Since he'd already spent a few years in ody us
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:39,071	| serial-s03-e09 |	Probably less than six
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:40,607	| serial-s03-e09 |	It is granted judicial release
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:44,959	| serial-s03-e09 |	Bingham County with all these guys were getting walloped with big sentences
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:48,031	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua had a fresh perspective on the number 6
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:10:00,831	| serial-s03-e09 |	17 years
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:02,879	| serial-s03-e09 |	Dislike
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:15,167	| serial-s03-e09 |	Compare two double digits he was saying
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,959	| serial-s03-e09 |	Maybe six was a lucky break
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:30,271	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua's brought to court the morning of his hearing he still didn't know what he was going to do
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:32,319	| serial-s03-e09 |	He met with Jim hosek
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:34,367	| serial-s03-e09 |	Who laid out the probable truth
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:37,183	| serial-s03-e09 |	But today nine years was the best case scenario
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:38,975	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua took the deal
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:42,815	| serial-s03-e09 |	Dashiell proceeding is hard to stomach
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:44,607	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua stood there
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:45,375	| serial-s03-e09 |	Crying
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:48,191	| serial-s03-e09 |	A few of his umpteen yes ma'ams barely Audible
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:53,055	| serial-s03-e09 |	And that you have demonstrated by your conduct
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:57,407	| serial-s03-e09 |	That Rehabilitation during the remaining period of juvenile jurisdiction is unlikely
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:03,039	| serial-s03-e09 |	I want point the judge ask someone to fetch Joshua some Kleenex
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:05,855	| serial-s03-e09 |	No one had come to his rescue
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:09,695	| serial-s03-e09 |	His father hadn't hired the private lawyer he said he was going to hire
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:13,023	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua civil attorneys never did file a lawsuit on Joshua's behalf
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:17,119	| serial-s03-e09 |	The Indian River staff who told Joshua that stick up for him vouch for his progress
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:18,143	| serial-s03-e09 |	Not here
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:20,959	| serial-s03-e09 |	I learn they've been firmly reminded
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:22,495	| serial-s03-e09 |	You work for odys
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:27,359	| serial-s03-e09 |	While we're at it we're the FBI agents would seem to like Joshua back in 2014
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:29,151	| serial-s03-e09 |	When I told him to check on him
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:30,943	| serial-s03-e09 |	I got it
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:32,991	| serial-s03-e09 |	Who's all too messy
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:33,503	| serial-s03-e09 |	Too much
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:35,551	| serial-s03-e09 |	All those incidents on the list
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:36,575	| serial-s03-e09 |	The contacts
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:38,623	| serial-s03-e09 |	Tit for Tat who started what
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:39,903	| serial-s03-e09 |	Too messy
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:42,463	| serial-s03-e09 |	Told me
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:45,791	| serial-s03-e09 |	Sure we could have picked apart three or four of the incidents on that list
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,327	| serial-s03-e09 |	Explained
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:50,143	| serial-s03-e09 |	Fights on paper are more intricate than they appear
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:53,215	| serial-s03-e09 |	What about the 40 other items
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:54,239	| serial-s03-e09 |	Teetering just behind
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:56,543	| serial-s03-e09 |	They're going to be crushed them hoes like said
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,591	| serial-s03-e09 |	But the sheer volume of incidents
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:01,919	| serial-s03-e09 |	One person who had shown up
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:03,455	| serial-s03-e09 |	Josh was only Witness
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:04,479	| serial-s03-e09 |	Lashayla Turner
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:06,783	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua is Mentor from Freedom School
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:09,855	| serial-s03-e09 |	She said gym hopefully I could contact her yesterday
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:12,415	| serial-s03-e09 |	She thought she might be called upon to testify
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:14,463	| serial-s03-e09 |	The Turner was upset
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:16,511	| serial-s03-e09 |	I thought it could be spot she said
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:20,351	| serial-s03-e09 |	I really thought I could be fought
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:23,167	| serial-s03-e09 |	In his letter to invoke Joshua's syo
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:27,263	| serial-s03-e09 |	What do is it written that there was no more they could do to rehabilitate Joshua
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:30,847	| serial-s03-e09 |	After no additional interventions and treatments that can be attempted
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:33,151	| serial-s03-e09 |	It is unfortunate they wrote
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:35,711	| serial-s03-e09 |	That he threw away the opportunity he was given
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:40,319	| serial-s03-e09 |	Stadia that Joshua is unfixable was Turner said
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:42,879	| serial-s03-e09 |	That part of it is completely yes
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:46,975	| serial-s03-e09 |	Miss Turner isn't some wide-eyed advocate
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:49,535	| serial-s03-e09 |	She's worked with lots of kids in juvenile facilities
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:53,119	| serial-s03-e09 |	For masters in public administration with a focus on youth policy
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:54,911	| serial-s03-e09 |	She's from East Cleveland
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:58,751	| serial-s03-e09 |	To the deep and personal experience with the good and the bad of gangs
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:02,079	| serial-s03-e09 |	She agrees that some of the kids at Indian River aren't ready to come out yet
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:05,151	| serial-s03-e09 |	But they are still works in not quite enough progress
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:10,015	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua though she said he is not one of the ones she most worried about
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:13,087	| serial-s03-e09 |	And he's not one of the ones odys should be most worried about
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:15,391	| serial-s03-e09 |	She does not accept that he hasn't progressed
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:17,439	| serial-s03-e09 |	Because to her
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:22,047	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua at 19 such a far cry from Joshua at 16
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:28,191	| serial-s03-e09 |	When he was the Hot Head Eric and a****** that judge when you met at first that I met verse
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:32,799	| serial-s03-e09 |	There's no doubt in my mind that that's when the conversation should have been had
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:39,199	| serial-s03-e09 |	The conversation of should we find them out absolutely because he's becoming expensive facility and he was a child.
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:45,599	| serial-s03-e09 |	Could he be rehabilitated a question of the big guy had a complete question and didn't think that he could
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:49,951	| serial-s03-e09 |	Sister said the only fight they had in Freedom School inside the facility only one
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:50,719	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:57,631	| serial-s03-e09 |	His first week in the program he stood up on a chair and spit on somebody like I mean just outraged
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:14:00,703	| serial-s03-e09 |	Even in conversation with him after that it was his
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:03,007	| serial-s03-e09 |	Arrogance to him it was this
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:05,311	| serial-s03-e09 |	Haughtiness
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:10,943	| serial-s03-e09 |	Lily doesn't exist in him
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:11,711	| serial-s03-e09 |	Anymore
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:13,759	| serial-s03-e09 |	Sota now
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:15,807	| serial-s03-e09 |	Serious conversation completely change
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:16,319	| serial-s03-e09 |	2
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:19,391	| serial-s03-e09 |	I want to get out of here I want to be a better person
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:22,207	| serial-s03-e09 |	I'm asking
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:26,559	| serial-s03-e09 |	To not be put into these situations I'm asking you put on a different unit
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:29,631	| serial-s03-e09 |	Saratoga this been crying out
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:30,143	| serial-s03-e09 |	Saying
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:31,935	| serial-s03-e09 |	This is what I need
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:32,959	| serial-s03-e09 |	I want to get out of this
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:35,007	| serial-s03-e09 |	And you ignore that
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:37,311	| serial-s03-e09 |	What most disturbs Miss Turner
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:41,407	| serial-s03-e09 |	It was Joshua whose ethics and behavior were being scrutinized and punished
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:44,735	| serial-s03-e09 |	I know no one would look at what the state had done to him
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:47,039	| serial-s03-e09 |	I think Joshua is the
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:50,111	| serial-s03-e09 |	Best case example
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:52,159	| serial-s03-e09 |	FYI
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:58,559	| serial-s03-e09 |	Is so bogus when we have these expectations for kids to speak up about what's happening in the community as a test of
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:02,911	| serial-s03-e09 |	And things like that and we see the ramifications
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:04,959	| serial-s03-e09 |	And how we don't wrap around to protect that
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:11,615	| serial-s03-e09 |	I think the biggest issue isn't that Joshua hasn't held up his end of the bargain
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:13,407	| serial-s03-e09 |	Is that the state hasn't held up theirs
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:15,455	| serial-s03-e09 |	Family protected him
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:19,551	| serial-s03-e09 |	Having protected him from the gang he inflamed
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:25,695	| serial-s03-e09 |	By testifying for the state
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:40,287	| serial-s03-e09 |	More in a minute

EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:40,191	| serial-s03-e09 |	What do they smell like
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:44,287	| serial-s03-e09 |	The smell is probably a lot like a ichiza starting to spoil
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:46,847	| serial-s03-e09 |	Which is a symptom of an ear infection

EDL	00:18:58,687	00:19:02,527	| serial-s03-e09 |	They're going to drive him from County Jail to an intake prison about 40 minutes from Cleveland

EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:44,255	| serial-s03-e09 |	County is not a place you want to spend even one extra day
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:47,327	| serial-s03-e09 |	Insult to injury Joshua had no money on his books

EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:55,007	| serial-s03-e09 |	Why were they keeping him in County
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:56,543	| serial-s03-e09 |	What do they want with him
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:02,431	| serial-s03-e09 |	Yeah I think that's pretty much what's happening
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:04,223	| serial-s03-e09 |	Yeah
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:08,063	| serial-s03-e09 |	After it sat in jail for a month of Tuesdays and Thursdays
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:10,367	| serial-s03-e09 |	I emailed him hopefully to ask Anton age
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:13,183	| serial-s03-e09 |	Can you explain why Joshua still in County
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:14,975	| serial-s03-e09 |	His response
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:16,255	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua Stone County
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:19,327	| serial-s03-e09 |	Jim hope it wasn't Joshua's lawyer anymore
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:20,607	| serial-s03-e09 |	He said he'd look into it
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:27,263	| serial-s03-e09 |	Kim discovered a communication breakdown between the juvenile court and the county sheriff's office which one's the jail
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:34,175	| serial-s03-e09 |	Administratively no one knew or seem to notice or care that they didn't know who had jurisdiction over Josh
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:34,943	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:36,479	| serial-s03-e09 |	But Jim said they clear it up
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:39,807	| serial-s03-e09 |	Josh and I developed a new routine
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:41,087	| serial-s03-e09 |	He called me and asked
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:42,367	| serial-s03-e09 |	Any word from history
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:43,391	| serial-s03-e09 |	Can I say something like
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:46,975	| serial-s03-e09 |	So apparently now everybody knows what's up and
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:48,767	| serial-s03-e09 |	Lady doctors for you
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:53,375	| serial-s03-e09 |	Nope that was early November

EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:56,959	| serial-s03-e09 |	2 months after you've been sentenced
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:59,263	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua was still lousy and County
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:02,079	| serial-s03-e09 |	I'd run out of encouraging reports from the outside
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:07,711	| serial-s03-e09 |	Somebody at some point has to do something that's what that's all I know
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:13,343	| serial-s03-e09 |	Somebody at some point we'll have to do something they cannot keep you in County Jail indefinitely
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:16,416	| serial-s03-e09 |	I don't know what they doing
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:19,744	| serial-s03-e09 |	The metaphor could not have been clumsier
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:22,048	| serial-s03-e09 |	The government had forgotten about Joshua
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:24,864	| serial-s03-e09 |	In County Jail
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:26,400	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua was bored
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:31,264	| serial-s03-e09 |	Sometimes it be cooked in a Cell they all would be really 24 hours straight
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:33,824	| serial-s03-e09 |	I noticed
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:35,104	| serial-s03-e09 |	The Joshua
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:36,384	| serial-s03-e09 |	He wasn't raging
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:37,664	| serial-s03-e09 |	Women getting in fights
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:42,784	| serial-s03-e09 |	You know you sound like you sound pretty good

EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:14,016	| serial-s03-e09 |	Just did their jobs as far as you could tell
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:15,552	| serial-s03-e09 |	People are nicer to one another
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:18,368	| serial-s03-e09 |	More relaxed with one another more supportive he said
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:24,768	| serial-s03-e09 |	Who's noticing what I noticed in the shift from middle school to high school just because one person didn't like you. Didn't mean
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:26,048	| serial-s03-e09 |	In the whole pod was against you
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:30,912	| serial-s03-e09 |	It was something of a revelation to him even white people do okay in here he said
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:47,296	| serial-s03-e09 |	The other young man I'd spoken to Leo Malik Davon white kid named wave
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:50,624	| serial-s03-e09 |	We've been in both odys and then an adult jail
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:51,392	| serial-s03-e09 |	But all agreed
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:53,184	| serial-s03-e09 |	That is it was
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:54,464	| serial-s03-e09 |	Dangerous as it was
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:56,512	| serial-s03-e09 |	Still better than juvenile
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:57,280	| serial-s03-e09 |	Less stress
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:22:59,840	| serial-s03-e09 |	The same feeling
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:01,120	| serial-s03-e09 |	Less stress more relaxed
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:05,472	| serial-s03-e09 |	Would stretch out and hold true when Joshua arrived at adult prison

EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:13,664	| serial-s03-e09 |	In Lima Ohio
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:14,944	| serial-s03-e09 |	Set a 3 hour drive from Cleveland
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:16,736	| serial-s03-e09 |	Swiss Family couldn't visit
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:19,552	| serial-s03-e09 |	But Joshua was just happy to be sprung from his cell
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:22,112	| serial-s03-e09 |	She walking back and forth just cuz I can
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:27,232	| serial-s03-e09 |	Because he cooperated

EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:31,584	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua was put in protective custody

EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:36,960	| serial-s03-e09 |	He wasn't feuding with other inmates are getting into it with CEOs
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:38,752	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua marveled
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:42,080	| serial-s03-e09 |	There were fewer guards yet the inmates had more freedom
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:45,920	| serial-s03-e09 |	Part of it was maturity he said people trying to get home to your kids
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:49,248	| serial-s03-e09 |	The main reason the adult system was better he said
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:50,784	| serial-s03-e09 |	Was because it was harsher
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:53,344	| serial-s03-e09 |	Haider less forgiving ship all around
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:55,648	| serial-s03-e09 |	If you fight or act out
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:56,928	| serial-s03-e09 |	Throw your in on a CSA

EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:48,896	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua said
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:51,456	| serial-s03-e09 |	Juveniles take advantage of that s***
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:51,968	| serial-s03-e09 |	The max

EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:07,584	| serial-s03-e09 |	You
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:10,144	| serial-s03-e09 |	The only understands who you feel me
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:13,216	| serial-s03-e09 |	County Jail was better than juvenile
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:16,032	| serial-s03-e09 |	Adult prison was better than County Jail
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:17,312	| serial-s03-e09 |	Harsher punishment
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:18,848	| serial-s03-e09 |	Was better than let at 8
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:22,432	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua's world had rotated 180

EDL	00:33:56,224	00:33:57,248	| serial-s03-e09 |	Once Joshua got out
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:33:59,808	| serial-s03-e09 |	Did you think Joshua could have an okay future
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:02,368	| serial-s03-e09 |	When that didn't include Perpetual incarceration
EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:05,184	| serial-s03-e09 |	Right now at this point
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:07,744	| serial-s03-e09 |	Because why
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:11,328	| serial-s03-e09 |	Treason
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:16,960	| serial-s03-e09 |	Negativity
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:22,848	| serial-s03-e09 |	I hated this answer
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:28,224	| serial-s03-e09 |	Because Joshua was bound over he would now have an adult felony record
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:32,576	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua knew that would react the most long-term damage to his prospects once he got out
EDL	00:34:33,600	00:34:36,928	| serial-s03-e09 |	Tattoos began creeping back onto his hands and neck and face
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:43,584	| serial-s03-e09 |	All the places you had them removed before
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:56,640	| serial-s03-e09 |	I spent many phone calls looking up people on the internet for Joshua people he knew from
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:58,688	| serial-s03-e09 |	Cleveland County Jail
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:35:00,736	| serial-s03-e09 |	Charges he was asking
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:02,016	| serial-s03-e09 |	Are they going to trial
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:05,344	| serial-s03-e09 |	People who already been sentenced
EDL	00:35:05,856	00:35:06,880	| serial-s03-e09 |	How long they got
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:11,744	| serial-s03-e09 |	Which institution can give me the inmate number tell me the zip code again
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:13,024	| serial-s03-e09 |	Who's writing to them
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:14,304	| serial-s03-e09 |	Making contact
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:19,680	| serial-s03-e09 |	But some of the people he was having me look up their cases sounded terrible
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:21,472	| serial-s03-e09 |	Premeditated murder
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:24,032	| serial-s03-e09 |	A shot and then burned in a car
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:26,336	| serial-s03-e09 |	I asked him what are you doing
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:30,688	| serial-s03-e09 |	Looks like what you did with your pass is
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:33,248	| serial-s03-e09 |	That I'm not here to judge nobody
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:38,624	| serial-s03-e09 |	Like nobody is perfect everybody in this world made bad choices before

EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:01,664	| serial-s03-e09 |	Sometimes a good friend
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:11,392	| serial-s03-e09 |	He was being kind
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:15,232	| serial-s03-e09 |	And I understood he was trying to give other people what he himself needed
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:17,792	| serial-s03-e09 |	Reminder that he wasn't a piece of s***
EDL	00:36:17,792	00:36:19,072	| serial-s03-e09 |	Throughs forgivable
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:19,584	| serial-s03-e09 |	Redeemable
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:24,960	| serial-s03-e09 |	He was taking a position far more Humane than the one that Criminal Justice System had taken with him
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:28,032	| serial-s03-e09 |	Try to think for a minute about why I was getting angry
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:32,384	| serial-s03-e09 |	I realized this community of inmates who was stitching together
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:33,408	| serial-s03-e09 |	Was worrying me
EDL	00:36:33,408	00:36:34,176	| serial-s03-e09 |	When you got out
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:37,504	| serial-s03-e09 |	So I think my reaction and having is like
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:43,392	| serial-s03-e09 |	Could you just please stay the f*** away from some criminals for a while so that
EDL	00:36:43,904	00:36:46,208	| serial-s03-e09 |	I'm not falling back into that world
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:49,536	| serial-s03-e09 |	And I think that's why I'm having this reaction which is it
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:54,400	| serial-s03-e09 |	Stairs to you
EDL	00:36:55,424	00:36:57,472	| serial-s03-e09 |	Sometimes you send me so that's why I
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:36:59,008	| serial-s03-e09 |	It is like like it's not that
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:03,104	| serial-s03-e09 |	Feisty
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:18,976	| serial-s03-e09 |	It's tempting to think that all this prison and Punishment lead somewhere
EDL	00:37:18,976	00:37:20,512	| serial-s03-e09 |	But there's a goal we can point to
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:22,816	| serial-s03-e09 |	People who commit crimes
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:27,424	| serial-s03-e09 |	Maybe if they turn their lives around a Civic reward awaits them back home
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:29,728	| serial-s03-e09 |	For someone like Joshua
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:32,288	| serial-s03-e09 |	It's hard to imagine what that reward would be
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:36,384	| serial-s03-e09 |	Ms Turner I told me the young men she's worked with inside the prison
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:40,736	| serial-s03-e09 |	Could you been able to crack open their feelings make themselves vulnerable
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:42,784	| serial-s03-e09 |	She's watched many of them come home
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:44,832	| serial-s03-e09 |	And then crumble
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:48,416	| serial-s03-e09 |	Because they're back and violent neighborhoods where they need armor to survive
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:50,464	| serial-s03-e09 |	She told me
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:56,864	| serial-s03-e09 |	The most successful ones I hate to say the ones that are communicating that they actually feel Joy
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:37:58,912	| serial-s03-e09 |	Are the ones who went back to the streets
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:38:00,960	| serial-s03-e09 |	Joshua new
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:06,592	| serial-s03-e09 |	You said it to me many times his only chance of survival was to never go back to Cleveland
EDL	00:38:06,592	00:38:09,664	| serial-s03-e09 |	If you returned home he was going to end up hurting someone
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:11,200	| serial-s03-e09 |	Or getting hurt
EDL	00:38:11,200	00:38:17,344	| serial-s03-e09 |	Right back at the Justice Center

EDL	00:46:18,623	00:46:20,927	| serial-s03-e09 |	Cool minimalist
EDL	00:46:20,927	00:46:25,279	| serial-s03-e09 |	Don't file charges on to a single crime when one charge will do
EDL	00:46:25,279	00:46:27,071	| serial-s03-e09 |	Don't overcharge the force that guilty plea
EDL	00:46:27,839	00:46:30,655	| serial-s03-e09 |	Don't lock anyone up unless they're demonstrable violent
EDL	00:46:30,655	00:46:33,983	| serial-s03-e09 |	Admit that police officers lie under oath
EDL	00:46:33,983	00:46:38,079	| serial-s03-e09 |	Get out of the punishment business and turned for the Urgent problem of fairness
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:43,455	| serial-s03-e09 |	Keep obsessive track of who exactly is being charged with what crime
EDL	00:46:43,455	00:46:47,039	| serial-s03-e09 |	Other setting shakes out and what their life looks like in 3 years or 5 years
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:50,111	| serial-s03-e09 |	Take me to the color of their skin and how much money they have
EDL	00:46:50,623	00:46:53,439	| serial-s03-e09 |	Don't share what you learn in a drawer and forget about it
EDL	00:46:53,439	00:46:56,767	| serial-s03-e09 |	Don't be insensibly tempted as Charles Dickens wrote
EDL	00:46:56,767	00:47:00,863	| serial-s03-e09 |	Into a loose way of letting bad things alone to take their own bad course
EDL	00:47:01,887	00:47:04,447	| serial-s03-e09 |	Cops prosecutors judges lawyers
EDL	00:47:04,447	00:47:07,007	| serial-s03-e09 |	Call out the colleagues who degrade your profession
EDL	00:47:07,775	00:47:11,871	| serial-s03-e09 |	Find attorneys in public defenders at least twice as much as you're paying them now
EDL	00:47:11,871	00:47:18,015	| serial-s03-e09 |	Judges stop choosing attorneys citizens mix up the bench stop electing judges County
EDL	00:47:19,039	00:47:21,855	| serial-s03-e09 |	Overall slowdown doubt yourself
EDL	00:47:22,623	00:47:24,671	| serial-s03-e09 |	I know how corny the sounds but
EDL	00:47:24,671	00:47:28,511	| serial-s03-e09 |	Imagine that every person in the elevator car is part of your own family
EDL	00:47:29,023	00:47:31,583	| serial-s03-e09 |	And reflect on the far-reaching paying of prosecution
EDL	00:47:32,607	00:47:35,423	| serial-s03-e09 |	Also don't take anyone's mouth shut in court that happened
EDL	00:47:35,935	00:47:38,239	| serial-s03-e09 |	And consider getting rid of the grand jury
EDL	00:47:38,239	00:47:40,287	| serial-s03-e09 |	I could cram that will to bursting
EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:42,591	| serial-s03-e09 |	If I'm only allowed one suggestion
EDL	00:47:43,103	00:47:43,615	| serial-s03-e09 |	I say
EDL	00:47:44,127	00:47:46,175	| serial-s03-e09 |	Let's all accept that something's gone wrong
EDL	00:47:46,687	00:47:47,967	| serial-s03-e09 |	Let's make that our premise
EDL	00:47:49,503	00:47:54,111	| serial-s03-e09 |	Many times during a reporting in Cleveland when I ask about problems are reforms
EDL	00:47:54,111	00:47:55,391	| serial-s03-e09 |	Someone would throw out
EDL	00:47:55,391	00:47:57,695	| serial-s03-e09 |	Well let's remember we have the best system in the world
EDL	00:47:58,463	00:48:00,767	| serial-s03-e09 |	County prosecutor Michael O'Malley said it to me
EDL	00:48:00,767	00:48:04,351	| serial-s03-e09 |	I just think people need to realize we have the best criminal justice system in the world
EDL	00:48:05,631	00:48:10,495	| serial-s03-e09 |	The people who operate that system know about the wards and they can see we can always improve
EDL	00:48:11,519	00:48:13,567	| serial-s03-e09 |	But generally they're not chomping for an overhaul
EDL	00:48:14,079	00:48:17,663	| serial-s03-e09 |	The kind of Extreme Makeover that the data is screaming at us to undertake
EDL	00:48:18,175	00:48:19,199	| serial-s03-e09 |	We've all heard the stats
EDL	00:48:19,711	00:48:20,991	| serial-s03-e09 |	That we here in the United States
EDL	00:48:21,503	00:48:25,343	| serial-s03-e09 |	Imprison a vastly higher percentage of our population than any other country in the world
EDL	00:48:25,855	00:48:26,879	| serial-s03-e09 |	We are number one
EDL	00:48:27,903	00:48:29,439	| serial-s03-e09 |	The numbers are well-documented
EDL	00:48:29,439	00:48:30,719	| serial-s03-e09 |	Wildly out of whack
EDL	00:48:30,719	00:48:32,255	| serial-s03-e09 |	And unprecedented in our history
