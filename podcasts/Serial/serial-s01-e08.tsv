EDL	00:01:10,912	00:01:15,776	| serial-s01-e08 |	From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial one story told week by week
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:16,544	| serial-s01-e08 |	Sarah Koenig
EDL	00:01:17,824	00:01:22,176	| serial-s01-e08 |	I wanted to know from Stella Armstrong why she voted to convict Adnan Syed
EDL	00:01:22,176	00:01:23,968	| serial-s01-e08 |	She immediately talked about J
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:25,760	| serial-s01-e08 |	But you believed him
EDL	00:01:25,760	00:01:29,600	| serial-s01-e08 |	Like I said it's been a while but I remember the one young man
EDL	00:01:29,600	00:01:30,368	| serial-s01-e08 |	Who was the
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:31,136	| serial-s01-e08 |	Supposedly his
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:31,904	| serial-s01-e08 |	Friends
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:35,232	| serial-s01-e08 |	Who had enabled him to move the body
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:38,304	| serial-s01-e08 |	Right hand that struck me that
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:42,144	| serial-s01-e08 |	Why would you admit to doing something that drastic if you hadn't done it
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:47,776	| serial-s01-e08 |	You know what I mean for what reason what was he going to gain from that he still had to go to jail
EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:51,616	| serial-s01-e08 |	Oh he didn't defend didn't
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:54,176	| serial-s01-e08 |	He walked
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:56,224	| serial-s01-e08 |	And estranged
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:02:01,344	| serial-s01-e08 |	The same thing I asked anyone who's come in contact with j
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:03,136	| serial-s01-e08 |	What is Jay's deal
EDL	00:02:03,648	00:02:09,280	| serial-s01-e08 |	I don't mean that he pled guilty to accessory after the fact in a first-degree murder
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:12,096	| serial-s01-e08 |	Testified against Adnan and got no prison time as a result
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:14,400	| serial-s01-e08 |	I'll talk more about that in another episode
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:17,472	| serial-s01-e08 |	What I mean is what did you make of Jay
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:20,288	| serial-s01-e08 |	Which of course is code for what am I supposed to make of Jay
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:23,104	| serial-s01-e08 |	How to become a cross sitting up there on the witness stand
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:26,176	| serial-s01-e08 |	What's his demeanor on the stand
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:27,456	| serial-s01-e08 |	Kid did he seem like
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:30,784	| serial-s01-e08 |	He seemed like he was
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:33,600	| serial-s01-e08 |	StreetWise
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:35,392	| serial-s01-e08 |	I hope that's the best way to put it
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:39,744	| serial-s01-e08 |	He seemed like he you know got around in the neighborhood tour
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:42,816	| serial-s01-e08 |	He was able to take care of yourself
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:44,608	| serial-s01-e08 |	He remind me of
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:48,192	| serial-s01-e08 |	He would be that friend if you got in trouble you would call
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:49,216	| serial-s01-e08 |	You know what I mean
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:55,872	| serial-s01-e08 |	Save I was back in high school and I'll and somebody was bothering me he remind me of somebody I would call
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:56,640	| serial-s01-e08 |	To help me
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:58,944	| serial-s01-e08 |	Like if somebody was fighting me or
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:05,088	| serial-s01-e08 |	It was believable to you that he would be that guy for I like he would be the guy that I return to
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:05,600	| serial-s01-e08 |	Yeah
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:07,392	| serial-s01-e08 |	That was my impression
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:10,976	| serial-s01-e08 |	And no because we all have somebody in our life like that
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:11,488	| serial-s01-e08 |	You know
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:14,048	| serial-s01-e08 |	That you may know a cousin or
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:15,072	| serial-s01-e08 |	A relative
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:17,888	| serial-s01-e08 |	Who is something go wrong
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:19,424	| serial-s01-e08 |	You think you can call to help you
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:24,800	| serial-s01-e08 |	Just said that I just did a very quick scared of all of my

EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:37,600	| serial-s01-e08 |	We will say they also useless
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:44,000	| serial-s01-e08 |	Wearing a tie sometimes a jacket
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:46,304	| serial-s01-e08 |	He's handsome he's tall and thin
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:51,424	| serial-s01-e08 |	You can see in the video over a little each time he speaks into the microphone in front of them
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:55,264	| serial-s01-e08 |	Since JS credibility was the state's case
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,824	| serial-s01-e08 |	Attorney Christina Gutierrez
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:59,104	| serial-s01-e08 |	Try to rip it to shreds
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:01,408	| serial-s01-e08 |	That essentially was her defense
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:06,784	| serial-s01-e08 |	She uses the word truth and lie as often as possible in a cross examination
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:09,344	| serial-s01-e08 |	Exchanges like this one
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:10,368	| serial-s01-e08 |	Pictures asked him
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:13,440	| serial-s01-e08 |	I know your second interview on tape
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:15,488	| serial-s01-e08 |	That you were not telling the truth were you not

EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:18,559	| serial-s01-e08 |	I was not telling you everything now
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:23,679	| serial-s01-e08 |	What you were telling them
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:24,703	| serial-s01-e08 |	Were they not
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:31,359	| serial-s01-e08 |	Some
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:33,663	| serial-s01-e08 |	Is it not stink
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:40,831	| serial-s01-e08 |	Pictures ask Jay about Best Buy told him there were security cameras in the parking lot and at the
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:41,343	| serial-s01-e08 |	The entrance
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:45,439	| serial-s01-e08 |	Jaden kill hey why would they care whether there were cameras there she asked
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:47,743	| serial-s01-e08 |	Cheapest to Jay almost casually
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:50,047	| serial-s01-e08 |	Believe
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:53,631	| serial-s01-e08 |	Directions to do
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:57,215	| serial-s01-e08 |	With the death of Haley Wright State
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:59,007	| serial-s01-e08 |	Funny question
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:03,359	| serial-s01-e08 |	Did you kill him in one
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:07,711	| serial-s01-e08 |	You want Frozen
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:12,063	| serial-s01-e08 |	The defense attorney tried to make him
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:14,623	| serial-s01-e08 |	But basically she was trying to show DJ killed
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:17,439	| serial-s01-e08 |	I was blaming it on and on
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:20,767	| serial-s01-e08 |	Which disorder that's what I remember
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:23,839	| serial-s01-e08 |	Nothing led us to believe that
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:25,119	| serial-s01-e08 |	She had a
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:26,655	| serial-s01-e08 |	Motive
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:27,679	| serial-s01-e08 |	To kill misli
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:32,799	| serial-s01-e08 |	That really stayed with me because she was so adamant that he was a liar
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:34,079	| serial-s01-e08 |	Right
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:36,639	| serial-s01-e08 |	Did you just didn't buy that he was lying about it
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:43,551	| serial-s01-e08 |	I didn't bother that it was a lie I bought the fact that he was telling the truth about what happened at that moment
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:53,279	| serial-s01-e08 |	Different
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:56,607	| serial-s01-e08 |	This must have been a harrowing nerve-racking stretch in his life
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:06:01,215	| serial-s01-e08 |	The trial itself really boring
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:03,775	| serial-s01-e08 |	Manchester procedural stuff that's always boring
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:06,079	| serial-s01-e08 |	The cross-examination is boring
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:07,103	| serial-s01-e08 |	Even if the star Witness
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:11,711	| serial-s01-e08 |	When defense attorney I talked to said that boring this can be a strategy
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:15,295	| serial-s01-e08 |	She's a lawyer's know that people can only pay close attention for so long
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:17,343	| serial-s01-e08 |	45 minutes an hour
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:18,623	| serial-s01-e08 |	Before they start to flag
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:21,183	| serial-s01-e08 |	So it's not see a tricks that gets people to crack
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:22,719	| serial-s01-e08 |	Tedium
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:27,327	| serial-s01-e08 |	Which would explain so much of a Gutierrez was doing if in fact that's what she was doing
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:30,399	| serial-s01-e08 |	She spends a lot of time on streets for instance
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:36,799	| serial-s01-e08 |	The trajectories of different roads where they travel Northeast or Northwest with their names change as they cross from the city into
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:37,567	| serial-s01-e08 |	County
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:39,871	| serial-s01-e08 |	On buildings how they are situated
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:43,967	| serial-s01-e08 |	Is
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:45,247	| serial-s01-e08 |	A box
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:46,271	| serial-s01-e08 |	Structure
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:48,063	| serial-s01-e08 |	With the Best Buy
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:53,183	| serial-s01-e08 |	Logo of an Angel
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:56,767	| serial-s01-e08 |	Three more visible
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:58,559	| serial-s01-e08 |	Home Security Boulevard
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:06:59,839	| serial-s01-e08 |	If not
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:02,399	| serial-s01-e08 |	Ryodan and that's
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:08,799	| serial-s01-e08 |	There's a light there that if you were not on Security Boulevard
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:11,103	| serial-s01-e08 |	He went straight
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:13,151	| serial-s01-e08 |	We will go into the parking lot
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:14,687	| serial-s01-e08 |	Up Security Mall
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:18,015	| serial-s01-e08 |	Jay doesn't crack though
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:20,575	| serial-s01-e08 |	He's alert he is polite he stays with her
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:25,695	| serial-s01-e08 |	He stays with her when she's calm and soothing and boring and he stays with her when she gets a little more shouting
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:32,607	| serial-s01-e08 |	Yes ma'am no ma'am answers which if I had to guess is probably 75% of what Jay says in Cross
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:38,751	| serial-s01-e08 |	There's a part where the chair is tries to suggest that Jay was cheating on his girlfriend Stephanie with Jen pusateri
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:43,359	| serial-s01-e08 |	If you were stepping out on Stephanie
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:46,943	| serial-s01-e08 |	Funny relationship
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:50,015	| serial-s01-e08 |	With me
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:51,807	| serial-s01-e08 |	With anyone
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:52,575	| serial-s01-e08 |	Call Stephanie
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:56,159	| serial-s01-e08 |	If you or stepping out

EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:14,591	| serial-s01-e08 |	If

EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:41,471	| serial-s01-e08 |	Could you ask her to stop yelling in my ear please
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:47,871	| serial-s01-e08 |	Goodyear has died a few years after this trial so I can't ask her but I have to take nothing
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:49,151	| serial-s01-e08 |	Doing here as accidental
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:56,063	| serial-s01-e08 |	Choose a successful sought-after defense attorney choose aggressive and obviously the court room is no place for pulling punches
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:09:02,975	| serial-s01-e08 |	But you got to wonder whether moments like this hurt and Nas case rather than helped it because
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:07,071	| serial-s01-e08 |	It's Baltimore half the jury is black 7 out of 12 actually
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:11,679	| serial-s01-e08 |	She probably comes off as a nice young Man and the Sea
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:15,007	| serial-s01-e08 |	Sometimes unwittingly testimony is almost poetic
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:19,359	| serial-s01-e08 |	He says you told Jen pusateri to be honest with the detectives because quote
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:23,199	| serial-s01-e08 |	The lies that we were telling to try to protect each other during the truth
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:29,599	| serial-s01-e08 |	Anon wanted to kill her
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:33,439	| serial-s01-e08 |	Mysterious took it as a grain of sand instead of concrete
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:40,607	| serial-s01-e08 |	Image of hay in the trunk of the car stuck with him he says I've never seen anyone dead before
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:46,751	| serial-s01-e08 |	The first thing I thought was how fragile Stephanie was
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:54,687	| serial-s01-e08 |	People lie in court under oath all the time
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:59,295	| serial-s01-e08 |	Witnesses lie lawyers lie police lie this should come as a shocker to no one
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:05,951	| serial-s01-e08 |	And I'm not saying that's what happened here I'm just saying that I'm not assuming that everyone who participated in a nun's trial told the
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:10,559	| serial-s01-e08 |	But clearly the jury found a believable or believable enough
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:14,399	| serial-s01-e08 |	After 6 week trial the convicted in on in Just 2 hours
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:19,007	| serial-s01-e08 |	We talked to six jurors and none of them had any lingering doubts about the
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:21,823	| serial-s01-e08 |	The case none of them wondered if the investigation was shotty
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:25,663	| serial-s01-e08 |	None of them are much bothered by had J statements to police had shifted over time
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:28,991	| serial-s01-e08 |	To be hung up on that
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:33,087	| serial-s01-e08 |	I should be concerned about the inconsistencies
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:34,879	| serial-s01-e08 |	I'm concerned about you are
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:39,487	| serial-s01-e08 |	As I mentioned the detectives involved in this case didn't want to talk to me for the story
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:41,279	| serial-s01-e08 |	I turned to this guy
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:45,375	| serial-s01-e08 |	You are Jim trainum James to deal with James
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:46,911	| serial-s01-e08 |	And we weave
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:47,423	| serial-s01-e08 |	We hired you
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:48,959	| serial-s01-e08 |	I'd like
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:53,567	| serial-s01-e08 |	Me you're a real detective I'm just playing one on the radio
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:57,407	| serial-s01-e08 |	Homicide detective in Washington DC
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:59,711	| serial-s01-e08 |	A jurisdiction not too different from Baltimore
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:05,855	| serial-s01-e08 |	He's become something of an expert on false confessions and an advocate for better interrogation techniques
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:07,903	| serial-s01-e08 |	It goes around the country during presentations about it
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:11,487	| serial-s01-e08 |	Everything we had on this case
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:13,535	| serial-s01-e08 |	Niles tapes transcripts
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:17,887	| serial-s01-e08 |	And again I want to be clear that we paid him for his time to huge amount of material to go through
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:20,959	| serial-s01-e08 |	Turn on two things
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:23,263	| serial-s01-e08 |	First just overall
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:26,335	| serial-s01-e08 |	How is the investigation into Hae Min Lee's murder
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:29,151	| serial-s01-e08 |	Did the detectives do a good job or did they screw it up
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:33,503	| serial-s01-e08 |	I'm second how should I be thinking about Jay as a witness
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:36,319	| serial-s01-e08 |	What were the detective scene that maybe I wasn't
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:41,439	| serial-s01-e08 |	Yes he thought the inconsistencies were a problem to
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:43,999	| serial-s01-e08 |	Also said don't forget the flip side
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:50,143	| serial-s01-e08 |	But I'm also looking at some of the consistencies to write at some of the
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:52,191	| serial-s01-e08 |	He took them to where the car was
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:54,239	| serial-s01-e08 |	Grandpa
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:56,799	| serial-s01-e08 |	That's a huge thing right there
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:12:02,175	| serial-s01-e08 |	Jay had a big piece of reliable information that the cops themselves did not know
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:03,199	| serial-s01-e08 |	Where his car was
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:07,295	| serial-s01-e08 |	Story complete the circle for the cops
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:10,367	| serial-s01-e08 |	They were suspicious of a non from the beginning
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:12,415	| serial-s01-e08 |	Adnan Cell records
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:15,743	| serial-s01-e08 |	They get to Jen who leads them to Jay who tells them it's Adnan
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:18,815	| serial-s01-e08 |	Their suspicions have now been born out
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:21,119	| serial-s01-e08 |	Thanks to Jay truan on tones phone
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:23,935	| serial-s01-e08 |	Satisfying investigative Circle
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:24,959	| serial-s01-e08 |	A murder case
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:26,239	| serial-s01-e08 |	On a silver platter
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:26,751	| serial-s01-e08 |	Substratum
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:30,335	| serial-s01-e08 |	Put on who they consider to be The Logical suspect
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:31,615	| serial-s01-e08 |	I mean yeah
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:33,151	| serial-s01-e08 |	It's pretty much a dream case
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:36,479	| serial-s01-e08 |	Part of what training does is review investigation
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:39,807	| serial-s01-e08 |	This one is better than most of what he sees
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:46,975	| serial-s01-e08 |	The detectives in this case were cautious and methodical they weren't rushing to grab suspects or to dismiss them either
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:49,023	| serial-s01-e08 |	The evidence collection is well-documented
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:56,191	| serial-s01-e08 |	Which I didn't expect to hear that even though it's basically a one witness case the cell records mostly don't match Jay state
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:12:59,007	| serial-s01-e08 |	There's no physical evidence linking Adnan to the murder
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:04,383	| serial-s01-e08 |	Despite all that to an experienced detective like this looks like a pretty sound investigation
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:06,431	| serial-s01-e08 |	I will say this is better than average
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:11,295	| serial-s01-e08 |	But what I'm saying is this
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:13,855	| serial-s01-e08 |	The mechanics the documentation the steps of a took
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,391	| serial-s01-e08 |	And all of that
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:16,415	| serial-s01-e08 |	They look good
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:17,695	| serial-s01-e08 |	Okay
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:19,743	| serial-s01-e08 |	I would have probably follow the same route
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:21,023	| serial-s01-e08 |	However
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:22,559	| serial-s01-e08 |	What were unsure of
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:27,167	| serial-s01-e08 |	Is what happened to change a story from A to B
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:30,239	| serial-s01-e08 |	And we do not know
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:34,335	| serial-s01-e08 |	What happened in the in those three hours or whatever like that
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:36,127	| serial-s01-e08 |	And that will always
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,151	| serial-s01-e08 |	Result
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:38,431	| serial-s01-e08 |	And a question
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:41,503	| serial-s01-e08 |	As to what the final outcome I mean should have been
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:43,295	| serial-s01-e08 |	Here's what he's talking about
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:46,623	| serial-s01-e08 |	Both of J's tape statements there's a before
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:49,695	| serial-s01-e08 |	Period of time before the tape recorder is turned on
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:53,279	| serial-s01-e08 |	When the cops first bring Jay in on February 28th
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:56,095	| serial-s01-e08 |	They talked to him for about an hour before the tape one on
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:58,911	| serial-s01-e08 |	March 15th the second interview
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:03,775	| serial-s01-e08 |	Jason's is initials to an explanation of Rights form at 3:15 p.m.
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:05,055	| serial-s01-e08 |	Send a text Art
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:08,639	| serial-s01-e08 |	Today's date is the 15th of March
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:09,407	| serial-s01-e08 |	It's a proxy
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:11,455	| serial-s01-e08 |	20 minutes after 6
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:12,223	| serial-s01-e08 |	Good night
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:14,271	| serial-s01-e08 |	6:20 p.m.
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:16,063	| serial-s01-e08 |	So from 3:15 to
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:17,087	| serial-s01-e08 |	620
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:19,903	| serial-s01-e08 |	3 hours have gone by since Jay sign that form
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:22,719	| serial-s01-e08 |	This is what's called the pre-interview
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:25,279	| serial-s01-e08 |	Training says that's where the Mischief can happen
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,047	| serial-s01-e08 |	The contamination
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:28,863	| serial-s01-e08 |	Necessarily intentionally but it happens
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:36,031	| serial-s01-e08 |	The pre-interview was when the cops in the witness kind of iron out the statement so could be taped as a coherent thing and that was
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:37,567	| serial-s01-e08 |	Standard procedure back then
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:39,359	| serial-s01-e08 |	Now look a lot of jurisdictions
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:44,991	| serial-s01-e08 |	Baltimore homicide detectives videotape the entire interview from the moment the person steps in the interview room
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:51,903	| serial-s01-e08 |	On March 15th we know the cops had shown J at least some photographs from the investigation they refer to that on the tape
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:56,767	| serial-s01-e08 |	And races at trial that he was confronted with the cell records during that interview as well
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:59,071	| serial-s01-e08 |	Do you have to wonder says China
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:02,143	| serial-s01-e08 |	Whether he was massaging his story to fit with the cops wanted to hear
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:08,543	| serial-s01-e08 |	Inconsistencies in Jay statements that the cops are catching him in cops are used to that
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:10,847	| serial-s01-e08 |	Every confession has inconsistencies
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:12,895	| serial-s01-e08 |	You just need to understand why they're happening
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:15,199	| serial-s01-e08 |	Is he minimizing his role is he
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:16,223	| serial-s01-e08 |	Protecting someone
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:17,759	| serial-s01-e08 |	JS case yes and yes
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:22,367	| serial-s01-e08 |	But how do you make sense of the inconsistencies that don't seem to have a purpose
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:25,695	| serial-s01-e08 |	Like the one about going to the Cliffs at Patapsco State Park that afternoon
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:27,999	| serial-s01-e08 |	Drops out of the narrative at trial
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:32,863	| serial-s01-e08 |	And for my where I said I'm like yeah it doesn't work because doesn't fit your timeline and he can't get back
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:33,631	| serial-s01-e08 |	The track in time
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:35,423	| serial-s01-e08 |	If you went out and smoke
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:35,935	| serial-s01-e08 |	Edjoin
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:42,079	| serial-s01-e08 |	No you're not at all because I think that you could on one of the biggest problems
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:45,151	| serial-s01-e08 |	That we have with the way that we interview and interrogate
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:46,687	| serial-s01-e08 |	I hear
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:47,967	| serial-s01-e08 |	And the fact that
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:50,015	| serial-s01-e08 |	We have a excellent Witness
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:56,927	| serial-s01-e08 |	Do we got somebody who's giving us the whole case right here he's broke it wide open for us we don't want to ruin him
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:58,463	| serial-s01-e08 |	Insults
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:03,583	| serial-s01-e08 |	You know how much do you want to push how much do you want to create quote unquote bad Evan
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:06,399	| serial-s01-e08 |	Love like there's no such
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:11,263	| serial-s01-e08 |	Like I said it's called bad evidence
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:12,031	| serial-s01-e08 |	Right
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:14,335	| serial-s01-e08 |	You don't want to do something if it's going to go against
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:16,127	| serial-s01-e08 |	Your theory of the case
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:23,295	| serial-s01-e08 |	I don't get that I mean that's likely with my father used to say all facts are friendly
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:26,111	| serial-s01-e08 |	Action that be more true for a cop than for anyone else like
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:27,647	| serial-s01-e08 |	You can't
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:29,695	| serial-s01-e08 |	Picture you can pick and choose
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:33,535	| serial-s01-e08 |	I'd rather than trying to get to the truth what you're trying to do is build your
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:34,047	| serial-s01-e08 |	Case
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:36,095	| serial-s01-e08 |	And make it the strongest case
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:36,607	| serial-s01-e08 |	Possible
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:39,167	| serial-s01-e08 |	But how can it be a strong
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:42,239	| serial-s01-e08 |	Hayes and how can he be a great Witness
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:45,567	| serial-s01-e08 |	Their stuff that's
EDL	00:16:46,079	00:16:48,639	| serial-s01-e08 |	Not true or or unexplained
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:50,175	| serial-s01-e08 |	And
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:53,503	| serial-s01-e08 |	Come back is it there's always going to be things that are on
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:54,015	| serial-s01-e08 |	Explainable
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:55,807	| serial-s01-e08 |	But like I said
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:57,855	| serial-s01-e08 |	Also remember verification biases
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:58,623	| serial-s01-e08 |	Kicking in here
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:16:59,391	| serial-s01-e08 |	Where is well
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:00,671	| serial-s01-e08 |	I want to believe you
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:05,023	| serial-s01-e08 |	I am because you're my witness and I think this is what happened and all that
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:08,095	| serial-s01-e08 |	So the fact that you're giving me something that's inconsistent
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:09,887	| serial-s01-e08 |	It doesn't fit my theory of the case
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:12,959	| serial-s01-e08 |	What is verification bias caused you to do
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:15,007	| serial-s01-e08 |	Ignoring push it aside
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:18,591	| serial-s01-e08 |	And that's what they're doing here with these inconsistencies are kind of pushing them
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:23,967	| serial-s01-e08 |	I was curious to him that the cops never search J's house for instance
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:25,759	| serial-s01-e08 |	But they never subjected him to a polygraph
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:30,879	| serial-s01-e08 |	He said maybe that's because he was on their team now helping so you don't want to push too hard
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:36,255	| serial-s01-e08 |	He said the cops quote probably settled for what they thought was good enough to be the truth on quote
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:40,607	| serial-s01-e08 |	He said he did have doubts about Adnan claim of Innocence
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:44,447	| serial-s01-e08 |	But that he definitely thought there was something quote-unquote off about this case
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:47,263	| serial-s01-e08 |	But we still don't know what happened in this murder
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:49,311	| serial-s01-e08 |	We still don't have the true story
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:51,359	| serial-s01-e08 |	I don't believe James Version
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:55,711	| serial-s01-e08 |	I think that there is a lot more to it than that
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:57,503	| serial-s01-e08 |	Is the eye I feel that
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:17:59,295	| serial-s01-e08 |	Definitely minimizing
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:01,343	| serial-s01-e08 |	His involvement
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:05,439	| serial-s01-e08 |	Peter to either protect himself
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:07,743	| serial-s01-e08 |	Peachisoda for water water freeze
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:09,791	| serial-s01-e08 |	Protect himself to protect somebody else
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:12,607	| serial-s01-e08 |	Or because I wanted it was right there with them
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:13,119	| serial-s01-e08 |	Right
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:19,007	| serial-s01-e08 |	But I cannot prove that he's given to me without contamination
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:21,311	| serial-s01-e08 |	Write the real problem is is that
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:23,103	| serial-s01-e08 |	How do you prove it one way or the other
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:25,663	| serial-s01-e08 |	Right
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:31,807	| serial-s01-e08 |	The answer's probably live in those unrecorded pre-interview hours
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:33,855	| serial-s01-e08 |	A black hole of crucial information
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:39,743	| serial-s01-e08 |	The stuff wasn't all video to Interlink their holes were never as you're saying like we're never going to know the in
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:42,559	| serial-s01-e08 |	But for what things that I could know the answer
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:45,375	| serial-s01-e08 |	You're too if your me what's the biggest thing I need to
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:46,143	| serial-s01-e08 |	Figure out then
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:52,287	| serial-s01-e08 |	Did Jada talk
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:58,687	| serial-s01-e08 |	Okay
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:19:01,759	| serial-s01-e08 |	Okay so we passed the city limit
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:05,599	| serial-s01-e08 |	Schneider and I went to CJ
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:09,951	| serial-s01-e08 |	We did not warren j we were coming which is not the gentlest reporter move I know
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:13,791	| serial-s01-e08 |	The best chance of success if we met him face-to-face
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:19,167	| serial-s01-e08 |	Taking a car case for why we wanted to talk to him and he could have a better sense of what we were about
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:23,263	| serial-s01-e08 |	Dick move to show up at someone's door
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:24,287	| serial-s01-e08 |	Joe and I were nervous
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:26,847	| serial-s01-e08 |	I am so hyped up
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:29,407	| serial-s01-e08 |	Listen to the tape I wanted to get myself a Xanax
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:33,247	| serial-s01-e08 |	Super excited to talk to him
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:36,319	| serial-s01-e08 |	Like if this works and I mean
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:41,439	| serial-s01-e08 |	He knows he knows everything we want every question we've had
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:42,207	| serial-s01-e08 |	For the past
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:45,279	| serial-s01-e08 |	7 months
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:51,167	| serial-s01-e08 |	Weather like
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:51,679	| serial-s01-e08 |	There's a
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:53,215	| serial-s01-e08 |	Treasure chest
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:55,263	| serial-s01-e08 |	Answers
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,799	| serial-s01-e08 |	That we've been looking for this
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:57,567	| serial-s01-e08 |	Whole time
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:58,335	| serial-s01-e08 |	And he
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:19:59,359	| serial-s01-e08 |	Has it
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:00,383	| serial-s01-e08 |	Cheez-It
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:08,575	| serial-s01-e08 |	Whether or not we don't even know if he's home
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:12,415	| serial-s01-e08 |	We arrived
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:13,439	| serial-s01-e08 |	He was not home
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:15,743	| serial-s01-e08 |	So we came back again many hours later
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:16,767	| serial-s01-e08 |	Knocked
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:18,559	| serial-s01-e08 |	Answer the door
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:21,375	| serial-s01-e08 |	Tall and skinny and exhausted looking
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:24,447	| serial-s01-e08 |	It was Friday probably end of a long work day for him
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:27,775	| serial-s01-e08 |	He nevertheless invited us and asked us to sit down
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:29,823	| serial-s01-e08 |	We didn't record anything
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:31,871	| serial-s01-e08 |	20 minutes maybe
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:33,919	| serial-s01-e08 |	Does a tense meeting
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:35,455	| serial-s01-e08 |	An emotional meeting in fact
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:42,367	| serial-s01-e08 |	Afterwards Julie and I felt like we walked into a stranger's house lobbed a Grenade on to his living room carpet and then
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:42,879	| serial-s01-e08 |	Goodbye
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:45,183	| serial-s01-e08 |	We debriefed back in the car
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:49,023	| serial-s01-e08 |	Here's the first thing he said I mean you said
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:51,327	| serial-s01-e08 |	But there are a lot of people who say that they don't
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:52,095	| serial-s01-e08 |	I think I did it
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:54,911	| serial-s01-e08 |	Keep very forcibly settled and who did
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:57,727	| serial-s01-e08 |	He said he did
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:59,519	| serial-s01-e08 |	He was like I was there
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:01,823	| serial-s01-e08 |	I saw it like I know what I know
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:06,943	| serial-s01-e08 |	He was very forceful like I can't believe he
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:08,223	| serial-s01-e08 |	He won't even man up
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:09,503	| serial-s01-e08 |	And admit it
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:11,039	| serial-s01-e08 |	He just totally scoffed
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:11,807	| serial-s01-e08 |	Shut the idea that
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:14,879	| serial-s01-e08 |	Anon
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:16,672	| serial-s01-e08 |	Whidbey Clinic
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:19,744	| serial-s01-e08 |	He was very calm
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:23,584	| serial-s01-e08 |	Like how would you describe his demeanor
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:24,864	| serial-s01-e08 |	Tired
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:26,912	| serial-s01-e08 |	Yeah
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:28,704	| serial-s01-e08 |	She seemed tired
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:31,520	| serial-s01-e08 |	And a little and weary but not
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:34,336	| serial-s01-e08 |	But actually very polite and actually started very
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:34,848	| serial-s01-e08 |	Sweet
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:38,176	| serial-s01-e08 |	Tired
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:40,480	| serial-s01-e08 |	But he also said
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:46,880	| serial-s01-e08 |	I'm feeling like so much are animal rage right now even you bringing this up now
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:47,904	| serial-s01-e08 |	But you got a good job of
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:50,208	| serial-s01-e08 |	You know
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:56,608	| serial-s01-e08 |	I'm keeping it in cuz he didn't seem like he was about to about to hit something but in
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:58,656	| serial-s01-e08 |	More frustrated understandable way
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:03,008	| serial-s01-e08 |	Jay was understandably skeptical of us and of our motives
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:07,360	| serial-s01-e08 |	When we left Jay said he think about an interview and get back to us
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:09,408	| serial-s01-e08 |	He left a strong impression
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:11,200	| serial-s01-e08 |	Julie maybe even more than on me
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:13,248	| serial-s01-e08 |	Even just hearing him
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:18,112	| serial-s01-e08 |	So forcefully deny in a land so forcefully say I know he did it
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:22,976	| serial-s01-e08 |	You know it's your face to face
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:25,536	| serial-s01-e08 |	He's right there he's a person
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:28,096	| serial-s01-e08 |	He sang at he seems
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:29,888	| serial-s01-e08 |	Like he really means that
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:31,936	| serial-s01-e08 |	This is not pleasant for him to talk about
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:34,752	| serial-s01-e08 |	So you know
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:36,544	| serial-s01-e08 |	It sounds
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:38,336	| serial-s01-e08 |	Believable
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:44,224	| serial-s01-e08 |	Add ice totally saw the appeal of him
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:45,504	| serial-s01-e08 |	Other
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:47,808	| serial-s01-e08 |	Person in a friend and a witness
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:56,000	| serial-s01-e08 |	Correspondence sporadically by email in the weeks following our meeting
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:57,536	| serial-s01-e08 |	He said he wasn't afraid of the truth
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:23:00,096	| serial-s01-e08 |	Finally in so many words
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:01,632	| serial-s01-e08 |	Decline an interview
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:13,920	| serial-s01-e08 |	What is the deal with Jay
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:17,760	| serial-s01-e08 |	I talked to dozens of people mostly his friends and classmates
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:24,672	| serial-s01-e08 |	Woodlawn High School a range of opinions about whether he was a good guy or not a good guy

EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:58,880	| serial-s01-e08 |	Right because he wasn't a jock
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:24:59,904	| serial-s01-e08 |	Is more of a Stoner
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:02,464	| serial-s01-e08 |	They didn't seem to care whether he fit in

EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:06,304	| serial-s01-e08 |	With who he was

EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:26,016	| serial-s01-e08 |	But his friends say it seems like he was more or less taking care of himself
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:27,808	| serial-s01-e08 |	Had a job
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:29,088	| serial-s01-e08 |	His mother depended on him

EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:41,888	| serial-s01-e08 |	He hung out with some of the magnet kids because his girlfriend Stephanie was in the program
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:45,472	| serial-s01-e08 |	People told me contradictory things about Jay
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:48,800	| serial-s01-e08 |	Woodlawn including one teacher
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:50,848	| serial-s01-e08 |	Unflattering things about him
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:54,176	| serial-s01-e08 |	Nothing terrible just that he was mean or intimidating
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:56,736	| serial-s01-e08 |	Some kids thought of him as quote-unquote Shady
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:58,784	| serial-s01-e08 |	But you wouldn't want to push him
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:01,600	| serial-s01-e08 |	You got the sense that if you cross jaehee come after you
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:05,952	| serial-s01-e08 |	But then I also her descriptions of that included the word goofy
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:06,720	| serial-s01-e08 |	AR stoner
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:09,792	| serial-s01-e08 |	Or it was just a pose
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:11,840	| serial-s01-e08 |	Something to put on to Cintas
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:13,632	| serial-s01-e08 |	He's he's Alpha
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:15,424	| serial-s01-e08 |	Is definitely an alpha male
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:19,008	| serial-s01-e08 |	This is Chris who says he was one of Jay's best friends around this time
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:23,616	| serial-s01-e08 |	He said in the hallway at school
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:27,456	| serial-s01-e08 |	He wasn't mad or anything he's just messing around
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:32,576	| serial-s01-e08 |	Chris remember this one story or it seemed to me all the different versions of Jay I'd heard
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:34,880	| serial-s01-e08 |	The Goofy and the scary were contained in it
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:40,768	| serial-s01-e08 |	You know we have weird argument sometimes I remember outside of one of my cousin's house has he tried to stab me
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:47,680	| serial-s01-e08 |	I'll because I hadn't been stabbed before so we got into a fight over a actually I gave him a knife
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:49,728	| serial-s01-e08 |	If I work at a knife shop
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:53,056	| serial-s01-e08 |	I gave him
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:59,456	| serial-s01-e08 |	So we're literally like fighting outside of my cousin's house and he's like
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:05,600	| serial-s01-e08 |	Before you need to know what it's like and unlike your own I can let you stab me
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:15,584	| serial-s01-e08 |	I talked to three people who said they knew Jay well or hung out with him around the time of the crime
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:18,400	| serial-s01-e08 |	About what happened
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:24,544	| serial-s01-e08 |	I want to Chris first because when J spoke to detectives that first night during his first
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:25,824	| serial-s01-e08 |	Jay mention Chris by name
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:31,200	| serial-s01-e08 |	How to ask Jay if you told anyone else about this murder and Jason he told Chris
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:34,016	| serial-s01-e08 |	Bristol me police never questioned him
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:37,600	| serial-s01-e08 |	Not that he can remember anyway and he thought you remember something like that
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:39,904	| serial-s01-e08 |	There no notes in their files about an interview with Chris
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:44,000	| serial-s01-e08 |	Kristen was true Jay did tell him about what happened
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:45,280	| serial-s01-e08 |	His version
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:48,864	| serial-s01-e08 |	The building blocks are the same but this running details are unfamiliar
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:52,960	| serial-s01-e08 |	Of course giant caveat it's 15 years later that I'm asking Chris
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:53,728	| serial-s01-e08 |	Tell me
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:56,032	| serial-s01-e08 |	For comparison purposes here goes
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:28:02,944	| serial-s01-e08 |	Chris has Jay told him he was at a pool hall out on Route 40 in Catonsville when he got a call from a non
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:07,296	| serial-s01-e08 |	Precise they were crossed
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:08,576	| serial-s01-e08 |	Street from each other at the time
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:12,928	| serial-s01-e08 |	He told you that I done came to get him when he was at
EDL	00:28:12,928	00:28:18,048	| serial-s01-e08 |	He was shooting
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:20,608	| serial-s01-e08 |	Yo where are you we told her where it was
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:23,936	| serial-s01-e08 |	Add nacho. Because I know I got to talk to you is like
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:29,568	| serial-s01-e08 |	Convinced him to come outside with him
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:30,848	| serial-s01-e08 |	And
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:33,664	| serial-s01-e08 |	Is car or I don't know if he's driving his car Haley's
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:36,480	| serial-s01-e08 |	In this version the trunk pop happens at the pool hall
EDL	00:28:37,248	00:28:41,088	| serial-s01-e08 |	Chris AJ told Adnan he wanted nothing to do with it but not enforce them
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:43,648	| serial-s01-e08 |	He was in it now he was an accessory
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:47,232	| serial-s01-e08 |	Couldn't go to the cops because of his own illegal activities
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:48,000	| serial-s01-e08 |	CJ Woodstock
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:49,792	| serial-s01-e08 |	Help bury the body
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:53,888	| serial-s01-e08 |	Chris figured Linkin Park with likely J's idea rather than add-ons
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:59,008	| serial-s01-e08 |	Present information about the crime itself doesn't quite match the states version
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:01,568	| serial-s01-e08 |	He said Jay told him
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:04,896	| serial-s01-e08 |	Confronted hey about flirting with another guy
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:05,664	| serial-s01-e08 |	Car salesman
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:09,248	| serial-s01-e08 |	And when she call the nun crazy he snapped and strangled her
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:11,552	| serial-s01-e08 |	Chris said he heard this happened
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:14,368	| serial-s01-e08 |	In the parking lot of the Woodlawn Public Library
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:16,928	| serial-s01-e08 |	That's the one that's right there on campus
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:19,744	| serial-s01-e08 |	Where Asia said she saw Adnan that day
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:26,656	| serial-s01-e08 |	Chris has Jay told him that Adnan threatened to kill Stephanie if Jaden keep
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:33,056	| serial-s01-e08 |	His mouth shut this is not the first I'd heard about something like this Jay told the cops that he worried and none would hurt Stephanie to
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:38,944	| serial-s01-e08 |	And you also testified at trial that have not had made it clear he could get to Stephanie anytime we wanted since they were such good friends
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:43,552	| serial-s01-e08 |	Stuffing herself tells the cops this is in their notes from their conversation with her
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:45,856	| serial-s01-e08 |	The J told her to stay away from a non
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:52,000	| serial-s01-e08 |	Chris has Jay told him and showed up at Jay's house with Stephanie not long after the crime
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:53,536	| serial-s01-e08 |	I made a gesture to indicate
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:55,840	| serial-s01-e08 |	I'll hurt her if you're not careful
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:56,608	| serial-s01-e08 |	So
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:30:01,216	| serial-s01-e08 |	Stephanie goes in your inside pack jammie steps out onto the
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:03,264	| serial-s01-e08 |	It all the porch with Adnan he's like
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:06,080	| serial-s01-e08 |	Snuggling terrorize me
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:10,432	| serial-s01-e08 |	Can you keep your mouth shut or something
EDL	00:30:10,432	00:30:10,944	| serial-s01-e08 |	App
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:13,760	| serial-s01-e08 |	If it if he had any weakness it was Stephen

EDL	00:30:18,880	00:30:19,904	| serial-s01-e08 |	Protecting Stephanie
EDL	00:30:21,184	00:30:25,024	| serial-s01-e08 |	I talked to Laura a friend of Jays and Stephanie's and John's and Alvernon
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:27,840	| serial-s01-e08 |	Laura Estrada Sandoval
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:29,376	| serial-s01-e08 |	She was close with Stephanie
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:30,400	| serial-s01-e08 |	They play sports together
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:33,984	| serial-s01-e08 |	Her parents didn't agree with their relationship cuz he was just like
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:38,848	| serial-s01-e08 |	They felt like he's like he wasn't going to melt anything wasn't going to school
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:40,896	| serial-s01-e08 |	You know Stephanie
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:43,456	| serial-s01-e08 |	She's beautiful and she said she was

EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:48,064	| serial-s01-e08 |	She said she got a scholarship to college Lake

EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:05,984	| serial-s01-e08 |	Good influence on you
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:09,568	| serial-s01-e08 |	Because she looked Jay so much
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:10,336	| serial-s01-e08 |	For him
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:10,848	| serial-s01-e08 |	Douglas

EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:21,600	| serial-s01-e08 |	Stephanie didn't want to talk to me
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:24,160	| serial-s01-e08 |	I know what I spoke to who knows her was surprised by that
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:27,744	| serial-s01-e08 |	Two person they said she never talked to them about what happened either
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:31,072	| serial-s01-e08 |	I said it was like a wall came down and they can penetrate it
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:33,376	| serial-s01-e08 |	Lord in their friendship
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:35,680	| serial-s01-e08 |	Because we really needed to talk about it
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:37,984	| serial-s01-e08 |	And Stephanie wouldn't or couldn't
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:44,384	| serial-s01-e08 |	Laura hung out with Jay all that summer before the trial and she says they just didn't discuss it
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:49,504	| serial-s01-e08 |	His murder was this enormous sad frightening elephant nobody wanted to go near
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:53,088	| serial-s01-e08 |	Jason Patrick told me he couldn't get you to talk about it either
EDL	00:31:53,600	00:31:56,672	| serial-s01-e08 |	What happened
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:58,976	| serial-s01-e08 |	Dodge Ram
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:04,352	| serial-s01-e08 |	Does Patrick by the way isn't the one I've already mentioned in an earlier episode from the call log
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:04,864	| serial-s01-e08 |	Different Patrick
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:10,752	| serial-s01-e08 |	This Patrick went to Woodlawn he was a year ahead of Jaso 2 years ahead of Adnan and Hae and Stephanie
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:16,128	| serial-s01-e08 |	Patrick lost touch with J when all this went down he says he tried and tried to call but you never responded
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:20,480	| serial-s01-e08 |	Years later maybe around 2005 Jacob back in touch one day
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:22,528	| serial-s01-e08 |	And then they saw each other a little party
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:23,552	| serial-s01-e08 |	Patrick asked him about it
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:27,904	| serial-s01-e08 |	Turn all of these like Renditions and versions of stories from the Sun
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:32,768	| serial-s01-e08 |	Having fun of me now like I can get to the truth and
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:34,816	| serial-s01-e08 |	End
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:37,632	| serial-s01-e08 |	You know
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:40,704	| serial-s01-e08 |	I was afraid he was going to hurt
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:41,728	| serial-s01-e08 |	Stephanie
EDL	00:32:42,752	00:32:43,520	| serial-s01-e08 |	And I was like
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:46,080	| serial-s01-e08 |	Staten Island
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:47,616	| serial-s01-e08 |	Can you threaten her and
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:52,480	| serial-s01-e08 |	He said he was afraid that he was going to hurt her that's why I guess I took it as a threat now
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:58,880	| serial-s01-e08 |	Everyone I pushed him
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:02,208	| serial-s01-e08 |	Detail at Christian for more
EDL	00:33:02,208	00:33:02,720	| serial-s01-e08 |	It wasn't
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:04,000	| serial-s01-e08 |	I didn't get it
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:07,328	| serial-s01-e08 |	Like he wasn't he wasn't going to
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:13,472	| serial-s01-e08 |	Go any further with it you know and there was a lot of
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:17,568	| serial-s01-e08 |	What does drink beer
EDL	00:33:18,336	00:33:21,920	| serial-s01-e08 |	Patrick says the Stephanie explanation sounded pretty thin to him
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:25,504	| serial-s01-e08 |	But you can't get anything else out of Jay and figured it wasn't his place to force it
EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:31,904	| serial-s01-e08 |	LJ's friends I spoke to whether they thought J was telling the truth about what happened that night
EDL	00:33:31,904	00:33:33,440	| serial-s01-e08 |	I got some Curious answers
EDL	00:33:33,952	00:33:37,280	| serial-s01-e08 |	Because his friends had a reputation for lying
EDL	00:33:37,280	00:33:39,328	| serial-s01-e08 |	But not for lying about something like that
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:40,352	| serial-s01-e08 |	Something so big
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:44,192	| serial-s01-e08 |	Sort of the same way he had a reputation for being scary but not
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:44,960	| serial-s01-e08 |	Scary scary
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:48,032	| serial-s01-e08 |	The first thing that popped in my head was like jail eyes
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:50,592	| serial-s01-e08 |	Why does that jayla's about everything
EDL	00:33:51,360	00:33:54,432	| serial-s01-e08 |	But Kathy again that's not a real name or her real voice
EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:59,552	| serial-s01-e08 |	She's the person who said I was acting weird at her apartment that night of the murder when they brought him over
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:02,880	| serial-s01-e08 |	Talking about it and saying you
EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:06,208	| serial-s01-e08 |	Vajazzling inconsistencies at the first thing that
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:11,584	| serial-s01-e08 |	Cuz Jay lies Jay doesn't tell the truth
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:14,144	| serial-s01-e08 |	About what what kind of stuff
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:15,936	| serial-s01-e08 |	I think it was kind of like
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:18,240	| serial-s01-e08 |	But everything nothing
EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:22,336	| serial-s01-e08 |	I can definitely remember sometimes it would be telling a story
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:25,408	| serial-s01-e08 |	Hey what's really know it was b*******
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:29,248	| serial-s01-e08 |	LOL I remember one time I'm looking at Jen and generally guys like
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:32,064	| serial-s01-e08 |	Here we go again you know I mean like this is a b*******
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:40,512	| serial-s01-e08 |	Chris and Patrick told me that Jay would tell them stories
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:43,328	| serial-s01-e08 |	Tall Tales almost that they figured had to be made up
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:46,400	| serial-s01-e08 |	Then sometimes the stories turned out to be true
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:53,568	| serial-s01-e08 |	And Kathy said sure Jay might lie about what he had for breakfast or even whether you went to Patapsco State Park on the afternoon
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:55,360	| serial-s01-e08 |	January 13th 1999
EDL	00:34:55,872	00:34:58,432	| serial-s01-e08 |	But she didn't think Jay was lying about the crime itself
EDL	00:34:58,944	00:35:02,528	| serial-s01-e08 |	Because she's convinced Adnan is guilty based on a nonce behavior that night
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:05,344	| serial-s01-e08 |	What he was saying when you got that phone call at your house
EDL	00:35:14,816	00:35:16,608	| serial-s01-e08 |	Teresa Terry
EDL	00:35:16,608	00:35:18,912	| serial-s01-e08 |	Of all the people about this crime
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:23,264	| serial-s01-e08 |	She ever thought J was lying about that night
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:26,336	| serial-s01-e08 |	I spoke to her briefly at her work
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:27,360	| serial-s01-e08 |	Shorts at a discount store
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:31,712	| serial-s01-e08 |	But she was totally uninterested in talking to me
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:36,320	| serial-s01-e08 |	Nothing to hide she said she just did not want to talk about that time in her life.
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:39,648	| serial-s01-e08 |	She did answer my one big question though
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:41,440	| serial-s01-e08 |	And her answer was yes
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:45,024	| serial-s01-e08 |	She believes Jay then and that hasn't changed in the intervening years
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:48,352	| serial-s01-e08 |	But she did lie to you somewhat back then
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:54,752	| serial-s01-e08 |	Remember he tells Jem that night that he doesn't know where add-on put his body but they don't know enough to go to the police
EDL	00:35:55,776	00:35:58,848	| serial-s01-e08 |	Jen told me she could understand that kind of lie
EDL	00:35:58,848	00:36:02,688	| serial-s01-e08 |	But anyone in his position forced into something he wanted no part of
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:04,736	| serial-s01-e08 |	Anyone might have told the same kind of lie
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:07,552	| serial-s01-e08 |	I didn't shake her trust in his overall story
EDL	00:36:08,320	00:36:11,136	| serial-s01-e08 |	Then she was one thing she never believed
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:14,464	| serial-s01-e08 |	She said she never believed the murder happened at Best Buy
EDL	00:36:14,976	00:36:17,280	| serial-s01-e08 |	Because you thought there would have been security footage
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:18,304	| serial-s01-e08 |	And that never came out
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:22,656	| serial-s01-e08 |	I told her it seems like maybe there really weren't security cameras at Best Buy Back Then
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:24,704	| serial-s01-e08 |	She kind of shrugged and said
EDL	00:36:24,704	00:36:26,496	| serial-s01-e08 |	Oh well I don't know
EDL	00:36:32,640	00:36:36,992	| serial-s01-e08 |	I talked to said when I heard Jay was wrapped up in a murder
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:38,272	| serial-s01-e08 |	It didn't surprise them
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:41,344	| serial-s01-e08 |	Shocking
EDL	00:36:42,880	00:36:43,904	| serial-s01-e08 |	Not so shocking
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:48,512	| serial-s01-e08 |	People also said they couldn't Square J feeling threatened by
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:51,072	| serial-s01-e08 |	But that's just being wrong to them
EDL	00:36:52,096	00:36:55,424	| serial-s01-e08 |	Does Patrick and Laura and Kathy
EDL	00:36:55,424	00:36:57,728	| serial-s01-e08 |	People who spent a lot of time with j
EDL	00:36:57,728	00:36:59,520	| serial-s01-e08 |	The were shocked by Jason Baughman
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:03,872	| serial-s01-e08 |	Or something like that
EDL	00:37:04,640	00:37:06,944	| serial-s01-e08 |	They said that wasn't you
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:10,272	| serial-s01-e08 |	Same thing almost every single one of them
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:11,040	| serial-s01-e08 |	Says about him
EDL	00:37:12,320	00:37:14,368	| serial-s01-e08 |	So the end up in this in-between place
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:17,440	| serial-s01-e08 |	Swear they can't quite wrap their minds around the story of that night
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:19,232	| serial-s01-e08 |	Who's Patrick again
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:23,840	| serial-s01-e08 |	Intelligent inquisitive sweet goofy guy
EDL	00:37:23,840	00:37:25,376	| serial-s01-e08 |	Beautifully unconventional
EDL	00:37:26,144	00:37:26,656	| serial-s01-e08 |	I think
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:27,680	| serial-s01-e08 |	Artemis
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:36,128	| serial-s01-e08 |	I know this so terrible to say I hoping someone
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:38,432	| serial-s01-e08 |	The source that she was
EDL	00:37:39,200	00:37:40,992	| serial-s01-e08 |	They had no choice so that
EDL	00:37:41,760	00:37:43,040	| serial-s01-e08 |	Hoosier outside of his
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:45,856	| serial-s01-e08 |	Control in that
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:50,976	| serial-s01-e08 |	Maybe he was looking out for the safety and well-being of others
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:55,072	| serial-s01-e08 |	He wasn't such a willing participant as she was
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:58,400	| serial-s01-e08 |	I hope that it wasn't
EDL	00:38:00,192	00:38:04,288	| serial-s01-e08 |	That grappling you can hear in his voice that's so common among this group of friends
EDL	00:38:05,056	00:38:08,640	| serial-s01-e08 |	People like Laura who can't imagine a non killing anyone
EDL	00:38:08,640	00:38:11,200	| serial-s01-e08 |	But also can't imagine Jay doing what he said he did
EDL	00:38:11,712	00:38:13,760	| serial-s01-e08 |	Or why he would lie about something so huge
EDL	00:38:14,784	00:38:18,112	| serial-s01-e08 |	If you're Laura and there's no scenario here you can rationalize
EDL	00:38:18,112	00:38:19,136	| serial-s01-e08 |	You're left with fog
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:24,768	| serial-s01-e08 |	This piece of tape I'm about to play you it's my favorite piece of tape from all my reporting so far
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:26,816	| serial-s01-e08 |	Because I relate to it so precisely
EDL	00:38:27,328	00:38:30,144	| serial-s01-e08 |	It could be me talking to Laura instead of the other way around
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:32,960	| serial-s01-e08 |	So then who's affected it like why would
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:36,288	| serial-s01-e08 |	State five ways it doesn't make sense why would
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:39,104	| serial-s01-e08 |	Why would
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:41,408	| serial-s01-e08 |	Hayward
EDL	00:38:41,920	00:38:42,944	| serial-s01-e08 |	I just I can't
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:45,760	| serial-s01-e08 |	Okay just as confused as you are
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:57,792	| serial-s01-e08 |	A J sentencing for his accessory after the fact conviction
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:39:01,120	| serial-s01-e08 |	He's wearing a white shirt has long arms hanging at his side
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:03,168	| serial-s01-e08 |	Towering over his lawyer whose teeth
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:07,264	| serial-s01-e08 |	She tells the judge all the stuff a defense attorney tends to cover at a sentencing
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:11,360	| serial-s01-e08 |	Just have upbringing that he didn't have adults helping instead of moral compass
EDL	00:39:11,872	00:39:14,688	| serial-s01-e08 |	What is hardworking and loves animals and is good with kids
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:16,736	| serial-s01-e08 |	He's headed to college and wants to better himself
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:19,040	| serial-s01-e08 |	She says she underwent quotes
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:22,624	| serial-s01-e08 |	Rigorous and demeaning cross-examination on the part of Christina Gutierrez
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:25,184	| serial-s01-e08 |	And she says he's remorseful
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:26,464	| serial-s01-e08 |	She says just now
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:28,768	| serial-s01-e08 |	He was weeping in the hallway about Haley
EDL	00:39:30,048	00:39:34,656	| serial-s01-e08 |	Prosecutor Kevin urick tells the judge he is thoroughly pleased with his participation in the case
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:35,680	| serial-s01-e08 |	And impress
EDL	00:39:36,192	00:39:40,544	| serial-s01-e08 |	I said very satisfactory you and I believe honestly testified
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:42,592	| serial-s01-e08 |	And also I would say something I
EDL	00:39:42,592	00:39:45,664	| serial-s01-e08 |	You don't usually see I think he actually showed remorse
EDL	00:39:53,088	00:39:54,112	| serial-s01-e08 |	Judges impress to
EDL	00:39:54,624	00:39:56,672	| serial-s01-e08 |	NJ does seem genuinely torn up
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:40:00,000	| serial-s01-e08 |	There anything you want to say before I impose the sentence
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:02,304	| serial-s01-e08 |	Justin
EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:05,632	| serial-s01-e08 |	Whatever you do decide I'm like you know that
EDL	00:40:06,656	00:40:08,448	| serial-s01-e08 |	A real hard time even sitting here
EDL	00:40:12,032	00:40:12,800	| serial-s01-e08 |	People look at me
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:20,224	| serial-s01-e08 |	Ameristar food
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:21,760	| serial-s01-e08 |	Apartment at
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:30,464	| serial-s01-e08 |	The judge sentences J2 two years probation no jail time
EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:32,256	| serial-s01-e08 |	His lawyer Mouse the words
EDL	00:40:32,256	00:40:33,536	| serial-s01-e08 |	Thank you to the judge
EDL	00:40:34,304	00:40:37,376	| serial-s01-e08 |	Courtroom with the only person who came with him that day
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:38,400	| serial-s01-e08 |	Stephanie
EDL	00:40:41,472	00:40:45,056	| serial-s01-e08 |	Anon didn't testify at his trial which isn't unusual
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:51,456	| serial-s01-e08 |	Pictures aren't supposed to take that into consideration the judge tells himself that they are not allowed to hold that against the defendant when they
EDL	00:40:51,456	00:40:51,968	| serial-s01-e08 |	Deliberating
EDL	00:40:52,736	00:40:58,368	| serial-s01-e08 |	Did it bother you guys as a jury that I done himself didn't testify didn't take the stand
EDL	00:40:59,392	00:41:00,416	| serial-s01-e08 |	Yes it did
EDL	00:41:00,928	00:41:03,232	| serial-s01-e08 |	Text Lisa Flynn one of the jurors
EDL	00:41:03,232	00:41:04,512	| serial-s01-e08 |	That was huge
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:06,048	| serial-s01-e08 |	We just
EDL	00:41:06,048	00:41:06,816	| serial-s01-e08 |	I think
EDL	00:41:08,352	00:41:09,888	| serial-s01-e08 |	That was huge
EDL	00:41:09,888	00:41:11,168	| serial-s01-e08 |	We all kind of like gas
EDL	00:41:13,472	00:41:15,520	| serial-s01-e08 |	It's like Blown Away by that
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:18,336	| serial-s01-e08 |	You know why not if you're a dependent IRS
EDL	00:41:18,336	00:41:21,920	| serial-s01-e08 |	You know why would you not get up there and defend yourself
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:23,712	| serial-s01-e08 |	I try to prove that
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:27,040	| serial-s01-e08 |	The state is wrong that you weren't there that you're not guilty
