EDL	00:00:51,200	00:00:54,784	| serial-s03-e01 |	The Justice Center in Cleveland Ohio takes up a whole city block downtown
EDL	00:00:55,552	00:00:58,112	| serial-s03-e01 |	It's a cluster of concrete towers built in the 1970
EDL	00:00:59,136	00:01:00,928	| serial-s03-e01 |	I can head here but I'm just going to say it
EDL	00:01:01,440	00:01:02,464	| serial-s03-e01 |	The buildings are hideous
EDL	00:01:03,488	00:01:04,256	| serial-s03-e01 |	Practice
EDL	00:01:06,816	00:01:10,656	| serial-s03-e01 |	Justice Center houses in one location everything at justice system needs
EDL	00:01:11,168	00:01:16,288	| serial-s03-e01 |	The city and county courts the county jail Prosecutor's offices Sheriff's Office
EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:18,080	| serial-s03-e01 |	And headquarters for the Cleveland Police
EDL	00:01:19,616	00:01:22,688	| serial-s03-e01 |	Roughly speaking the building functions like most hierarchies
EDL	00:01:22,688	00:01:24,992	| serial-s03-e01 |	Vertically in this case from the bowels up
EDL	00:01:25,504	00:01:28,320	| serial-s03-e01 |	The main court tower is 26 stories high
EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:29,856	| serial-s03-e01 |	To the elevator really runs the play
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:35,232	| serial-s03-e01 |	The persons arrested in Cleveland are coming into the Justice Center from the basement
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:38,304	| serial-s03-e01 |	Weary cops escort suspects from the underground parking garage
EDL	00:01:38,816	00:01:39,840	| serial-s03-e01 |	Booked
EDL	00:01:39,840	00:01:41,376	| serial-s03-e01 |	Apache floors to the jail
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:44,448	| serial-s03-e01 |	Once I get a court date the writing up to one of the courtroom
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:50,592	| serial-s03-e01 |	The lower floors are for lesser crimes less hollowed proceedings misdemeanors housing court
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:53,920	| serial-s03-e01 |	The higher floors starting about halfway up the building are felonies
EDL	00:01:55,200	00:02:01,600	| serial-s03-e01 |	Detectives wearing lanyards off and get off on the 9th floor for the prosecutor's office is the court stenographers
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:05,696	| serial-s03-e01 |	Always courteous drag their squat wheelie cases on and off the elevator
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:10,560	| serial-s03-e01 |	Navigate chat for a few floors with the officers from the sheriff's department in search of a coffee and a muffin
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:16,448	| serial-s03-e01 |	Defense attorneys are riding up and down all morning muttering to each other can you believe
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:17,984	| serial-s03-e01 |	Griping about Judges
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:20,288	| serial-s03-e01 |	Elevators are not over hearing
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:23,872	| serial-s03-e01 |	Elevator Mainstays of course are Crime Victims
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:24,896	| serial-s03-e01 |	And their families
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:25,920	| serial-s03-e01 |	And defendant
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:26,432	| serial-s03-e01 |	Their family
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:27,968	| serial-s03-e01 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:29,248	| serial-s03-e01 |	Those families are one in the same
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:31,808	| serial-s03-e01 |	I'm feeling optimistic
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:38,208	| serial-s03-e01 |	I appreciate that an elevator car and a government building is one of the few places left in our country where different kinds of people
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:39,232	| serial-s03-e01 |	Are forced into proximity
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:43,072	| serial-s03-e01 |	I like to think that we can all stand so close to one another
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:49,472	| serial-s03-e01 |	What are sensible heels and Timberland boots and American flag lapel pins and fake eyelashes an Axe Cologne and Orthopedic insert
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:51,776	| serial-s03-e01 |	Teardrop tattoos in to go coffees
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:53,568	| serial-s03-e01 |	And when the elevator doors open up
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:55,616	| serial-s03-e01 |	Spilling us out onto our floor
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:57,920	| serial-s03-e01 |	The fact that no one is bloody tarieven Interiors
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:03:00,992	| serial-s03-e01 |	The small pleasing reminder that we're all in this together
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:05,344	| serial-s03-e01 |	Other times the shoulder-to-shoulder closeness only magnifies the obvious
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:06,624	| serial-s03-e01 |	We're not the same
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:07,904	| serial-s03-e01 |	Got it all
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,720	| serial-s03-e01 |	Coming up from the lobby one morning
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:13,024	| serial-s03-e01 |	Young black woman is holding a little portable speaker
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:19,680	| serial-s03-e01 |	The white people in the elevator give each other
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:21,984	| serial-s03-e01 |	I don't want to reciprocate their looks
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:26,848	| serial-s03-e01 |	Instead I decided to my duty to break the tension by saying the lamest thing I possibly can
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:29,152	| serial-s03-e01 |	To be clear that wasn't my plan
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:30,944	| serial-s03-e01 |	Just what came naturally to me apparently
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:38,112	| serial-s03-e01 |	Soundtrack for the elevator
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:40,416	| serial-s03-e01 |	Just even bother with it this time
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:41,952	| serial-s03-e01 |	Now I keep my head down
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:44,768	| serial-s03-e01 |	The weather looks the black people are probably giving each other
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:48,352	| serial-s03-e01 |	This place is primarily black and white
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:50,912	| serial-s03-e01 |	The majority of the courthouse staff is black
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:52,704	| serial-s03-e01 |	Clerks are mostly black
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:54,240	| serial-s03-e01 |	What's their managers are white
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:56,544	| serial-s03-e01 |	In the sheriff's department most of the sea
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:57,824	| serial-s03-e01 |	Security guards are black
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:59,104	| serial-s03-e01 |	Most of the deputies
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:03:59,872	| serial-s03-e01 |	Are white
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:03,968	| serial-s03-e01 |	Most of the attorneys are white almost all the county judges are white and their bailiffs are white
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:06,784	| serial-s03-e01 |	Most of the defendants and Crime Victims
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:07,296	| serial-s03-e01 |	Are black
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:11,392	| serial-s03-e01 |	In the Cocoon of the elevator everyone's polite to each other
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:12,672	| serial-s03-e01 |	Pretends nothing is weird about this
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:17,024	| serial-s03-e01 |	But if the elevators were calibrated to detect a power imbalance in the load
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:19,071	| serial-s03-e01 |	Like a socially-conscious clothes dryer
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:21,119	| serial-s03-e01 |	Baby perpetually on the fritz
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:30,079	| serial-s03-e01 |	From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago it's cereal
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:31,615	| serial-s03-e01 |	Courthouse told week by week
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:37,759	| serial-s03-e01 |	Entertaining
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:50,303	| serial-s03-e01 |	If you listen to serial before you probably know that our first season was about a murder case in Baltimore
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:54,655	| serial-s03-e01 |	Ever since that story aired people that's me and people I work with
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:55,679	| serial-s03-e01 |	Question
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:57,983	| serial-s03-e01 |	What does this case tell us about the criminal justice system
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:04:59,519	| serial-s03-e01 |	Fair question
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:02,591	| serial-s03-e01 |	And to answer I usually say
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:08,991	| serial-s03-e01 |	Because the answer is that cases like that one there not with filling Americas
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:09,759	| serial-s03-e01 |	Cortland everyday
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:11,807	| serial-s03-e01 |	The defendant in that case
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:12,831	| serial-s03-e01 |	Adnan Syed
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:14,623	| serial-s03-e01 |	Was charged with first-degree murder
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:15,903	| serial-s03-e01 |	Kid never been in trouble before
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:18,207	| serial-s03-e01 |	His family had an expensive defense
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:18,975	| serial-s03-e01 |	Attorney
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:21,535	| serial-s03-e01 |	And rarest of all his case went to trial
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:22,559	| serial-s03-e01 |	It lasted 6 weeks
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:27,935	| serial-s03-e01 |	None of that is typical of the vast majority of cases moving through the criminal courts in this country
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:32,031	| serial-s03-e01 |	And even if it were I don't think we can understand how the criminal justice
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:34,079	| serial-s03-e01 |	System works by interrogating one
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:34,847	| serial-s03-e01 |	Extraordinary case
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:36,895	| serial-s03-e01 |	Ordinary cases
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:37,407	| serial-s03-e01 |	Are where we need
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:40,223	| serial-s03-e01 |	We need to spend at least a year
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:46,367	| serial-s03-e01 |	Watching ordinary criminal justice in the least exceptional most middle-of-the-road most middle of the country place we could find
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:47,647	| serial-s03-e01 |	Cleveland
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:53,279	| serial-s03-e01 |	When I first began reporting this story I called the former US attorney there for advice
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:54,303	| serial-s03-e01 |	Explain what I want to do
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:56,607	| serial-s03-e01 |	He said Cleveland's not a bad choice
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,143	| serial-s03-e01 |	And then he said
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:59,679	| serial-s03-e01 |	Please don't be mean to Cleveland
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:01,215	| serial-s03-e01 |	You can be mean to the criminal justice
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:02,751	| serial-s03-e01 |	System but please don't be mean
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:03,263	| serial-s03-e01 |	To Cleveland
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:06,847	| serial-s03-e01 |	I told him I didn't plan on taking cheap shots at the mistake by the lake
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:08,383	| serial-s03-e01 |	Because I'm a classic
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:08,895	| serial-s03-e01 |	Recorder
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:12,735	| serial-s03-e01 |	Anyway we could have gone to lots of cities and the problems would look about the same
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:16,063	| serial-s03-e01 |	Minneapolis or Atlanta or Pittsburgh or Sacramento
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:19,135	| serial-s03-e01 |	Same sorts of crime same struggle for fairness
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:19,903	| serial-s03-e01 |	Attempts at reform
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:23,487	| serial-s03-e01 |	Who scored so it's really hard to record
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:25,023	| serial-s03-e01 |	You might need permission from the states
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:27,071	| serial-s03-e01 |	Supreme Court hello Illinois
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:30,143	| serial-s03-e01 |	Another place is recording of any kind is Barden courtrooms
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:30,911	| serial-s03-e01 |	What is your
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:31,935	| serial-s03-e01 |	Problem Pennsylvania
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:33,727	| serial-s03-e01 |	Cleveland OH
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:37,311	| serial-s03-e01 |	They let our producer manual joji and me wander the courthouse
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:38,335	| serial-s03-e01 |	Unencumbered
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:38,847	| serial-s03-e01 |	With microphone
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:40,383	| serial-s03-e01 |	Extraordinary
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:43,455	| serial-s03-e01 |	We spent more than a year in the Justice Center
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:45,503	| serial-s03-e01 |	Following criminal cases of all sizes
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:48,575	| serial-s03-e01 |	Tiny ones reporters don't usually pause over
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:50,623	| serial-s03-e01 |	Like weed possession or driving under suspension
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,159	| serial-s03-e01 |	Have your cases
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:53,695	| serial-s03-e01 |	Assault armed robbery
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:55,487	| serial-s03-e01 |	The most serious crime there is
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,255	| serial-s03-e01 |	Aggravated murder
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:59,327	| serial-s03-e01 |	Every case Emmanuel and I followed
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:00,863	| serial-s03-e01 |	There came a point where we thought
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:01,631	| serial-s03-e01 |	No
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:02,911	| serial-s03-e01 |	This can't be how it works
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:04,447	| serial-s03-e01 |	I never liked
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:04,959	| serial-s03-e01 |	Oh
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:06,495	| serial-s03-e01 |	Oh my God

EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:26,207	| serial-s03-e01 |	From the inside
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:30,303	| serial-s03-e01 |	First case we're going to talk about is small
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:31,583	| serial-s03-e01 |	It's a bar fight
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:34,143	| serial-s03-e01 |	We're starting with this one because it's a simple
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:36,959	| serial-s03-e01 |	It is also an example of the system work
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:39,519	| serial-s03-e01 |	I want to show you what that looks like in this Courthouse
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:44,127	| serial-s03-e01 |	Teva Baseline for what's considered functional Justice in Cuyahoga County

EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:46,175	| serial-s03-e01 |	Here we go
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:50,015	| serial-s03-e01 |	A bar fight walks into a Justice Center
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:59,999	| serial-s03-e01 |	Let me show you this video I want to get your impression of it
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:03,583	| serial-s03-e01 |	One morning last spring Russ bensing defense attorney

EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:09,215	| serial-s03-e01 |	You want to tell me about a case he's got
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:11,263	| serial-s03-e01 |	I'm calling the defendant Ana
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:12,287	| serial-s03-e01 |	Is not her name
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:16,383	| serial-s03-e01 |	She's charged with assaulting a police officer which is a 4th degree felony
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:19,711	| serial-s03-e01 |	Russ's drafting me until one person focus group here
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:24,063	| serial-s03-e01 |	He wants to know whether an outsider like me will interpret the video the same way he does
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:25,855	| serial-s03-e01 |	I just stand in for a juror
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:31,999	| serial-s03-e01 |	Okay so just explain what we're looking at okay this is the surveillance tape of the bar this incident occurred in a bar
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:34,303	| serial-s03-e01 |	There she is right
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:35,327	| serial-s03-e01 |	Lower left
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:36,351	| serial-s03-e01 |	Corner
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:39,935	| serial-s03-e01 |	Yeah yeah long hair
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:43,519	| serial-s03-e01 |	Annie's White young looking small
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:46,335	| serial-s03-e01 |	She's wearing librarian glasses skinny jeans
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:48,639	| serial-s03-e01 |	Boots and a t-shirt that fits her just so
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:51,711	| serial-s03-e01 |	Even in this terribly granny video she's attractive
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:53,759	| serial-s03-e01 |	She's leaning on the corner of the bar
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:55,551	| serial-s03-e01 |	She is
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:58,111	| serial-s03-e01 |	And she somebody approaches
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:58,623	| serial-s03-e01 |	The Greer
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,975	| serial-s03-e01 |	And smack your ass
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:05,535	| serial-s03-e01 |	That what you just did
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:12,191	| serial-s03-e01 |	And I had gone out that night with her friend and some other guy to a small Corner Bar on the westside of Cleveland
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:16,543	| serial-s03-e01 |	When I met Anna she told me it's not the sort of place usually hangs out
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:17,311	| serial-s03-e01 |	It was our first time there
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:21,407	| serial-s03-e01 |	Just a little rougher people are there older people
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:24,991	| serial-s03-e01 |	Cheater girlfriend noticed these two women down the bar looking at them
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:30,367	| serial-s03-e01 |	I just noticed her and other girl like constantly staring at us but we still stay there for about an hour
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:33,439	| serial-s03-e01 |	And that's when
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:35,487	| serial-s03-e01 |	Did they talk to you right now no
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:36,767	| serial-s03-e01 |	It was why were they looking
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:38,047	| serial-s03-e01 |	I have no idea
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:41,119	| serial-s03-e01 |	I personally think it's because we were pretty
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:45,983	| serial-s03-e01 |	So I go and get a drink and
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:49,823	| serial-s03-e01 |	This guy is smack me on my rear end
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:50,591	| serial-s03-e01 |	And
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:53,151	| serial-s03-e01 |	The guy you have been talking
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:55,967	| serial-s03-e01 |	No just some random guy at the bar
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:57,503	| serial-s03-e01 |	Are you serious was a random guy
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:58,783	| serial-s03-e01 |	I figured you knew that guy
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:00,575	| serial-s03-e01 |	No I did not know him
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,343	| serial-s03-e01 |	Messages
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:04,927	| serial-s03-e01 |	Cuz men are dogs
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:06,207	| serial-s03-e01 |	They can be dogs
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:08,255	| serial-s03-e01 |	And I
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:11,327	| serial-s03-e01 |	You know at first I was like haha you know stop
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:12,607	| serial-s03-e01 |	And then
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:19,007	| serial-s03-e01 |	He kept doing it and I actually got mad and I you know I got in his face and in the surveillance video there's
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:20,287	| serial-s03-e01 |	A perfect view of all this
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:23,359	| serial-s03-e01 |	First one guy touches her butt and lets it go
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:27,711	| serial-s03-e01 |	But a second guy touches her but she pushes him back and playful way
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:30,783	| serial-s03-e01 |	Then the first guy starts in again hitting harder
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:32,063	| serial-s03-e01 |	Smacking her ass
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:38,463	| serial-s03-e01 |	3 * 4 * and it turns lips are footed M as in cut it out he stops R6
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:44,863	| serial-s03-e01 |	Find her a police officer walks slowly onto the screen he's not seeing any of the slapping Heat
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:51,007	| serial-s03-e01 |	Just come from the bathroom downstairs they've been working on the Block and come in the bar to pee meanwhile back at the counter
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:56,383	| serial-s03-e01 |	Smack the guy has anima 7th time and it spins around to confront the ass clapper
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:11:02,783	| serial-s03-e01 |	At that point one of the women who'd been staring at Anna from down the bar stocky blond she storms over to Anna
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:06,879	| serial-s03-e01 |	Gets between her and the a slapper and immediately gets into it with Anna
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:09,695	| serial-s03-e01 |	This is what Russ wanted me to say
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:10,719	| serial-s03-e01 |	Hannah was provoked
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:12,511	| serial-s03-e01 |	Other Woman answers
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,535	| serial-s03-e01 |	The picture frame
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:16,095	| serial-s03-e01 |	And they start arguing and then they go out at
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:21,983	| serial-s03-e01 |	It's not clear if anybody threw the first punch or what but Anika's decisively for the ladies throat
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,263	| serial-s03-e01 |	And then it's just a mess
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:29,919	| serial-s03-e01 |	The people around them are trying to break it up but it is not stopping she's thrashing around she could swallowed up in the crowd
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:31,711	| serial-s03-e01 |	Bunch of people
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:35,295	| serial-s03-e01 |	Knock it to the ground where this person picture
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:37,855	| serial-s03-e01 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,391	| serial-s03-e01 |	Well
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:39,903	| serial-s03-e01 |	Well
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:46,303	| serial-s03-e01 |	All these boozy patrons are piling in people are grabbing and has long hair and her head is getting yanked around
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,839	| serial-s03-e01 |	Countries pull to the floor
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:49,631	| serial-s03-e01 |	It's awful to watch
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:52,703	| serial-s03-e01 |	The most disturbing woman to me is when the blonde ladies friend
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:56,031	| serial-s03-e01 |	Takes off her eyeglasses places next to her beer
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:12:02,431	| serial-s03-e01 |	Readies herself by sweeping back her hair and then she doesn't just kick Anna she gives her a ferocious stomp like she
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:03,455	| serial-s03-e01 |	Trying to kill a rat
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:10,111	| serial-s03-e01 |	And it gets back up or maybe she's dragged back up I can't even tell if she's fighting anyone in particular anymore
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:13,695	| serial-s03-e01 |	And later tells me she's got the heart of a fighter but maybe not the skills
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:14,975	| serial-s03-e01 |	That looks about right
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:18,303	| serial-s03-e01 |	Someone behind Anna's got his big arm around her neck
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:19,839	| serial-s03-e01 |	Can I see the cop
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:22,655	| serial-s03-e01 |	There's a cop right there
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:25,471	| serial-s03-e01 |	People are still grabbing her
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:28,031	| serial-s03-e01 |	Is flailing
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:32,895	| serial-s03-e01 |	There is where she swings
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:34,175	| serial-s03-e01 |	And hits
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:35,967	| serial-s03-e01 |	And hits the cop
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:38,783	| serial-s03-e01 |	Looks like she got some on the left side of his face
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:41,087	| serial-s03-e01 |	Then the cop who's a big dude
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:42,111	| serial-s03-e01 |	He's on top of her
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:43,647	| serial-s03-e01 |	Take her to the ground cops are
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:47,487	| serial-s03-e01 |	After that it's four nights in the Cleveland City Jail
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:50,815	| serial-s03-e01 |	$5,000 bond to get out in a fourth-degree felony charge
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:52,863	| serial-s03-e01 |	Assault on a peace officer
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:54,399	| serial-s03-e01 |	The video ends
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:12:56,959	| serial-s03-e01 |	So
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:59,263	| serial-s03-e01 |	You're on a jury you see that you can Victor
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:01,311	| serial-s03-e01 |	No I wouldn't convector
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:03,103	| serial-s03-e01 |	I mean I don't think I would
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:07,455	| serial-s03-e01 |	Just technically she connected with the cops face but to me it looked accidental
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:12,319	| serial-s03-e01 |	That is the answer was hoping for a solid not guilty for his client
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:16,927	| serial-s03-e01 |	Better yet he like a not-guilty tenants with righteous indignation which I can also provide
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:20,255	| serial-s03-e01 |	How does a video we just watched add up to a felony charge
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:23,327	| serial-s03-e01 |	A young woman tries to stop a man from hitting her ass
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:28,703	| serial-s03-e01 |	She's been verbally and possibly physically attacked by some puffed-up buttinsky from down the bar
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:32,799	| serial-s03-e01 |	End up fighting for all she's worth defending herself all 110 lb of her
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:34,079	| serial-s03-e01 |	Against the pack of strangers
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:37,407	| serial-s03-e01 |	Cop stops and she hits him from the looks of it by accident
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:41,503	| serial-s03-e01 |	The cop is not injured by the way and is the one who ended up scratched and bleeding
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:46,111	| serial-s03-e01 |	I get the bad behavior abounds in this episode and Anna's included
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:47,391	| serial-s03-e01 |	Felony assault
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:49,439	| serial-s03-e01 |	To become a spelling for this
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:50,719	| serial-s03-e01 |	That cannot be right
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:52,767	| serial-s03-e01 |	Russ thinks it's not right
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:54,815	| serial-s03-e01 |	You think that the system got this one wrong
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:56,607	| serial-s03-e01 |	Transkei should not be happening at all
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:59,423	| serial-s03-e01 |	He tells me today his plan is to go big
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:04,031	| serial-s03-e01 |	I know that they offer me a misdemeanor assault on
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:04,799	| serial-s03-e01 |	In this case
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:07,359	| serial-s03-e01 |	But he doesn't want to settle for a misdemeanor assault on this one
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:09,151	| serial-s03-e01 |	He's got the surveillance tape
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:11,455	| serial-s03-e01 |	Which way is like a closed circuit morality play
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:16,575	| serial-s03-e01 |	He feels like that alone ought to be strong enough evidence to force of course correction on the part of the state
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:18,367	| serial-s03-e01 |	To undo what's already been done
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:20,415	| serial-s03-e01 |	China's race
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:25,023	| serial-s03-e01 |	Whiteness is not really part of his calculation here but at least it doesn't work against her
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:31,423	| serial-s03-e01 |	After many decades in this business Russ says he's accepted to shameful truth that as a general rule and never help
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:32,447	| serial-s03-e01 |	Abs2b black
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:33,471	| serial-s03-e01 |	It never hurts to be white
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:37,311	| serial-s03-e01 |	So today I'm going to try to see if the Stapleton

EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:43,711	| serial-s03-e01 |	This is what I've come here to see
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:46,783	| serial-s03-e01 |	Houses adversarial system going to turn now
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:48,319	| serial-s03-e01 |	How's it going to play out
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:52,159	| serial-s03-e01 |	Russ gathers his stuff we leave a little conference room
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:57,279	| serial-s03-e01 |	I follow him as he goes to look for Anna he told her to be at the courthouse this morning by 9
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:15:03,679	| serial-s03-e01 |	Siri are you doing what's your guys doing

EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:16,223	| serial-s03-e01 |	All these people rushed him afterwards
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:20,319	| serial-s03-e01 |	As if you were wearing a pin that said when your case now ask me how
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:22,111	| serial-s03-e01 |	It's like that all the time with Ross
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:25,951	| serial-s03-e01 |	He walks around the Justice Center and people just come out in for advice
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:27,999	| serial-s03-e01 |	Ping pong in the details of their cases off of them
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:30,559	| serial-s03-e01 |	Attorney Krause in the hallway
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:35,423	| serial-s03-e01 |	So my guy was caught transporting the two kilos from Chicago to Cleveland he says
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:41,567	| serial-s03-e01 |	Okay but he doesn't admit to being the guy that made the secret Apartments
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:46,175	| serial-s03-e01 |	Yeah yeah okay Russell say rocking a little on his heels
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:47,455	| serial-s03-e01 |	Wearing the coins in his pants
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:52,575	| serial-s03-e01 |	Then Hillside the case while they need or the new ruling out of the 8th District I hadn't heard about
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:56,671	| serial-s03-e01 |	Russ has no personal secretary no law Clerk
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:57,183	| serial-s03-e01 |	Just him
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:15:59,999	| serial-s03-e01 |	You like the action here Alexa kibitzing
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:03,583	| serial-s03-e01 |	I need the master of doleful TGIF Courthouse red party

EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:08,447	| serial-s03-e01 |	I like Russ
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:09,983	| serial-s03-e01 |	The colleagues like him too
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:13,055	| serial-s03-e01 |	Not clear whether his clients like him
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:15,871	| serial-s03-e01 |	He can sometimes be a bit of an asshole to his clients
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:17,663	| serial-s03-e01 |	Actually they call him all day long
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:22,271	| serial-s03-e01 |	I didn't show up at the courthouse today and is confused about where he's supposed to go
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:23,295	| serial-s03-e01 |	Rust-Oleum
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:24,575	| serial-s03-e01 |	To the Justice Center
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:25,855	| serial-s03-e01 |	Where the court is
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:27,135	| serial-s03-e01 |	You've been here before
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:28,159	| serial-s03-e01 |	What
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:33,535	| serial-s03-e01 |	You don't have a warrant you don't have to get down here okay
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:37,887	| serial-s03-e01 |	What's the defense attorneys in this building R Us has some paid client
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:39,935	| serial-s03-e01 |	He also has a lot of assigned clients
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:42,751	| serial-s03-e01 |	People who can't afford to hire a lawyer so the court provides one
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:44,799	| serial-s03-e01 |	That's how they do it in Cuyahoga County
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:49,151	| serial-s03-e01 |	30 to 35% of indigent defendants get a public defender
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:50,687	| serial-s03-e01 |	The rest are assigned to private attorney
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:51,711	| serial-s03-e01 |	Like Ross
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:56,319	| serial-s03-e01 |	Russ is the difference between how he treats his paying clients and his non-paying clients
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:57,599	| serial-s03-e01 |	Come down to hand holding
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:17:00,159	| serial-s03-e01 |	The actual lawyer in part is the same he says
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:01,951	| serial-s03-e01 |	What is bedside manner change
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:07,071	| serial-s03-e01 |	The paying customer but he might visit them in jail just to check in make sure they're doing okay
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:09,375	| serial-s03-e01 |	He's not doing that with an assigned client
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:11,423	| serial-s03-e01 |	I'm guessing a paying client
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:14,495	| serial-s03-e01 |	He's not talking to them like this tell you what Mike
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:15,519	| serial-s03-e01 |	Okay
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:21,919	| serial-s03-e01 |	I've been doing this for 41 years I'm going to be willing to bet that I can do a better job of researching the law that
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:24,735	| serial-s03-e01 |	And you can't so let me take that weight off your shoulders
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,015	| serial-s03-e01 |	He hangs up
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:36,767	| serial-s03-e01 |	F****** believable
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:41,375	| serial-s03-e01 |	Anna is also in the same case
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:44,191	| serial-s03-e01 |	But so far she hasn't annoyed him is nice to her
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:46,495	| serial-s03-e01 |	He beats her up on the 20th floor
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:48,799	| serial-s03-e01 |	She's sitting in the waiting area under the TV
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:50,335	| serial-s03-e01 |	There's one on every floor
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:51,103	| serial-s03-e01 |	Set to the Food Network
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:52,127	| serial-s03-e01 |	Always
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:58,015	| serial-s03-e01 |	Anna looks small and nervous
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:02,623	| serial-s03-e01 |	I'm not allowed to record their meeting that would violate attorney-client confidentiality
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:06,463	| serial-s03-e01 |	Wrestling Turtle conference room so we can explain what's happening today
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:08,255	| serial-s03-e01 |	Pre-trial conference
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:10,303	| serial-s03-e01 |	Sounds formal but it's not
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:15,423	| serial-s03-e01 |	What means is that rest will track down and his prosecutor and they'll have a quick conversation about the case
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:17,983	| serial-s03-e01 |	And it was going to get to be there for it
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:20,799	| serial-s03-e01 |	She just has to sit and wait under the TV for us to report back
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:25,919	| serial-s03-e01 |	I don't know whether Anna knows this yet but rest for sure knows it
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:29,503	| serial-s03-e01 |	Prosecutors will almost always pursue a case that involves a cop
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:31,039	| serial-s03-e01 |	That's the way it is
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:37,439	| serial-s03-e01 |	Law enforcement code
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:43,839	| serial-s03-e01 |	The next time I see Russ he's eating a piece of carrot cake that was on offer in a judge's Chambers
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:46,143	| serial-s03-e01 |	He's had his pre-trial with the prosecutor on Anna's case
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:48,191	| serial-s03-e01 |	I made the mark
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:49,727	| serial-s03-e01 |	Request for dismissal
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:52,287	| serial-s03-e01 |	Meaning rest ask the prosecutor to drop the case
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:53,055	| serial-s03-e01 |	Santana
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:54,079	| serial-s03-e01 |	She said
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:57,407	| serial-s03-e01 |	That was laughable and
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:19:00,223	| serial-s03-e01 |	Power probably be marked with a felony
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:02,271	| serial-s03-e01 |	Probably be tried
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:06,111	| serial-s03-e01 |	When she wouldn't even knock it down to a misdemeanor to a misdemeanor assault
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:10,463	| serial-s03-e01 |	What she doesn't have the power to do anything she has to take it to her supervisor
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:13,023	| serial-s03-e01 |	Hoosier heart marker
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:18,143	| serial-s03-e01 |	Hard marker means
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:20,447	| serial-s03-e01 |	Yeah I just like it sounds so it's not going to
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:22,495	| serial-s03-e01 |	Reduce much
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:25,567	| serial-s03-e01 |	Russound matter-of-fact about this
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:27,103	| serial-s03-e01 |	I need a sort of
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:29,663	| serial-s03-e01 |	He's not shocked that his dismissal request was shot down
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:32,735	| serial-s03-e01 |	He is offended about the way it was shot down
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:37,855	| serial-s03-e01 |	As the day wears on and I follow rush around to his other pre-trials on other cases
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:42,719	| serial-s03-e01 |	The kid caught driving a stolen car a sex offender who violated a registration requirement
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:45,535	| serial-s03-e01 |	Guy nailed for having drugs and a scale in his car
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:49,631	| serial-s03-e01 |	Russ keep circling back to how the prosecutor on Anna's case
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:50,655	| serial-s03-e01 |	Call his requests last
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:52,959	| serial-s03-e01 |	It couldn't shake his irritation
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:54,751	| serial-s03-e01 |	Tell me about it
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:56,799	| serial-s03-e01 |	Tell other people waiting at the elevators about it
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:04,735	| serial-s03-e01 |	Irritated because he didn't make this dismissal request for Lowe's
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:08,319	| serial-s03-e01 |	He's been doing this a long time he's good at it
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:11,391	| serial-s03-e01 |	He knows how disinclined prosecutors are to drop a case
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:12,159	| serial-s03-e01 |	How rarely that have
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:14,975	| serial-s03-e01 |	You wouldn't ask for a dismissal without good reason
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:17,791	| serial-s03-e01 |	Protocol it laughable feels disrespected
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:22,399	| serial-s03-e01 |	Doesn't really know this prosecutor her name is Jennifer King
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:25,471	| serial-s03-e01 |	Is Hershey's a good lawyer but she's a little young
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:29,823	| serial-s03-e01 |	Maybe she doesn't yet understand that if you call a person's Ernest markwest laughable
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:31,615	| serial-s03-e01 |	Back in the professional relationship
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:33,919	| serial-s03-e01 |	I talked to Jennifer
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:34,687	| serial-s03-e01 |	Burger King
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:38,783	| serial-s03-e01 |	Perhaps unsurprisingly she had a different take on why they got off to a scratchy start
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:43,391	| serial-s03-e01 |	Jennifer's been in the prosecutor's office for 3 years in the general felony unit
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:45,695	| serial-s03-e01 |	She's got a huge inviting smile
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:50,303	| serial-s03-e01 |	She told me Russ's request for dismissal didn't sound like much of a request to her
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:51,839	| serial-s03-e01 |	Chillin like a stone
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:55,679	| serial-s03-e01 |	The defense attorney came to me at the first creature outside you're going to dismiss this
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:21:03,615	| serial-s03-e01 |	You didn't say will you dismiss as he said you were going to dismiss us I mean he was asking
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:10,015	| serial-s03-e01 |	Did he mean you guys are going to end up dismissing this like by the time I'm through with you you're going to wish you never like it was like
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:11,295	| serial-s03-e01 |	Or was he saying
EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:12,319	| serial-s03-e01 |	Hey can you dismiss
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:14,879	| serial-s03-e01 |	Would you take from it
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:17,440	| serial-s03-e01 |	I took from it as being pretty aggressive
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:20,000	| serial-s03-e01 |	Hey I know you're going to dismiss this cuz
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:20,768	| serial-s03-e01 |	This cases
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:22,048	| serial-s03-e01 |	Is crap
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:22,816	| serial-s03-e01 |	And
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:25,888	| serial-s03-e01 |	You all are just charging random girls
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:27,168	| serial-s03-e01 |	In this fight
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:29,984	| serial-s03-e01 |	Jennifer felt like Ross was telling her how to do her job
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:36,384	| serial-s03-e01 |	You know a young female prosecutor who has never worked with an older male prosecutors probably been practicing longer than I've been
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:39,200	| serial-s03-e01 |	Why you no comes at me and says
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:45,088	| serial-s03-e01 |	You're going to dismiss this case I never told her you're going to dismiss this case
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:51,488	| serial-s03-e01 |	Never thought I would never say that to any prosecutor I would never I am not a confrontation
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:57,888	| serial-s03-e01 |	Why not
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:22:04,032	| serial-s03-e01 |	Belabor this but rust remembered yet a different interaction in which he thought Jennifer misinterpreted him
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:10,432	| serial-s03-e01 |	He says he tried to fix it after that first meeting told her you didn't mean any offense by anything he said but his quads
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:11,712	| serial-s03-e01 |	I apology didn't go over well
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:15,552	| serial-s03-e01 |	He knows it's hard to be a female attorney in this building especially a young one
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:18,368	| serial-s03-e01 |	Female attorneys get short shrift he says
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:24,512	| serial-s03-e01 |	There's a bias against them principally among older white men I eat a lot of the criminal bar
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:31,680	| serial-s03-e01 |	Jennifer told me whatever her personal feelings about a defense attorney she does not going to take them out on the defendant
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:33,216	| serial-s03-e01 |	That does not influence my mark
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:37,312	| serial-s03-e01 |	I thought maybe Jennifer would be a little sheepish about an escape
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:40,640	| serial-s03-e01 |	But they were Prosecuting it at all much less is a felony
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:44,480	| serial-s03-e01 |	The Jennifer mantis case was uncomplicated
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:48,064	| serial-s03-e01 |	And I was facing a felony because punching a cop is a felony
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:51,904	| serial-s03-e01 |	Jennifer head watch the same bar surveillance video that Ross had
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:52,416	| serial-s03-e01 |	And that I had
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:54,976	| serial-s03-e01 |	She said so yeah you can see what
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:57,536	| serial-s03-e01 |	But what you don't have an audio
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:59,072	| serial-s03-e01 |	You don't hear the officer saying
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:02,656	| serial-s03-e01 |	Police break it up and she still flailing
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:05,728	| serial-s03-e01 |	She's still kicking and she punches and officer who
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:07,776	| serial-s03-e01 |	Trying to keep people from being harmed
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:09,312	| serial-s03-e01 |	Right in the face
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:12,896	| serial-s03-e01 |	And I mean her arm comes around so we see
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:14,432	| serial-s03-e01 |	Yes there's an assault there
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:18,784	| serial-s03-e01 |	Did that did that punch look deliver it to you or did it look like somebody
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:20,064	| serial-s03-e01 |	Kind of flailing around
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:21,088	| serial-s03-e01 |	Try to defend
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:29,024	| serial-s03-e01 |	Somewhere in between I mean it ain't no it wasn't a dude stop straight punch to the face I see you kind of a thing but then again it wasn't just like her
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:30,304	| serial-s03-e01 |	Arm flung back and happy
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:31,328	| serial-s03-e01 |	Hit him in the face
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:32,352	| serial-s03-e01 |	Either mean she is
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:33,888	| serial-s03-e01 |	Aggressively
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:40,288	| serial-s03-e01 |	Fighting at that point and yes there's lots of people on the floor and there is another woman kicking her butt really
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:46,688	| serial-s03-e01 |	If she just stopped at that point nothing probably would have come of this she probably would have been charged with
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:53,088	| serial-s03-e01 |	With any sort of assault for the record Anna says she never heard the off
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:55,136	| serial-s03-e01 |	Officer say stop or Break It Up
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:58,720	| serial-s03-e01 |	She said she never even knew police were in the bar until someone arrested her
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:01,280	| serial-s03-e01 |	But that's Anna's word over cops
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:03,072	| serial-s03-e01 |	Jennifer will take the cops
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:09,984	| serial-s03-e01 |	Rust
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:12,544	| serial-s03-e01 |	Thinks this whole case is built on a misunderstanding
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:14,080	| serial-s03-e01 |	Starting from the very beginning
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:15,104	| serial-s03-e01 |	When a cop arrested
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:15,616	| serial-s03-e01 |	Did Anna
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:20,224	| serial-s03-e01 |	Pointed out that the cop didn't watch the surveillance video that same night
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:22,528	| serial-s03-e01 |	So you must have thought Anna was the troublemaker
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:26,112	| serial-s03-e01 |	And his police report he writes that anocote initiated the fight
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:30,976	| serial-s03-e01 |	Rest of the cop didn't know Anna was being harassed by some skeevy dude in a baseball cap
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:33,792	| serial-s03-e01 |	Didn't know the blonde lady got in Anna's face
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:35,840	| serial-s03-e01 |	Banana got stomped while she was on the floor
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:38,656	| serial-s03-e01 |	The cop had known Russ said
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:39,936	| serial-s03-e01 |	I don't think he would have charged
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:41,984	| serial-s03-e01 |	I don't think anybody
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:44,800	| serial-s03-e01 |	Really knew the full story of what happened
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:46,592	| serial-s03-e01 |	Is that true though
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:50,432	| serial-s03-e01 |	Police wearing body cameras that night in the bar
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:52,480	| serial-s03-e01 |	Listen here
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:59,136	| serial-s03-e01 |	This is Anna's friend Kristen who is sitting next to her in the bar
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:04,768	| serial-s03-e01 |	Christian talk to at least three different officers that night including Sergeant Timothy Gill
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:05,792	| serial-s03-e01 |	The cop who got hit in the face
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:08,352	| serial-s03-e01 |	And she told him all the same story
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:10,144	| serial-s03-e01 |	Same accurate
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:15,520	| serial-s03-e01 |	Story so then he wouldn't stop so she got pissed off like y'all chill the f*** out
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:17,568	| serial-s03-e01 |	And then
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:19,872	| serial-s03-e01 |	The other girl with guy in her face like
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:21,408	| serial-s03-e01 |	Jumped up right away
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:23,968	| serial-s03-e01 |	Don't talk to my friend like this and then start going at it with her
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:28,064	| serial-s03-e01 |	Does body camera footage is part of the evidence and Anna's case
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:29,600	| serial-s03-e01 |	I listen to all of it
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:32,928	| serial-s03-e01 |	I got to say it contains some gems for us as case
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:35,488	| serial-s03-e01 |	The officer did know what
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:39,584	| serial-s03-e01 |	And yet and it is the only one who gets in any trouble that night
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:41,120	| serial-s03-e01 |	Which seems extravagant Leone
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:41,632	| serial-s03-e01 |	Unfair
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:45,728	| serial-s03-e01 |	1 points are aware of the lady who got in her face
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:49,568	| serial-s03-e01 |	They're going to file a report saying that lady assaulted at her
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:51,104	| serial-s03-e01 |	That doesn't have
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:53,408	| serial-s03-e01 |	I never even talk to that lady
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:55,968	| serial-s03-e01 |	She wisely hightailed it from the bar right after Anna was
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:56,736	| serial-s03-e01 |	Detained
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:26:02,368	| serial-s03-e01 |	In his report Sergeant Gill will describe the other woman not as an assailant but as a quota mutual combat in
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:05,952	| serial-s03-e01 |	As for the a slapper he did stick around
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:09,792	| serial-s03-e01 |	There's this whole exchange between Kristen and Sergeant Gill where he asks her
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:12,864	| serial-s03-e01 |	With the guy look like he was smacking your friend
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:16,448	| serial-s03-e01 |	Kristen DiMera she's like I don't know and then go says
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:18,496	| serial-s03-e01 |	Just give me what you got
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:20,032	| serial-s03-e01 |	Increasing cost it up
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:22,080	| serial-s03-e01 |	Jesus that's him right there in the red jacket
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:25,408	| serial-s03-e01 |	Jacket on outside
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:27,456	| serial-s03-e01 |	The guys taken outside
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:29,504	| serial-s03-e01 |	Patted down put in the back of a cruiser
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:30,528	| serial-s03-e01 |	Anon
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:31,808	| serial-s03-e01 |	The police let him go
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:34,368	| serial-s03-e01 |	Why would they do that you ask
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:39,488	| serial-s03-e01 |	Well maybe because back inside the bar at the remaining Patron say oh guy in the red jacket
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:45,632	| serial-s03-e01 |	I talk to this fellow afterwards
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:46,400	| serial-s03-e01 |	Troy
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:46,912	| serial-s03-e01 |	He's nice
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:48,704	| serial-s03-e01 |	I felt badly about what happened to Anna
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:50,496	| serial-s03-e01 |	We all
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:51,776	| serial-s03-e01 |	As as
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:54,848	| serial-s03-e01 |	You know there was about four or five people that say we never seen that
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:55,616	| serial-s03-e01 |	Do you know
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:57,408	| serial-s03-e01 |	He wouldn't do something like that
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:26:58,944	| serial-s03-e01 |	You know him
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:26:59,712	| serial-s03-e01 |	No
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:00,736	| serial-s03-e01 |	But
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:02,528	| serial-s03-e01 |	He would have
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:06,368	| serial-s03-e01 |	Just stay like that so he wouldn't that's not how me want to do that
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:09,440	| serial-s03-e01 |	Troy believes this is why the a slapper was let go
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:10,464	| serial-s03-e01 |	Because they all voucher
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:12,256	| serial-s03-e01 |	Okay
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:18,656	| serial-s03-e01 |	So the male cop is believing
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:23,008	| serial-s03-e01 |	For men or six men over the women who say
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:23,776	| serial-s03-e01 |	He slapped her ass
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:27,872	| serial-s03-e01 |	Also
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:30,432	| serial-s03-e01 |	The cop himself Sergeant Gill the victim
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:32,480	| serial-s03-e01 |	She doesn't appear to care that much about being punch
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:36,576	| serial-s03-e01 |	Consensus from the bar patrons is of the punch was essentially an accident
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:40,160	| serial-s03-e01 |	I don't think anyone should get Hall Downtown including Ana
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:42,976	| serial-s03-e01 |	Biggest arch in gilsum sloppy pushback
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:44,768	| serial-s03-e01 |	You got to rest her seriously
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:47,072	| serial-s03-e01 |	Sergeant Gill struggles
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:50,400	| serial-s03-e01 |	In this tape Sergeant Gill is in the background saying
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:56,544	| serial-s03-e01 |	Let me make this perfectly clear nobody wants to arrest the gal
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:28:03,456	| serial-s03-e01 |	Nobody wants you arrested West 104
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:04,736	| serial-s03-e01 |	411
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:08,320	| serial-s03-e01 |	It's hard to hear but he says will I press charges
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:10,112	| serial-s03-e01 |	Do I think it's the biggest eel in the world
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:10,880	| serial-s03-e01 |	No I don't
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:16,000	| serial-s03-e01 |	He says the same thing to Anna who's outside the bar sitting in the back of a police cruiser
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:17,024	| serial-s03-e01 |	Half handcuff
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:19,584	| serial-s03-e01 |	One cup of slipped off and was dancing Every Witch Way
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:23,936	| serial-s03-e01 |	His tone with her is not exactly apologetic but it is conciliatory
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:28,288	| serial-s03-e01 |	Fieldhouse sweetheart don't worry I'm not going to press charges
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:33,920	| serial-s03-e01 |	I'm not going to press charges it doesn't matter if you're fine
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:40,064	| serial-s03-e01 |	But I have to take you to jail because you hit a policeman but it doesn't listen to me
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:45,184	| serial-s03-e01 |	I'm not sure why Sergeant Gill is saying he's not going to press charges
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:50,048	| serial-s03-e01 |	Sergeant Gill isn't the only decide on this is the first link in a chain
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:51,072	| serial-s03-e01 |	Here's what's going to happen
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:55,168	| serial-s03-e01 |	A detective will come by the bar tomorrow and look at the surveillance tape
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:56,192	| serial-s03-e01 |	He'll see what he needs to see
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:59,008	| serial-s03-e01 |	Bananas are made contact with sergeant killface
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:01,056	| serial-s03-e01 |	And that'll be probable cause
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:02,080	| serial-s03-e01 |	Felony assault Ibiza
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:04,640	| serial-s03-e01 |	The prosecutors will take it from there
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:07,456	| serial-s03-e01 |	City prosecutor Anthony County prosecutor
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:11,808	| serial-s03-e01 |	Sergeant Gill could stop the whole thing right now as he's talking to Anna
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:14,624	| serial-s03-e01 |	He could let her out of that Cruiser Center home to bed
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:17,696	| serial-s03-e01 |	Instead he says this
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:21,024	| serial-s03-e01 |	Which is the most confounding sliver of audio from the whole night
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:24,352	| serial-s03-e01 |	Searching girl says I know you didn't mean to punch me
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:26,400	| serial-s03-e01 |	I understand
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:28,192	| serial-s03-e01 |	Accidental
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:31,264	| serial-s03-e01 |	You got to go
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:34,848	| serial-s03-e01 |	I'm sure it was purely accidental
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:37,920	| serial-s03-e01 |	Maybe he's just trying to calm her down
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:40,736	| serial-s03-e01 |	Regardless and it is not placated
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:43,296	| serial-s03-e01 |	Possible nothing could have placated or just then
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:46,880	| serial-s03-e01 |	She told me she was a little drunk and very angry sitting in the back of the
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:47,648	| serial-s03-e01 |	Land Cruiser

EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:14,784	| serial-s03-e01 |	She said I hate to say it, white girl
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:15,552	| serial-s03-e01 |	You know I'm saying
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:18,368	| serial-s03-e01 |	Sometimes you can get away with things and you can say things

EDL	00:31:43,872	00:31:49,248	| serial-s03-e01 |	What is the CEO of caffe Alterra
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:54,624	| serial-s03-e01 |	Stuff but cost a lot less
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:57,440	| serial-s03-e01 |	Alter has been around since 1980
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:32:01,024	| serial-s03-e01 |	It was one of the first organic coffee companies in the United States
EDL	00:32:01,536	00:32:04,608	| serial-s03-e01 |	I mean the USDA certification for organic
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:05,888	| serial-s03-e01 |	Didn't even exist
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:11,520	| serial-s03-e01 |	When they started it was just a handshake agreement that said we didn't use pesticides we didn't use fertilizers
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:12,800	| serial-s03-e01 |	How old were you in 1980

EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:26,368	| serial-s03-e01 |	They wanted to switch it up to some trendier roasts and run the business more smoothly
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:29,696	| serial-s03-e01 |	But that still needed to hire a director of coffee
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:34,560	| serial-s03-e01 |	Someone who could buy coffee beans roast them and taste them for quality control
EDL	00:32:35,072	00:32:37,120	| serial-s03-e01 |	But that person was really hard to find
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:41,728	| serial-s03-e01 |	Because there's not many Roasters in the country that are on our side
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:43,264	| serial-s03-e01 |	There's
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:48,896	| serial-s03-e01 |	Probably only a few thousand individuals that would have the skills and the ability to do this
EDL	00:32:49,664	00:32:51,968	| serial-s03-e01 |	It's definitely like finding a needle in a haystack

EDL	00:33:58,272	00:34:02,368	| serial-s03-e01 |	Rustix the real reason the prosecutor's office is pursuing this case against Anna
EDL	00:34:02,880	00:34:03,904	| serial-s03-e01 |	Is because
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:05,184	| serial-s03-e01 |	There was a cop involved yes
EDL	00:34:05,696	00:34:07,744	| serial-s03-e01 |	Because she's already got a record
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:10,304	| serial-s03-e01 |	No felonies but she's got some misdemeanors
EDL	00:34:11,328	00:34:14,144	| serial-s03-e01 |	From Florida there's a driving under suspension a DUI
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:15,936	| serial-s03-e01 |	And some local conviction
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:17,984	| serial-s03-e01 |	Including a recent one
EDL	00:34:17,984	00:34:18,496	| serial-s03-e01 |	Looks pretty bad
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:22,592	| serial-s03-e01 |	A case that started out as two felony theft charges but got dropped down to mr.
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:25,152	| serial-s03-e01 |	So it is not clean
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:27,968	| serial-s03-e01 |	But there a lot of clean records in the Justice
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:30,016	| serial-s03-e01 |	Most of the defendants
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:33,600	| serial-s03-e01 |	Many of the victims to have had some prior entanglement with the law
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:35,392	| serial-s03-e01 |	And even if it's small stuff
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:36,928	| serial-s03-e01 |	Marijuana possession or trespassing
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:38,464	| serial-s03-e01 |	You get the stink on you
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:40,000	| serial-s03-e01 |	Would have come to think of is this
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:43,072	| serial-s03-e01 |	You get a whiff of bad citizenry about you
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:46,144	| serial-s03-e01 |	An odor that causes the presumption of innocence to shrivel
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:48,704	| serial-s03-e01 |	Russ understands why I understand
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:53,312	| serial-s03-e01 |	Because everyone who works in this building has become accustomed to the likes of you
EDL	00:34:53,824	00:34:54,848	| serial-s03-e01 |	You are the usual
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:58,176	| serial-s03-e01 |	And now it feels natural that the courthouse is where you belong

EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:06,880	| serial-s03-e01 |	The prosecutor moves from the laughable stage of negotiations
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:07,904	| serial-s03-e01 |	To a solid

EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:17,632	| serial-s03-e01 |	Russ knows the whole system is primed for him to take this misdemeanor offer
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:18,912	| serial-s03-e01 |	Facts of the case be damned
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:20,704	| serial-s03-e01 |	Everyone here please
EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:23,520	| serial-s03-e01 |	96% of convictions in this Courthouse
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:24,288	| serial-s03-e01 |	Confirm please
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:28,896	| serial-s03-e01 |	All day that's what people are doing brokering haggling Angling
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:29,408	| serial-s03-e01 |	Plea deal
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:34,016	| serial-s03-e01 |	The tenancy even among defense attorneys Russ's is to go along with the flow
EDL	00:35:34,016	00:35:36,832	| serial-s03-e01 |	We're trying to get rid of cases if somebody is offered to plead with
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:40,416	| serial-s03-e01 |	We don't okay that that's a win
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:41,952	| serial-s03-e01 |	In defense parlor
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:46,304	| serial-s03-e01 |	The feeling will be while she has a prior record anyway
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:48,352	| serial-s03-e01 |	So a plea to a misdemeanor is
EDL	00:35:48,352	00:35:49,120	| serial-s03-e01 |	No concert
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:54,496	| serial-s03-e01 |	I remember one judge told me
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:35:55,776	| serial-s03-e01 |	And this is
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:35:58,336	| serial-s03-e01 |	One judge told me
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:36:00,640	| serial-s03-e01 |	If Miss County innocence is a misdemeanor
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:05,504	| serial-s03-e01 |	What that means is if they don't have
EDL	00:36:06,272	00:36:07,296	| serial-s03-e01 |	The evidence against
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:08,064	| serial-s03-e01 |	Askew
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:09,344	| serial-s03-e01 |	Village play.
EDL	00:36:09,344	00:36:09,856	| serial-s03-e01 |	2 misdemeanor
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:11,136	| serial-s03-e01 |	Okay
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:12,416	| serial-s03-e01 |	If they can't prove you guilty
EDL	00:36:12,416	00:36:13,440	| serial-s03-e01 |	They'll give you a misdemeanor
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:18,304	| serial-s03-e01 |	Everyone around here prosecutors defense attorneys judges even defendants
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:22,144	| serial-s03-e01 |	Internalize this idea that a misdemeanor is a little consequence
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:26,240	| serial-s03-e01 |	Lorelei Cress sometimes has to remind himself how mangled the principle that
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:29,824	| serial-s03-e01 |	The prosecution can't prove its case they should drop it
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:32,640	| serial-s03-e01 |	Not simply shrink it until it looks harmless enough to swallow
EDL	00:36:33,408	00:36:37,760	| serial-s03-e01 |	What's more if Anna does plated this charge just to make her case go away
EDL	00:36:37,760	00:36:41,600	| serial-s03-e01 |	The judge understandably is going to treat her as if she did in fact
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:42,112	| serial-s03-e01 |	Assault a cop
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:43,392	| serial-s03-e01 |	And
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:46,720	| serial-s03-e01 |	She's going to give her a hard time
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:47,488	| serial-s03-e01 |	I'm about it
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:49,024	| serial-s03-e01 |	Just going to lecture her
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:51,840	| serial-s03-e01 |	And you know when your kind didn't do any
EDL	00:36:52,864	00:36:53,888	| serial-s03-e01 |	That that's just
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:55,936	| serial-s03-e01 |	I don't
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:37:04,384	| serial-s03-e01 |	But I just don't want to put her in that situation where she is belittled and accused of doing something
EDL	00:37:04,896	00:37:05,664	| serial-s03-e01 |	She didn't do
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:06,432	| serial-s03-e01 |	Because she didn't do it
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:10,272	| serial-s03-e01 |	Interjects the states offer recipes with her
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:15,136	| serial-s03-e01 |	Again provocation accidental hit the glaring unfairness of it all
EDL	00:37:15,136	00:37:17,184	| serial-s03-e01 |	Why should his client plea to any kind of assault
EDL	00:37:17,696	00:37:18,720	| serial-s03-e01 |	I'll take it to trial
EDL	00:37:19,232	00:37:20,256	| serial-s03-e01 |	Another decision made
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:23,072	| serial-s03-e01 |	Now Russ is having cold feet
EDL	00:37:23,072	00:37:24,608	| serial-s03-e01 |	Because I'm having sex
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:25,632	| serial-s03-e01 |	Thoughts about
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:27,424	| serial-s03-e01 |	You know
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:29,984	| serial-s03-e01 |	What about what about trying the case
EDL	00:37:29,984	00:37:30,496	| serial-s03-e01 |	Speakers for
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:34,336	| serial-s03-e01 |	Annie's cases no longer about what really happened in that bar
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:36,128	| serial-s03-e01 |	It's become a risk-benefit analysis
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:38,944	| serial-s03-e01 |	The surveillance video is great evidence
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:43,040	| serial-s03-e01 |	Rose has a slim concerned that the state might try to bring in the body cam video
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:44,064	| serial-s03-e01 |	Where Amazon at are
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:46,112	| serial-s03-e01 |	She said some ugly things in it
EDL	00:37:46,112	00:37:49,184	| serial-s03-e01 |	It's not incriminating or anything but it doesn't help her look sympathetic
EDL	00:37:49,696	00:37:55,328	| serial-s03-e01 |	And regardless of how well the child goes for Anna there's always at 5% of juries who do something weird
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:57,120	| serial-s03-e01 |	Like Invicta case like this
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:38:00,960	| serial-s03-e01 |	Does get convicted then there's the matter of the room
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:01,984	| serial-s03-e01 |	20b
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:03,008	| serial-s03-e01 |	Judge Maureen Clancy
EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:07,872	| serial-s03-e01 |	Judge Clancy used to be a prosecutor just got a reputation as law enforcement friendly
EDL	00:38:08,384	00:38:09,152	| serial-s03-e01 |	Give me a test answer
EDL	00:38:09,920	00:38:15,808	| serial-s03-e01 |	Praying this judge was an unlucky draw in about 20 other rooms rest wouldn't worry about Anna getting sent to jail for this
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:18,624	| serial-s03-e01 |	But this room it is conceivable
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:21,184	| serial-s03-e01 |	Those are the risks for Anna
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:23,488	| serial-s03-e01 |	But then admits
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:25,536	| serial-s03-e01 |	There are risks for him to
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:27,072	| serial-s03-e01 |	In rejecting the misdemeanor assault
EDL	00:38:27,584	00:38:30,656	| serial-s03-e01 |	Risks that shouldn't matter when you're considering what's best for your client
EDL	00:38:31,168	00:38:32,448	| serial-s03-e01 |	But in reality they do
EDL	00:38:32,960	00:38:34,752	| serial-s03-e01 |	I know that when I tell the price
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:35,264	| serial-s03-e01 |	Shakira.
EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:37,312	| serial-s03-e01 |	She's going to trial
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:40,640	| serial-s03-e01 |	And I'm relatively certain I'll get
EDL	00:38:40,640	00:38:41,664	| serial-s03-e01 |	Blowback
EDL	00:38:41,664	00:38:42,688	| serial-s03-e01 |	You know why are you taking
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:44,224	| serial-s03-e01 |	What's time
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:46,272	| serial-s03-e01 |	And not pleading this out to him this term
EDL	00:38:46,272	00:38:48,576	| serial-s03-e01 |	I wouldn't certainly get it from
EDL	00:38:48,576	00:38:49,344	| serial-s03-e01 |	From the project
EDL	00:38:49,344	00:38:50,880	| serial-s03-e01 |	Pewter it wouldn't surprise
EDL	00:38:52,160	00:38:53,184	| serial-s03-e01 |	The Drudge
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:56,512	| serial-s03-e01 |	I know but I will
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:38:57,536	| serial-s03-e01 |	In what form
EDL	00:38:57,536	00:39:00,096	| serial-s03-e01 |	I'll be viewed as
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:02,144	| serial-s03-e01 |	Somebody was complicated
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:03,936	| serial-s03-e01 |	Necessarily
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:06,496	| serial-s03-e01 |	Like you'll just be seen as an irritant now and
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:10,848	| serial-s03-e01 |	Well it is an obstructionist somebody who is in
EDL	00:39:10,848	00:39:12,640	| serial-s03-e01 |	Heating the disposition
EDL	00:39:12,640	00:39:13,408	| serial-s03-e01 |	Cases
EDL	00:39:13,920	00:39:15,456	| serial-s03-e01 |	I I will be
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:20,832	| serial-s03-e01 |	I am not going to say subject ridicule but I will be regarded as an extra
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:23,392	| serial-s03-e01 |	I said you know I do it
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:25,696	| serial-s03-e01 |	You don't want to get a
EDL	00:39:25,696	00:39:26,720	| serial-s03-e01 |	Butaton for that
EDL	00:39:28,256	00:39:30,304	| serial-s03-e01 |	Reputation is everything around here
EDL	00:39:30,304	00:39:33,120	| serial-s03-e01 |	It's a closed and somewhat circular communities as Courthouse
EDL	00:39:33,632	00:39:34,912	| serial-s03-e01 |	Everyone knows everyone
EDL	00:39:34,912	00:39:36,448	| serial-s03-e01 |	Word gets around very fast
EDL	00:39:36,448	00:39:37,728	| serial-s03-e01 |	If you're a pain in the ass
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:40,800	| serial-s03-e01 |	Grandstand if your boat rocker you slow dockets down
EDL	00:39:41,312	00:39:42,336	| serial-s03-e01 |	It can affect your business
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:46,688	| serial-s03-e01 |	Kalix Minot refer clients to you and judges might not assign you cases
EDL	00:39:47,456	00:39:52,064	| serial-s03-e01 |	About half of Russia's income is from assignments some like Anna's some appellate work
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:53,856	| serial-s03-e01 |	By 1 they don't pay much
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:56,672	| serial-s03-e01 |	Not exactly pay-by-the-hour there's a pcap
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:40:02,560	| serial-s03-e01 |	According to the court rules the most you can get paid for Anna's case is $800 whether he takes it to trial or not
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:06,144	| serial-s03-e01 |	The minimum he can get paid as curiously specific 250
EDL	00:40:06,144	00:40:06,656	| serial-s03-e01 |	$6
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:11,776	| serial-s03-e01 |	The best way to make money as an assignment attorney is a treat it like a volume business
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:14,848	| serial-s03-e01 |	Take lots of cases resolved them quickly but not too quickly
EDL	00:40:15,872	00:40:16,896	| serial-s03-e01 |	Patches
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:18,176	| serial-s03-e01 |	Judges control the assignment
EDL	00:40:18,688	00:40:21,760	| serial-s03-e01 |	Which can lead to a kind of settled self-inflicted pressure
EDL	00:40:22,272	00:40:25,088	| serial-s03-e01 |	Maybe I won't file this motion or take this case
EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:25,856	| serial-s03-e01 |	The trial
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:27,648	| serial-s03-e01 |	Because that might annoy the judge
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:29,440	| serial-s03-e01 |	And then he might know assignment cases
EDL	00:40:30,208	00:40:34,048	| serial-s03-e01 |	Rose has a good reputation I doubt he's in real danger of reprisal
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:37,888	| serial-s03-e01 |	But if his Courthouse veteran is worrying about whether he'll be seen as an obstruction
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:39,424	| serial-s03-e01 |	A little kiss like this
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:41,728	| serial-s03-e01 |	Measuring a less secure attorney might do in his place
EDL	00:40:49,152	00:40:52,736	| serial-s03-e01 |	3 weeks before the trial date Raza Nanna make a last-ditch counter-offer
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:55,296	| serial-s03-e01 |	How about disorderly conduct
EDL	00:40:55,296	00:40:56,064	| serial-s03-e01 |	An M4
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:40:58,368	| serial-s03-e01 |	What are the smallest charges in the courthouse
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:00,416	| serial-s03-e01 |	Just went up from say a speeding ticket
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:02,464	| serial-s03-e01 |	The state rejected
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:05,536	| serial-s03-e01 |	Note to Jennifer this was definitely an assault
EDL	00:41:06,048	00:41:08,096	| serial-s03-e01 |	So it's either take the M1
EDL	00:41:08,096	00:41:09,632	| serial-s03-e01 |	Or try to beat the felony charge
EDL	00:41:10,144	00:41:10,656	| serial-s03-e01 |	Trial
EDL	00:41:13,728	00:41:16,288	| serial-s03-e01 |	We are here today in the cape
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:19,872	| serial-s03-e01 |	Hair shows up for her trial wearing a new dress you got at Marshall's
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:22,688	| serial-s03-e01 |	Navy blue with white piping around the collar cap sleeves
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:24,736	| serial-s03-e01 |	String of Pearls sparkly flats
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:26,016	| serial-s03-e01 |	Looks like an attorney
EDL	00:41:26,528	00:41:28,576	| serial-s03-e01 |	Which he later told me was the look she was going for
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:31,904	| serial-s03-e01 |	Julie the tags on the dress and hopes of returning it
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:32,672	| serial-s03-e01 |	Who is Shakib
EDL	00:41:33,440	00:41:36,000	| serial-s03-e01 |	Russ is there of course standing with Anna at the defense table
EDL	00:41:36,512	00:41:38,816	| serial-s03-e01 |	The prosecution's table across from them
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:39,584	| serial-s03-e01 |	No Jennifer
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:40,864	| serial-s03-e01 |	But some other guy
EDL	00:41:41,376	00:41:42,912	| serial-s03-e01 |	A young prosecutor named Jonathan
EDL	00:41:43,680	00:41:45,984	| serial-s03-e01 |	I want to know Jonathan characterizes the crime before
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:49,312	| serial-s03-e01 |	Disorderly conduct a misdemeanor of the fourth degree
EDL	00:41:50,592	00:41:51,872	| serial-s03-e01 |	Disorderly conduct
EDL	00:41:51,872	00:41:53,919	| serial-s03-e01 |	A misdemeanor of the fourth degree
EDL	00:41:54,943	00:41:56,991	| serial-s03-e01 |	Since Jennifer was busy on a murder trial
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:41:59,295	| serial-s03-e01 |	It's about a week ago she's handed off the case
EDL	00:41:59,295	00:42:00,063	| serial-s03-e01 |	Jonathan McDonald
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:02,879	| serial-s03-e01 |	Jonathan watch the bar surveillance video
EDL	00:42:02,879	00:42:06,207	| serial-s03-e01 |	And this morning before his trial began russaw Jonathan back in
EDL	00:42:06,207	00:42:08,511	| serial-s03-e01 |	Court Chambers and first thing he said to rest was
EDL	00:42:08,511	00:42:10,047	| serial-s03-e01 |	You got your disorderly conduct
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:11,583	| serial-s03-e01 |	Anna takes it
EDL	00:42:12,095	00:42:13,887	| serial-s03-e01 |	In the courtroom she pleads guilty
EDL	00:42:13,887	00:42:14,399	| serial-s03-e01 |	Happily
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:17,471	| serial-s03-e01 |	Jonathan gives a judge a quick synopsis of the case
EDL	00:42:17,983	00:42:19,263	| serial-s03-e01 |	It was a fight he says
EDL	00:42:19,263	00:42:20,287	| serial-s03-e01 |	It was chaotic
EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:22,847	| serial-s03-e01 |	Multiple people were touching Anna
EDL	00:42:22,847	00:42:23,615	| serial-s03-e01 |	She was flailing
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:27,199	| serial-s03-e01 |	He closes it out with a fourth degree use of the passive voice
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:28,991	| serial-s03-e01 |	Sergeant Gill he tells the judge
EDL	00:42:28,991	00:42:30,271	| serial-s03-e01 |	Was struck by a blow
EDL	00:42:30,783	00:42:33,087	| serial-s03-e01 |	Diablo and I would agree with the defendant
EDL	00:42:33,855	00:42:35,647	| serial-s03-e01 |	Sergeant kill himself isn't there
EDL	00:42:35,647	00:42:37,695	| serial-s03-e01 |	You come by earlier in the day but he had to leave
EDL	00:42:37,695	00:42:38,975	| serial-s03-e01 |	Another officer was there
EDL	00:42:39,487	00:42:42,303	| serial-s03-e01 |	Does Clancy double checks with them like you're cool with this outcome
EDL	00:42:42,815	00:42:45,887	| serial-s03-e01 |	The officer mentions and already spent four days in jail
EDL	00:42:45,887	00:42:47,167	| serial-s03-e01 |	Does I mean
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:48,191	| serial-s03-e01 |	I would say that
EDL	00:42:48,191	00:42:48,703	| serial-s03-e01 |	Adequate
EDL	00:42:49,471	00:42:53,567	| serial-s03-e01 |	Judge Clancy find a $200 and send her on her way with the gentle
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:54,591	| serial-s03-e01 |	Good luck to you
EDL	00:42:54,591	00:42:56,383	| serial-s03-e01 |	Architect you
EDL	00:42:59,967	00:43:03,807	| serial-s03-e01 |	Everyone suddenly seem so chill about this felony assault on a peace officer
EDL	00:43:04,319	00:43:08,159	| serial-s03-e01 |	Just weeks earlier Jennifer had firmly rejected the M4 disorderly
EDL	00:43:08,671	00:43:09,183	| serial-s03-e01 |	What happened
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:10,207	| serial-s03-e01 |	What change
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:14,047	| serial-s03-e01 |	Obviously the prosecutor for one fresh eyes on the case
EDL	00:43:14,047	00:43:17,375	| serial-s03-e01 |	In this instance I've attached to a guy who gets along well with rust fencing
EDL	00:43:18,143	00:43:21,215	| serial-s03-e01 |	The personalities aside rest later told me it's also the timing
EDL	00:43:21,727	00:43:24,031	| serial-s03-e01 |	The eve of trial can be a magical time
EDL	00:43:24,031	00:43:26,079	| serial-s03-e01 |	Arrest on a Samuel Johnson quotation
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:29,663	| serial-s03-e01 |	The prospect of going to trial concentrates a man's mind wonderful
EDL	00:43:30,431	00:43:31,455	| serial-s03-e01 |	Clarity descends
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:35,295	| serial-s03-e01 |	Sometimes you learn things about your own case that you hadn't quite seen before
EDL	00:43:35,807	00:43:36,575	| serial-s03-e01 |	My credit sucks May
EDL	00:43:37,343	00:43:38,367	| serial-s03-e01 |	And I think that's
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:39,647	| serial-s03-e01 |	That's probably would have
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:40,927	| serial-s03-e01 |	Here
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:43,743	| serial-s03-e01 |	That they they just took it
EDL	00:43:43,743	00:43:45,791	| serial-s03-e01 |	I'll look at it that you know
EDL	00:43:45,791	00:43:47,839	| serial-s03-e01 |	Can you realize certain things about it
EDL	00:43:49,119	00:43:50,399	| serial-s03-e01 |	Not a tribal situation
EDL	00:43:51,679	00:43:52,959	| serial-s03-e01 |	In fact I told Jonathan
EDL	00:43:52,959	00:43:53,727	| serial-s03-e01 |	I said
EDL	00:43:54,495	00:43:57,055	| serial-s03-e01 |	You can find 12 people in your office who would convey
EDL	00:43:57,567	00:44:01,919	| serial-s03-e01 |	Would all agree that she should be convicted to this and he said touche
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:05,503	| serial-s03-e01 |	Did you say that after we did the deal
EDL	00:44:07,039	00:44:07,551	| serial-s03-e01 |	Did the police
EDL	00:44:08,063	00:44:12,159	| serial-s03-e01 |	This point I was sincerely confused about what to make of Anna's case
EDL	00:44:12,159	00:44:15,999	| serial-s03-e01 |	Just in a fundamental way it was this thumbs up thumbs down
EDL	00:44:15,999	00:44:18,559	| serial-s03-e01 |	Is this an example of the system
EDL	00:44:19,583	00:44:21,119	| serial-s03-e01 |	Working or not working
EDL	00:44:21,887	00:44:23,423	| serial-s03-e01 |	Oh it is it that I think
EDL	00:44:23,423	00:44:24,703	| serial-s03-e01 |	It achieved the right
EDL	00:44:24,703	00:44:26,495	| serial-s03-e01 |	Results so it's an example of
EDL	00:44:26,495	00:44:27,007	| serial-s03-e01 |	The system work
EDL	00:44:27,519	00:44:28,799	| serial-s03-e01 |	Yeah I had this gone to
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:29,567	| serial-s03-e01 |	Trileptal
EDL	00:44:29,567	00:44:30,335	| serial-s03-e01 |	Would be a Santa Ana
EDL	00:44:31,103	00:44:31,615	| serial-s03-e01 |	The system
EDL	00:44:32,639	00:44:33,151	| serial-s03-e01 |	Never should
EDL	00:44:33,663	00:44:35,711	| serial-s03-e01 |	To be perfectly blunt she never should
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:36,735	| serial-s03-e01 |	Irish twins
EDL	00:44:37,759	00:44:41,343	| serial-s03-e01 |	Setting aside the trust believes Anna didn't commit a crime
EDL	00:44:41,343	00:44:43,391	| serial-s03-e01 |	And that she just plead guilty to one
EDL	00:44:43,391	00:44:44,159	| serial-s03-e01 |	The system worked
EDL	00:44:45,439	00:44:47,231	| serial-s03-e01 |	I talked to Jennifer about this to
EDL	00:44:47,231	00:44:48,511	| serial-s03-e01 |	Xi'an Russell green
EDL	00:44:48,511	00:44:51,583	| serial-s03-e01 |	She said she was glad the case went to a prosecutor who had a good rapport with ra
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:53,375	| serial-s03-e01 |	That she was fine with the result
EDL	00:44:54,143	00:44:59,263	| serial-s03-e01 |	Anyway Jennifer set at the end of the day the difference between the initial offer of misdemeanor assault
EDL	00:44:59,263	00:45:00,287	| serial-s03-e01 |	And the final offer
EDL	00:45:00,287	00:45:01,311	| serial-s03-e01 |	Disorderly conduct
EDL	00:45:02,591	00:45:06,431	| serial-s03-e01 |	Really the difference between the M4 and the M1 is
EDL	00:45:06,431	00:45:08,479	| serial-s03-e01 |	So negligible but it's like
EDL	00:45:08,479	00:45:12,319	| serial-s03-e01 |	Caso4 and it worked out the justice system work
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:14,623	| serial-s03-e01 |	Please just point out no
EDL	00:45:15,135	00:45:16,927	| serial-s03-e01 |	An assault versus a disorderly
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:17,695	| serial-s03-e01 |	I'm sorry no
EDL	00:45:18,463	00:45:22,815	| serial-s03-e01 |	If it were your record or my record by Jennifer's record we were talking about
EDL	00:45:22,815	00:45:24,607	| serial-s03-e01 |	The difference is not negligible
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:27,935	| serial-s03-e01 |	This is what rankles me most about Anna's case
EDL	00:45:27,935	00:45:30,495	| serial-s03-e01 |	The breeziness with which everyone's looking back on it now
EDL	00:45:31,007	00:45:33,055	| serial-s03-e01 |	Clapping the dust off their hands and saying
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:34,591	| serial-s03-e01 |	Great that's done
EDL	00:45:34,591	00:45:37,919	| serial-s03-e01 |	Small crime smoke a small punishment all in proportion
EDL	00:45:37,919	00:45:38,687	| serial-s03-e01 |	Justice is served
EDL	00:45:39,711	00:45:42,271	| serial-s03-e01 |	But they're not saying maybe because you're not seeing it
EDL	00:45:42,271	00:45:43,807	| serial-s03-e01 |	Is the extent of Anna's punishment
EDL	00:45:44,319	00:45:45,599	| serial-s03-e01 |	Which one you take a minute
EDL	00:45:45,599	00:45:48,159	| serial-s03-e01 |	The catalog the consequences was not small
EDL	00:45:48,671	00:45:49,183	| serial-s03-e01 |	Did not fit
EDL	00:45:50,463	00:45:51,999	| serial-s03-e01 |	I'm going to do that now take you through
EDL	00:45:52,511	00:45:56,351	| serial-s03-e01 |	It said it when they say she got a fine and was sent on her way it could have been worse
EDL	00:45:56,863	00:45:59,167	| serial-s03-e01 |	You'll see why I'm arguing that it was worse
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:00,447	| serial-s03-e01 |	Quite a lot worse
EDL	00:46:01,983	00:46:05,311	| serial-s03-e01 |	First off and I sat in the back of a police car for at least an hour
EDL	00:46:05,311	00:46:07,359	| serial-s03-e01 |	Belligerent yes but also distraught
EDL	00:46:08,127	00:46:10,431	| serial-s03-e01 |	Then she's booked into the Cleveland City Jail
EDL	00:46:10,431	00:46:11,199	| serial-s03-e01 |	Which is
EDL	00:46:11,199	00:46:12,223	| serial-s03-e01 |	Disgusting
EDL	00:46:12,991	00:46:14,271	| serial-s03-e01 |	Disgusting
EDL	00:46:14,271	00:46:15,039	| serial-s03-e01 |	Agreed
EDL	00:46:15,039	00:46:16,319	| serial-s03-e01 |	I've seen parts of it
EDL	00:46:16,319	00:46:17,855	| serial-s03-e01 |	And I spent four nights there
EDL	00:46:18,623	00:46:20,671	| serial-s03-e01 |	I can say it fast four nights in jail
EDL	00:46:20,671	00:46:22,463	| serial-s03-e01 |	Or I can say it like it fell to Anna
EDL	00:46:22,975	00:46:23,743	| serial-s03-e01 |	Thursday night
EDL	00:46:24,255	00:46:25,279	| serial-s03-e01 |	Then Friday night
EDL	00:46:25,791	00:46:26,815	| serial-s03-e01 |	Saturday night
EDL	00:46:27,327	00:46:28,351	| serial-s03-e01 |	And Sunday night
EDL	00:46:29,119	00:46:29,887	| serial-s03-e01 |	Your bar fight
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:31,167	| serial-s03-e01 |	4 Days of Night
EDL	00:46:32,191	00:46:33,215	| serial-s03-e01 |	It was loud in there
EDL	00:46:33,215	00:46:36,031	| serial-s03-e01 |	People shouting and arguing up and down and across the cells
EDL	00:46:36,543	00:46:41,407	| serial-s03-e01 |	And I slept on a mat on the floor no blanket no sheet a pathetic little sponge on a stick
EDL	00:46:41,407	00:46:41,919	| serial-s03-e01 |	For a toothbrush
EDL	00:46:42,431	00:46:47,551	| serial-s03-e01 |	Because Aunt has white and skinny and it said people assume she was a heroin addict and gave her a hard time about that
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:48,831	| serial-s03-e01 |	Color clock in a junkie
EDL	00:46:49,343	00:46:51,647	| serial-s03-e01 |	Messing with each other just to pass
EDL	00:46:51,647	00:46:53,439	| serial-s03-e01 |	The time everyone's board
EDL	00:46:53,439	00:46:54,975	| serial-s03-e01 |	There's no TV
EDL	00:46:54,975	00:46:59,839	| serial-s03-e01 |	They gave you maybe like a magazine that's an interesting light
EDL	00:47:00,607	00:47:04,703	| serial-s03-e01 |	Where to eat in Cleveland by
EDL	00:47:05,471	00:47:09,311	| serial-s03-e01 |	Why do it their food cycling you're just sitting in there like
EDL	00:47:10,079	00:47:11,359	| serial-s03-e01 |	Finally Monday,
EDL	00:47:11,871	00:47:12,895	| serial-s03-e01 |	And Anna sees a judge
EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:15,199	| serial-s03-e01 |	Who sets her bond at $5,000
EDL	00:47:15,711	00:47:16,479	| serial-s03-e01 |	That's a lot
EDL	00:47:16,991	00:47:18,271	| serial-s03-e01 |	The judge had other choices
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:21,343	| serial-s03-e01 |	Anna could have been let out of jail was just a promise to come back to
EDL	00:47:21,343	00:47:22,111	| serial-s03-e01 |	Court
EDL	00:47:22,111	00:47:24,159	| serial-s03-e01 |	But this was $5,000
EDL	00:47:24,159	00:47:24,927	| serial-s03-e01 |	Full payment
EDL	00:47:24,927	00:47:25,951	| serial-s03-e01 |	Which antigen have
EDL	00:47:26,463	00:47:30,815	| serial-s03-e01 |	Instead she paid a bondsman a fee of $500 to post the bond for her
EDL	00:47:30,815	00:47:32,095	| serial-s03-e01 |	Money she doesn't get back
EDL	00:47:32,607	00:47:34,655	| serial-s03-e01 |	If she hadn't been able to Muster that fee
EDL	00:47:34,655	00:47:36,703	| serial-s03-e01 |	Should have been sitting in jail for months possibly
EDL	00:47:37,983	00:47:40,799	| serial-s03-e01 |	A condition of her bond is Court supervised release
EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:42,079	| serial-s03-e01 |	Certified pre-trial probation
EDL	00:47:42,591	00:47:45,663	| serial-s03-e01 |	Every Wednesday she's got to come back downtown
EDL	00:47:45,663	00:47:46,687	| serial-s03-e01 |	Check in
EDL	00:47:46,687	00:47:48,223	| serial-s03-e01 |	I pee in a cup for drug test
EDL	00:47:48,991	00:47:51,039	| serial-s03-e01 |	These visits are on top of the pre-trial
EDL	00:47:52,063	00:47:55,135	| serial-s03-e01 |	All told anime more than 20 trips to the Justice Center for this
EDL	00:47:55,647	00:47:56,927	| serial-s03-e01 |	She does not live close by
EDL	00:47:58,207	00:48:03,071	| serial-s03-e01 |	The judge find her $200 for the disorderly conduct plus court fees
EDL	00:48:03,071	00:48:05,887	| serial-s03-e01 |	Which she has to pay because she put guilty she was convicted
EDL	00:48:06,399	00:48:11,263	| serial-s03-e01 |	If the state had dropped the charger she going to trial in one these fees would disappear
EDL	00:48:11,263	00:48:14,335	| serial-s03-e01 |	I showed them the rest asked if he could explain the itemized list
EDL	00:48:14,847	00:48:16,383	| serial-s03-e01 |	14 different fees
EDL	00:48:16,383	00:48:19,455	| serial-s03-e01 |	Summit names that suggested deep respect for catch-all accounting
EDL	00:48:19,967	00:48:21,247	| serial-s03-e01 |	Reparations
EDL	00:48:21,247	00:48:22,783	| serial-s03-e01 |	County operations
EDL	00:48:22,783	00:48:24,575	| serial-s03-e01 |	Court special projects fund
EDL	00:48:24,575	00:48:26,367	| serial-s03-e01 |	And then call Dad fee
EDL	00:48:26,367	00:48:28,415	| serial-s03-e01 |	Russ had no idea what the stuff was
EDL	00:48:30,207	00:48:32,511	| serial-s03-e01 |	You're laughing why
EDL	00:48:33,279	00:48:35,071	| serial-s03-e01 |	Oh my
EDL	00:48:35,071	00:48:36,863	| serial-s03-e01 |	Steep is what it is
EDL	00:48:37,631	00:48:41,983	| serial-s03-e01 |	Anarosa Court a total of $784.50
EDL	00:48:41,983	00:48:44,287	| serial-s03-e01 |	On top of the 500 she paid the bondsman
EDL	00:48:45,055	00:48:48,895	| serial-s03-e01 |	Russ said there's a way you can petition the court to waive the fee Savannah can't pay
EDL	00:48:48,895	00:48:53,247	| serial-s03-e01 |	But she doesn't ask him to and he doesn't offer technically is not a lawyer anymore
EDL	00:48:53,759	00:48:56,063	| serial-s03-e01 |	List of fuse was a surprise to Anna to

EDL	00:48:57,087	00:48:58,111	| serial-s03-e01 |	Before this number

EDL	00:50:06,463	00:50:08,255	| serial-s03-e01 |	Someone who's got no common sense
EDL	00:50:08,767	00:50:11,583	| serial-s03-e01 |	Maybe they do 3 years 5 years means nothing
EDL	00:50:12,095	00:50:13,887	| serial-s03-e01 |	They go right back out and commit more crimes

EDL	00:50:20,287	00:50:23,103	| serial-s03-e01 |	But there was a more disturbing invocation as well
EDL	00:50:23,103	00:50:24,895	| serial-s03-e01 |	When it prowls this Courthouse
EDL	00:50:24,895	00:50:26,175	| serial-s03-e01 |	Send throughout our criminal justice

EDL	00:50:41,535	00:50:43,839	| serial-s03-e01 |	The same way you are I would
EDL	00:50:43,839	00:50:47,679	| serial-s03-e01 |	This little case for the state of Ohio wasn't little for Anna
EDL	00:50:48,447	00:50:53,311	| serial-s03-e01 |	In our interview she couldn't bring herself to watch the bar surveillance video of that night it was too upsetting
EDL	00:50:54,079	00:50:57,919	| serial-s03-e01 |	She teared up a couple of times thinking about what a horrible year it has been
EDL	00:50:57,919	00:50:58,943	| serial-s03-e01 |	She blamed herself
EDL	00:50:59,455	00:51:00,735	| serial-s03-e01 |	She's been stupid to go to a bar like
EDL	00:51:01,247	00:51:02,783	| serial-s03-e01 |	She said the people she didn't trust
EDL	00:51:04,319	00:51:07,391	| serial-s03-e01 |	Anna doesn't have money just have a stable job
EDL	00:51:07,391	00:51:08,927	| serial-s03-e01 |	She's really young
EDL	00:51:08,927	00:51:09,695	| serial-s03-e01 |	Just 21
EDL	00:51:10,207	00:51:15,327	| serial-s03-e01 |	And I didn't feel the stress and outrage and shame of this case less than I would have
EDL	00:51:15,839	00:51:16,863	| serial-s03-e01 |	I think she felt it more
EDL	00:51:24,799	00:51:28,383	| serial-s03-e01 |	Before and his final day in court when she ended up taking a plea
EDL	00:51:28,383	00:51:31,711	| serial-s03-e01 |	Russet had only one interaction with the judge regarding Anna's case
EDL	00:51:32,223	00:51:34,015	| serial-s03-e01 |	He was coming to her Chambers by her bailiff
EDL	00:51:34,527	00:51:36,831	| serial-s03-e01 |	Who told us that judge Clancy had a question for him
EDL	00:51:37,599	00:51:39,391	| serial-s03-e01 |	Press waited around for 20 minutes
EDL	00:51:39,391	00:51:41,951	| serial-s03-e01 |	Annabelle came out and just relay the question
EDL	00:51:42,463	00:51:45,023	| serial-s03-e01 |	Curiosity the judge would like to know
EDL	00:51:45,023	00:51:48,095	| serial-s03-e01 |	Was the defendant in this case related to a County judge
EDL	00:51:48,095	00:51:48,607	| serial-s03-e01 |	Retired
EDL	00:51:49,119	00:51:49,887	| serial-s03-e01 |	Team last name
EDL	00:51:50,911	00:51:51,935	| serial-s03-e01 |	Bristol the bailiff
EDL	00:51:51,935	00:51:52,703	| serial-s03-e01 |	No
EDL	00:51:52,703	00:51:53,471	| serial-s03-e01 |	No relation
EDL	00:51:55,007	00:51:57,311	| serial-s03-e01 |	Bristol need is almost a year after it happened
EDL	00:51:58,079	00:52:01,407	| serial-s03-e01 |	What is the answer to Ben yes and it was related to the retired judge
EDL	00:52:01,919	00:52:03,455	| serial-s03-e01 |	It would have been dismissed
EDL	00:52:03,967	00:52:07,039	| serial-s03-e01 |	If they found out she was a judge's knees are related in some way
EDL	00:52:07,039	00:52:08,319	| serial-s03-e01 |	I don't think she even would have been charged
EDL	00:52:10,879	00:52:12,415	| serial-s03-e01 |	Is that how it works in Cleveland
