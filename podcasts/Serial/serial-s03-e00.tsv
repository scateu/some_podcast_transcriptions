EDL	00:00:00,512	00:00:04,096	| serial-s03-e00 |	I spent more than a year inside the criminal courthouse in Cleveland Ohio
EDL	00:00:04,608	00:00:07,168	| serial-s03-e00 |	I want to tell you quickly about this one case I watch
EDL	00:00:07,168	00:00:07,936	| serial-s03-e00 |	Early on
EDL	00:00:08,704	00:00:10,240	| serial-s03-e00 |	The case was set for trial
EDL	00:00:10,240	00:00:11,264	| serial-s03-e00 |	Was about to start
EDL	00:00:11,776	00:00:12,544	| serial-s03-e00 |	The judge
EDL	00:00:12,544	00:00:15,360	| serial-s03-e00 |	You telling the defendant that he might be wise to just
EDL	00:00:15,360	00:00:16,128	| serial-s03-e00 |	Skip the trial
EDL	00:00:16,640	00:00:17,664	| serial-s03-e00 |	I plead guilty
EDL	00:00:17,664	00:00:19,712	| serial-s03-e00 |	Is risking a lot of prison time
EDL	00:00:19,712	00:00:20,480	| serial-s03-e00 |	Have you thought about
EDL	00:00:21,248	00:00:23,040	| serial-s03-e00 |	The judge was listing the charges
EDL	00:00:23,040	00:00:27,648	| serial-s03-e00 |	Counting all the years that defendant might be looking at if we were found guilty by a jury
EDL	00:00:27,648	00:00:29,952	| serial-s03-e00 |	So does it make sense
EDL	00:00:30,720	00:00:31,744	| serial-s03-e00 |	Taurus
EDL	00:00:31,744	00:00:33,024	| serial-s03-e00 |	Additional
EDL	00:00:34,048	00:00:35,328	| serial-s03-e00 |	28 years
EDL	00:00:36,608	00:00:39,168	| serial-s03-e00 |	In counts 1 and 2 alone
EDL	00:00:40,192	00:00:43,776	| serial-s03-e00 |	I believe he's charged with either three or four kidnappings is that correct
EDL	00:00:43,776	00:00:45,312	| serial-s03-e00 |	The numbers kept growing
EDL	00:00:45,312	00:00:46,592	| serial-s03-e00 |	36 years
EDL	00:00:46,592	00:00:47,360	| serial-s03-e00 |	42 years
EDL	00:00:47,872	00:00:49,408	| serial-s03-e00 |	For the kidnapping charges alone
EDL	00:00:50,176	00:00:51,456	| serial-s03-e00 |	Adding to the tension
EDL	00:00:51,456	00:00:54,272	| serial-s03-e00 |	Is that the defendant had a lawyer standing next to him
EDL	00:00:54,272	00:00:55,552	| serial-s03-e00 |	But he didn't want to use them
EDL	00:00:56,064	00:00:57,344	| serial-s03-e00 |	He wanted to represent himself
EDL	00:00:57,856	00:00:59,136	| serial-s03-e00 |	The judge was telling him
EDL	00:00:59,136	00:01:03,232	| serial-s03-e00 |	Awful idea you're already screwing this up
EDL	00:01:04,256	00:01:05,792	| serial-s03-e00 |	How prideful can you be
EDL	00:01:06,304	00:01:08,352	| serial-s03-e00 |	The defendant name is Greg Rucker
EDL	00:01:08,352	00:01:09,376	| serial-s03-e00 |	Was in his early twenties
EDL	00:01:09,888	00:01:12,448	| serial-s03-e00 |	He pleaded guilty instead of going to trial
EDL	00:01:12,448	00:01:13,472	| serial-s03-e00 |	Who's going to do maybe
EDL	00:01:13,472	00:01:14,240	| serial-s03-e00 |	560 years
EDL	00:01:14,752	00:01:16,288	| serial-s03-e00 |	The judge kept Adam
EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:21,408	| serial-s03-e00 |	Sure you don't want to change your mind we're about to choose the jurors
EDL	00:01:22,688	00:01:24,992	| serial-s03-e00 |	I thought for sure Greg Rucker would cave
EDL	00:01:24,992	00:01:26,528	| serial-s03-e00 |	It was such an onslaught
EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:29,600	| serial-s03-e00 |	Priester there in his jail scrubs and Crocs
EDL	00:01:30,112	00:01:30,880	| serial-s03-e00 |	Quiet but firm
EDL	00:01:31,392	00:01:33,440	| serial-s03-e00 |	He knew what he was doing he wanted to trial
EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:37,280	| serial-s03-e00 |	Besides me there was only one other person in the gallery
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:38,304	| serial-s03-e00 |	A friend of Greg's
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:39,584	| serial-s03-e00 |	At riding young guy named Drake
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:43,424	| serial-s03-e00 |	During a break he stepped out into the hallway I followed
EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:45,472	| serial-s03-e00 |	Craigslist started appealing to him
EDL	00:01:46,240	00:01:47,776	| serial-s03-e00 |	I'm very concerned
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:48,544	| serial-s03-e00 |	For your friend
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:49,824	| serial-s03-e00 |	Bright
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:51,872	| serial-s03-e00 |	The lawyer also thought it was Madness
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:53,152	| serial-s03-e00 |	For Greg to go to trial
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:55,456	| serial-s03-e00 |	She said to drink if you have any way to talk to him
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:57,504	| serial-s03-e00 |	I am I tried but
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:02:00,320	| serial-s03-e00 |	Drake started talking about Greg's basketball game
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:01,856	| serial-s03-e00 |	How he digs in
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:03,392	| serial-s03-e00 |	Fights Back even when he's down
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:08,000	| serial-s03-e00 |	Which I could see was making the lawyer wonder whether Drake was grasping the gravity of the
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:08,512	| serial-s03-e00 |	Situation
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:12,352	| serial-s03-e00 |	That Type of Way some years it's not a game
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:12,864	| serial-s03-e00 |	Dino
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:14,400	| serial-s03-e00 |	But I mean
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:17,472	| serial-s03-e00 |	I hope that'll be smart about it
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:20,032	| serial-s03-e00 |	The lawyer said he told Greg
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:22,848	| serial-s03-e00 |	Look if you plead you can get out from under this case
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:23,872	| serial-s03-e00 |	And still be in your 20s
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:25,920	| serial-s03-e00 |	Set of getting out when he almost 60
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:28,224	| serial-s03-e00 |	It seem crazy to me
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:30,784	| serial-s03-e00 |	The great to get Decades of prison time
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:32,320	| serial-s03-e00 |	Because
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:33,600	| serial-s03-e00 |	His alleged crime
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:35,904	| serial-s03-e00 |	Was mugging three people early one Sunday morning
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:38,464	| serial-s03-e00 |	At gunpoint so that's bad
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:40,256	| serial-s03-e00 |	He wasn't holding the gun
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:41,280	| serial-s03-e00 |	Another guy was
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:42,304	| serial-s03-e00 |	Co-defendant
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:44,608	| serial-s03-e00 |	Didn't use the gun no one was injured
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:47,680	| serial-s03-e00 |	But Greg was charged with seven very serious felonies
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:49,472	| serial-s03-e00 |	Including three kidnapping
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:51,776	| serial-s03-e00 |	Probably not the kind you're thinking of
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:54,592	| serial-s03-e00 |	The kidnappings were for hindering people's freedom
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:55,360	| serial-s03-e00 |	Wild it robbed them
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:57,920	| serial-s03-e00 |	Drake was sure he was in a cell
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:00,736	| serial-s03-e00 |	He said yes Greg had committed other crimes
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:01,760	| serial-s03-e00 |	Before they talked about it
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:04,320	| serial-s03-e00 |	But this one he told drag
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:05,344	| serial-s03-e00 |	He wasn't there
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:05,856	| serial-s03-e00 |	It wasn't him
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:07,648	| serial-s03-e00 |	I believe for a fact you didn't do it
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:14,816	| serial-s03-e00 |	My thought was if Greg Rucker was risking that much prison time and if he was so sure
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:16,864	| serial-s03-e00 |	Where is case that he wanted to argue it alone
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:18,656	| serial-s03-e00 |	Without the interference of a lawyer
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:20,704	| serial-s03-e00 |	Either Greg Rucker was innocent
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:22,240	| serial-s03-e00 |	He was bonkers
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:33,248	| serial-s03-e00 |	Next day trial again Greg decided to let his lawyer represent him
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:38,112	| serial-s03-e00 |	Good idea everyone agreed the state brought out all the victims and they were Charming
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:40,672	| serial-s03-e00 |	A guy who only Beloved ice cream business
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:46,560	| serial-s03-e00 |	Married couple delivering Plain Dealer newspapers
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:50,400	| serial-s03-e00 |	The wife of the couple Victoria with a teacher at a Christian School
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:54,496	| serial-s03-e00 |	Her Labyrinth sweater and hair Arrangement reminded me of Holly Hobbie
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:56,032	| serial-s03-e00 |	She presented as wholesome
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:57,312	| serial-s03-e00 |	A kind
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:59,360	| serial-s03-e00 |	She called the man who stole her car
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:04,480	| serial-s03-e00 |	Stuck a gun in her husband's face who made her feel like either he or she or the both of them are about to die
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:08,320	| serial-s03-e00 |	She called them the white gentleman rights could have been it was white
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:09,344	| serial-s03-e00 |	And the black gentleman
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:11,648	| serial-s03-e00 |	Choose the perfect State's Witness
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:12,928	| serial-s03-e00 |	Except
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:17,024	| serial-s03-e00 |	She couldn't identify Greg Rucker
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:18,559	| serial-s03-e00 |	No I did not
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:20,863	| serial-s03-e00 |	Her husband also couldn't identify Greg
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:25,215	| serial-s03-e00 |	Another guy who been mud by this Duo have been riding his bike when they came up on him
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:26,495	| serial-s03-e00 |	He can pick out Greg
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:29,567	| serial-s03-e00 |	Can I buy a hundred percent safe for sure
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:32,639	| serial-s03-e00 |	No one saw Greg Rucker
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:34,943	| serial-s03-e00 |	Also there was no physical evidence against him
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:39,295	| serial-s03-e00 |	I know police body camera security footage of caught him on phone
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:43,647	| serial-s03-e00 |	I started to think okay what are the chances I would wander into a wrongful process
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:44,671	| serial-s03-e00 |	Execution right off the bat
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:45,951	| serial-s03-e00 |	There's no way
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:50,815	| serial-s03-e00 |	On the other hand after two days of trial the state's case did seem kind of weak
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:52,863	| serial-s03-e00 |	Maybe cracker was innocent
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:53,887	| serial-s03-e00 |	Who's right
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:54,911	| serial-s03-e00 |	Vista trial
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:56,447	| serial-s03-e00 |	The den
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:57,983	| serial-s03-e00 |	There was a third day
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:06,175	| serial-s03-e00 |	That morning the prosecution introduced jailhouse calls between Gray
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:06,943	| serial-s03-e00 |	His co-defendant
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:08,735	| serial-s03-e00 |	In these recordings
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:09,503	| serial-s03-e00 |	Great sounding
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:10,527	| serial-s03-e00 |	Guilty
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:12,831	| serial-s03-e00 |	Super guilty is how he sounded
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:16,927	| serial-s03-e00 |	Talking about how the cops are onto them how he might avoid being identified
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:19,231	| serial-s03-e00 |	On top of that the co-defendant
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:22,303	| serial-s03-e00 |	Adobe thick tongue fell out with a superlative widow's peak
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:25,887	| serial-s03-e00 |	Testified that indeed Greg had helped him commit these robberies
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:27,935	| serial-s03-e00 |	Greg's one Alibi with
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:29,727	| serial-s03-e00 |	His former girlfriend
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:30,495	| serial-s03-e00 |	Did him no favors
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:33,311	| serial-s03-e00 |	Her testimony may not much sense at all
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,103	| serial-s03-e00 |	Sono
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:37,151	| serial-s03-e00 |	By the end I realized
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:38,431	| serial-s03-e00 |	Not around 4 Prosser
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:39,199	| serial-s03-e00 |	Secretion
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:39,967	| serial-s03-e00 |	Eyewitness
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:41,247	| serial-s03-e00 |	Irregular process
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:45,855	| serial-s03-e00 |	And yet inside this regular prosecution
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:48,415	| serial-s03-e00 |	I seen a Litany of things that shouldn't be allowed
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:51,743	| serial-s03-e00 |	Was like a checklist of almost all the stuff reformers complain about
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:54,559	| serial-s03-e00 |	Extra charges loaded onto a case
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:59,423	| serial-s03-e00 |	Pressure to bleed Chevy police work a police officer possibly lying on the stand
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:03,519	| serial-s03-e00 |	11th Hour evidence shoehorned into a trial overworked attorneys
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:04,799	| serial-s03-e00 |	Dozing jurors
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:08,895	| serial-s03-e00 |	And finally an outsized prison sentence
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:12,735	| serial-s03-e00 |	But no one was stomping their feet too hard about any of that
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:15,295	| serial-s03-e00 |	In the Cleveland Courthouse this was a nothing case
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:16,831	| serial-s03-e00 |	No not really watching
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:18,111	| serial-s03-e00 |	Besides
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:19,647	| serial-s03-e00 |	Why would anyone care
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:21,439	| serial-s03-e00 |	Greg was guilty
