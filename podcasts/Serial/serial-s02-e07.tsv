EDL	00:00:38,144	00:00:40,448	| serial-s02-e07 |	All felt like why are we up here
EDL	00:00:40,448	00:00:46,336	| serial-s02-e07 |	I can't do anything but just keep going going out and shaking hands and I love it
EDL	00:00:46,336	00:00:52,480	| serial-s02-e07 |	And this is the one where I said I don't want to see more this f****** Lawrence of Arabia s*** I said out loud

EDL	00:01:18,592	00:01:21,664	| serial-s02-e07 |	Talk to somebody I need to report a missing person
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:28,320	| serial-s02-e07 |	From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial one story told week by week
EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:29,088	| serial-s02-e07 |	I'm Sarah Koenig
EDL	00:01:33,952	00:01:36,000	| serial-s02-e07 |	If I were a soldier with some pride
EDL	00:01:36,000	00:01:36,512	| serial-s02-e07 |	With principal
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:40,096	| serial-s02-e07 |	And I had to come up with a reason for walking off into Afghanistan
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:42,656	| serial-s02-e07 |	Causing a crisis on so many levels
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:45,728	| serial-s02-e07 |	I might engineer something like those explanation
EDL	00:01:46,240	00:01:48,544	| serial-s02-e07 |	That I was sacrificing myself for the team
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:49,824	| serial-s02-e07 |	Because I thought they were in danger
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:52,128	| serial-s02-e07 |	It's a way to save face
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:54,432	| serial-s02-e07 |	To say my intentions were Noble and good
EDL	00:01:55,200	00:01:58,016	| serial-s02-e07 |	Over the months of reporting the story I have wondered about this
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:02:01,088	| serial-s02-e07 |	Weather bow was really telling the truth about why he left his Platoon
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:03,648	| serial-s02-e07 |	Or if he was telling the version he could live with
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:05,952	| serial-s02-e07 |	Mark and I've also debated this
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:06,720	| serial-s02-e07 |	Of course
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:10,048	| serial-s02-e07 |	Once when we were talking Mark took the microphone and started to interview me
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:13,888	| serial-s02-e07 |	Well I guess I'm interested in more narrow stance do you think he's lying
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:23,360	| serial-s02-e07 |	I mean I'm just asking
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:29,504	| serial-s02-e07 |	Because you 10 still bothers me
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:31,808	| serial-s02-e07 |	Remember the coochie
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:36,160	| serial-s02-e07 |	The Taliban said they first captured by when he wandered into a coochie 10 or near coochie tent
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:41,280	| serial-s02-e07 |	Which wasn't part of those telling it all it made me think if Bo had walked into a coochie tent
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:44,864	| serial-s02-e07 |	Maybe he wasn't really headed to fob sharana to tell someone about leadership problem
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:47,168	| serial-s02-e07 |	Maybe you should try to run away
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:47,680	| serial-s02-e07 |	Looking for help
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:52,544	| serial-s02-e07 |	Mark and I had that conversation back in September I've since moved on from the coochie
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:57,152	| serial-s02-e07 |	I don't think it's verifiable or that much of a discrepancy with those version of what happened actually
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:04,064	| serial-s02-e07 |	Promises to say I can understand why some other people both served with when I first talked to them
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:05,344	| serial-s02-e07 |	Hidden Bible story
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:07,648	| serial-s02-e07 |	I thought maybe he concocted it in hindsight
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:09,440	| serial-s02-e07 |	But I put a 20
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:11,488	| serial-s02-e07 |	Inmates chain cross he said quote
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:13,024	| serial-s02-e07 |	She had some years to work on that
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:23,520	| serial-s02-e07 |	There's a Litany of reasons why someone could be skeptical of both explanation
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:27,360	| serial-s02-e07 |	First his premise that leadership was dangerously bad
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:30,432	| serial-s02-e07 |	For the most part the soldiers we talked to didn't agree
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:33,248	| serial-s02-e07 |	That was some said they actually loved some of their leaders thought they were great
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:38,368	| serial-s02-e07 |	And Lieutenant Colonel Clint Baker the Battalion Commander Bauer responded to so negatively
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:43,232	| serial-s02-e07 |	Getting overall they didn't think he was putting them in situations that were crazy risky or that they couldn't handle
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:48,352	| serial-s02-e07 |	Then the notion that both would have to do something so dramatic to be listened to
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:49,376	| serial-s02-e07 |	Also not true
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:51,936	| serial-s02-e07 |	Which is so
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:53,216	| serial-s02-e07 |	Orderly outlandish
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:55,776	| serial-s02-e07 |	I mean it doesn't pass
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:58,336	| serial-s02-e07 |	Oh man because of where they were
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:02,176	| serial-s02-e07 |	A couple of days prior they were on fob sharana which is
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:02,688	| serial-s02-e07 |	Huge
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:04,224	| serial-s02-e07 |	And has
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:05,248	| serial-s02-e07 |	All sorts of off
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:08,064	| serial-s02-e07 |	Any any one of them could have gone and talk to you
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:09,600	| serial-s02-e07 |	That's Mark McCrory
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:16,256	| serial-s02-e07 |	Is an open door policy that allows you to approach any officer at all with a problem doesn't have to be in your chain of command
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:20,607	| serial-s02-e07 |	But whether an officer would have taken both seriously I have to say is doubtful
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:21,375	| serial-s02-e07 |	About knew that
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:27,519	| serial-s02-e07 |	Big one I heard from quite a few people was it Bowie either was in cahoots with local afghans
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:29,567	| serial-s02-e07 |	Or even wanting to contact the Taliban
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:32,127	| serial-s02-e07 |	Here's Darrell Hanson John Thurman
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:37,503	| serial-s02-e07 |	I mean for him just to like walk out where he did like he wasn't afraid of them
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:38,783	| serial-s02-e07 |	He will be he had to
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:41,855	| serial-s02-e07 |	Had some kind of compassion for him
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:47,487	| serial-s02-e07 |	And didn't like us for him to walk away and I like
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:51,327	| serial-s02-e07 |	I know where again I have to go back to the question where are you going to go
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:56,959	| serial-s02-e07 |	Cuz if there's no other option you've either got our side or the Taliban side
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:05:03,103	| serial-s02-e07 |	A lot of people pointed out that Bo hung out with the Afghan police who were also stationed at The Outpost at mess
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:05,663	| serial-s02-e07 |	Etsy with them eat meals with them
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:06,687	| serial-s02-e07 |	Other people did too
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:08,735	| serial-s02-e07 |	It was great it was great food
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:11,551	| serial-s02-e07 |	But some people said boat was there more often
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:14,367	| serial-s02-e07 |	Seems more interested in them than other people did
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:20,511	| serial-s02-e07 |	Josh quarter said that bull was once late for a guard shift and had to go looking for him and found him having tea with the Afghan
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:27,167	| serial-s02-e07 |	Stand the table went missing Josh says he heard that to the A&P guys were also unaccounted for
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:29,727	| serial-s02-e07 |	Two Afghan police were missing as well
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:30,495	| serial-s02-e07 |	So
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:34,079	| serial-s02-e07 |	That seemed very logical to me that all seemed to make sense cuz
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:36,383	| serial-s02-e07 |	Okay well now he may have to
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:40,223	| serial-s02-e07 |	Guides or he has two people he
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:42,527	| serial-s02-e07 |	Is looking to meet up with
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:46,879	| serial-s02-e07 |	Maybe Bo had made a deal with these guys someone betrayed him or sold them out to the Taliban
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:50,719	| serial-s02-e07 |	I tried to check this Intel
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:56,863	| serial-s02-e07 |	I called the former Governor of Pacheco province in Afghanistan the guy who'd worked pretty closely with the leaders and Bows battalion
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:58,399	| serial-s02-e07 |	But he wouldn't talk to me on a cell phone
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:02,751	| serial-s02-e07 |	I did invite me to visit in person which is very nice but not immediately helpful
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:08,895	| serial-s02-e07 |	I did not say anything about the missing cops in the Wikileaks reports or in general dolls investigation
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:15,807	| serial-s02-e07 |	Executive officer above Battalion told me he'd heard this rumor to about some missing Afghans but he did not
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:16,831	| serial-s02-e07 |	Know if anything came of it
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:23,999	| serial-s02-e07 |	Sami Yusuf side the Afghan reporter asked around about it as well he told us there was a report of some missing Afghan
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:24,767	| serial-s02-e07 |	And please
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:25,791	| serial-s02-e07 |	It was later discredited
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:28,351	| serial-s02-e07 |	Market
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:29,375	| serial-s02-e07 |	Fiasco about it
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:33,983	| serial-s02-e07 |	Lenny idea was you had some A&P guys who were going to help you out or no
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:36,799	| serial-s02-e07 |	Local police
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:48,063	| serial-s02-e07 |	I was right
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:49,855	| serial-s02-e07 |	The guys were
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:54,207	| serial-s02-e07 |	I have every reason to
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:07:00,863	| serial-s02-e07 |	Who said the reason he hung out with the A&P sometimes was because that was part of the mission
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:04,447	| serial-s02-e07 |	Build a rapport in case they ever ended up in a firefight together
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:05,471	| serial-s02-e07 |	Who's trying to do coin
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:08,543	| serial-s02-e07 |	He says that's also why he tried to learn a little patch though
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:10,591	| serial-s02-e07 |	Which some soldiers also said made them suspicious
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:14,431	| serial-s02-e07 |	The evidence people point to most often though
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:16,991	| serial-s02-e07 |	To support the idea that Bo was simply deserting
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:18,015	| serial-s02-e07 |	React no higher purpose
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:21,343	| serial-s02-e07 |	Was that he had talked about doing exactly that
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:22,623	| serial-s02-e07 |	Taking off
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:27,487	| serial-s02-e07 |	Several people told General doll they'd heard both say things about walking into the mount
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:29,279	| serial-s02-e07 |	Pakistan are heading to India
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:33,375	| serial-s02-e07 |	It's a one-person something like this even before he deployed while he was still in Alaska
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:35,167	| serial-s02-e07 |	Christmas angles
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:37,215	| serial-s02-e07 |	Probably about his closest friend in the platoon
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:39,775	| serial-s02-e07 |	Imma make him talking about
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:43,871	| serial-s02-e07 |	You know the mountains and how great it look and you know imagine
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:48,479	| serial-s02-e07 |	Just walking out there remember all that stuff I mean I always right there when you was talking about it
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:53,855	| serial-s02-e07 |	Chain cross if you'd had a conversation with bow the night before he left the Opie
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:57,439	| serial-s02-e07 |	Was evening and the guys were sitting around in the shade of a truck.
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:58,207	| serial-s02-e07 |	Talking
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:59,231	| serial-s02-e07 |	And the topic came up
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:00,255	| serial-s02-e07 |	How would you fake your death
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:01,535	| serial-s02-e07 |	I don't know
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,071	| serial-s02-e07 |	Papa cliff
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:08,191	| serial-s02-e07 |	They told me that he faked his death Afghanistan war
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:09,215	| serial-s02-e07 |	You just disappear
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:10,751	| serial-s02-e07 |	I want to see your casualty
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:13,823	| serial-s02-e07 |	Annie sez
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:15,359	| serial-s02-e07 |	That is goal
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:17,407	| serial-s02-e07 |	That he was to fake his death
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:20,223	| serial-s02-e07 |	Did they even get to Pakistan
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:22,783	| serial-s02-e07 |	And the Indians went up with a gang over there
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:25,087	| serial-s02-e07 |	Austin Lanford was there too
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:27,391	| serial-s02-e07 |	This is the first time he'd ever talked about
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:28,159	| serial-s02-e07 |	The night before you left the old
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:31,743	| serial-s02-e07 |	An Austin remembers the conversation about the same way Shane.
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:34,047	| serial-s02-e07 |	Wanting to be a
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:37,119	| serial-s02-e07 |	Mercenary
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:38,143	| serial-s02-e07 |	Of sorts
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:42,495	| serial-s02-e07 |	And it was something along the lines of
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:45,823	| serial-s02-e07 |	He was going to join a group
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:47,871	| serial-s02-e07 |	I go up in their ranks
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:48,639	| serial-s02-e07 |	And then
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:52,223	| serial-s02-e07 |	Shobaleader and then
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:55,039	| serial-s02-e07 |	And then he'd be known
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:57,087	| serial-s02-e07 |	For being a mercenary or something like that
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:00,671	| serial-s02-e07 |	That's what you remember that's what the gist I got
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:02,975	| serial-s02-e07 |	He said no Russian
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:05,535	| serial-s02-e07 |	Restaurant that big influence in India with games
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:09,119	| serial-s02-e07 |	I mean he told me about Russian that he work is left in the game
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:10,911	| serial-s02-e07 |	Heading into Russian mob
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:12,447	| serial-s02-e07 |	Hitman
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:14,239	| serial-s02-e07 |	Will also ask about a weapon
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:17,567	| serial-s02-e07 |	He was issued a saw big heavy machine gun
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:19,615	| serial-s02-e07 |	Chain her to Pistol and M9
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:21,407	| serial-s02-e07 |	He tells me I hate
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:22,431	| serial-s02-e07 |	What would happen if your
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:24,223	| serial-s02-e07 |	Dyno near disappeared
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:27,295	| serial-s02-e07 |	I told Mike in trouble
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:30,111	| serial-s02-e07 |	We are like that's a stupid question like yeah
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:30,623	| serial-s02-e07 |	Of course
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:35,999	| serial-s02-e07 |	And then
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:37,023	| serial-s02-e07 |	Someone took it from you
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:38,815	| serial-s02-e07 |	I said I'd get in trouble
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:41,887	| serial-s02-e07 |	Okay
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:44,447	| serial-s02-e07 |	Oh didn't take a gun with him when he left
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:50,335	| serial-s02-e07 |	Looking back on it now. Shane says it's like if an ice cream truck drove by
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:52,127	| serial-s02-e07 |	And somebody said hey I think I might scream
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:54,943	| serial-s02-e07 |	And then the next thing you know the person is gone
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:56,735	| serial-s02-e07 |	You going to figure they went after the ice cream truck
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:02,367	| serial-s02-e07 |	For his part Austin was reluctant to tell me about the conversation
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:04,927	| serial-s02-e07 |	Because obviously he knows how it sounds
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:06,463	| serial-s02-e07 |	It's a little
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:07,231	| serial-s02-e07 |	Extreme
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:11,583	| serial-s02-e07 |	And I kind of don't want to make him seem like she was
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:13,631	| serial-s02-e07 |	Crazy or organelle
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:16,959	| serial-s02-e07 |	Not in his right mind cuz we all had
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:20,543	| serial-s02-e07 |	Weird thoughts while we're over there isolated from anybody
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:22,335	| serial-s02-e07 |	Another words
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:24,383	| serial-s02-e07 |	Wanderlust E comments like this
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:25,919	| serial-s02-e07 |	All that strange
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:28,223	| serial-s02-e07 |	So many people told me
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:29,759	| serial-s02-e07 |	Fear + stress
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:32,319	| serial-s02-e07 |	Boredom plus Warzone means
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:34,367	| serial-s02-e07 |	You say some really off-the-wall stuff
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:41,791	| serial-s02-e07 |	Another platoon mate Jason Frye told me he wrote letters to a friend when he was in Afghanistan and got them back years later
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:43,071	| serial-s02-e07 |	Read through them he thought
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:45,119	| serial-s02-e07 |	What was I thinking who was I
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:47,167	| serial-s02-e07 |	Is Mark McCurry
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:50,239	| serial-s02-e07 |	Things that we get away with saying to each other
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:51,263	| serial-s02-e07 |	Completely Ludacris
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:54,335	| serial-s02-e07 |	Give me an example of Fort Hood shooting was when on
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:11:00,735	| serial-s02-e07 |	While we were there and I remember that we were watching it on some grainy television in the armed forces
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:03,807	| serial-s02-e07 |	Dish Network in the chow hall on my buddies for sale for Migos
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:06,879	| serial-s02-e07 |	We have to go back out again tonight I want to make Fort Hood look like church
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:13,279	| serial-s02-e07 |	Dark and creepy
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:18,399	| serial-s02-e07 |	You know the only kind of humor we understand I mean we're wound up pretty tight yeah yeah
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:24,031	| serial-s02-e07 |	General dog considered all the evidence
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:26,079	| serial-s02-e07 |	Pointing to the idea that Bo was deserting
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:26,591	| serial-s02-e07 |	Permanently
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:29,919	| serial-s02-e07 |	He heard about the weird comments about the Intel
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:31,967	| serial-s02-e07 |	And he concluded Beau was telling the truth
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:36,319	| serial-s02-e07 |	Bose quote stated motive was well-meaning in his mind.
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:37,855	| serial-s02-e07 |	Ironically
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:40,159	| serial-s02-e07 |	The basis for his stated motive was incorrect
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:44,511	| serial-s02-e07 |	Mark spent about a year thinking it through
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:46,559	| serial-s02-e07 |	And he also ended up believing though
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,583	| serial-s02-e07 |	Philosophy
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:48,863	| serial-s02-e07 |	Probably just for practical reason
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:51,935	| serial-s02-e07 |	Princess Belle with such a careful planner
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:53,727	| serial-s02-e07 |	He was an outdoor kid who grown up in the mountains
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:58,335	| serial-s02-e07 |	The intended to just disappear permanently desert why wouldn't he bring more food
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:58,847	| serial-s02-e07 |	More water
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:02,431	| serial-s02-e07 |	Beside his computer and some other stuff home in a box
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:03,199	| serial-s02-e07 |	Before you left the Okie
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:06,015	| serial-s02-e07 |	Some people see is evidence he was leaving for good
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:07,807	| serial-s02-e07 |	Mark sees it as the opposite
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:11,135	| serial-s02-e07 |	And take it with you if you're going to India
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:14,463	| serial-s02-e07 |	Throw it in a backpack and a charger
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:14,975	| serial-s02-e07 |	You know
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:20,351	| serial-s02-e07 |	Eight you know he sent the form yet cuz he thought he was going Stateside cuz he thought he was going to
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:24,191	| serial-s02-e07 |	She was going to have an audience with the general and then they're going to throne in Leavenworth
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:29,567	| serial-s02-e07 |	It's probably true that he that he anticipated getting his computer back
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:36,479	| serial-s02-e07 |	That's why there's nothing really at the end of data points to the idea
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:38,271	| serial-s02-e07 |	If this was a permanent departure
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:40,831	| serial-s02-e07 |	Shijiazhuang
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:43,647	| serial-s02-e07 |	Justin pack for that
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:50,303	| serial-s02-e07 |	Kiddo
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:52,607	| serial-s02-e07 |	It's just it's that simple
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:55,679	| serial-s02-e07 |	But details like this
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:57,215	| serial-s02-e07 |	Definitely not what convinced me
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:13:01,567	| serial-s02-e07 |	He's logged something like 25 hours of taped conversations with bow
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:03,871	| serial-s02-e07 |	And many more hours of conversation
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:04,383	| serial-s02-e07 |	Not on tape
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:08,735	| serial-s02-e07 |	The more I learn about the and the more I learn about how his mind worked
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:13,855	| serial-s02-e07 |	And the more I talk to him about natural history the other subjects
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:16,159	| serial-s02-e07 |	And realizing that
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:21,535	| serial-s02-e07 |	Of course I would never walk off of Base you know and yeah most of his platoon never would so
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:23,071	| serial-s02-e07 |	If that makes sense it is
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:24,863	| serial-s02-e07 |	It is a totally
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:26,655	| serial-s02-e07 |	Wackadoodle
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,935	| serial-s02-e07 |	Inclusion to make
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:28,959	| serial-s02-e07 |	But
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:32,543	| serial-s02-e07 |	Good night if your Bo Bergdahl
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:35,615	| serial-s02-e07 |	That makes perfect sense
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:40,735	| serial-s02-e07 |	How does it make sense to go
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:46,367	| serial-s02-e07 |	When I finally sat down for an interview with General doll
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:50,975	| serial-s02-e07 |	He didn't just go back pre-deployment to explain what happened once he got to Afghanistan
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:51,999	| serial-s02-e07 |	Do it all the way back
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:53,279	| serial-s02-e07 |	To home
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:54,303	| serial-s02-e07 |	Idaho
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:55,327	| serial-s02-e07 |	To Childhood there
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:59,167	| serial-s02-e07 |	He done a lot of thinking while he was locked up in that cage with the Taliban
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:03,519	| serial-s02-e07 |	Guy looking at myself I looking at the situation going how did I get here
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:08,383	| serial-s02-e07 |	And that question is put me back into my childhood
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:12,223	| serial-s02-e07 |	I got here because I made a choice
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:17,599	| serial-s02-e07 |	But that choice was bald
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:28,863	| serial-s02-e07 |	I'll give you a bit of a backstory I literally grew up by myself
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:34,495	| serial-s02-e07 |	Homeschooling
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:42,687	| serial-s02-e07 |	Completely isolated
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:48,319	| serial-s02-e07 |	So you just screw up like f****** around in the woods in like
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:49,599	| serial-s02-e07 |	Stuff like that
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:54,975	| serial-s02-e07 |	Usually likes

EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:34,911	| serial-s02-e07 |	He wasn't good at his work or you wouldn't do it
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:40,031	| serial-s02-e07 |	And he says you get punished for that and for other things in a way that he says felt unpredictable
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:44,127	| serial-s02-e07 |	But says he was scared all the time getting in trouble
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:45,919	| serial-s02-e07 |	They didn't have the greatest relationship with a

EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:05,151	| serial-s02-e07 |	Questions of

EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:22,560	| serial-s02-e07 |	And reflected against it
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:24,096	| serial-s02-e07 |	And
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:25,632	| serial-s02-e07 |	If you don't want it to be anyone else's

EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:10,944	| serial-s02-e07 |	The world and everybody in it too unrealistic
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:12,224	| serial-s02-e07 |	Sickly high expectations
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:18,624	| serial-s02-e07 |	And if you don't live by those Expectations by those morals in that honor
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:20,928	| serial-s02-e07 |	That he thinks you should
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:21,952	| serial-s02-e07 |	And he tries to live
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:23,744	| serial-s02-e07 |	Stella said he has no respect for you

EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:33,216	| serial-s02-e07 |	It just sounds of impossibly idealistic
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:39,616	| serial-s02-e07 |	Yeah point where it kind of is strangles how you move through the world or something
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:41,152	| serial-s02-e07 |	It's really handicapping
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:42,944	| serial-s02-e07 |	Can I get the handicap
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:45,504	| serial-s02-e07 |	He's constantly struggling
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:47,296	| serial-s02-e07 |	2
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:56,000	| serial-s02-e07 |	Understand how people are okay with everything you know what I mean
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:23:01,888	| serial-s02-e07 |	He doesn't have an understanding of how differently they view the world
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:02,400	| serial-s02-e07 |	Yeah
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:04,960	| serial-s02-e07 |	I think he's fully understanding
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:08,544	| serial-s02-e07 |	That not everybody can accept the way he thinks
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:11,872	| serial-s02-e07 |	But that's never going to change the way he thinks
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:14,944	| serial-s02-e07 |	I got it yeah like his his
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:17,760	| serial-s02-e07 |	He has the least flexible
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:24,416	| serial-s02-e07 |	System ever

EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:46,688	| serial-s02-e07 |	In Alaska
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:50,784	| serial-s02-e07 |	He went down south to work at a military training camp
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:52,576	| serial-s02-e07 |	A place where Special Forces
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:53,088	| serial-s02-e07 |	Guys are gopher
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:56,672	| serial-s02-e07 |	Experience a topo he'd rather be doing what they were doing
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:06,912	| serial-s02-e07 |	The week is up they disappear to go off in
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:14,848	| serial-s02-e07 |	So we left
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:17,408	| serial-s02-e07 |	He went to Florida to complete a charter boat
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:20,224	| serial-s02-e07 |	At some point he left for France
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:21,504	| serial-s02-e07 |	To join the French Foreign Legion
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:24,576	| serial-s02-e07 |	Which Kim says she knows he did arrive in France
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:27,136	| serial-s02-e07 |	She's just not completely sure what happened after that
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:28,928	| serial-s02-e07 |	I didn't really talk much about it
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:34,048	| serial-s02-e07 |	They probably thought he was out of his mind for going there and what and this
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:37,888	| serial-s02-e07 |	Here's a Killer Blonde hair this young cute kid from Idaho
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:41,984	| serial-s02-e07 |	Blonde hair and blue eyes I'm going to join the Foreign Legion hey sign me up
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:43,264	| serial-s02-e07 |	They probably thought he was
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:44,800	| serial-s02-e07 |	Completely
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:48,896	| serial-s02-e07 |	Bunkers for doing that because he was ordered that was just a really bad choice
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:53,504	| serial-s02-e07 |	And of course when he tells me about I think part of the reason he did it was
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:54,528	| serial-s02-e07 |	See my face
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:55,296	| serial-s02-e07 |	Like
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:59,392	| serial-s02-e07 |	Because he didn't tell you about it beforehand though he did and was like are you kidding me
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:01,440	| serial-s02-e07 |	That is the dumbest thing I've ever
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:05,536	| serial-s02-e07 |	You know there was a beginning of me getting incredulos at his choices that was the first
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:07,584	| serial-s02-e07 |	No maybe at the first
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:09,376	| serial-s02-e07 |	The first of many or one of many
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:14,496	| serial-s02-e07 |	He trained on his bike Nick Sabor a lot of spandex in those days
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:16,288	| serial-s02-e07 |	Recycling trip down the West Coast
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:19,360	| serial-s02-e07 |	Which like the Foreign Legion didn't pan out
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:24,224	| serial-s02-e07 |	Few days and he got hit by an RV and he was okay but his bike was ruined
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:27,808	| serial-s02-e07 |	Who came back to catch him and started in on the next idea
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:33,440	| serial-s02-e07 |	Eventually the next idea became the military surprise to his friends
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:35,744	| serial-s02-e07 |	Does brother-in-law was in the Navy
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:37,792	| serial-s02-e07 |	And both had that strong protector quality
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:39,840	| serial-s02-e07 |	Romantic version of it to be sure
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:42,144	| serial-s02-e07 |	You wanted to be invisible Kayla said
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:44,448	| serial-s02-e07 |	Someone who'd be unnoticed in the shadows
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:45,984	| serial-s02-e07 |	Looking out for the innocent
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:47,264	| serial-s02-e07 |	Shooting in when they needed him
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:53,152	| serial-s02-e07 |	And they knew who wanted to put himself in situations that would require courage and Grit
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:58,272	| serial-s02-e07 |	That would test his mettle so that he could come out the other side and know what kind of man he was
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:26:02,880	| serial-s02-e07 |	So they understood it which is not the same as thinking it was a good idea
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:06,720	| serial-s02-e07 |	Please don't do that
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:13,120	| serial-s02-e07 |	Who it should be noted is a pacifist to begin with and he knew how I'd react is probably predictable and I'm going to ask
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:16,960	| serial-s02-e07 |	Are you sure this is something you want to do I think it's a horrible horrible idea
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:18,752	| serial-s02-e07 |	Not just
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:21,056	| serial-s02-e07 |	For you know not not for everyone
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:27,456	| serial-s02-e07 |	You know for you for all the above reasons is romantic expectations his rigid could have
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:33,856	| serial-s02-e07 |	Contact his judgmentalness it up join the crowd follow orders
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:40,256	| serial-s02-e07 |	I said look I know if you want to do that and we not going to listen to me of course you're over 18 do whatever you want
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:46,400	| serial-s02-e07 |	But if you're going to look into the Coast Guard because at least then you'll be helping people you'll be like
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:49,216	| serial-s02-e07 |	Saving people's lives sitting vessels

EDL	00:26:58,688	00:27:00,480	| serial-s02-e07 |	Have you thought of that already know
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:01,760	| serial-s02-e07 |	Sweden
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:03,040	| serial-s02-e07 |	He join the Coast Guard
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:05,600	| serial-s02-e07 |	January of 2006

EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:09,184	| serial-s02-e07 |	Is 19
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:10,976	| serial-s02-e07 |	It lasted only a few weeks
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:34,784	| serial-s02-e07 |	He didn't want to be weak
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:36,064	| serial-s02-e07 |	You didn't want to
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:39,904	| serial-s02-e07 |	Not be able to participate in that system to achieve those goals but
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:42,208	| serial-s02-e07 |	His sensitivities
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:43,232	| serial-s02-e07 |	And
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:47,840	| serial-s02-e07 |	It is way of pondering and overthinking things made it
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:50,656	| serial-s02-e07 |	Highly difficult in that environment to survive
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:54,496	| serial-s02-e07 |	I never actually
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:15,232	| serial-s02-e07 |	And being yelled and screamed at
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:18,048	| serial-s02-e07 |	It didn't take him long to realize he wanted to get out of there
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:19,328	| serial-s02-e07 |	Basic made a mistake
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:25,472	| serial-s02-e07 |	And in the communications that I had from him at the time they were becoming increasingly more worrisome
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:27,264	| serial-s02-e07 |	I was just
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:28,032	| serial-s02-e07 |	In pain
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:29,824	| serial-s02-e07 |	For him you know I breathe
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:30,592	| serial-s02-e07 |	These little notes
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:38,272	| serial-s02-e07 |	They're only like that in the spiral notebooks you flip 3 and 1/2
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:40,320	| serial-s02-e07 |	The four by five for 6
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:45,440	| serial-s02-e07 |	With the ripped off spiral at the top and just running really small and
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:49,792	| serial-s02-e07 |	The riding with change to you know and I didn't as well as stress level increased
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:28:59,776	| serial-s02-e07 |	People are out there
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:18,208	| serial-s02-e07 |	The town was changing is my rambling as more desperate it was just rapidly
EDL	00:29:18,208	00:29:18,720	| serial-s02-e07 |	Yeah
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:21,024	| serial-s02-e07 |	At me now eroding
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:22,560	| serial-s02-e07 |	I think I wrote a couple letters back like
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:27,168	| serial-s02-e07 |	You know are you okay I'm getting really worried this needs to end you know what
EDL	00:29:27,168	00:29:28,448	| serial-s02-e07 |	What can I do
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:40,480	| serial-s02-e07 |	One day out of the blue boat shows up at Strega
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:41,248	| serial-s02-e07 |	The t-bar
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:41,760	| serial-s02-e07 |	He's back
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:43,808	| serial-s02-e07 |	They're all thrilled to see him
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:44,576	| serial-s02-e07 |	And also
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:45,088	| serial-s02-e07 |	Confused
EDL	00:29:45,600	00:29:46,880	| serial-s02-e07 |	What happened where are you back
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:49,184	| serial-s02-e07 |	He told him something about a psychtest
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:51,232	| serial-s02-e07 |	Which he said he pretty much fake
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:53,024	| serial-s02-e07 |	Kevin the others
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:53,792	| serial-s02-e07 |	Didn't really believe them
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:02,240	| serial-s02-e07 |	According to General dolls investigation
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:04,544	| serial-s02-e07 |	What happened is that on third week of training
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:08,128	| serial-s02-e07 |	He was found on the floor with blood on his hands and face
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:09,664	| serial-s02-e07 |	Twin series
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:10,432	| serial-s02-e07 |	Nosebleed
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:14,272	| serial-s02-e07 |	Who says now he doesn't remember how he ended up on the floor
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:20,672	| serial-s02-e07 |	I thought he was told later he was in a fetal position and shaking crying he was taken to the hospital
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:27,072	| serial-s02-e07 |	He told the intake people there he felt overwhelmed he said the next day there were a psychiatrist assess him
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:33,472	| serial-s02-e07 |	And according to dolls report quote observe that PFC bergdahl's mental status is significant for situation
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:33,984	| serial-s02-e07 |	Anxiety
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:40,128	| serial-s02-e07 |	Any recommended discharging him knowing he would need to receive Stress Management counseling
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:46,528	| serial-s02-e07 |	And have quote clearance by a psychiatrist prior to reenlistment
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:51,392	| serial-s02-e07 |	Tide for continued service in the Coast Guard because of a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depression
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:11,104	| serial-s02-e07 |	Brother sister in law
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:23,392	| serial-s02-e07 |	Black sheep of the family
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:25,952	| serial-s02-e07 |	And I figured I could do the Army because
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:27,744	| serial-s02-e07 |	The Army was more
EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:39,008	| serial-s02-e07 |	Military
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:43,104	| serial-s02-e07 |	Yeah
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:58,464	| serial-s02-e07 |	Do that too when I join the Army at
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:32:03,072	| serial-s02-e07 |	I thought I was in a much better position
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:09,984	| serial-s02-e07 |	Because of the way that Bo had been was called separated from the Coast Guard
EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:14,848	| serial-s02-e07 |	There was a code in his military record indicating he'd need a waiver if he ever wanted to re-enlist
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:18,688	| serial-s02-e07 |	In other words the Army would have to waive its usual standards to let bow in
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:22,016	| serial-s02-e07 |	May 2008 when both signed up
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:24,320	| serial-s02-e07 |	Happened to be a good time to get a waiver
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:25,856	| serial-s02-e07 |	There's been a surge in Iraq
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:27,392	| serial-s02-e07 |	Maybe another one coming in Afghanistan
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:29,952	| serial-s02-e07 |	The Army was hurting for recruits
EDL	00:32:29,952	00:32:31,744	| serial-s02-e07 |	Easing up on restrictions
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:32,256	| serial-s02-e07 |	Is criminal record
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:34,560	| serial-s02-e07 |	That might have disqualified people in the past
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:39,424	| serial-s02-e07 |	Give me a sentence in 2001 about 4% of army recruits got waivers
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:41,984	| serial-s02-e07 |	By 2007 it was 20%
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:45,312	| serial-s02-e07 |	2008 that your bow enlisted it was about Seventeen percent
EDL	00:32:46,848	00:32:49,664	| serial-s02-e07 |	Because it's Coast Guard discharge was labeled uncharacterized
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:52,736	| serial-s02-e07 |	It seems pretty much although had to do to get a waiver
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:57,088	| serial-s02-e07 |	Was write a paragraph explaining to the Boise recruiter why he been separated from the coast
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:33:02,720	| serial-s02-e07 |	Hard time adapting to change didn't feel prepared to be on his own
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:03,232	| serial-s02-e07 |	Adam family
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:05,024	| serial-s02-e07 |	Going on Altru
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:09,376	| serial-s02-e07 |	The statement which was typed up by the recruiter as he was speaking with bow
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:12,192	| serial-s02-e07 |	Says quote I have matured and know that I am her
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:13,216	| serial-s02-e07 |	Prepare to go into the army
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:17,056	| serial-s02-e07 |	Please do not allow my past records prevent me from coming into
EDL	00:33:17,056	00:33:17,568	| serial-s02-e07 |	The army
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:22,432	| serial-s02-e07 |	A week later about also showed the recruiter his DOD medical history form
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:25,504	| serial-s02-e07 |	But apparently it didn't include any mention of
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:31,904	| serial-s02-e07 |	His panic attack or his hospitalization or the doctor's note saying he needed clearance by a psychiatrist prior to
EDL	00:33:31,904	00:33:32,416	| serial-s02-e07 |	Reenlistment
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:35,232	| serial-s02-e07 |	Baoding mention this note to the Army recruiter either
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:37,024	| serial-s02-e07 |	He says he didn't even know about
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:40,864	| serial-s02-e07 |	So evidently that note was never seen by the army
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:44,192	| serial-s02-e07 |	It's not clear in fact if anyone ever took notice of it
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:45,472	| serial-s02-e07 |	Apart from the doctor who wrote it
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:48,288	| serial-s02-e07 |	Spring of 2008
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:49,568	| serial-s02-e07 |	But was accepted into the army
EDL	00:33:50,080	00:33:52,128	| serial-s02-e07 |	This time he hadn't told anyone in advance
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:54,176	| serial-s02-e07 |	He
EDL	00:33:54,176	00:33:55,968	| serial-s02-e07 |	Was being very evasive and I just
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:57,760	| serial-s02-e07 |	Was getting really annoyed
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:33:59,552	| serial-s02-e07 |	Alright what's going on
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:02,624	| serial-s02-e07 |	You're lying I can tell you're lying to me you're not telling what's going on
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:04,160	| serial-s02-e07 |	This went on for a couple months
EDL	00:34:04,672	00:34:06,976	| serial-s02-e07 |	And then all the sudden he shows up in his urine
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:12,352	| serial-s02-e07 |	I launched
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:18,752	| serial-s02-e07 |	Literally lunch myself I'm like literally grabbed his shoulders and I shaking at all you doing
EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:22,336	| serial-s02-e07 |	Did you sign the thing already is this just a done deal
EDL	00:34:22,336	00:34:23,616	| serial-s02-e07 |	And he's
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:30,016	| serial-s02-e07 |	Acting really quiet and kind of a smirk smile on his face like I knew you would react like this is why I didn't tell you
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:32,064	| serial-s02-e07 |	And I was just out of my mind
EDL	00:34:32,576	00:34:33,088	| serial-s02-e07 |	I just
EDL	00:34:33,856	00:34:34,368	| serial-s02-e07 |	Freaked out
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:37,184	| serial-s02-e07 |	And this is because again
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:39,744	| serial-s02-e07 |	You'd had this
EDL	00:34:39,744	00:34:44,864	| serial-s02-e07 |	Fears about his suitability before he went to the Coast Guard those fears were worn out
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:46,656	| serial-s02-e07 |	Yes and now he was doing it I guess
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:50,240	| serial-s02-e07 |	And you just knew this is not this is a really bad idea
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:53,312	| serial-s02-e07 |	This is just the worst idea ever
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:54,592	| serial-s02-e07 |	It was the army
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:04,832	| serial-s02-e07 |	Setting aside the question of whether it was a good idea for bow to join the Army
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:06,880	| serial-s02-e07 |	The Army have let bow in
