EDL	00:00:00,256	00:00:01,792	| serial-s01-day01 |	Hello serial listeners
EDL	00:00:01,792	00:00:03,072	| serial-s01-day01 |	Hurricane Ike year
EDL	00:00:03,072	00:00:05,376	| serial-s01-day01 |	This week I'm going to do something I haven't done before
EDL	00:00:05,888	00:00:09,216	| serial-s01-day01 |	Which is duck back into Adnan Syed case for a few days
EDL	00:00:09,216	00:00:11,776	| serial-s01-day01 |	Report on a court proceeding that's happening in Baltimore
EDL	00:00:12,288	00:00:14,592	| serial-s01-day01 |	If you have no idea what I'm talking about right now
EDL	00:00:14,592	00:00:15,360	| serial-s01-day01 |	Quick
EDL	00:00:15,360	00:00:19,456	| serial-s01-day01 |	Go listen to season 1 of Serial and then come back to me in roughly
EDL	00:00:19,456	00:00:19,968	| serial-s01-day01 |	10 hours
EDL	00:00:20,992	00:00:24,064	| serial-s01-day01 |	What's happening this week is not a new trial is a hearing
EDL	00:00:24,064	00:00:28,416	| serial-s01-day01 |	It's actually a continuation of anions petition for post-conviction relief
EDL	00:00:28,928	00:00:32,512	| serial-s01-day01 |	That's something you try only after you've exhausted your regular Appeals
EDL	00:00:32,512	00:00:33,792	| serial-s01-day01 |	The last ditch effort
EDL	00:00:34,560	00:00:36,352	| serial-s01-day01 |	He first file that petition
EDL	00:00:36,352	00:00:37,888	| serial-s01-day01 |	How in 2010 I think
EDL	00:00:38,400	00:00:40,448	| serial-s01-day01 |	Long before I got interested in this case
EDL	00:00:41,216	00:00:47,104	| serial-s01-day01 |	In fact I think the very first time I talked to a nun was right when the court had ruled against him had denied this petition
EDL	00:00:47,616	00:00:49,152	| serial-s01-day01 |	But he appealed it
EDL	00:00:49,152	00:00:50,688	| serial-s01-day01 |	And that's when it started to get interesting
EDL	00:00:51,456	00:00:56,832	| serial-s01-day01 |	In Broad Strokes Adnan was arguing that his defense attorney at the time of his trial was incompetent
EDL	00:00:57,344	00:00:59,648	| serial-s01-day01 |	But she made mistakes that were so bad
EDL	00:00:59,648	00:01:01,184	| serial-s01-day01 |	But he should get some form of relief
EDL	00:01:01,696	00:01:05,024	| serial-s01-day01 |	Maybe his conviction for killing Hae Min Lee should be overturned
EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:08,096	| serial-s01-day01 |	One of those mistakes in unclaimed
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:11,680	| serial-s01-day01 |	Was that his attorney never contacted a potential Alibi Witness
EDL	00:01:11,680	00:01:12,960	| serial-s01-day01 |	Asia McClain
EDL	00:01:12,960	00:01:13,728	| serial-s01-day01 |	Remember her
EDL	00:01:14,752	00:01:20,896	| serial-s01-day01 |	EBay after season 1 of Serial ended some new stuff came to light including some new evidence regarding Asia McClain
EDL	00:01:21,408	00:01:25,504	| serial-s01-day01 |	And about problems with the crucial cell tower testimony at Adnan trial
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:29,088	| serial-s01-day01 |	And over the past year the wheels of Justice rolled
EDL	00:01:29,600	00:01:32,160	| serial-s01-day01 |	Slowly slowly like they do
EDL	00:01:32,160	00:01:33,696	| serial-s01-day01 |	And finally this week
EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:36,512	| serial-s01-day01 |	The Baltimore City circuit court will hear this new evidence
EDL	00:01:36,512	00:01:38,304	| serial-s01-day01 |	We're here with some new Witnesses have to
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:41,120	| serial-s01-day01 |	To say about what happened or didn't happen
EDL	00:01:41,120	00:01:43,168	| serial-s01-day01 |	Adnan original trial
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:44,192	| serial-s01-day01 |	16 years ago
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:48,544	| serial-s01-day01 |	Right now it's Tuesday February 2nd 2016
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:50,080	| serial-s01-day01 |	The night before the hearing starts
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:56,992	| serial-s01-day01 |	Soon as I'm done recording this I'm getting in my car and driving to Baltimore and I'm going to show up at the courthouse at 8 a.m. tomorrow like they tow
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:01:57,760	| serial-s01-day01 |	Told me to
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:02:01,088	| serial-s01-day01 |	And I'm going to watch and listen and I'm going to tell you what happened
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:03,392	| serial-s01-day01 |	That week by week but day by day
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:06,976	| serial-s01-day01 |	I'm fascinated to see who exactly will testify
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:08,256	| serial-s01-day01 |	What they say
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:11,072	| serial-s01-day01 |	How old are you to have all these people back in one courtroom
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:12,352	| serial-s01-day01 |	All right
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:15,936	| serial-s01-day01 |	Now we're going to refresh your memory about the case of Adnan Syed
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:19,520	| serial-s01-day01 |	And then after that it'll magically have turned into tomorrow
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:22,080	| serial-s01-day01 |	And you'll hear me calling my producer Dana chivis
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:25,664	| serial-s01-day01 |	To tell her and you about day 1 of an Ontario
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:31,552	| serial-s01-day01 |	This is a Global Tel Link prepaid call from
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:33,600	| serial-s01-day01 |	Adnan Syed
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:37,952	| serial-s01-day01 |	An inmate at a Maryland Correctional Facility
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:40,000	| serial-s01-day01 |	I definitely
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:44,096	| serial-s01-day01 |	I just and if someone can look at this with a all man you know he must be lying
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:45,120	| serial-s01-day01 |	So coincidental
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:46,912	| serial-s01-day01 |	What did he tell you
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:51,520	| serial-s01-day01 |	She told me that she broke his heart during extremely wrong
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:54,592	| serial-s01-day01 |	Anyone who treated that way
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:03:00,480	| serial-s01-day01 |	Why would you admit to doing something that drastic if you hadn't done it there is no way that
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:06,880	| serial-s01-day01 |	She was at Best Buy at 2:36
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:09,440	| serial-s01-day01 |	You getting the Charming sociopath you're just not that lucky
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:15,584	| serial-s01-day01 |	Believable
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:24,032	| serial-s01-day01 |	But I think I think you might be that technicality
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:31,456	| serial-s01-day01 |	It is what it is
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:41,952	| serial-s01-day01 |	Hello

EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:52,095	| serial-s01-day01 |	So the first half of the day was
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:54,143	| serial-s01-day01 |	Establishing
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:58,239	| serial-s01-day01 |	Christina Gutierrez Adnan trial
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:00,287	| serial-s01-day01 |	Back in
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:01,567	| serial-s01-day01 |	In the original criminal trial
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:03,103	| serial-s01-day01 |	Had been
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:07,199	| serial-s01-day01 |	Declining in a bunch of ways to physically
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:09,503	| serial-s01-day01 |	Professionally financially
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:12,831	| serial-s01-day01 |	So they were like two attorneys
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:14,623	| serial-s01-day01 |	Who had worked with her
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:16,415	| serial-s01-day01 |	In the from the mid-to-late 90
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:18,975	| serial-s01-day01 |	And you know 99.
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:24,095	| serial-s01-day01 |	Who testified of like how bad it got
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:26,655	| serial-s01-day01 |	And it did seem like it was pretty bad from there
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:28,959	| serial-s01-day01 |	Like that she was
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:29,727	| serial-s01-day01 |	Physical pain
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:31,263	| serial-s01-day01 |	She was passing off
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:32,543	| serial-s01-day01 |	Cases to people
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:33,823	| serial-s01-day01 |	Cuz she was overwhelmed
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:36,383	| serial-s01-day01 |	In the courtroom scene
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:40,223	| serial-s01-day01 |	Definitely not
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:41,247	| serial-s01-day01 |	How she had been which is Kai
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:43,039	| serial-s01-day01 |	Legendary
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:44,575	| serial-s01-day01 |	You know sought-after
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:46,111	| serial-s01-day01 |	Very success
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:47,647	| serial-s01-day01 |	Defense attorney
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:49,439	| serial-s01-day01 |	And that she just was
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:50,207	| serial-s01-day01 |	Like her
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:50,975	| serial-s01-day01 |	Powers were
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:52,767	| serial-s01-day01 |	Definitely waiting
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:55,071	| serial-s01-day01 |	And sort of more to the point
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:55,583	| serial-s01-day01 |	Was
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:57,375	| serial-s01-day01 |	This question of
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:59,679	| serial-s01-day01 |	Why would she not have
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:00,191	| serial-s01-day01 |	I've called
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:04,031	| serial-s01-day01 |	Why would she not have looked into Asia map
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:04,543	| serial-s01-day01 |	Clean as a
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:06,335	| serial-s01-day01 |	Isabel Alibi Witness
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:07,615	| serial-s01-day01 |	Her clients right now
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:10,175	| serial-s01-day01 |	And is that
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:11,199	| serial-s01-day01 |	Is there any
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:13,759	| serial-s01-day01 |	Strategic reason why you would not
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:15,295	| serial-s01-day01 |	Check into
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:16,063	| serial-s01-day01 |	To this person
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:18,111	| serial-s01-day01 |	For her for her not
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:18,879	| serial-s01-day01 |	To call Asia map
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:20,159	| serial-s01-day01 |	Okay
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:22,463	| serial-s01-day01 |	And
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:26,047	| serial-s01-day01 |	And then you know the big witness of the day was
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:26,815	| serial-s01-day01 |	Asia McClain
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:30,911	| serial-s01-day01 |	Tell me about Asia like what did what did she say what was that like
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:33,471	| serial-s01-day01 |	It was
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:38,847	| serial-s01-day01 |	I have to say like it was kind of it was kind of intense in the courtroom when she was
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:40,127	| serial-s01-day01 |	When she was testifying
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:41,407	| serial-s01-day01 |	You know anyways
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:43,967	| serial-s01-day01 |	I don't even know totally how to type but likes
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:44,991	| serial-s01-day01 |	Cereal was a
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:49,343	| serial-s01-day01 |	Heart of her testimony so that's very strange
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:53,183	| serial-s01-day01 |	A little bit surreal like is this happening
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:55,999	| serial-s01-day01 |	Great Moments
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:02,655	| serial-s01-day01 |	When I the way that I first learned about the case right was just like
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:05,727	| serial-s01-day01 |	There's been this miscarriage of Justice like there was this
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:09,823	| serial-s01-day01 |	Key witness who is never heard from and she would have provided the perfect Alibi and
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:12,639	| serial-s01-day01 |	And she was never heard from and it's just like
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:13,663	| serial-s01-day01 |	You know this gross negligence
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:20,575	| serial-s01-day01 |	And so it all remember this like this is how we only have the whole thing was just like we just need to find this girl and find out what she
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:21,343	| serial-s01-day01 |	It will say
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:25,951	| serial-s01-day01 |	Yeah I was like she has a key to this thing over feeling like that
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:32,351	| serial-s01-day01 |	Yeah like this can't be that hard and then we do track her down and then it's it's not
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:34,911	| serial-s01-day01 |	That's simple right it's not at all. Just you
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:36,703	| serial-s01-day01 |	It's so much more complicated than her whatever
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:40,031	| serial-s01-day01 |	Just to see her so strident
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:40,543	| serial-s01-day01 |	In the courtroom
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:47,199	| serial-s01-day01 |	And she's pretty striking looking also she's too beautiful and yeah and she's kind of tall
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:49,247	| serial-s01-day01 |	Very high heels on
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:50,015	| serial-s01-day01 |	She looked
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:50,783	| serial-s01-day01 |	You know very put
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:51,295	| serial-s01-day01 |	Together in
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:53,343	| serial-s01-day01 |	Bright red lipstick and
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:54,623	| serial-s01-day01 |	And
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:57,439	| serial-s01-day01 |	And so it was just it was like wow
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:57,951	| serial-s01-day01 |	There she is
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:02,047	| serial-s01-day01 |	It was just like a lot of drama in the room when she was test
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:06,143	| serial-s01-day01 |	Testifying by the what was the thing she was saying that was
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:07,423	| serial-s01-day01 |	Called English drama
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:10,239	| serial-s01-day01 |	I think because there had been so much
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:11,007	| serial-s01-day01 |	Talk about
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:13,311	| serial-s01-day01 |	And about what she
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:15,615	| serial-s01-day01 |	Might have said would have said
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:21,247	| serial-s01-day01 |	You know parsing everything she said parsing her letters parsing her affidavit
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:23,551	| serial-s01-day01 |	Parsing the stuff that she said to me
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:27,391	| serial-s01-day01 |	And then to just hear her say these
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:29,695	| serial-s01-day01 |	Things that sounded
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:30,719	| serial-s01-day01 |	But very straight
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:31,231	| serial-s01-day01 |	Forward
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:33,791	| serial-s01-day01 |	Which were what
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:36,607	| serial-s01-day01 |	Which are kind of a resting like I don't know she was just saying like
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:37,375	| serial-s01-day01 |	Shih Tzu
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:39,423	| serial-s01-day01 |	She was very sure of herself
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:43,519	| serial-s01-day01 |	And very sure about what you remembered which is like you know this
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:46,335	| serial-s01-day01 |	Same thing we've been hearing right which is like I remember
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,359	| serial-s01-day01 |	Yunnan
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:52,735	| serial-s01-day01 |	I was in the library that was on public library after school on January 13th 1999
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,783	| serial-s01-day01 |	Starting in about
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:56,319	| serial-s01-day01 |	10:45 or so
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:59,135	| serial-s01-day01 |	I was waiting for hours for my boyfriend
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:00,671	| serial-s01-day01 |	Pick me up he was super late
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:02,207	| serial-s01-day01 |	I was super bored
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:04,511	| serial-s01-day01 |	As soon as school ended I remember I walked in
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:06,815	| serial-s01-day01 |	Send WeChat you know like this whole thing we chatted for 50
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:07,583	| serial-s01-day01 |	1820 minutes
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:14,495	| serial-s01-day01 |	Blink did it land like when she when she died
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:16,287	| serial-s01-day01 |	Glad she seemed very normal
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:19,103	| serial-s01-day01 |	You know and then she said these like very
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:22,943	| serial-s01-day01 |	Idealistic things that
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:24,991	| serial-s01-day01 |	I think that's probably also what
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:31,903	| serial-s01-day01 |	Met people what kind of emotional labor she said I'm trying to find it and they're just so simple the things that she said that she was
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:32,415	| serial-s01-day01 |	Sarah Blake
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:36,767	| serial-s01-day01 |	Anons attorney Justin Brown said why did you want to testify
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:40,095	| serial-s01-day01 |	And she just said I felt for justice to be served
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:42,399	| serial-s01-day01 |	We should put all the information on the
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:43,167	| serial-s01-day01 |	The table I just thought it was
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,447	| serial-s01-day01 |	Baidu
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:50,079	| serial-s01-day01 |	I was scribbling like crazy in my notebook I was like to serve the scribblings I was like just
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:56,991	| serial-s01-day01 |	Super focus on writing and so is everyone around it was exposed
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:58,527	| serial-s01-day01 |	In the room but
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:01,599	| serial-s01-day01 |	More I was trying to see what an honest face
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:07,999	| serial-s01-day01 |	Was doing could you see his face from where you're sitting in the back of his head or what
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:12,351	| serial-s01-day01 |	I was trying to see if he was even looking at that who is testifying and
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:16,191	| serial-s01-day01 |	You know I couldn't tell to me it seems a lot like you was just a
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:17,215	| serial-s01-day01 |	Looking down
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:21,311	| serial-s01-day01 |	Looking straight in front of them like at the hospital in front of him he was very very
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:22,079	| serial-s01-day01 |	Still
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,103	| serial-s01-day01 |	The entire
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:24,895	| serial-s01-day01 |	RC Willey
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:26,943	| serial-s01-day01 |	Yeah like barely moving like
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:27,711	| serial-s01-day01 |	She would shift
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:30,783	| serial-s01-day01 |	Occasionally but almost like he just became a stone
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:35,647	| serial-s01-day01 |	Deja today on the stands
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:39,487	| serial-s01-day01 |	Was it still was it did you find it was still is compelling what she was
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:43,583	| serial-s01-day01 |	Saying that simple things you had to say was that still has compelling to you now
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:44,095	| serial-s01-day01 |	Today
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:49,471	| serial-s01-day01 |	Hearing her explain her letters like things in her letters that seemed a little like what does that mean
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:53,055	| serial-s01-day01 |	And so she should have went through the letters
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:56,127	| serial-s01-day01 |	So she said
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:11:00,991	| serial-s01-day01 |	This is this is pretty detailed but there's a part of one of her letters where she says
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:05,087	| serial-s01-day01 |	If you need me like maybe I can help you account for some of your
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:06,623	| serial-s01-day01 |	Unaccounted for time
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:09,951	| serial-s01-day01 |	Between the hours of 2:15 and 8
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:10,463	| serial-s01-day01 |	APM
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:14,815	| serial-s01-day01 |	You know what she says I don't want to get here yet and that's also one of the things
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:15,327	| serial-s01-day01 |	In the original
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:16,863	| serial-s01-day01 |	Eviction hearing
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:18,143	| serial-s01-day01 |	That judge Walsh rules
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:20,703	| serial-s01-day01 |	Noted in his
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:23,775	| serial-s01-day01 |	Opinion where he's staying right just sounds like she's offering to lie
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:29,663	| serial-s01-day01 |	It sounds like she's already with my Saturday with a nod
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:32,991	| serial-s01-day01 |	This is a very big window of time so it what she saying like all the
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:35,295	| serial-s01-day01 |	And so
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:42,207	| serial-s01-day01 |	Anand attorney had her explain like what what do you what do you mean by that and she said oh well I had been to a nun's house
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:43,743	| serial-s01-day01 |	That day
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:47,839	| serial-s01-day01 |	To tell his parent to tell his family like
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:49,119	| serial-s01-day01 |	If you
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:50,399	| serial-s01-day01 |	You know what I knew
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:51,679	| serial-s01-day01 |	And
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:54,239	| serial-s01-day01 |	And they told
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:56,543	| serial-s01-day01 |	Me he was struggling to account
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:57,823	| serial-s01-day01 |	For that afternoon
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:12:02,431	| serial-s01-day01 |	Like he couldn't really remember what happened after school between school and going
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:07,295	| serial-s01-day01 |	The mosque at 8 around 8 so that was the. Of time so she was saying
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:09,855	| serial-s01-day01 |	I can account for this little slice of it
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:10,623	| serial-s01-day01 |	Of that.
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:11,903	| serial-s01-day01 |	If you need
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:14,719	| serial-s01-day01 |	It's just like she writes the letter in the first place
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:16,255	| serial-s01-day01 |	Yeah
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:19,327	| serial-s01-day01 |	Sprint
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:25,215	| serial-s01-day01 |	Christina we're not interested but it just felt like I got it okay to it all seems like very straightforward and clear
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:27,775	| serial-s01-day01 |	Haha she came out really well for the defense
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:32,127	| serial-s01-day01 |	And we have yet to see what the state's going to do to her tomorrow like that will continue
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:36,991	| serial-s01-day01 |	You tomorrow they started and you could see like they are going to go really hard on her eye
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:40,575	| serial-s01-day01 |	Oh really
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:45,439	| serial-s01-day01 |	Because of how they even started I mean the prosecutor is tough
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:46,207	| serial-s01-day01 |	He's tough
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:49,791	| serial-s01-day01 |	I'm not totally sure what they're what their plan is with Asia but I think
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:52,863	| serial-s01-day01 |	I think what they're going to try to do is
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:54,399	| serial-s01-day01 |	I don't either going to try
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:57,727	| serial-s01-day01 |	Credit her exactly but I think what they're going to say is
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:13:00,543	| serial-s01-day01 |	You think of yourself as a person with a really poor
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:01,311	| serial-s01-day01 |	Precise memory
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:06,943	| serial-s01-day01 |	But here appear some ways in which we're going to show you that your memory is
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:08,479	| serial-s01-day01 |	Restasis used
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:09,759	| serial-s01-day01 |	I think it is and so
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:13,855	| serial-s01-day01 |	I'm totally speculating here
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:17,695	| serial-s01-day01 |	But to show that if you had gotten on the stand
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:18,719	| serial-s01-day01 |	Back at Adnan
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:19,231	| serial-s01-day01 |	Trial
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:22,047	| serial-s01-day01 |	This testimony wouldn't have worked very well
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:23,071	| serial-s01-day01 |	It wouldn't have changed
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:24,351	| serial-s01-day01 |	Gett the trial
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:26,911	| serial-s01-day01 |	Because he has a permit
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:27,935	| serial-s01-day01 |	Here's all these ways I can
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:29,215	| serial-s01-day01 |	Kohl's in what
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:29,983	| serial-s01-day01 |	You're saying
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:30,495	| serial-s01-day01 |	In your test
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:33,311	| serial-s01-day01 |	Insurgents
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:34,847	| serial-s01-day01 |	Starting to poke holes
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:40,991	| serial-s01-day01 |	He was he wasn't starting to poke holes yet like he didn't get that far but you got late and then we stopped
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:41,759	| serial-s01-day01 |	But he was
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:44,319	| serial-s01-day01 |	Clearly trying to
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:47,135	| serial-s01-day01 |	He was he was sort of laying the foundation
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:47,903	| serial-s01-day01 |	For her
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:49,183	| serial-s01-day01 |	Do not remember stuff
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:56,095	| serial-s01-day01 |	Oh look at the questions that she's going to have to flounder a little bit and then yeah ultimately
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:14:02,495	| serial-s01-day01 |	Say something with either not satisfying or leg of Camilla X she had to say like I'm I don't remember I'm not sure
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:04,799	| serial-s01-day01 |	I don't remember I'm not clear I could
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:08,895	| serial-s01-day01 |	I could speculate if you want but I don't know I don't I'm not sure and it but and they didn't have anything
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:11,455	| serial-s01-day01 |	Student have they weren't directly related to
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:13,759	| serial-s01-day01 |	Statement it was like
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:15,039	| serial-s01-day01 |	Did you play sports
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:20,159	| serial-s01-day01 |	Yes I did I play volleyball and basketball woke did you have basketball practice that day
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:22,463	| serial-s01-day01 |	Think so I don't
