EDL	00:01:23,712	00:01:27,040	| serial-s01-e02 |	The motive the state supplied the basis for the whole thing
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:29,600	| serial-s01-e02 |	Was it after he broke up with a nun
EDL	00:01:29,600	00:01:30,880	| serial-s01-e02 |	She couldn't accept it
EDL	00:01:30,880	00:01:33,696	| serial-s01-e02 |	He was so wounded by her and so Furious
EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:34,720	| serial-s01-e02 |	That he decided to kill her
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:39,584	| serial-s01-e02 |	Prosecutor Kevin urick told the jury in his opening statement
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:41,376	| serial-s01-e02 |	He became enraged
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:43,936	| serial-s01-e02 |	He felt betrayed that his honor has been besmirched
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:45,472	| serial-s01-e02 |	I became very angry
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:47,264	| serial-s01-e02 |	And he set out to kill Hae Min Lee
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:51,616	| serial-s01-e02 |	Or this is from closing quote it was humiliating what she did to him

EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:55,968	| serial-s01-e02 |	This is not a crime about love
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:57,248	| serial-s01-e02 |	This is a crime about Pride
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:02,368	| serial-s01-e02 |	Is that what their relationship and breakup were really like
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:09,280	| serial-s01-e02 |	Was he so hurt that he decided to kill her that's what I'm trying to find out in today's episode by talking to lots of people
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:15,680	| serial-s01-e02 |	Close knit group known each other since elementary
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:18,240	| serial-s01-e02 |	High school and even though they went to a big house
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:19,264	| serial-s01-e02 |	High School
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:24,128	| serial-s01-e02 |	And their friends were come together in a magnet program of about 30 kids
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:30,272	| serial-s01-e02 |	High School within the school and they all took classes together and hang out together and they dated each other so we knew each other well
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:37,440	| serial-s01-e02 |	Any other information I have to go on our Hayes own words about their relationship because I have a copy of her diary

EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:49,728	| serial-s01-e02 |	What's remarkable about the diary and what makes it so helpful is that it's essentially a Chronicle of the oven on era of his life
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:54,592	| serial-s01-e02 |	The first entry is April 1st 1998 when they started going out

EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:29,408	| serial-s01-e02 |	On April 27th she wrote a long entry in her diary about prom night
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:34,016	| serial-s01-e02 |	Her diary by the way I'm not exactly sure what I expected her diary to be like
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:36,320	| serial-s01-e02 |	It's such a teenage girl's diary
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:39,136	| serial-s01-e02 |	She jumps from her boyfriend to driver's ed

EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:25,983	| serial-s01-e02 |	But it's okay

EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:59,263	| serial-s01-e02 |	Created much more of a lake
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:02,079	| serial-s01-e02 |	Her saying I'm going to be at your house but really I'm going out with him
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:03,615	| serial-s01-e02 |	Kind of thing

EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:08,223	| serial-s01-e02 |	Or others
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:10,527	| serial-s01-e02 |	Primarily mine
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:14,111	| serial-s01-e02 |	Just a lot of that sort of secrecy around
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:16,159	| serial-s01-e02 |	We had a lot of
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:16,927	| serial-s01-e02 |	I guess
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:18,463	| serial-s01-e02 |	A lot of real similar
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:21,279	| serial-s01-e02 |	Similar type of situations with our families
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:26,399	| serial-s01-e02 |	Since he and I both had immigrant parents they understood the expectations
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:27,423	| serial-s01-e02 |	And the constraints
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:31,007	| serial-s01-e02 |	Go to college take care of your younger brother
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:32,799	| serial-s01-e02 |	And Ferdinand no girls
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:37,919	| serial-s01-e02 |	If a female friend run his car for instance you have to make sure not to leave any longhairs behind
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:40,479	| serial-s01-e02 |	Where's a girl gave Adnan a ride home
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:42,271	| serial-s01-e02 |	You have to drop him off down the block
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:44,575	| serial-s01-e02 |	So his parents wouldn't see who is at the wheel
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:46,111	| serial-s01-e02 |	You know it was really easy
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:47,903	| serial-s01-e02 |	To date someone
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:51,999	| serial-s01-e02 |	That kind of living in the same parameters that I did with regards to you though
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:53,535	| serial-s01-e02 |	Speed in a vacuum
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:55,839	| serial-s01-e02 |	Location of me coming to her house for dinner with her family
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:57,887	| serial-s01-e02 |	You know she understood that
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:05:59,423	| serial-s01-e02 |	You know that
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:01,215	| serial-s01-e02 |	Call the house
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:04,031	| serial-s01-e02 |	My mother and father I would get in trouble
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:04,799	| serial-s01-e02 |	Vice versa
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:07,359	| serial-s01-e02 |	You know so we would have to come and set up our
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:11,199	| serial-s01-e02 |	Well Repair in your sleep
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:13,759	| serial-s01-e02 |	They had a whole system for this
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:16,831	| serial-s01-e02 |	Clear
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:19,391	| serial-s01-e02 |	Remember it's 1998 so not many cell phones around
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:22,463	| serial-s01-e02 |	Then that person would call someone 800 service
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:28,607	| serial-s01-e02 |	What's the weather or the time and the other one would call in so that the phone wouldn't actually rang it would come in through call waiting
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:30,911	| serial-s01-e02 |	And the dosing parents would never be the wiser
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:40,383	| serial-s01-e02 |	At the trial the state tried to paint a picture of an odd as possessive of hay
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:41,663	| serial-s01-e02 |	Controlling
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:47,807	| serial-s01-e02 |	When I spoke to his closest friends about that a couple of them did say that he over involved
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:48,831	| serial-s01-e02 |	Somehow
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:51,135	| serial-s01-e02 |	But I couldn't come up with many examples
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:58,303	| serial-s01-e02 |	Do people remember the time when it done showed up uninvited to a girls trip to an amusement park Aisha Pittman was one of them
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:01,887	| serial-s01-e02 |	She remembers nothing positive about their relationship anymore
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:05,727	| serial-s01-e02 |	Go by your own admission she doesn't know whether her memories are colored by what came later
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:09,823	| serial-s01-e02 |	I think it was probably mostly normal but things that
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:13,151	| serial-s01-e02 |	He kind of just always generally annoyed me because
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:13,919	| serial-s01-e02 |	Just
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:14,687	| serial-s01-e02 |	The constant
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:15,455	| serial-s01-e02 |	Paging
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:16,735	| serial-s01-e02 |	If you was out
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:20,063	| serial-s01-e02 |	He's like what I just wanted to know where you were in
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:21,087	| serial-s01-e02 |	I told you
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:22,367	| serial-s01-e02 |	Clear Eyes going to be
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:25,951	| serial-s01-e02 |	She was at my house and we were having a girl's night he

EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:52,319	| serial-s01-e02 |	Impromptu visits I was talking about
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:54,623	| serial-s01-e02 |	On July 16th she writes
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:57,183	| serial-s01-e02 |	Carrot cake

EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:08,191	| serial-s01-e02 |	Replying to hang with Keisha
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:12,287	| serial-s01-e02 |	The time when he was nasty to her because she didn't respond to his messages
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:15,871	| serial-s01-e02 |	Mostly these incidents seem to be
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:16,639	| serial-s01-e02 |	Frittata
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:19,711	| serial-s01-e02 |	Attitude is not helping
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:20,223	| serial-s01-e02 |	Wright's engine
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:24,831	| serial-s01-e02 |	He hasn't called me since 12:30 this afternoon and it's definitely pushing me to the edge

EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:30,463	| serial-s01-e02 |	His friends say she had a strong personality
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:31,487	| serial-s01-e02 |	Strong opinions
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:32,255	| serial-s01-e02 |	She's no pushover
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:34,303	| serial-s01-e02 |	She's pissing on she let him know
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:38,911	| serial-s01-e02 |	But by far the majority of her diary entries are about how much she likes
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:39,423	| serial-s01-e02 |	And loves him
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:42,239	| serial-s01-e02 |	I stopped counting there was so many wonderful things

EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:07,327	| serial-s01-e02 |	Anything that stands out
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:10,399	| serial-s01-e02 |	Around all that summer before senior year
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:12,191	| serial-s01-e02 |	After work and drive around

EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:28,319	| serial-s01-e02 |	A couple of times he called it off
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:29,855	| serial-s01-e02 |	But then would ask for a
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:30,367	| serial-s01-e02 |	Saturday

EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:45,471	| serial-s01-e02 |	Is it good Muslim he was not supposed to be dating
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:49,567	| serial-s01-e02 |	Until he was sacrificing his religion and lying to his family
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:51,103	| serial-s01-e02 |	All just so he could be with her
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,639	| serial-s01-e02 |	Twisted up inside
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:56,991	| serial-s01-e02 |	And his diary seems to be where they found some evidence for that
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:59,039	| serial-s01-e02 |	In fact they had a friend of his
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:00,063	| serial-s01-e02 |	Debbie Warren
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:01,855	| serial-s01-e02 |	Read excerpts from it on the witness stand

EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:06,207	| serial-s01-e02 |	Shred-it trial
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:07,231	| serial-s01-e02 |	Dated May 15th
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:10,047	| serial-s01-e02 |	It's just all the things that stand in the middle
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:12,351	| serial-s01-e02 |	His religion and Muslim Customs are the main thing
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:15,423	| serial-s01-e02 |	It hurts me to know that I'm against his religion
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:17,215	| serial-s01-e02 |	He called me a double few times
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:18,751	| serial-s01-e02 |	I know I was only joking
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:19,519	| serial-s01-e02 |	Somewhat true
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:26,943	| serial-s01-e02 |	And then there's this which wasn't right at trial but is from July when Adnan went to an Islamic conference in Texas with
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:27,711	| serial-s01-e02 |	What is Dad
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:29,503	| serial-s01-e02 |	This is the most distressed he gets on the
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:31,551	| serial-s01-e02 |	When I read it I thought
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:33,855	| serial-s01-e02 |	Does not look so good for Adnan
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:38,207	| serial-s01-e02 |	I keep crying over the phone because I miss him so much
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:38,719	| serial-s01-e02 |	She writes
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:41,535	| serial-s01-e02 |	He told me that his religion means life to him
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:44,095	| serial-s01-e02 |	He tried to remain a faithful Muslim all his life
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:46,399	| serial-s01-e02 |	He fell in love with me which is a great sin
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:49,471	| serial-s01-e02 |	But you told me there is no way he'll ever leave me
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:51,007	| serial-s01-e02 |	If you can't imagine a life without me
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:54,847	| serial-s01-e02 |	Have to choose between me and his religion
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:57,151	| serial-s01-e02 |	I love him so much
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:59,455	| serial-s01-e02 |	And when it comes to choosing I'm going to let him go his way
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:02,271	| serial-s01-e02 |	I hate the fact that I'm the cause of his sin
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:07,391	| serial-s01-e02 |	He said that I shouldn't feel like I'm pulling him away from his religion but hello that's exactly what I'm doing
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:11,487	| serial-s01-e02 |	Anytime someone's writing stuff down like
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:15,327	| serial-s01-e02 |	CNN devil and religion means life in reference to their secret relationship
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:16,607	| serial-s01-e02 |	That's not good
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:19,935	| serial-s01-e02 |	Ask the muscle in question about it
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:21,727	| serial-s01-e02 |	It all sounds so much smaller
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:23,775	| serial-s01-e02 |	I'm going to put it as a joke
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:29,663	| serial-s01-e02 |	Why can't you I'm going to hell because I'm dating you were something but I never mentioned in type of way
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:33,759	| serial-s01-e02 |	Anon claims he just wasn't that religious
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:37,343	| serial-s01-e02 |	I was going to clubs and having sex with girls and smoking weed
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:39,647	| serial-s01-e02 |	The time he was 14 or 15
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:41,439	| serial-s01-e02 |	Culturally yes I'm a
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:43,487	| serial-s01-e02 |	But the rest he says not so much
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:45,791	| serial-s01-e02 |	So passages like this
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:48,095	| serial-s01-e02 |	He says he doesn't really recognize himself in them
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:48,863	| serial-s01-e02 |	I never
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:51,167	| serial-s01-e02 |	I never really felt as if you know
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:54,239	| serial-s01-e02 |	Now you know hate is tearing me away from my lips
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:56,543	| serial-s01-e02 |	I never
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:01,919	| serial-s01-e02 |	Does she kind of has
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:04,223	| serial-s01-e02 |	Just like the gravity
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:06,271	| serial-s01-e02 |	And the magnitude with which she took these things
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:09,599	| serial-s01-e02 |	I didn't really feel that way about these
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:14,719	| serial-s01-e02 |	It seems convenient
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:22,143	| serial-s01-e02 |	My behavior didn't change what's up
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:33,663	| serial-s01-e02 |	You know I just continue with the same type of behavior different people

EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:42,111	| serial-s01-e02 |	He says he wasn't all that bothered by that
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:44,415	| serial-s01-e02 |	He was a pretty good kid
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:47,743	| serial-s01-e02 |	Is doing well in school job he was volunteering at the mosque
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:49,023	| serial-s01-e02 |	Why should we have some fun
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:54,655	| serial-s01-e02 |	In the pantheon of ways a teenager could have been disrespectful or deceitful to his parents
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:56,191	| serial-s01-e02 |	He thought this rated pretty low
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:59,007	| serial-s01-e02 |	My name is shamim Rahman
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:01,311	| serial-s01-e02 |	And I'm the mother of Adnan Syed

EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:43,071	| serial-s01-e02 |	Are you sure members of non-parents wanting to find hey so they could talk to her
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:44,863	| serial-s01-e02 |	Which of course he wanted nothing to do with
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:47,423	| serial-s01-e02 |	So that we could leave the dance and not
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:48,703	| serial-s01-e02 |	Be harassed by
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:53,055	| serial-s01-e02 |	His parents like she walked out holding hands with my friend Sean to get away from it and she
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:53,567	| serial-s01-e02 |	You just felt like that

EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:58,687	| serial-s01-e02 |	Wanting to have
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:02,271	| serial-s01-e02 |	I think that for her was a I absolutely do
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:04,831	| serial-s01-e02 |	But this person at all because
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:08,159	| serial-s01-e02 |	This is what happens
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:12,255	| serial-s01-e02 |	On November 3rd he wrote in her diary
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:13,791	| serial-s01-e02 |	Who would have thought we would end like
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:17,375	| serial-s01-e02 |	Who would have imagined the amount of pain that comes with a broken heart
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:20,191	| serial-s01-e02 |	I know I'm doing the right thing
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:24,031	| serial-s01-e02 |	Call me selfish but this pain is way less than what it would be if we stayed together
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:29,919	| serial-s01-e02 |	Apparently they reunited because exactly a month later on December 3rd
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:31,967	| serial-s01-e02 |	She's full of love for an on-again
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:33,759	| serial-s01-e02 |	This feels so real
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:35,807	| serial-s01-e02 |	So loving and ever so amazing
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:39,135	| serial-s01-e02 |	I can't be any happier but yet I keep on being happier
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:43,487	| serial-s01-e02 |	Then just three days later there's this on December 6th
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:46,303	| serial-s01-e02 |	But what's the matter with me
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:48,351	| serial-s01-e02 |	Everytime I close my eyes I see my baby
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:50,911	| serial-s01-e02 |	But I keep on thinking about someone else
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:55,519	| serial-s01-e02 |	He's got a crush on Don
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:56,543	| serial-s01-e02 |	An older guy
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:57,311	| serial-s01-e02 |	Is 20
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:19:59,103	| serial-s01-e02 |	She works with at LensCrafters
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:00,383	| serial-s01-e02 |	The Owings Mills Mall
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:05,503	| serial-s01-e02 |	John has blue eyes and blond hair and a Camaro and she really really likes him
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:10,623	| serial-s01-e02 |	For the next couple of weeks she's racked with guilt and confusion over what to do
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:15,743	| serial-s01-e02 |	At one point she writes anions name in giant block letters made out of tiny little Adnan
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:20,863	| serial-s01-e02 |	And underneath that does the same thing with John in giant letters made up of tiny dots
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:25,215	| serial-s01-e02 |	127 *
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:27,007	| serial-s01-e02 |	127 Dons
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:30,847	| serial-s01-e02 |	Is that clear from the diary when she finally tells Adnan
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:31,615	| serial-s01-e02 |	It's over over
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:33,919	| serial-s01-e02 |	But certainly by Christmas they were split
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:38,783	| serial-s01-e02 |	On New Year's Day has her first official date with Don and they start going out
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:40,319	| serial-s01-e02 |	Hey is Head Over Heels
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:42,623	| serial-s01-e02 |	Are you sure remembers meeting him
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:43,647	| serial-s01-e02 |	On a double date
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:46,463	| serial-s01-e02 |	Friday's restaurant and then to see the movie Shakespeare in Love
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:48,255	| serial-s01-e02 |	What's the most awkward double date
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:51,839	| serial-s01-e02 |	Because he was older
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:55,167	| serial-s01-e02 |	I forget how old he was but he was significantly older than
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:57,727	| serial-s01-e02 |	And my boyfriend was
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:20:59,775	| serial-s01-e02 |	2 years younger
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:00,799	| serial-s01-e02 |	Fetishist
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:02,079	| serial-s01-e02 |	Horrible
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:04,639	| serial-s01-e02 |	With one man and one boy
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:05,919	| serial-s01-e02 |	Yeah
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:15,391	| serial-s01-e02 |	This is where the real questions begin
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:18,208	| serial-s01-e02 |	Important questions about Adnan
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:22,560	| serial-s01-e02 |	About how he responded to this break up into the fact of his new boyfriend
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:25,888	| serial-s01-e02 |	Because the whole premise of the state's case against Adnan
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:29,984	| serial-s01-e02 |	Is Eddie felt betrayed and humiliated and angry and that's why he killed her
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:33,056	| serial-s01-e02 |	This idea came from Jay their main Witness
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:35,360	| serial-s01-e02 |	It was Jane who supplied the motive to please
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:46,368	| serial-s01-e02 |	What did he tell you he told me that she broke his heart during extremely wrong
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:48,160	| serial-s01-e02 |	Granny want to treat him that way
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:55,328	| serial-s01-e02 |	Believe how she stays in looking face to face and told him she didn't love on me
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:56,864	| serial-s01-e02 |	Could be that heartless
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:00,448	| serial-s01-e02 |	He told me he said
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:03,520	| serial-s01-e02 |	Almost joking I think I'm going to kill him yeah
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:08,896	| serial-s01-e02 |	He didn't know how he was going
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:11,200	| serial-s01-e02 |	Because she approached
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:15,808	| serial-s01-e02 |	But nearly everyone I spoke with his friends and teachers
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:23,744	| serial-s01-e02 |	Announcer in Mac Francis boyfriend
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:26,816	| serial-s01-e02 |	But he grumbled about it in a typical guy weigh nothing strange
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:30,656	| serial-s01-e02 |	Everyone I talked to said some version of this
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:32,960	| serial-s01-e02 |	But he wasn't rage-filled or vindictive
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:34,496	| serial-s01-e02 |	He was just sad
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:38,336	| serial-s01-e02 |	It really did seem like run-of-the-mill mundane teenage

EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:54,720	| serial-s01-e02 |	If he killed her
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:57,280	| serial-s01-e02 |	Doesn't register with me
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:00,608	| serial-s01-e02 |	I don't remember getting that vibe from

EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:03,680	| serial-s01-e02 |	He was just another kid
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:05,472	| serial-s01-e02 |	Whose heart was broken
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:08,544	| serial-s01-e02 |	And

EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:13,664	| serial-s01-e02 |	Some kind of
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:16,992	| serial-s01-e02 |	Horrific crime based on that kind of saying I would have stopped teaching

EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:30,880	| serial-s01-e02 |	Sound very
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:32,672	| serial-s01-e02 |	Kind of
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:37,024	| serial-s01-e02 |	Tom and mutual and like nobody got upset
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:37,792	| serial-s01-e02 |	But
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:39,584	| serial-s01-e02 |	I mean is that true or was there like
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:43,936	| serial-s01-e02 |	Crying and the usual teenage angst
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:47,520	| serial-s01-e02 |	15 years later I mean
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:51,360	| serial-s01-e02 |	She was upset I was upset you know what times I was very sad
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:57,760	| serial-s01-e02 |	Maybe I was trying to be like a little stubborn about it
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:25:59,040	| serial-s01-e02 |	But on the other hand
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:03,136	| serial-s01-e02 |	It was everything where I was like you know screaming and yelling at her why you leaving me or
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:04,928	| serial-s01-e02 |	So
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:09,024	| serial-s01-e02 |	Spell that that that that that that that was never my behavior
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:10,048	| serial-s01-e02 |	You know at all
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:15,936	| serial-s01-e02 |	It is true that no one at the time described as acting obsessed or menacing and anyway
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:16,960	| serial-s01-e02 |	Venetia
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:21,568	| serial-s01-e02 |	Never expresses any concerns about Adnan post-breakup Behavior
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:26,176	| serial-s01-e02 |	She writes about a time just before Christmas so after they broken up
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:27,968	| serial-s01-e02 |	When she gets into a little car accident
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:30,016	| serial-s01-e02 |	And calls up at 9 to come get her from work
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:33,344	| serial-s01-e02 |	Bust on her new crush and Adnan
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:37,184	| serial-s01-e02 |	Look at the car together and decide it's unsafe to drive so Adnan takes her home
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:39,232	| serial-s01-e02 |	Apparently was all very cordial
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:40,512	| serial-s01-e02 |	Even Don said so
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:43,584	| serial-s01-e02 |	You wouldn't talk to me for the story but he testified at the
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:44,096	| serial-s01-e02 |	Trial
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:50,240	| serial-s01-e02 |	At this point I'm going to say flat out that I don't buy the motive for this murder
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:52,032	| serial-s01-e02 |	At least I have a state explain.
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:53,056	| serial-s01-e02 |	I just don't see it
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:56,896	| serial-s01-e02 |	That one person says he was acting strangely after they broke up
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:27:00,480	| serial-s01-e02 |	By all accounts we're still friends
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:04,832	| serial-s01-e02 |	He was interested in other girls he was working at his job he was headed to college
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:07,648	| serial-s01-e02 |	About two weeks after his arrest he gets an orientation packet
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:08,672	| serial-s01-e02 |	University of Maryland
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:16,352	| serial-s01-e02 |	I don't think he was some empty shell of a kid who betrayed his family and his religion it was now left with nothing and conjured up a murderer
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:17,632	| serial-s01-e02 |	Age for girl who broke his heart
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:19,680	| serial-s01-e02 |	I simply don't buy it
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:24,288	| serial-s01-e02 |	And the reason I don't buy it is because no one who knew him then or now
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:25,312	| serial-s01-e02 |	Says that's how it was
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:28,384	| serial-s01-e02 |	I want to be clear though
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:30,176	| serial-s01-e02 |	But that doesn't mean he didn't do it
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:34,784	| serial-s01-e02 |	It just means that so far I think the state story about why he killed her doesn't hold up
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:38,112	| serial-s01-e02 |	Maybe it was more of a spur-of-the-moment thing
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:42,976	| serial-s01-e02 |	Maybe despite the other girls he was running after he was privately stewing about hey
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:46,560	| serial-s01-e02 |	After all she was apparently still flirting with them after they broke up
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:48,352	| serial-s01-e02 |	Stop aging him with loving messages
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:50,912	| serial-s01-e02 |	Spider-Man expensive jacket that Christmas
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:52,960	| serial-s01-e02 |	Maybe sorry start a chance with her
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:55,264	| serial-s01-e02 |	What their friend Debbie told me
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:57,312	| serial-s01-e02 |	Maybe once Don came on the scene he thought
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:58,848	| serial-s01-e02 |	That's a slap in the face
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:01,408	| serial-s01-e02 |	How dare you continue to leave me on like this
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:10,368	| serial-s01-e02 |	The night before he disappeared on call her from a cell phone three times
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:16,256	| serial-s01-e02 |	The first two calls at 11:27 p.m. and 12:01 a.m. for only 2 seconds each
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:19,072	| serial-s01-e02 |	The third call at 12:35 a.m.
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:21,376	| serial-s01-e02 |	Lasted a minute and 24 seconds
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:26,240	| serial-s01-e02 |	Announce that he was probably calling to give his new cell phone number he just got in the phone the day before
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:30,592	| serial-s01-e02 |	Kennedy in the top left corner of her diary she'd written down the number
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:37,760	| serial-s01-e02 |	According to Downs testimony she been at his house that night which is probably why Adnan first two calls ended so fast probably
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:38,272	| serial-s01-e02 |	I wasn't home yet
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:42,624	| serial-s01-e02 |	Her very last diary entry January 12th is brief
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:44,928	| serial-s01-e02 |	I love you.
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:46,720	| serial-s01-e02 |	I think I found my soulmate
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:48,000	| serial-s01-e02 |	I love you so much
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:50,560	| serial-s01-e02 |	I fell in love with you the moment I open my eyes
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:52,864	| serial-s01-e02 |	To see you in the break room for the first time
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:05,664	| serial-s01-e02 |	There is one detail about the missing but I need to tell you about
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:07,456	| serial-s01-e02 |	I detailed it doesn't look good for Adnan
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:13,344	| serial-s01-e02 |	And that detail has to do with whether or non tried to get in Hayes car right after school
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:15,648	| serial-s01-e02 |	Because that is what the state would allege
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:19,232	| serial-s01-e02 |	Button on fabricated a reason to get in your car that afternoon
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:20,000	| serial-s01-e02 |	So you could kill her
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:23,584	| serial-s01-e02 |	Jay had told police that was a nun's plan
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:25,888	| serial-s01-e02 |	Did she tell you how he's going to do it that day
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:27,424	| serial-s01-e02 |	No but
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:29,728	| serial-s01-e02 |	He tells me that
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:32,288	| serial-s01-e02 |	He's going to do it in her car
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:35,360	| serial-s01-e02 |	He said to me that
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:37,152	| serial-s01-e02 |	He was going to
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:40,224	| serial-s01-e02 |	Colors car was broken down
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:42,016	| serial-s01-e02 |	And I asked her for a ride
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:46,368	| serial-s01-e02 |	So what do we know about the end of that day
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:47,136	| serial-s01-e02 |	Wednesday

EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:22,208	| serial-s01-e02 |	And he would come by every day and get the same thing

EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:28,608	| serial-s01-e02 |	She drove up in front of the gym where the concession stand was
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:29,632	| serial-s01-e02 |	Electric car running
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:32,960	| serial-s01-e02 |	So she came around the circle park the car right there

EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:36,800	| serial-s01-e02 |	And ran in to get something to drink
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:37,568	| serial-s01-e02 |	And to tell me
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:39,104	| serial-s01-e02 |	None of us not to leave him
EDL	00:30:39,104	00:30:41,152	| serial-s01-e02 |	The bus was for the boys wrestling team
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:44,480	| serial-s01-e02 |	Haywood manager and had a match later that afternoon that he was supposed to go to
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:46,016	| serial-s01-e02 |	And
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:46,784	| serial-s01-e02 |	You didn't see ref
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:47,296	| serial-s01-e02 |	After that
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:52,160	| serial-s01-e02 |	It's not anywhere near her car
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:53,696	| serial-s01-e02 |	No
EDL	00:30:54,464	00:30:55,488	| serial-s01-e02 |	I didn't see him there to come
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:31:00,864	| serial-s01-e02 |	Okay so no one actually testified at trial that they saw Hannah Donnelly school together
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:03,680	| serial-s01-e02 |	Aside from
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:07,008	| serial-s01-e02 |	Says they spotted a nun in her car at anytime that afternoon
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:11,616	| serial-s01-e02 |	Adnan has no recollection of having a stay for a ride anywhere
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:13,152	| serial-s01-e02 |	We talked about it many times
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:16,224	| serial-s01-e02 |	Here's what he said the very first time I asked him
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:34,144	| serial-s01-e02 |	McDonald's
EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:38,752	| serial-s01-e02 |	The trouble for Adnan
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:41,312	| serial-s01-e02 |	Is it a couple of their friends say he did ask
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:42,336	| serial-s01-e02 |	4 ride
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:43,872	| serial-s01-e02 |	What are the different Crystal
EDL	00:31:44,640	00:31:46,688	| serial-s01-e02 |	If I remember correctly
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:48,480	| serial-s01-e02 |	I think Adnan and I worked
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:49,760	| serial-s01-e02 |	Class
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:50,784	| serial-s01-e02 |	Together
EDL	00:31:53,600	00:31:54,112	| serial-s01-e02 |	And
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:56,416	| serial-s01-e02 |	They pass each other in
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:57,184	| serial-s01-e02 |	In the hallway
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:31:57,696	| serial-s01-e02 |	And I was with him
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:32:01,280	| serial-s01-e02 |	I remember somebody saying or him things
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:01,792	| serial-s01-e02 |	Something about
EDL	00:32:03,072	00:32:03,584	| serial-s01-e02 |	Can you give me a ride after
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:04,864	| serial-s01-e02 |	After school
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:06,912	| serial-s01-e02 |	Different Becky told police
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:08,192	| serial-s01-e02 |	She heard something about a ride as well
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:12,288	| serial-s01-e02 |	I do remember that there was talk about it I remember I felt like
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:14,336	| serial-s01-e02 |	He asked her to give him a
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:16,128	| serial-s01-e02 |	Give him a ride somewhere
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:17,152	| serial-s01-e02 |	Okay
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:19,456	| serial-s01-e02 |	Can I just read to you what
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:24,320	| serial-s01-e02 |	The police notes a April 9th 99 the interview Geo
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:27,392	| serial-s01-e02 |	Sometime earlier that day
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:30,464	| serial-s01-e02 |	Apparently he asked her to take him possibly to get
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:31,232	| serial-s01-e02 |	Car
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:31,744	| serial-s01-e02 |	Before lunch
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:33,792	| serial-s01-e02 |	Because it was in the shop
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:35,584	| serial-s01-e02 |	Heard about it at lunch
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:38,656	| serial-s01-e02 |	I think you heard about it at lunch
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:39,168	| serial-s01-e02 |	Right
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:41,216	| serial-s01-e02 |	He said she could
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:42,752	| serial-s01-e02 |	There would be no problem
EDL	00:32:42,752	00:32:47,104	| serial-s01-e02 |	At end of school I saw them she said oh no I can't take you I something else
EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:47,872	| serial-s01-e02 |	To do
EDL	00:32:47,872	00:32:48,896	| serial-s01-e02 |	She didn't say what else
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:53,248	| serial-s01-e02 |	Approximately 220 so that happened at approximately 2:20
EDL	00:32:53,248	00:32:55,552	| serial-s01-e02 |	He said okay I'll just ask someone else
EDL	00:32:55,552	00:32:56,576	| serial-s01-e02 |	He told her goodbye
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:59,392	| serial-s01-e02 |	Energy says did not see her after that
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:02,720	| serial-s01-e02 |	Yeah that sounds right
EDL	00:33:04,768	00:33:06,304	| serial-s01-e02 |	Kind of all comes back a little bit
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:09,888	| serial-s01-e02 |	Christian Becky both remembered
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:12,448	| serial-s01-e02 |	I'll bet he's our collection maybe Works in a nun's favor
EDL	00:33:12,960	00:33:14,752	| serial-s01-e02 |	But they turned him down for a ride he's
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:15,264	| serial-s01-e02 |	Cool with that
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:17,056	| serial-s01-e02 |	The question is still there
EDL	00:33:17,824	00:33:19,872	| serial-s01-e02 |	Was he trying to get in her car
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:21,664	| serial-s01-e02 |	Did she ask for a ride
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:22,176	| serial-s01-e02 |	Json
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:26,272	| serial-s01-e02 |	Evidence in support of a statement
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:28,064	| serial-s01-e02 |	Does even come from Crystal
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:30,368	| serial-s01-e02 |	Comes directly from
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:33,952	| serial-s01-e02 |	Because he himself told the cops the same thing that day
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:38,560	| serial-s01-e02 |	Who sang the state record police officer Scott Adcock to the stand
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:42,144	| serial-s01-e02 |	Around 6:30 p.m. after heading on missing
EDL	00:33:42,144	00:33:45,216	| serial-s01-e02 |	A Baltimore County police officer named Scott Adcock
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:46,496	| serial-s01-e02 |	Call Dad on cell phone
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:49,824	| serial-s01-e02 |	His family was worried that she hadn't turned up her cousin School
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:53,664	| serial-s01-e02 |	And the officer was calling around to some of her friends to see if they knew where she was
EDL	00:33:54,176	00:33:58,272	| serial-s01-e02 |	Here's Adcock testifying at trial
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:34:00,832	| serial-s01-e02 |	And he advised me that
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:02,624	| serial-s01-e02 |	He did see the victim in school that day
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:04,160	| serial-s01-e02 |	And that dumb
EDL	00:34:04,672	00:34:05,952	| serial-s01-e02 |	He was supposed to get a ride home
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:08,000	| serial-s01-e02 |	From the victim but he
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:09,280	| serial-s01-e02 |	Got detained at school when
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:11,584	| serial-s01-e02 |	He just got tired of waiting and left
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:19,008	| serial-s01-e02 |	Been a little more than two weeks after the call with officer Adcock on February 1st
EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:21,312	| serial-s01-e02 |	But it's time to search for Jesus ramped-up
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:23,104	| serial-s01-e02 |	A different detective calls
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:25,408	| serial-s01-e02 |	Astronaut about the ride thing
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:28,736	| serial-s01-e02 |	Awesome did you tell officer Adcock you. Stay for a ride
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:31,040	| serial-s01-e02 |	According to the police report
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:33,600	| serial-s01-e02 |	Anan said this was incorrect
EDL	00:34:33,600	00:34:34,880	| serial-s01-e02 |	Because he drives his own car.
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:38,208	| serial-s01-e02 |	So
EDL	00:34:38,720	00:34:39,744	| serial-s01-e02 |	He reverses himself
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:41,536	| serial-s01-e02 |	Why would he do that
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:48,704	| serial-s01-e02 |	Why would you tell the first cop who's expecting a ride and then once it's clear Hayes missing change his story
EDL	00:34:48,704	00:34:53,312	| serial-s01-e02 |	Maybe the girls were thinking of a different day or maybe when you talk to that first guy
EDL	00:34:53,824	00:34:56,640	| serial-s01-e02 |	Maybe he did ask a for right at some point that day but he's forgotten
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:35:04,320	| serial-s01-e02 |	Or maybe he's lying I'm not a detective but I consider this a red flag
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:10,720	| serial-s01-e02 |	Is this a teeny tiny
EDL	00:35:10,720	00:35:17,120	| serial-s01-e02 |	The great big flapping in the breeze red flag
