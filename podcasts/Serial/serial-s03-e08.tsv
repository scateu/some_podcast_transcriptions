EDL	00:01:42,656	00:01:49,056	| serial-s03-e08 |	When I began this project I didn't plan on covering any juvenile case
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:52,384	| serial-s03-e08 |	Juvenile records are public for one thing
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:55,968	| serial-s03-e08 |	I figured we got plenty to look at right here in the adult system
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:02:02,368	| serial-s03-e08 |	After while juvenile cases juvenile crime became impossible to ignore the newly-elected

EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:15,680	| serial-s03-e08 |	More and more juveniles were being charged with the worst crime
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:17,984	| serial-s03-e08 |	Serious assaults robberies

EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:26,432	| serial-s03-e08 |	Once these juvenile crimes made their way into the juvenile courts though
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:29,504	| serial-s03-e08 |	And once the juveniles themselves made their way into juvenile prisons
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:31,552	| serial-s03-e08 |	They disappear from View
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:34,624	| serial-s03-e08 |	Juvenile court rooms are tightly controlled
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:37,696	| serial-s03-e08 |	Names of juvenile defendants aren't publicized for good reason
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:40,512	| serial-s03-e08 |	The crimes children commit should not Forevermark them
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:45,376	| serial-s03-e08 |	But as a result I didn't have a picture of what Juvenile Justice look like in Cuyahoga County
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:48,704	| serial-s03-e08 |	I'd your mutterings at the Justice Center though
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:51,776	| serial-s03-e08 |	Mostly from defense attorneys grousing to each other
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:54,336	| serial-s03-e08 |	You're not going to believe what just happened to my juvenile quieter
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:55,616	| serial-s03-e08 |	Tumi
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:57,152	| serial-s03-e08 |	You think this place is bad
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:58,432	| serial-s03-e08 |	You should head over to juvenile
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:02:59,712	| serial-s03-e08 |	But I think
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:00,736	| serial-s03-e08 |	Why
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:02,272	| serial-s03-e08 |	What are you talking about
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:05,344	| serial-s03-e08 |	Then I met Joshua
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:07,648	| serial-s03-e08 |	He was 19 at the time
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:09,184	| serial-s03-e08 |	So not a child
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,464	| serial-s03-e08 |	He tell you he was grown
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:13,024	| serial-s03-e08 |	But he was still in the juvenile system
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:14,560	| serial-s03-e08 |	You can stay there till your 21
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:18,912	| serial-s03-e08 |	Keep in mind the juvenile system its mission is different from that of the adults
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:21,216	| serial-s03-e08 |	The point isn't to punish
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:22,752	| serial-s03-e08 |	Retribution
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:24,800	| serial-s03-e08 |	The point is to rehabilitate
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:27,104	| serial-s03-e08 |	In the juvenile system
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:28,896	| serial-s03-e08 |	That's where we're supposed to think like parents
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:30,688	| serial-s03-e08 |	Are the standard should be
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:31,456	| serial-s03-e08 |	My child
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:33,504	| serial-s03-e08 |	Is this what's best for my child
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:35,040	| serial-s03-e08 |	But this help my child
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:37,344	| serial-s03-e08 |	So
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:38,624	| serial-s03-e08 |	I'm going to tell you about Joshua
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:42,464	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua sometimes starts off a story with
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:43,232	| serial-s03-e08 |	Okay so boom
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:45,280	| serial-s03-e08 |	Boom is big in Cleveland
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:46,304	| serial-s03-e08 |	Shorthand for
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:47,072	| serial-s03-e08 |	Let me try to explain
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:48,352	| serial-s03-e08 |	For real
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:51,168	| serial-s03-e08 |	I feel like all the way like phone
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:54,240	| serial-s03-e08 |	All the tape I have with Joshua is from prison
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:57,312	| serial-s03-e08 |	So the sound is mostly at any threat of terrible
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,080	| serial-s03-e08 |	I'm sorry about that
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:00,896	| serial-s03-e08 |	Prison system allow me to interview Joshua and purse
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:06,272	| serial-s03-e08 |	But I can tell you is his longtime interlocutor I like it when Joshua says boom
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:07,040	| serial-s03-e08 |	Or better yet
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:07,552	| serial-s03-e08 |	Boom boom
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:10,112	| serial-s03-e08 |	Means I might start to understand something
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:13,440	| serial-s03-e08 |	So just how Joshua came to inhabit his current predicament
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:16,768	| serial-s03-e08 |	One Night in June of 2014
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:21,119	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua freshly 16i down to sleep after a night at a bar

EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:24,959	| serial-s03-e08 |	FBI agents for pulling him from his bed
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:28,543	| serial-s03-e08 |	They took him to an interrogation room in Cleveland Heights
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:33,407	| serial-s03-e08 |	They told him they had him for some robberies

EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:58,751	| serial-s03-e08 |	The FBI agents were saying not only do we have video evidence of what you've done but thank you social media
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:00,031	| serial-s03-e08 |	We also know who you run with
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:06,943	| serial-s03-e08 |	The crimes Joshua was charged with were serious armed robberies from many months back
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:10,783	| serial-s03-e08 |	Gas stations in a friend held up to BP's in one day
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:17,183	| serial-s03-e08 |	And a third robbery of a Popeye's Joshua said he was coerced into that one by an older gang member they barely got Nemo
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:21,791	| serial-s03-e08 |	Money he said they left with this pathetic little plastic bucket that had small bills in it

EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:48,927	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua said his gun had no bullets in it that his co-defendants gun was broken the firing pin was busted
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:51,999	| serial-s03-e08 |	Are the customers and workers at Popeye's that Wednesday morning didn't know that
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:59,167	| serial-s03-e08 |	The FBI agents were telling Joshua we've got you on video so let's friends are our choices shall we

EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:20,159	| serial-s03-e08 |	Or the officer said

EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:38,079	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua was operating on a couple hours sleep
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:40,127	| serial-s03-e08 |	If he remembers right he was handcuffed
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:43,455	| serial-s03-e08 |	He said the officers weren't rude or abusive to him
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:44,223	| serial-s03-e08 |	This cool he said
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:46,527	| serial-s03-e08 |	They left him alone for a while
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:48,063	| serial-s03-e08 |	To think about the deal they were offering
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:55,999	| serial-s03-e08 |	At any point did you say to them I want to talk to a lawyer or I need to speak to my mom

EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:47,711	| serial-s03-e08 |	And how long do they keep you there
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:50,271	| serial-s03-e08 |	I was there for about like

EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:01,279	| serial-s03-e08 |	No
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:03,839	| serial-s03-e08 |	Really
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:09,983	| serial-s03-e08 |	Doesn't it sound illegal
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:10,751	| serial-s03-e08 |	It's not
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:12,031	| serial-s03-e08 |	It's allowed
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:17,407	| serial-s03-e08 |	My children haven't robbed any gas station so I feel the apples and oranges here
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:23,295	| serial-s03-e08 |	But I have to sign a permission slip for my teenager to go on a quote-unquote field trip that's a five-block walk from her school

EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:34,815	| serial-s03-e08 |	Followed by exhaustion and the prospect of everlasting incarceration
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:37,375	| serial-s03-e08 |	And no adults but a hand on his shoulder
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:42,495	| serial-s03-e08 |	To crouch down and whisper in his ear what I believe most of us would have whispered if we've been in that room
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:44,287	| serial-s03-e08 |	Ask for a lawyer
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:46,079	| serial-s03-e08 |	Do it now ask for
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:46,591	| serial-s03-e08 |	Lawyer
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:48,895	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua had
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:50,175	| serial-s03-e08 |	The interview would have
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:51,455	| serial-s03-e08 |	Should have stopped
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:52,735	| serial-s03-e08 |	And maybe his story would have
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,783	| serial-s03-e08 |	Should have gone another way
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:58,111	| serial-s03-e08 |	As it was Joshua took the deal
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:58,623	| serial-s03-e08 |	That fast
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:00,671	| serial-s03-e08 |	It was June of 2014
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:03,743	| serial-s03-e08 |	Two months earlier his daughter had been born
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:06,559	| serial-s03-e08 |	Those two months with already told me where the happiest of his life
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:11,423	| serial-s03-e08 |	You couldn't handle the idea of being locked up until both he and she were decades older
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:16,031	| serial-s03-e08 |	And also Joshua's relationship inside the gang he was in
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:17,055	| serial-s03-e08 |	Heartless felons
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,335	| serial-s03-e08 |	Complicated
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:22,943	| serial-s03-e08 |	I know it's hard to square but Joshua says he was an armed robber who wasn't into violence
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:27,807	| serial-s03-e08 |	Isn't the only benefit of joining the heartless felons with the protection they offered
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:28,831	| serial-s03-e08 |	From the heartless felons
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:29,855	| serial-s03-e08 |	From them
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:32,927	| serial-s03-e08 |	He said they extorted people into committing crimes
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:35,231	| serial-s03-e08 |	Especially the younger kids like him
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:37,279	| serial-s03-e08 |	When do serious time if they got caught
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:38,815	| serial-s03-e08 |	So yeah
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:40,863	| serial-s03-e08 |	He did stuff with them and for them
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:43,423	| serial-s03-e08 |	Didn't feel anything for most of them
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:46,751	| serial-s03-e08 |	The only one he have considered a friend you told me
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:49,311	| serial-s03-e08 |	You're not guy had pulled a gun on him once during an argument
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:51,359	| serial-s03-e08 |	So he took the deal
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:52,895	| serial-s03-e08 |	Juvenile life
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:54,431	| serial-s03-e08 |	The catch
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:57,759	| serial-s03-e08 |	Something called a serious youthful offender dispositional sentence
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:10:00,831	| serial-s03-e08 |	Usually people just call it an syo
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:03,391	| serial-s03-e08 |	It works like a suspended adult prison sentence
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:06,719	| serial-s03-e08 |	You young man are going to stay in the juvenile system that's
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,487	| serial-s03-e08 |	The carrot
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:11,327	| serial-s03-e08 |	We're hanging a ghostly adult sentence over your head that's the stick
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:14,655	| serial-s03-e08 |	Which we can invoke if you can't keep it together in juvenile prison
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:17,983	| serial-s03-e08 |	So if you want to stay in juvenile you have to behave
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:21,567	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua believed he could behave he took the deal
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:28,223	| serial-s03-e08 |	That same day he got arrested
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:31,295	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua says he drove around with the cops showed them places
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:33,855	| serial-s03-e08 |	Identify people in photographs
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:36,159	| serial-s03-e08 |	People associated with the heartless felons
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:39,487	| serial-s03-e08 |	In the coming months he'd meet with investigators a couple more times
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:43,071	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua has terrific recall for all manner of information
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:44,095	| serial-s03-e08 |	I'd give them dates
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:44,863	| serial-s03-e08 |	Addresses
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:45,631	| serial-s03-e08 |	X
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:49,727	| serial-s03-e08 |	He told them details of crimes about which they already knew and about ones they didn't
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:51,007	| serial-s03-e08 |	As a source
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:52,031	| serial-s03-e08 |	He was a champion
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:56,127	| serial-s03-e08 |	He really Joshua is extremely unusual
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:58,687	| serial-s03-e08 |	This is Lissa Rankin
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:11:00,479	| serial-s03-e08 |	She was Joshua's public defender
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:04,319	| serial-s03-e08 |	Choose a scientist case only after Joshua had agreed to cooperate
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:07,647	| serial-s03-e08 |	When I called her to ask about Joshua
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:09,439	| serial-s03-e08 |	It been a client for only a couple months
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:10,207	| serial-s03-e08 |	Earlier
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:11,999	| serial-s03-e08 |	Remember him immediately
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:15,327	| serial-s03-e08 |	She's used to clients refusing to cooperate with the police
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:18,911	| serial-s03-e08 |	Refusing even to tell her information that might help their defense
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:21,215	| serial-s03-e08 |	So for him to be
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:25,823	| serial-s03-e08 |	So open and volunteering information and
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:27,359	| serial-s03-e08 |	How this whole thing
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:29,407	| serial-s03-e08 |	Start is that when he had met with the office
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:30,687	| serial-s03-e08 |	It's worth before the arraignment
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:35,295	| serial-s03-e08 |	Before he was represented he had volunteered information
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:37,855	| serial-s03-e08 |	And he really helps them
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:43,231	| serial-s03-e08 |	On a number of Investigations because they didn't have starting points
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:47,839	| serial-s03-e08 |	This is when the heartless felons really started coming in
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:48,607	| serial-s03-e08 |	The play
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:52,191	| serial-s03-e08 |	They were freaking a lot of havoc in Cuyahoga County and I believed
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:53,215	| serial-s03-e08 |	The state of salar
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:58,079	| serial-s03-e08 |	And so the police were very desperate to get as much information as they can
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:01,919	| serial-s03-e08 |	And Joshua really connected a lot of.
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:05,247	| serial-s03-e08 |	And I think he explained it in a way
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:07,807	| serial-s03-e08 |	That really was almost like a tutorial
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,599	| serial-s03-e08 |	And he could tell you
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:10,623	| serial-s03-e08 |	Everything
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:14,463	| serial-s03-e08 |	You know he could explain hierarchy housings work
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:18,815	| serial-s03-e08 |	You know there's really no such thing as a King app
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:19,839	| serial-s03-e08 |	Because
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:25,983	| serial-s03-e08 |	There aren't people in these gangs you know studying these games that kind of studying from a sociological standpoint
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:31,615	| serial-s03-e08 |	I felt like Josh was probably one of the clearest historians that they've had in a long time
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:33,919	| serial-s03-e08 |	Really
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:37,247	| serial-s03-e08 |	Put himself out there and because of Josh
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:42,367	| serial-s03-e08 |	You know other other major crimes were solved and
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:43,647	| serial-s03-e08 |	You know the Hope was that
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:46,463	| serial-s03-e08 |	Much more dangerous individuals
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:47,487	| serial-s03-e08 |	Zorbing
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:48,767	| serial-s03-e08 |	Taking off the streets
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:49,535	| serial-s03-e08 |	Because of Josh
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:52,607	| serial-s03-e08 |	This gang is affiliated
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:53,631	| serial-s03-e08 |	With the heartless felons
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:58,751	| serial-s03-e08 |	The gang operated in the Glenville neighborhood between
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:00,543	| serial-s03-e08 |	Saint Clair Superior
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:02,079	| serial-s03-e08 |	East 105 Street area
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:06,431	| serial-s03-e08 |	7 months after Joshua begin cooperating
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:08,991	| serial-s03-e08 |	A bunch of important people in Cleveland would hold a press conference
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:11,551	| serial-s03-e08 |	The mayor of Cleveland police chief
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:14,367	| serial-s03-e08 |	People from ATF FBI County Sheriff's Office
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,135	| serial-s03-e08 |	Prosecutor
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,671	| serial-s03-e08 |	They said
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:19,231	| serial-s03-e08 |	Six months ago we began an investigation
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:22,303	| serial-s03-e08 |	Announce the 13-person indictment
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:24,863	| serial-s03-e08 |	All members of a heartless felons Affiliated group
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:26,143	| serial-s03-e08 |	Call the Cutthroats
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:27,679	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua's General neighborhood
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:32,287	| serial-s03-e08 |	We looked at these gang members for crimes ranging from
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:33,567	| serial-s03-e08 |	Voice results
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:39,199	| serial-s03-e08 |	Aggravated robberies kidnappings various weapons violations
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:44,319	| serial-s03-e08 |	They're also tied to at least one homicide that we know of right now
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:49,439	| serial-s03-e08 |	There were drug charges Rico charges gang charges more Gang Related rest will follow
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:55,071	| serial-s03-e08 |	BFDI didn't talk to me about Joshua's case or his cooperation by the way north of the Cleveland Police
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:59,423	| serial-s03-e08 |	Almost everyone in the Cutthroat indictment pleaded guilty
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:00,959	| serial-s03-e08 |	A couple of people went to trial
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:03,775	| serial-s03-e08 |	And again Joshua kept up his end of the deal
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:06,591	| serial-s03-e08 |	A year had gone by since his arrest
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:08,383	| serial-s03-e08 |	He thought he was all done helping
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:10,687	| serial-s03-e08 |	But then off they took him to the Justice Center
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:14,271	| serial-s03-e08 |	Or he got up in front of his dangerous Earth while friends
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:16,319	| serial-s03-e08 |	An out at himself as an informant
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:21,183	| serial-s03-e08 |	He knew that hate him for it could get killed for it if he's got the chance
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:22,975	| serial-s03-e08 |	We also figured
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:26,303	| serial-s03-e08 |	Everyone on that cuts word indictment all these cases
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:27,071	| serial-s03-e08 |	They were adults
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:29,375	| serial-s03-e08 |	They be going into adult prisons
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:31,423	| serial-s03-e08 |	He was staying in juvenile
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:37,055	| serial-s03-e08 |	He testified at the trial of one guy charged for a drive-by shooting like I was acquitted
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:38,591	| serial-s03-e08 |	And also in a murder trial
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:42,943	| serial-s03-e08 |	For that one Josh was only job was to identify the defendant
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:44,479	| serial-s03-e08 |	Yeah I know him
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:47,295	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua had no first-hand information about the crime
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:49,855	| serial-s03-e08 |	But the state put him on the stand anyway
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:52,415	| serial-s03-e08 |	Ask the prosecutor MOA dollar
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:54,719	| serial-s03-e08 |	Why put Joshua up there then
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:56,767	| serial-s03-e08 |	You had other people ID in your guy
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:58,303	| serial-s03-e08 |	Including an ATF agent
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:00,607	| serial-s03-e08 |	Including the defendant's own mother
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:05,727	| serial-s03-e08 |	Who said yeah that young man sporting the distinctively energetic ponytail in the surveillance tape
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:07,007	| serial-s03-e08 |	That's my son

EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:11,871	| serial-s03-e08 |	You don't want to leave evidence
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:12,383	| serial-s03-e08 |	Not you
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:14,687	| serial-s03-e08 |	You know you have evidence
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:15,711	| serial-s03-e08 |	We're going to use it
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:16,223	| serial-s03-e08 |	Ensure that
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:19,039	| serial-s03-e08 |	Yeah something like this a homicide word person
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:20,831	| serial-s03-e08 |	Life is taken from him for no reason
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:22,623	| serial-s03-e08 |	Another person is Gravely injured
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:24,415	| serial-s03-e08 |	That we don't leave at the chance
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:30,559	| serial-s03-e08 |	You guys ever hesitate to use juveniles cuz you're just like let's try to keep them out of the stuff
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:32,095	| serial-s03-e08 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:34,143	| serial-s03-e08 |	At it again depends on the case
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:38,495	| serial-s03-e08 |	Your problem is a lot of our Shooters are people who are killing people are
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:39,519	| serial-s03-e08 |	Are Young
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:42,079	| serial-s03-e08 |	And other people to hang out with
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:44,895	| serial-s03-e08 |	The prosecutor from the other trial
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:46,687	| serial-s03-e08 |	The drive-by shooting told me
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:48,991	| serial-s03-e08 |	Of course they never want their witnesses to get hurt
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:50,527	| serial-s03-e08 |	He also said
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:54,623	| serial-s03-e08 |	In terms of Joshua after he was done testifying
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:55,903	| serial-s03-e08 |	I didn't really give him any thought
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:16:01,791	| serial-s03-e08 |	Lissa Rankin the public defender happened to be in the courtroom and Joshua was on the stand
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:04,351	| serial-s03-e08 |	He wasn't her client anymore but she recognized
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:05,375	| serial-s03-e08 |	And she thought
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:07,423	| serial-s03-e08 |	Wow they are still using him
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:09,983	| serial-s03-e08 |	This is still going on
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:16,127	| serial-s03-e08 |	You know I was very concerned for Joshua safety because we know how these
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:17,151	| serial-s03-e08 |	Cases go
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:20,479	| serial-s03-e08 |	You know any of the kid
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:24,575	| serial-s03-e08 |	Other defense attorneys told me they do not advise their clients to
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:26,623	| serial-s03-e08 |	To cooperate unless there's no other solution
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:29,951	| serial-s03-e08 |	Too often the benefits aren't what they're cracked up to be
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:31,743	| serial-s03-e08 |	Well the risks crackle on for years
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:35,839	| serial-s03-e08 |	I talked to another public defender in the juvenile division
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:36,607	| serial-s03-e08 |	Morgan Pierce
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:41,215	| serial-s03-e08 |	She told me she quote rarely if ever has a could cooperate with law enforcement
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:44,031	| serial-s03-e08 |	Unless your kid can jump out of plane she said
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:48,895	| serial-s03-e08 |	They're either going to go to juvenile prison and be in danger or they're going to go back to their neighborhood and be in danger
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:52,735	| serial-s03-e08 |	And still very much trust the system to follow through on what they say
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:55,807	| serial-s03-e08 |	The prosecutors are not beholden to anything
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:57,087	| serial-s03-e08 |	So the kids are used
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:58,367	| serial-s03-e08 |	Are naive
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:06,303	| serial-s03-e08 |	Lissa Rankin remembered how much the police officers had seemed to like Joshua when they interviewed on
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:07,839	| serial-s03-e08 |	I did encourage him
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:10,399	| serial-s03-e08 |	There's talk of him getting out of prison
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:10,911	| serial-s03-e08 |	Going to school
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:15,263	| serial-s03-e08 |	There was a lot of talk that they would check in on him and
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:18,591	| serial-s03-e08 |	I guess you know ideally you hope that that means
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:21,151	| serial-s03-e08 |	Somehow protecting him
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:34,207	| serial-s03-e08 |	Juvenile prisons in Ohio
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:37,535	| serial-s03-e08 |	Are run by the Ohio Department of Youth Services odys
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:40,863	| serial-s03-e08 |	And if a juvenile prison system could have a golden age
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:42,399	| serial-s03-e08 |	This would be it 4 Ohio
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:45,983	| serial-s03-e08 |	10 years ago the system was forced to remake itself
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:50,591	| serial-s03-e08 |	After lawsuits and a state investigation that a federal investigation
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:51,871	| serial-s03-e08 |	If I need a consent decree
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:57,503	| serial-s03-e08 |	Back in 2007 a court-ordered investigation found what sounded like child abuse
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:17:58,271	| serial-s03-e08 |	Potentially
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:18:00,575	| serial-s03-e08 |	Severely overcrowded housing units
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:05,695	| serial-s03-e08 |	Untrained confrontational poorly supervised sometimes even vengeful staff
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:07,487	| serial-s03-e08 |	Using excessive force
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:09,791	| serial-s03-e08 |	And quote Reckless and malicious practices
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:13,375	| serial-s03-e08 |	Choke holds that created extreme risks of asphyxia
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:17,471	| serial-s03-e08 |	Java juices tactics in strategic locations to avoid cameras
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:21,311	| serial-s03-e08 |	Kids were also being harmed by other kids
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:23,615	| serial-s03-e08 |	I need no real Avenue to complain or to get help
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:26,943	| serial-s03-e08 |	Sometimes they threaten suicide just to get into isolation
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:31,295	| serial-s03-e08 |	Then came federally-mandated and fairly massive reforms
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:35,135	| serial-s03-e08 |	It's hard to do away with solitary confinement as a punishment
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:38,463	| serial-s03-e08 |	Art staff from using Force except in extreme circumstances
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:41,023	| serial-s03-e08 |	And added lots of educational and therapeutic programs
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:46,399	| serial-s03-e08 |	Most impressively they really did redefined what juvenile prison should be for
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:47,935	| serial-s03-e08 |	Weather condition before
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:53,311	| serial-s03-e08 |	Unless your child is hurting other people using a gun committing rape setting housefires
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:56,639	| serial-s03-e08 |	He's probably not going to an odys closed facility
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:19:01,759	| serial-s03-e08 |	Is going to go to a smaller residential or non-residential program in his own community
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:07,391	| serial-s03-e08 |	I want some young hot wires and spray painters still do end up in odys prisons for the wrong reasons
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:10,975	| serial-s03-e08 |	Address of Alternatives in their own rural counties or around head of Judge
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:15,071	| serial-s03-e08 |	Generally speaking Ohio is not locking up kids like that anymore
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:19,423	| serial-s03-e08 |	2004 through 2000 kids in Ohio juvenile prisons
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:21,727	| serial-s03-e08 |	Now they're about 500
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:26,847	| serial-s03-e08 |	In 2015 the Department of Justice issued a report
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:31,967	| serial-s03-e08 |	Celebrating a turnaround that has quote resulted in what is many ways a model system
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:34,015	| serial-s03-e08 |	We are calling the Ohio model
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:36,319	| serial-s03-e08 |	Excellent progress yes
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:40,415	| serial-s03-e08 |	The one downside is that the kids who do get sent to odys
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:42,719	| serial-s03-e08 |	To borrow a phrase from Donald Rumsfeld
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:43,743	| serial-s03-e08 |	Are the worst of the worst
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:48,607	| serial-s03-e08 |	Or if Donald Rumsfeld had a compassionate social worker said she might say
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:52,447	| serial-s03-e08 |	The kids arriving at odys now or more traumatized and higher needs
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:57,055	| serial-s03-e08 |	And instead of being divided among nine institutions there now corralled into 3
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:20:01,663	| serial-s03-e08 |	The higher concentration of sometimes-violent always struggling children
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:03,455	| serial-s03-e08 |	Living together in a smaller space
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:08,063	| serial-s03-e08 |	The facility where Joshua landed in September of 2014
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:09,087	| serial-s03-e08 |	It's called Indian River
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:13,183	| serial-s03-e08 |	Not officially maximum-security but functionally it operates like Judy Mac
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:17,279	| serial-s03-e08 |	One big building housing at time about 140 kids
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:20,351	| serial-s03-e08 |	They have their own school which is across the yard
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:22,399	| serial-s03-e08 |	I've been inside the main building
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:24,191	| serial-s03-e08 |	What's clean brightly-painted
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:27,007	| serial-s03-e08 |	Life-size posters of basketball stars are decorating the hallway
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:30,335	| serial-s03-e08 |	What does 8 units roughly 20 kids doing unit
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:32,127	| serial-s03-e08 |	Single rooms with doors that close
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:34,943	| serial-s03-e08 |	Each unit has ad a room with a TV
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:36,223	| serial-s03-e08 |	They can play video games
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:37,759	| serial-s03-e08 |	Play cards of Dysart
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:38,271	| serial-s03-e08 |	Contraband
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:42,367	| serial-s03-e08 |	The kids go to school to therapy they might have jobs cleaning a cup
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:43,647	| serial-s03-e08 |	Cafeteria ordering maintenance
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:47,231	| serial-s03-e08 |	At first things went okay for Joshua to Indian River
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:50,047	| serial-s03-e08 |	No one knew he cooperated with law enforcement
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:51,327	| serial-s03-e08 |	Josh Rosen family didn't know
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:54,655	| serial-s03-e08 |	He saw that the heartless felons were in charge of some of the unit
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:56,959	| serial-s03-e08 |	Controlling the video game remote
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:21:01,055	| serial-s03-e08 |	Taxing kids for their food forcing them to clean up or to make 3-way phone calls for them
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:03,103	| serial-s03-e08 |	All of which Joshua had anticipated
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:06,175	| serial-s03-e08 |	Heartless felons were invented in Cleveland's juvenile lockup
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:09,247	| serial-s03-e08 |	And Joshua had been inside one of them before
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:10,271	| serial-s03-e08 |	When is about 13
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:14,111	| serial-s03-e08 |	Does the first time he saw how tightly they operated inside prison
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:18,464	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua had already passed the various tests to get absorbed into the Gang
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:19,744	| serial-s03-e08 |	They call it getting twisted
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:26,400	| serial-s03-e08 |	If you don't want to be perpetually bullied and assaulted
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:27,680	| serial-s03-e08 |	If you want to be able to eat
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:29,472	| serial-s03-e08 |	Other kids taking your food
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:31,520	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua said you try to join
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:33,824	| serial-s03-e08 |	And to join you have to get three bodies
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:35,360	| serial-s03-e08 |	Assault 3 people
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:38,432	| serial-s03-e08 |	Other other juveniles are staff
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:40,224	| serial-s03-e08 |	Strike
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:55,328	| serial-s03-e08 |	An Indian River Joshua with an Insider well-positioned
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:58,144	| serial-s03-e08 |	Nobody was asking him where you from
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:22:00,192	| serial-s03-e08 |	Always the first loaded question
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:03,264	| serial-s03-e08 |	She was friends with the leader of the heartless felons
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:04,288	| serial-s03-e08 |	The Godfather
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:04,800	| serial-s03-e08 |	Rgf
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:06,080	| serial-s03-e08 |	Vouch for him
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:08,384	| serial-s03-e08 |	Is good for about a year
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:11,968	| serial-s03-e08 |	Then he had to testify at the trial downtown
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:15,296	| serial-s03-e08 |	And a Slither of rumors started back at Indian River
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:16,832	| serial-s03-e08 |	The Joshua had told
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:23,744	| serial-s03-e08 |	Cuz like the beginning of 2000s
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,192	| serial-s03-e08 |	The Donald
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:38,336	| serial-s03-e08 |	Popped up like what are you talkin about what what specifically is happening
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:40,640	| serial-s03-e08 |	Working around me
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:51,136	| serial-s03-e08 |	Whenever I ask Joshua what it was like to testify how he felt about cooperating with the
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:51,904	| serial-s03-e08 |	The police
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:54,208	| serial-s03-e08 |	The dancers are rushed in a little mechanical
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:58,560	| serial-s03-e08 |	As if the subject triggers a tiny Guillotine window and is Brian to zip closed
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:01,632	| serial-s03-e08 |	Protecting the more fragile synapses from exposure
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:05,728	| serial-s03-e08 |	What account with practically digital accuracy though
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:08,032	| serial-s03-e08 |	Is when the trouble really really started
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:11,360	| serial-s03-e08 |	Indian River for about 2 years
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:13,152	| serial-s03-e08 |	And then he transferred
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:15,456	| serial-s03-e08 |	To a minimum-security juvenile prison
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:16,736	| serial-s03-e08 |	Call Cuyahoga Hills
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:18,528	| serial-s03-e08 |	Summer 2016
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:22,112	| serial-s03-e08 |	That's when the bare-bones rumors about Joshua started to Take On Me
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:30,560	| serial-s03-e08 |	Cell phone
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:32,864	| serial-s03-e08 |	He was like

EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:50,528	| serial-s03-e08 |	Cuyahoga Hills is in a suburb right outside Cleveland
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:54,112	| serial-s03-e08 |	Lots of people from his neighborhood or rival neighborhoods
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:55,136	| serial-s03-e08 |	Coming and going
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:56,672	| serial-s03-e08 |	Family members visiting
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:58,464	| serial-s03-e08 |	Calling gossiping

EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:37,888	| serial-s03-e08 |	But otherwise kids are mingling all the time
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:40,192	| serial-s03-e08 |	Which if your target
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:41,472	| serial-s03-e08 |	Is tantamount to a hellscape
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:46,080	| serial-s03-e08 |	A quick look at the odys rundown of incidents involving Joshua
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:48,640	| serial-s03-e08 |	You see the rush of assaults as soon as he gets

EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:50,944	| serial-s03-e08 |	Like a blood pressure spike
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:52,480	| serial-s03-e08 |	July 3rd
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:53,248	| serial-s03-e08 |	July 7th
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:55,040	| serial-s03-e08 |	July 19th July 22nd
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:57,600	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua can fight
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:25:00,160	| serial-s03-e08 |	A few staff members told me he can really fight
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:03,744	| serial-s03-e08 |	He told me his moves got the attention of one guard who's also a gym teacher
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:06,816	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua said the guys to watch the surveillance videos
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:07,840	| serial-s03-e08 |	Best fights in admiration
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:10,912	| serial-s03-e08 |	Anyway Joshua fought back
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:12,960	| serial-s03-e08 |	But he said more and more people were assaulting him
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:16,544	| serial-s03-e08 |	First of the three people than for people than 6 people
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:21,152	| serial-s03-e08 |	The worst assault in terms of the physical damage done to Joshua
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:22,688	| serial-s03-e08 |	Was in September of 2016
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:24,992	| serial-s03-e08 |	It happened in the schoolhouse
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:28,320	| serial-s03-e08 |	Haven staying clear of school because you knew it wasn't safe there
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:31,392	| serial-s03-e08 |	But he said they told him he wouldn't be allowed to take his GED test
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:32,928	| serial-s03-e08 |	If you didn't have 90%
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:33,440	| serial-s03-e08 |	Attendance
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:41,120	| serial-s03-e08 |	Then next thing you know like I was walking through the school hall
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:43,424	| serial-s03-e08 |	And then
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:47,264	| serial-s03-e08 |	Black dolphin
EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:49,056	| serial-s03-e08 |	I woke up in the hospital that's all I remember
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:52,384	| serial-s03-e08 |	Oh my god really have no memory is like

EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:01,088	| serial-s03-e08 |	My head on the door
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:02,112	| serial-s03-e08 |	On the ground
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:05,696	| serial-s03-e08 |	On the doorknob when I was
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:08,256	| serial-s03-e08 |	Lay down and I'll just had a seizure
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:12,352	| serial-s03-e08 |	I was coughing up blood
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:13,888	| serial-s03-e08 |	Modern members
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:15,168	| serial-s03-e08 |	Oakland Hospital
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:16,704	| serial-s03-e08 |	Clothes full of blood
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:20,032	| serial-s03-e08 |	How long are you in the house
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:20,544	| serial-s03-e08 |	Hospital
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:22,848	| serial-s03-e08 |	I was just there for a couple of hours and I
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:30,528	| serial-s03-e08 |	Are they coming back in the same part of the institution with the higher higher higher ranking
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:32,832	| serial-s03-e08 |	I worry about wearing some back at square one
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:34,880	| serial-s03-e08 |	Another attack
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:36,928	| serial-s03-e08 |	December 30th 2016
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:37,952	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua's jumped again
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:41,536	| serial-s03-e08 |	This time he firmly believes a guard made that happen
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:46,144	| serial-s03-e08 |	You just been moved to a new unit and he started arguing with the guard on duty
EDL	00:26:46,656	00:26:49,216	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua said he went and took the unit phone
EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:50,240	| serial-s03-e08 |	And the guards desk
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:51,776	| serial-s03-e08 |	Deploy to get some attention
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:54,336	| serial-s03-e08 |	He put it in his Foot Locker by his bed
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:55,104	| serial-s03-e08 |	When give it back
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:27:02,272	| serial-s03-e08 |	The guard had ordered pizza from the kids on the unit Joshua said when the guard came in with the pizza boxes
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:03,552	| serial-s03-e08 |	He told some kids
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:05,344	| serial-s03-e08 |	Go get the phone back from Joshua
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:06,368	| serial-s03-e08 |	And you can have your pizza
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:10,208	| serial-s03-e08 |	Knowing full well Joshua says that that would likely lead to an assault
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:11,232	| serial-s03-e08 |	I did
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:13,280	| serial-s03-e08 |	Three kids jumps Joshua
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:14,560	| serial-s03-e08 |	I got out of hand
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:16,864	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua said the guard then cuff them
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:18,144	| serial-s03-e08 |	Start to walk him out
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:19,936	| serial-s03-e08 |	But then a bunch more kids
EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:21,728	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua thinks about five of them
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:22,752	| serial-s03-e08 |	They joined in
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:27,872	| serial-s03-e08 |	Got trash on the ground so now he's got about eight kids on them all heartless felons while he's handcuffed
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:34,272	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua said the guard didn't call a signal 88 to ask for help that's for a serious fight or riot
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:36,832	| serial-s03-e08 |	Is that a different guard called a signal 5
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:39,904	| serial-s03-e08 |	Which means other staff are more likely to mosey over to help
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:40,928	| serial-s03-e08 |	Rather than run
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:47,328	| serial-s03-e08 |	But Joshua says more guards finally did come over and one of them put his own body between Joshua and the kids
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:48,096	| serial-s03-e08 |	Door stopping him
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:06,272	| serial-s03-e08 |	If I pick you up
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:08,576	| serial-s03-e08 |	Sutter Clinic
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:10,624	| serial-s03-e08 |	Three guards were also injured
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:14,208	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua says after that they took him to operations
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:16,768	| serial-s03-e08 |	We sat there for another hour or two handcuffs
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:19,584	| serial-s03-e08 |	Then just went into seclusion cell for a while
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:24,448	| serial-s03-e08 |	I ran all of what Joshua told me by odys
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:27,264	| serial-s03-e08 |	But the department would not answer any questions about Joshua
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:30,080	| serial-s03-e08 |	Did you not discuss juveniles in their custody
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:34,944	| serial-s03-e08 |	Nor were they provide anyone for me to interview about their policies or procedures are philosophy generally
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:39,040	| serial-s03-e08 |	Because they said it would be in service of a story about a particular use
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:42,112	| serial-s03-e08 |	They did send me a general statement which will get to later
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:46,976	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua said all along he's been telling me administration at Cuyahoga Hills
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:48,000	| serial-s03-e08 |	I am not safe
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:51,328	| serial-s03-e08 |	I heard similar complaints from other kids at odys
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:53,120	| serial-s03-e08 |	I told them
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:54,400	| serial-s03-e08 |	They didn't really do anything
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:58,752	| serial-s03-e08 |	You see an Institutional reports and lawsuits over the years as well
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:02,592	| serial-s03-e08 |	Allegations that staff knew kids were in danger from other kids
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:03,360	| serial-s03-e08 |	I didn't do enough
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:08,736	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua said he practically begged the people in charge at Cuyahoga Hills
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:11,040	| serial-s03-e08 |	You got to send me back to Indian River
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:13,344	| serial-s03-e08 |	Snuffer's Dallas all down there
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:15,904	| serial-s03-e08 |	Stop
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:16,416	| serial-s03-e08 |	And then

EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:37,408	| serial-s03-e08 |	But the superintendent at the institutional Hills
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:38,944	| serial-s03-e08 |	He basically said like
EDL	00:29:38,944	00:29:40,992	| serial-s03-e08 |	Like it was my fault that I was getting started like
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:44,064	| serial-s03-e08 |	Again odys did not comment on Joshua
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:46,112	| serial-s03-e08 |	This case including whether he asked to be moved
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:47,648	| serial-s03-e08 |	But I don't know
EDL	00:29:48,928	00:29:50,464	| serial-s03-e08 |	That was bringing everything on me
EDL	00:29:52,768	00:29:55,072	| serial-s03-e08 |	Likes and like that I called the boss
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:57,376	| serial-s03-e08 |	People

EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:13,760	| serial-s03-e08 |	But nobody was saying I kept telling him I can't explain
EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:16,064	| serial-s03-e08 |	Lights flickering off and gorgeous
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:16,832	| serial-s03-e08 |	Lake Emily

EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:28,608	| serial-s03-e08 |	Defense attorney
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:32,704	| serial-s03-e08 |	Who said he'd figure out if he could get Joshua early release from odys
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:35,776	| serial-s03-e08 |	Anna civil rights attorney mr. Paul cristallo is matter of fact
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:38,336	| serial-s03-e08 |	Then you might remember from aramis's case
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:40,640	| serial-s03-e08 |	That's how I learned about Joshua and Paul
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:43,712	| serial-s03-e08 |	Attorneys were shocked they said
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:46,528	| serial-s03-e08 |	It seemed like the heartless felons were colluding with staff
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:50,368	| serial-s03-e08 |	They considered asking the State Attorney General's office to launch an investigation
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:52,160	| serial-s03-e08 |	In the meantime
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:53,952	| serial-s03-e08 |	Paul had called the facility to say

EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:33,088	| serial-s03-e08 |	And yet I couldn't hear anyone aside from Joshua raising an alarm
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:35,392	| serial-s03-e08 |	Considered
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:36,928	| serial-s03-e08 |	Does anyone in my position would
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:40,000	| serial-s03-e08 |	There's probably more to the story that I'm not seeing
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:42,560	| serial-s03-e08 |	I set out to fact-check Joshua
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:44,864	| serial-s03-e08 |	Begin with Miss Turner

EDL	00:34:52,544	00:34:54,848	| serial-s03-e08 |	It's a curriculum design by the children's defense fund
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:59,456	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua says Freedom School was by far the best thing that happened to him inside odys
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:01,504	| serial-s03-e08 |	I changed his whole demeanor he said
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:04,320	| serial-s03-e08 |	Permit enraged suspicious scholar

EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:10,464	| serial-s03-e08 |	Every time I got mad she asked me why
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:15,072	| serial-s03-e08 |	Was the first time somebody actually ever sat down and listen to me vent
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:16,096	| serial-s03-e08 |	I tried to coach me
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:16,608	| serial-s03-e08 |	Work with me
EDL	00:35:17,888	00:35:19,936	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua stayed in the program for two years
EDL	00:35:19,936	00:35:20,960	| serial-s03-e08 |	Longer than anyone else
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:25,312	| serial-s03-e08 |	When the program lost funding Miss Turner positioned herself as Joshua's mentor
EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:26,336	| serial-s03-e08 |	Kept in touch
EDL	00:35:27,616	00:35:30,944	| serial-s03-e08 |	I asked Miss Turner about Joshua's version the pizza incident
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:35,040	| serial-s03-e08 |	Because I figured she knows him well she seen his worst and best behavior
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:37,344	| serial-s03-e08 |	I figured she'd know whether he was exaggerated
EDL	00:35:38,112	00:35:40,416	| serial-s03-e08 |	Weatherguard really have handcuff Joshua
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:42,720	| serial-s03-e08 |	Are there more or less allowed more kids to assault him
EDL	00:35:43,744	00:35:45,024	| serial-s03-e08 |	I'm hearing stuff like
EDL	00:35:45,024	00:35:45,536	| serial-s03-e08 |	Canal
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:47,840	| serial-s03-e08 |	The guard put handcuffs on them
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:53,216	| serial-s03-e08 |	Yes that is absolutely real in the way that I verify that is just
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:56,800	| serial-s03-e08 |	When asking to be able to see the footage
EDL	00:35:56,800	00:36:00,384	| serial-s03-e08 |	And their inability to do that only reason I know any of information about it is because
EDL	00:36:00,896	00:36:02,688	| serial-s03-e08 |	They called me to calm Joshua down
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:07,552	| serial-s03-e08 |	Are they called you yes so the facility called me with Joshua tomorrow
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:09,088	| serial-s03-e08 |	Kevin Thomas mentor
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:13,440	| serial-s03-e08 |	To calm him down and that is the most angry I've ever heard him I can hear him crying
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:16,256	| serial-s03-e08 |	And I couldn't even manage that myself
EDL	00:36:17,024	00:36:21,120	| serial-s03-e08 |	I told him I needed to see him I said to talk to him in person and we went to go see him
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:23,424	| serial-s03-e08 |	And that's when I saw the bruises
EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:24,448	| serial-s03-e08 |	And the beating
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:25,728	| serial-s03-e08 |	That's was very strong
EDL	00:36:26,240	00:36:29,568	| serial-s03-e08 |	He's a fighter this is what got him into like this
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:30,336	| serial-s03-e08 |	This is something that
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:32,384	| serial-s03-e08 |	Straight comfortable answer to see him
EDL	00:36:33,920	00:36:36,992	| serial-s03-e08 |	That bad and be able to talk to him and find out what happened
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:39,296	| serial-s03-e08 |	It was horrible and then the guard was fired afterwards
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:42,112	| serial-s03-e08 |	The car wouldn't have been fired at the car when they've been in the wrong
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:45,952	| serial-s03-e08 |	I eventually got the Personnel records for this guard
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:46,720	| serial-s03-e08 |	He was fired
EDL	00:36:47,232	00:36:49,280	| serial-s03-e08 |	The later through a settlement with the Union
EDL	00:36:49,280	00:36:52,864	| serial-s03-e08 |	He was allowed to resign along with a pledge to never again working odys
EDL	00:36:54,144	00:36:56,448	| serial-s03-e08 |	The guard wasn't sanction for Joshua getting jumped
EDL	00:36:56,960	00:36:58,496	| serial-s03-e08 |	Who sanctioned because of the pizza
EDL	00:36:59,264	00:37:01,312	| serial-s03-e08 |	Did minute to taking 20 bucks from one of the kids
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:03,360	| serial-s03-e08 |	And using it to buy them Pizza
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:04,640	| serial-s03-e08 |	It's against the rules
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:06,688	| serial-s03-e08 |	It seems like
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:11,808	| serial-s03-e08 |	Every time he's telling me a story I'm just like it feels like inside of there
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:16,672	| serial-s03-e08 |	Certainly Cuyahoga Hills but also to return extended Indian River that it's just
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:17,440	| serial-s03-e08 |	Chaos
EDL	00:37:17,440	00:37:23,840	| serial-s03-e08 |	It is absolute chaos
EDL	00:37:23,840	00:37:24,352	| serial-s03-e08 |	A little chaos
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:27,424	| serial-s03-e08 |	And that the kids seem in charge
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:29,472	| serial-s03-e08 |	Or is that not true
EDL	00:37:30,240	00:37:31,520	| serial-s03-e08 |	I would absolutely agree with that
EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:38,176	| serial-s03-e08 |	Yes and I want to resume our program was so beneficial because the children were outside with the program
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:42,016	| serial-s03-e08 |	If we were to have relied on just the staff I would not have failsafe
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:44,576	| serial-s03-e08 |	So the children
EDL	00:37:45,344	00:37:48,160	| serial-s03-e08 |	I wanted to speak to other kids who didn't odys
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:52,512	| serial-s03-e08 |	Juneau weather Joshua situation was real and whether it was common knowledge
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:55,328	| serial-s03-e08 |	It was me it was crazy I don't know
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:01,472	| serial-s03-e08 |	Is that
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:03,520	| serial-s03-e08 |	This is Malik he's 18
EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:05,568	| serial-s03-e08 |	Music Cuyahoga Hills with Joshua
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:07,104	| serial-s03-e08 |	He's an adult prison now
EDL	00:38:07,872	00:38:10,688	| serial-s03-e08 |	Blake said he saw Joshua get jumped multiple times
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:12,480	| serial-s03-e08 |	I feel bad for me
EDL	00:38:16,576	00:38:19,392	| serial-s03-e08 |	I got Malik name from a former staff member
EDL	00:38:19,392	00:38:23,488	| serial-s03-e08 |	It suggested he might be a good person to talk to you about what life was like at Cuyahoga Hills
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:27,840	| serial-s03-e08 |	She giving me a couple of names of remarkably Frank former ody us kids
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:32,960	| serial-s03-e08 |	She didn't know Joshua and she definitely didn't know that Malik is actually Joshua's cousin
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:37,056	| serial-s03-e08 |	If you overlay Cleveland and odys you see a lot of coincidence
EDL	00:38:37,056	00:38:37,824	| serial-s03-e08 |	Just like this
EDL	00:38:37,824	00:38:38,848	| serial-s03-e08 |	It's a pretty small world
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:43,968	| serial-s03-e08 |	Malik told me Joshua had it worse than anyone he'd seen come through Cuyahoga Hills
EDL	00:38:44,480	00:38:48,832	| serial-s03-e08 |	He said he himself had been high up in the heartless felons when all this was going on
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:50,112	| serial-s03-e08 |	He loves his cousin
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:51,136	| serial-s03-e08 |	They stuck up for him
EDL	00:39:00,608	00:39:03,168	| serial-s03-e08 |	So I went in and did Shannon like
EDL	00:39:07,520	00:39:12,384	| serial-s03-e08 |	He had words with a couple of the guys he said ask them to cool it
EDL	00:39:12,896	00:39:15,968	| serial-s03-e08 |	Did you personally get any blowback of Life why are you friends
EDL	00:39:16,480	00:39:20,320	| serial-s03-e08 |	Scatter yru
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:24,160	| serial-s03-e08 |	Heartless felons started to turn against Malik
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:25,440	| serial-s03-e08 |	Sergeant steel from him he said
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:30,048	| serial-s03-e08 |	One night when he was sleeping someone hit a leak in the face with a combination lock
EDL	00:39:30,048	00:39:31,072	| serial-s03-e08 |	Between the eyebrows
EDL	00:39:31,584	00:39:32,352	| serial-s03-e08 |	You need stitches
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:36,192	| serial-s03-e08 |	I talked to another guy named Leo from Toledo
EDL	00:39:36,192	00:39:38,496	| serial-s03-e08 |	Who did at Cuyahoga Hills at the same time as Joshua
EDL	00:39:39,008	00:39:41,056	| serial-s03-e08 |	Remember the assault in the school
EDL	00:39:41,056	00:39:42,336	| serial-s03-e08 |	When Joshua woke up in the ambulance
EDL	00:39:43,104	00:39:44,896	| serial-s03-e08 |	Somebody laughing hard
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:46,176	| serial-s03-e08 |	Copt means hit
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:48,480	| serial-s03-e08 |	It was a big dog opossum
EDL	00:39:49,248	00:39:52,320	| serial-s03-e08 |	He went to sleep but he hit his face on the concrete wall
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:56,160	| serial-s03-e08 |	Caesar
EDL	00:39:57,184	00:40:01,024	| serial-s03-e08 |	My whole face is swollen and had went to the hospital for that
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:05,888	| serial-s03-e08 |	Leah said it was because where it had gone around Cuyahoga Hills the Joshua with a snitch
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:09,728	| serial-s03-e08 |	She was giving a prison staff information about the heartless felons
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:11,008	| serial-s03-e08 |	Family
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:12,288	| serial-s03-e08 |	Yeah
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:15,616	| serial-s03-e08 |	You know a lot of stuff about the time and he was just telling her a lot
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:16,896	| serial-s03-e08 |	He was on
EDL	00:40:18,688	00:40:20,480	| serial-s03-e08 |	Trying to get a better 10% or something
EDL	00:40:21,248	00:40:24,064	| serial-s03-e08 |	Getting a lot of people asking about his name
EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:25,600	| serial-s03-e08 |	Okay
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:32,512	| serial-s03-e08 |	When you heard like all the others guys a snack or did you have any feeling about that personally one way or another
EDL	00:40:32,512	00:40:35,840	| serial-s03-e08 |	It's what he deserves
EDL	00:40:41,472	00:40:43,776	| serial-s03-e08 |	I was heavily involved in there
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:47,616	| serial-s03-e08 |	You were
EDL	00:40:48,128	00:40:51,456	| serial-s03-e08 |	Snitching on me
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:54,528	| serial-s03-e08 |	Okay
EDL	00:40:55,296	00:40:59,904	| serial-s03-e08 |	So you did you know this like this hit on him was going to happen or no
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:01,952	| serial-s03-e08 |	Yeah I know
EDL	00:41:02,720	00:41:05,792	| serial-s03-e08 |	Are you now okay can I ask you did you order it
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:07,584	| serial-s03-e08 |	I like talking to the man who ordered it
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:15,776	| serial-s03-e08 |	Yeah
EDL	00:41:17,568	00:41:21,664	| serial-s03-e08 |	At the time Leo said he was in charge of a section of the gang called YF
EDL	00:41:21,664	00:41:22,432	| serial-s03-e08 |	Young felons
EDL	00:41:22,944	00:41:24,736	| serial-s03-e08 |	So he called the hit on Joshua
EDL	00:41:25,504	00:41:26,272	| serial-s03-e08 |	Coincidence
EDL	00:41:27,040	00:41:28,320	| serial-s03-e08 |	He later become The Godfather
EDL	00:41:29,600	00:41:32,672	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua said he wasn't telling on the heartless felons at Cuyahoga Hills
EDL	00:41:32,672	00:41:35,232	| serial-s03-e08 |	But they were conflating his past cooperation
EDL	00:41:35,232	00:41:35,744	| serial-s03-e08 |	The present
EDL	00:41:36,512	00:41:37,536	| serial-s03-e08 |	Regardless
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:40,352	| serial-s03-e08 |	Leo said he was mostly hearing about Joshua
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:40,864	| serial-s03-e08 |	From the guards
EDL	00:41:41,632	00:41:43,424	| serial-s03-e08 |	Black Panther
EDL	00:41:44,192	00:41:46,496	| serial-s03-e08 |	I found out that he was on snitching
EDL	00:41:48,032	00:41:50,592	| serial-s03-e08 |	For telling you about him
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:41:58,527	| serial-s03-e08 |	In Cuyahoga Hills a kite is how you get a message to the office
EDL	00:41:59,039	00:42:02,367	| serial-s03-e08 |	Operation
EDL	00:42:03,135	00:42:04,927	| serial-s03-e08 |	And Annika superintendent
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:19,519	| serial-s03-e08 |	Staff was informing on Joshua Leo says to the most dangerous people in the prison
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:20,799	| serial-s03-e08 |	Him
EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:21,823	| serial-s03-e08 |	Leo
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:25,919	| serial-s03-e08 |	And his guys
EDL	00:42:33,599	00:42:38,975	| serial-s03-e08 |	I spoke to a couple of other former and current odys units from different facilities
EDL	00:42:39,487	00:42:41,791	| serial-s03-e08 |	I also spoke to current and former guards
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:43,071	| serial-s03-e08 |	Not disgruntled
EDL	00:42:43,071	00:42:44,607	| serial-s03-e08 |	People who like their jobs
EDL	00:42:44,607	00:42:46,911	| serial-s03-e08 |	Also current and former odys Social Work
EDL	00:42:47,679	00:42:51,007	| serial-s03-e08 |	Mostly adults Pokemon background for fear of retaliation
EDL	00:42:51,775	00:42:53,055	| serial-s03-e08 |	What they described
EDL	00:42:53,055	00:42:54,335	| serial-s03-e08 |	Remind me of a black market
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:58,175	| serial-s03-e08 |	Is it the juvenile prisons have their own Subterranean economy
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:43:04,575	| serial-s03-e08 |	Sucking in both Youth and staff who trade-in favors power and also cash
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:10,975	| serial-s03-e08 |	Of course I know corruption exists and I know juvenile prisons in particular are prone to bullying in Tamil
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:14,815	| serial-s03-e08 |	But this was a system recently out from under consent decree
EDL	00:43:14,815	00:43:16,351	| serial-s03-e08 |	Metamorphosed
EDL	00:43:16,351	00:43:17,887	| serial-s03-e08 |	Ohio model
EDL	00:43:17,887	00:43:22,751	| serial-s03-e08 |	Who stated mission is not to punish but to habilitate Youth and Empower families and communities
EDL	00:43:23,519	00:43:28,895	| serial-s03-e08 |	Cuyahoga Hills has won a national award for how it treats the children in its care twice
EDL	00:43:29,407	00:43:30,175	| serial-s03-e08 |	And yet
EDL	00:43:30,175	00:43:32,223	| serial-s03-e08 |	Well I'm just going to run through some of what I learned
EDL	00:43:32,991	00:43:33,759	| serial-s03-e08 |	Take contraband
EDL	00:43:34,783	00:43:36,575	| serial-s03-e08 |	I interviewed a former guard
EDL	00:43:36,575	00:43:37,343	| serial-s03-e08 |	Edward Kennedy
EDL	00:43:37,855	00:43:40,159	| serial-s03-e08 |	Is the only guard who agreed to go on the record
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:41,951	| serial-s03-e08 |	Possibly because he's got nothing to lose
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:45,023	| serial-s03-e08 |	He lost his job already after he was charged with domestic
EDL	00:43:45,023	00:43:45,535	| serial-s03-e08 |	Silence
EDL	00:43:46,047	00:43:48,351	| serial-s03-e08 |	When we talked he was actually in prison
EDL	00:43:48,351	00:43:49,119	| serial-s03-e08 |	As a prisoner
EDL	00:43:49,631	00:43:51,679	| serial-s03-e08 |	Before that he worked the other side
EDL	00:43:51,679	00:43:52,447	| serial-s03-e08 |	Azaguard
EDL	00:43:52,447	00:43:53,215	| serial-s03-e08 |	The Cuyahoga Hills
EDL	00:43:53,983	00:43:55,775	| serial-s03-e08 |	They called him why Isis and odys
EDL	00:43:55,775	00:43:56,287	| serial-s03-e08 |	OSU special
EDL	00:43:57,055	00:43:59,359	| serial-s03-e08 |	Edward said guards bringing in contraband
EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:00,383	| serial-s03-e08 |	Yes
EDL	00:44:17,279	00:44:19,071	| serial-s03-e08 |	Everybody knew about it
EDL	00:44:19,071	00:44:22,399	| serial-s03-e08 |	The guy worked on one of the most unruly units Edward said
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:23,679	| serial-s03-e08 |	When he was on duty
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:25,215	| serial-s03-e08 |	Everyone was curiously chill
EDL	00:44:25,983	00:44:27,775	| serial-s03-e08 |	Edward said that guard ended up getting fired
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:33,151	| serial-s03-e08 |	Edward said he himself didn't bring anything in like that but he said kids did ask him to
EDL	00:44:33,663	00:44:36,479	| serial-s03-e08 |	We'll keep the unit under control if you bring in a cell phone
EDL	00:44:36,479	00:44:37,247	| serial-s03-e08 |	Are some weed
EDL	00:44:40,063	00:44:44,159	| serial-s03-e08 |	A lot of feels on hand a suggestion I deal with on this phone that type of situation
EDL	00:44:44,927	00:44:46,719	| serial-s03-e08 |	That's Malik Joshua's cousin
EDL	00:44:46,719	00:44:47,999	| serial-s03-e08 |	And quite the businessman
EDL	00:44:48,511	00:44:52,351	| serial-s03-e08 |	Who's bringing stuff into the North and South buildings he said with the help of guards
EDL	00:44:52,863	00:44:54,655	| serial-s03-e08 |	Two or three at any one time he said
EDL	00:44:55,167	00:44:57,471	| serial-s03-e08 |	They go pick up stuff from his people on the outside
EDL	00:44:57,983	00:44:59,519	| serial-s03-e08 |	Bring it back into Malik
EDL	00:44:59,519	00:45:00,031	| serial-s03-e08 |	Sell it
EDL	00:45:00,543	00:45:03,871	| serial-s03-e08 |	And for the guards this wasn't just about keeping the units calm
EDL	00:45:03,871	00:45:04,895	| serial-s03-e08 |	Was about making money
EDL	00:45:05,407	00:45:06,175	| serial-s03-e08 |	Lakewood pay them
EDL	00:45:06,943	00:45:08,223	| serial-s03-e08 |	And how much were they getting
EDL	00:45:12,831	00:45:17,951	| serial-s03-e08 |	Maybe it depends
EDL	00:45:17,951	00:45:19,999	| serial-s03-e08 |	707 interior
EDL	00:45:23,583	00:45:25,631	| serial-s03-e08 |	Oh my God that's funny
EDL	00:45:31,007	00:45:34,591	| serial-s03-e08 |	Oh my God how much does a cell phone go for it
EDL	00:45:43,039	00:45:45,343	| serial-s03-e08 |	So there's that much money moving around in there
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:52,511	| serial-s03-e08 |	The heartless felons
EDL	00:45:52,511	00:45:54,559	| serial-s03-e08 |	They're also called the family or the fam
EDL	00:45:55,071	00:45:56,351	| serial-s03-e08 |	Which is another meaning
EDL	00:45:56,351	00:45:57,631	| serial-s03-e08 |	Forever about money
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:46:01,983	| serial-s03-e08 |	Leo the former GF told me they take it seriously
EDL	00:46:01,983	00:46:03,007	| serial-s03-e08 |	You got to move product
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:10,175	| serial-s03-e08 |	Malik estimated there was anywhere from 7 to $10,000 in cash circulating at Cuyahoga Hills at any one time
EDL	00:46:10,687	00:46:17,087	| serial-s03-e08 |	Muscat sending money home sometimes through visitation by the time Malik left he said he'd sent home about 2500
EDL	00:46:17,087	00:46:19,391	| serial-s03-e08 |	Dollars and had about 900 on hand
EDL	00:46:20,159	00:46:25,023	| serial-s03-e08 |	The commodity running alongside and sometimes feeding into the Contraband Market
EDL	00:46:25,023	00:46:25,791	| serial-s03-e08 |	Is violence
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:32,191	| serial-s03-e08 |	Three guards I talked to one current to former the guards feel hamstrung sometimes
EDL	00:46:32,191	00:46:36,031	| serial-s03-e08 |	Because some of their best tools for controlling the kids were taken away by reforms
EDL	00:46:36,031	00:46:37,311	| serial-s03-e08 |	Certain physical restraint
EDL	00:46:37,823	00:46:38,335	| serial-s03-e08 |	Seclusion
EDL	00:46:39,103	00:46:43,199	| serial-s03-e08 |	I could even put kids to bed at 7 p.m. anymore could make them keep their hands behind their back
EDL	00:46:44,223	00:46:46,783	| serial-s03-e08 |	The kids can be violent the guards are outnumbered
EDL	00:46:46,783	00:46:49,343	| serial-s03-e08 |	You can't count on Swift backup from operations
EDL	00:46:49,343	00:46:50,879	| serial-s03-e08 |	There's a fight or riot
EDL	00:46:50,879	00:46:53,695	| serial-s03-e08 |	So yeah the guards will sometimes provoke kids
EDL	00:46:53,695	00:46:54,975	| serial-s03-e08 |	Tom Thumb or insult them
EDL	00:46:55,487	00:46:57,535	| serial-s03-e08 |	So that the kid will respond in kind
EDL	00:46:57,535	00:47:01,119	| serial-s03-e08 |	And then the guard has an excuse to shut them in their rooms and not have to deal with them
EDL	00:47:02,143	00:47:04,447	| serial-s03-e08 |	I talked to a former social worker named Casey hotels
EDL	00:47:05,215	00:47:06,751	| serial-s03-e08 |	I told me she saw that kind of thing a lot
EDL	00:47:07,775	00:47:09,823	| serial-s03-e08 |	Casey worked at the Cuyahoga County Detention Center
EDL	00:47:10,335	00:47:11,871	| serial-s03-e08 |	The therapist until last summer
EDL	00:47:12,639	00:47:14,943	| serial-s03-e08 |	The Detention Center isn't technically odys
EDL	00:47:15,455	00:47:17,759	| serial-s03-e08 |	But there's a lot of cross-pollination with odys
EDL	00:47:18,271	00:47:19,551	| serial-s03-e08 |	Especially with Cuyahoga Hills
EDL	00:47:20,063	00:47:21,599	| serial-s03-e08 |	Terms of staff and kids
EDL	00:47:21,599	00:47:22,367	| serial-s03-e08 |	And gang culture
EDL	00:47:23,135	00:47:25,951	| serial-s03-e08 |	Stafford Sharon's and

EDL	00:52:09,343	00:52:11,391	| serial-s03-e08 |	When former Indian River guard told me

EDL	00:52:54,655	00:53:00,031	| serial-s03-e08 |	Several social workers told me that they started to lose their own sense of what was normal what was ethical
EDL	00:53:00,799	00:53:04,895	| serial-s03-e08 |	It felt like the kids had no protection from abuse or from coercion

EDL	00:55:05,727	00:55:07,007	| serial-s03-e08 |	For Joshua's own protection
EDL	00:55:08,287	00:55:10,335	| serial-s03-e08 |	He felt safe fish on his unit
EDL	00:55:10,335	00:55:12,639	| serial-s03-e08 |	He said he was cool with most everybody Indie Delta
EDL	00:55:13,151	00:55:14,943	| serial-s03-e08 |	His hopes were set on early release
EDL	00:55:15,455	00:55:17,503	| serial-s03-e08 |	And then who knows maybe a lawsuit but
EDL	00:55:17,503	00:55:19,551	| serial-s03-e08 |	Early release was the main thing he wanted
EDL	00:55:20,831	00:55:22,879	| serial-s03-e08 |	I talked to Joshua every couple of days
EDL	00:55:22,879	00:55:24,159	| serial-s03-e08 |	Sometimes everyday
EDL	00:55:24,159	00:55:26,719	| serial-s03-e08 |	Early on he started describing what sounded like
EDL	00:55:26,719	00:55:28,255	| serial-s03-e08 |	An uptick in the usual chaos
EDL	00:55:29,279	00:55:30,559	| serial-s03-e08 |	Catholic holidays

EDL	00:55:46,687	00:55:53,087	| serial-s03-e08 |	Had yanked the door open and stormed the kids on D Delta trying to conquer

EDL	00:55:54,367	00:55:58,463	| serial-s03-e08 |	Because their unit wasn't joining HF wasn't submitting to HF

EDL	00:56:03,327	00:56:06,143	| serial-s03-e08 |	Do Delta had kids from Columbus and Cincinnati
EDL	00:56:06,143	00:56:09,727	| serial-s03-e08 |	Kids from those places if they're in a gang they tend to BHB

EDL	01:01:19,231	01:01:23,071	| serial-s03-e08 |	So they started calling odys and saying this is unacceptable
EDL	01:01:23,071	01:01:24,351	| serial-s03-e08 |	In January
EDL	01:01:24,351	01:01:26,911	| serial-s03-e08 |	Officials from odys came to a judge's meeting
EDL	01:01:27,423	01:01:31,775	| serial-s03-e08 |	And they were trying to explain why this was occurring
EDL	01:01:31,775	01:01:33,055	| serial-s03-e08 |	And
EDL	01:01:33,055	01:01:34,079	| serial-s03-e08 |	I was
EDL	01:01:34,079	01:01:40,223	| serial-s03-e08 |	Visibly distraught to say the least we're done Floyd put her hand on my arm and said
EDL	01:01:41,759	01:01:47,135	| serial-s03-e08 |	Where cuz what was the explanation like how do you say it was an isolated incident I'm like he is 37
EDL	01:01:47,135	01:01:53,535	| serial-s03-e08 |	1 Pages how isolated is this we you know I'm in the facility everyday and you know this doesn't really
EDL	01:01:53,535	01:01:54,559	| serial-s03-e08 |	Only happened on my
EDL	01:01:54,559	01:01:58,655	| serial-s03-e08 |	It's on Instagram what do you mean it doesn't happen so they were basically just kind of like
EDL	01:01:59,423	01:02:00,191	| serial-s03-e08 |	Whitewashing it
EDL	01:02:00,703	01:02:07,103	| serial-s03-e08 |	My biggest issue was you are not helping our community you take these Youth and you put them in here and they come out in there
EDL	01:02:07,103	01:02:10,175	| serial-s03-e08 |	And then you know actually they've no tray there no vacation
EDL	01:02:10,687	01:02:13,759	| serial-s03-e08 |	And they have no ability to act appropriately
EDL	01:02:14,271	01:02:16,831	| serial-s03-e08 |	So what what are we doing besides housing now
EDL	01:02:16,831	01:02:19,903	| serial-s03-e08 |	Anna in a facility where we're not teaching them anything
EDL	01:02:20,415	01:02:25,535	| serial-s03-e08 |	A few months after that meeting the assistant director of odys abruptly resigned
EDL	01:02:25,535	01:02:27,583	| serial-s03-e08 |	And Julie walburn took her place
EDL	01:02:28,095	01:02:34,495	| serial-s03-e08 |	As soon as she came on board she walked through the according to her she walks are all the facilities
EDL	01:02:34,495	01:02:36,543	| serial-s03-e08 |	She met with all of the the
EDL	01:02:36,543	01:02:38,591	| serial-s03-e08 |	Heads of each facility
EDL	01:02:38,591	01:02:39,871	| serial-s03-e08 |	And she said
EDL	01:02:39,871	01:02:46,015	| serial-s03-e08 |	And we're going to take back the facilities and we are going to ensure that the Jews are not only safe because there was a lot of fighting
EDL	01:02:46,527	01:02:50,623	| serial-s03-e08 |	But the ones that are the Bad actors are going to be removed
EDL	01:03:02,399	01:03:03,423	| serial-s03-e08 |	In mid-june
EDL	01:03:03,423	01:03:06,239	| serial-s03-e08 |	Joshua told me that the superintendent of Indian River
EDL	01:03:06,239	01:03:07,519	| serial-s03-e08 |	I gather the syo
EDL	01:03:08,031	01:03:10,335	| serial-s03-e08 |	The kids who had adult time attached to their sentences
EDL	01:03:10,847	01:03:12,895	| serial-s03-e08 |	I could kick in if they didn't do well in juvenile
EDL	01:03:13,919	01:03:16,991	| serial-s03-e08 |	Odys hadn't been invoking Goose adult sentences
EDL	01:03:16,991	01:03:19,039	| serial-s03-e08 |	But now the superintendent told them
EDL	01:03:19,039	01:03:20,063	| serial-s03-e08 |	New sheriff in town
EDL	01:03:20,575	01:03:23,391	| serial-s03-e08 |	We now have a zero-tolerance policy for syo
