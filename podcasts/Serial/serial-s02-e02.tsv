EDL	00:00:24,832	00:00:27,392	| serial-s02-e02 |	Before we get on with episode 2 some news
EDL	00:00:27,392	00:00:31,744	| serial-s02-e02 |	A few days ago the Army announced that it will take Bo Bergdahl charges to court-martial
EDL	00:00:31,744	00:00:32,768	| serial-s02-e02 |	The trial basically
EDL	00:00:33,536	00:00:35,072	| serial-s02-e02 |	He's charged with two crimes
EDL	00:00:35,072	00:00:37,888	| serial-s02-e02 |	Desertion and something called misbehavior before the enemy
EDL	00:00:38,400	00:00:40,960	| serial-s02-e02 |	That second one it's not used very often
EDL	00:00:40,960	00:00:43,264	| serial-s02-e02 |	They carries the possibility of a life sentence
EDL	00:00:43,264	00:00:45,056	| serial-s02-e02 |	Which doesn't seem likely that would happen
EDL	00:00:45,568	00:00:46,592	| serial-s02-e02 |	I be so extreme
EDL	00:00:47,104	00:00:50,176	| serial-s02-e02 |	What does mean both could face some amount of prison time if he's convicted
EDL	00:00:51,456	00:00:57,344	| serial-s02-e02 |	The Army's decision to go to court-martial It's not that it's so surprising I mean this is always a strong possibility
EDL	00:00:57,344	00:01:00,160	| serial-s02-e02 |	Interested for a lot of people watching those case
EDL	00:01:00,160	00:01:01,440	| serial-s02-e02 |	It's been hard to handicap
EDL	00:01:02,208	00:01:06,816	| serial-s02-e02 |	All outward signs of pointed to an army that is of two minds about how to deal with what bow did
EDL	00:01:07,328	00:01:08,352	| serial-s02-e02 |	Whether to throw the book at
EDL	00:01:09,120	00:01:12,448	| serial-s02-e02 |	Or whether to say okay yes he screwed up in a huge way
EDL	00:01:13,728	00:01:15,008	| serial-s02-e02 |	The Taliban enough is enough
EDL	00:01:16,032	00:01:19,360	| serial-s02-e02 |	On the one hand the Army level pretty severe charges against Bo
EDL	00:01:19,872	00:01:22,432	| serial-s02-e02 |	But that in a military Hearing in September
EDL	00:01:22,432	00:01:26,784	| serial-s02-e02 |	The two-star general in charge of investigating those case a man named Kenneth doll
EDL	00:01:26,784	00:01:33,184	| serial-s02-e02 |	Which of the 371 page statement from Beau who assemble the 22 person team who coordinated with twins

EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:40,352	| serial-s02-e02 |	He said he believed that boat told him the truth about why he did what he did
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:41,888	| serial-s02-e02 |	The boat was remorseful
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:43,424	| serial-s02-e02 |	Taobao recognizes quotes
EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:46,240	| serial-s02-e02 |	That he was young and naive and inexperienced unquote
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:49,568	| serial-s02-e02 |	When asked on the stand where he thought they should go to jail
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:53,408	| serial-s02-e02 |	Major General doll said quote I think it would be inappropriate on quote
EDL	00:01:54,688	00:01:58,528	| serial-s02-e02 |	Likewise the officer in charge of that hearing Lieutenant Colonel mark visger
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:02:01,088	| serial-s02-e02 |	In his report on what to do about the charges
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:04,672	| serial-s02-e02 |	Apparently recommended a lesser proceeding called a special court-martial
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:05,952	| serial-s02-e02 |	More like a misdemeanor trial
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:07,744	| serial-s02-e02 |	He also recommended
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:08,512	| serial-s02-e02 |	No confinement
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:15,680	| serial-s02-e02 |	In response to which Senator John McCain arguably our country's most powerful former poww he was held for 5

EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:24,128	| serial-s02-e02 |	Case
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:30,016	| serial-s02-e02 |	And then this week the announcement that the Army will pursue the charges in the most serious way possible
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:31,552	| serial-s02-e02 |	A general court-martial
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:36,672	| serial-s02-e02 |	It's almost as if those military officials who come into close contact with bow
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:37,696	| serial-s02-e02 |	Are ready to forgive him
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:41,280	| serial-s02-e02 |	Well the Army as an institution continues to be furious
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:46,144	| serial-s02-e02 |	Few months ago filmmaker Mark Ball was talking about on the phone
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:48,704	| serial-s02-e02 |	And they were discussing the possibility of a plea deal
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:50,496	| serial-s02-e02 |	The weather Bellwood taken offer
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:54,336	| serial-s02-e02 |	First one to three years in prison in exchange for pleading guilty
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:56,640	| serial-s02-e02 |	I didn't think you would
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:59,200	| serial-s02-e02 |	Even though the basic facts of the case aren't in dispute
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:02,272	| serial-s02-e02 |	Admits he walked away from his post of his own volition
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:07,648	| serial-s02-e02 |	I told Mark he wear that if he took some plea offer he'd never get to explain himself
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:09,440	| serial-s02-e02 |	And people would continue to hate him
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:11,232	| serial-s02-e02 |	And it's true a lot of people hate him
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:14,304	| serial-s02-e02 |	Without ever fully understanding his reasons for doing what he did
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:15,840	| serial-s02-e02 |	That was his fear
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:17,120	| serial-s02-e02 |	After all of this

EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:35,071	| serial-s02-e02 |	And we told him that's we are please I mean
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:42,239	| serial-s02-e02 |	American normally working with the local militia which is not necessarily to be wear uniform
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:43,519	| serial-s02-e02 |	Right
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:49,151	| serial-s02-e02 |	And you told in police and he he look at us and then he jumped
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:50,175	| serial-s02-e02 |	Behind our bike
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:55,551	| serial-s02-e02 |	So is hello saying that we said oh we're local police
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:09:01,951	| serial-s02-e02 |	Set it come with us or whatever and Bergdahl seem to believe that and think he was maybe in safe hands
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:08,351	| serial-s02-e02 |	Bakuchiol told him that this guy you don't understand his language versus asking about
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:14,495	| serial-s02-e02 |	Police in Kabul was asking for something else or something or
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:19,615	| serial-s02-e02 |	And that's why they came and he said he was
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:25,759	| serial-s02-e02 |	And now why dress and sandals and he had something in his
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:29,087	| serial-s02-e02 |	Pocket he said there was a pistol
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:32,415	| serial-s02-e02 |	Knife or something
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:34,463	| serial-s02-e02 |	I don't know really exactly okay
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:37,791	| serial-s02-e02 |	Does coochie tensing comes up in various ways
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:42,399	| serial-s02-e02 |	The Taliban say either but walked into a couch eaten or near a 10
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:45,471	| serial-s02-e02 |	The Americans got some Intel the time to the same effect
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:48,287	| serial-s02-e02 |	And that Nomads tipped off the Taliban
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:52,127	| serial-s02-e02 |	For his part Bo says he was never in a coochie time
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:55,967	| serial-s02-e02 |	He says he was out in the open when armed man wrote up on motorcycles and grabbed him
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:10:00,063	| serial-s02-e02 |	This is one of those discrepancies and there will be others
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:01,855	| serial-s02-e02 |	Where I feel like it's worth mentioning
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:05,951	| serial-s02-e02 |	Because if both did walk into a Gucci tennis Halala saying
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:08,767	| serial-s02-e02 |	Well that makes his own explanation sound less solid
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:13,631	| serial-s02-e02 |	Maybe he wasn't really trying to cause a dust one by running from Opie Mastiff ashiana
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:15,423	| serial-s02-e02 |	Maybe he was simply deserting
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:20,287	| serial-s02-e02 |	But I also can't tell how much weight I should really give this coochie tent story
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:21,567	| serial-s02-e02 |	Because
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:23,103	| serial-s02-e02 |	The Taliban bring up all kinds of her
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:26,687	| serial-s02-e02 |	Like the bow is in the village to meet up with a woman
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:27,967	| serial-s02-e02 |	He was looking for drugs
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:31,807	| serial-s02-e02 |	Rumors pretty much anyone who's ever met Beau can easily dismiss
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:34,623	| serial-s02-e02 |	And maybe the truth is somewhere in between
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:36,415	| serial-s02-e02 |	It's possible bow was near
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:37,183	| serial-s02-e02 |	Kuji cam
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:38,463	| serial-s02-e02 |	And just didn't know it
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:42,303	| serial-s02-e02 |	And that the Nomad saw him out in the open and alerted the Taliban
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:43,583	| serial-s02-e02 |	But was never the wiser
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:46,655	| serial-s02-e02 |	Probably we're not going to get to the bottom of it
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:52,799	| serial-s02-e02 |	Because we can't fact check the stories these guys told Sammy we can't be sure everything they told him is true
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:56,639	| serial-s02-e02 |	And the details of what happened do shift around depending on who Sammy's talking to
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:59,199	| serial-s02-e02 |	Which isn't unusual in any kind of reporting
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:02,527	| serial-s02-e02 |	What I can say is that the overall chain of events
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:05,087	| serial-s02-e02 |	The major plot points that the Taliban describe
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:07,135	| serial-s02-e02 |	Are pretty consistent person to person
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:14,047	| serial-s02-e02 |	And Sammy's interviews with these guys they don't seem that interested in pinning down exactly how both ended up in or near us
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:16,863	| serial-s02-e02 |	More what they want to talk about
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:19,167	| serial-s02-e02 |	Is how incredible it was that it happened at all
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:23,007	| serial-s02-e02 |	Doraemon and hello to everyone involved this is just
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:24,543	| serial-s02-e02 |	Kikuchi's
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:25,055	| serial-s02-e02 |	Nomad
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:28,639	| serial-s02-e02 |	People they consider unsophisticated and uneducated
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:29,663	| serial-s02-e02 |	Snag this Westerner
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:32,223	| serial-s02-e02 |	And not just any Westerner but an American
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:35,807	| serial-s02-e02 |	An enemy of the Koran of the pashtun people
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:37,343	| serial-s02-e02 |	And not just any American
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:37,855	| serial-s02-e02 |	Soldier
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:42,975	| serial-s02-e02 |	Reminder the whole thing the way they got him and just being up close with your adversary like that
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:45,791	| serial-s02-e02 |	It was one of those lifetime strange experiences
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:52,191	| serial-s02-e02 |	And it came to into a letter
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:54,239	| serial-s02-e02 |	Akai CD so easily

EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:11,647	| serial-s02-e02 |	Sammy's interviews they use his expression
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:13,439	| serial-s02-e02 |	They call BOA ready-made loaf
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:14,719	| serial-s02-e02 |	A gift from God
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:17,535	| serial-s02-e02 |	I felt so lucky that both came to them

EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:29,567	| serial-s02-e02 |	But they subdued him
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:32,895	| serial-s02-e02 |	One of their bikes they took him back to the mosque
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:37,247	| serial-s02-e02 |	Boaz again resisting throwing punches
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:39,039	| serial-s02-e02 |	Or maybe his captors were beating him up

EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:46,367	| serial-s02-e02 |	Spoke was weird
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:52,255	| serial-s02-e02 |	His eyes were blue which Sammy says it's somewhat suspicious in Afghanistan there's a saying that you should keep away from blue-eyed
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:52,767	| serial-s02-e02 |	People
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:57,119	| serial-s02-e02 |	Animas Colossus people had gathered to discuss what to do with them
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:59,423	| serial-s02-e02 |	I sent his notes from his interviews
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:03,519	| serial-s02-e02 |	Is one part Halal talks about how bow was sitting in a dark corner of the mosque
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:06,079	| serial-s02-e02 |	And another Taliban fighter said to him quote
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:09,919	| serial-s02-e02 |	You look like a small cat baby with shining blue eyes
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:14,527	| serial-s02-e02 |	I think this is something
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:15,551	| serial-s02-e02 |	Explaining somebody weakness
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:18,367	| serial-s02-e02 |	But I think
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:22,207	| serial-s02-e02 |	I think he said there was a he was very kind of weak
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:23,231	| serial-s02-e02 |	He was not like a

EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:33,983	| serial-s02-e02 |	Yeah I'm just looking in a note that you wrote that says Bergdahl was weak and I think brainless
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:40,895	| serial-s02-e02 |	Yeah yeah what does he mean by that was the stupid that's why he entertained their hands
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:50,879	| serial-s02-e02 |	Okay somebody coming and jumping anywhere bike
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:53,439	| serial-s02-e02 |	Was he scared I did he say
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:59,071	| serial-s02-e02 |	When he was crying sometime he was
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:05,983	| serial-s02-e02 |	Smiling and without what's happened to this guy but X he was fired into anybody giving water it was not.
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:06,751	| serial-s02-e02 |	Drinking
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:12,895	| serial-s02-e02 |	He said he was like a Buddha Buddha Buddha Afghanistan Bamiyan Buddha statue
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:17,503	| serial-s02-e02 |	So I guess at Sunoco
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:19,295	| serial-s02-e02 |	What's the weather's been going out on him
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:21,599	| serial-s02-e02 |	Are we thought he's drunk
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:24,927	| serial-s02-e02 |	Yeah apparently deep

EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:40,031	| serial-s02-e02 |	Apparently they tend to think all westerners are drunk
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:54,111	| serial-s02-e02 |	Do I have to be extremely careful with my
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:58,975	| serial-s02-e02 |	Yeah

EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:04,607	| serial-s02-e02 |	Only rational
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:05,119	| serial-s02-e02 |	Be scared
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:09,215	| serial-s02-e02 |	When the Taliban guys explain to Sami how they kidnapped bow
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:12,031	| serial-s02-e02 |	It kind of wax romantic sometimes or crack jokes
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:15,103	| serial-s02-e02 |	There's a swashbuckling quality to Sammy's notes from his interviews
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:17,919	| serial-s02-e02 |	But then you remember Bo himself
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:19,711	| serial-s02-e02 |	Is completely at their Mercy

EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:52,383	| serial-s02-e02 |	I'm trying to get guys who barely speak English understand what I'm saying
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:59,551	| serial-s02-e02 |	Because they were
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:07,743	| serial-s02-e02 |	Disrespectful
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:12,607	| serial-s02-e02 |	So I came up with rude and they sing understand
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:16,959	| serial-s02-e02 |	Moses his memories from that time or sort of thin
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:19,007	| serial-s02-e02 |	In large part because he says he was blindfolded
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:22,591	| serial-s02-e02 |	It was focused on what was happening to him minute-to-minute
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:25,151	| serial-s02-e02 |	Trying to comprehend his circumstances
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:27,199	| serial-s02-e02 |	How you could possibly reverse them
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:29,759	| serial-s02-e02 |	They rode me around from a couple different places
EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:30,271	| serial-s02-e02 |	Funny
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:32,319	| serial-s02-e02 |	It got me to
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:33,855	| serial-s02-e02 |	Small village
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:36,415	| serial-s02-e02 |	You pull me off this
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:37,695	| serial-s02-e02 |	Off the motorcycle
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:40,255	| serial-s02-e02 |	Stop being out on the ground then
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:41,535	| serial-s02-e02 |	Older guys
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:43,583	| serial-s02-e02 |	Came up I guess
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:48,447	| serial-s02-e02 |	She doesn't look like a younger brother is like younger buddy or something like that
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:53,055	| serial-s02-e02 |	Yeah it is cell phone on me like taking a video of me and
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:54,079	| serial-s02-e02 |	His body was like
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:57,151	| serial-s02-e02 |	Scary sitting off to sign you like you know
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:18:59,967	| serial-s02-e02 |	American
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:02,015	| serial-s02-e02 |	And I just shook my head
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:04,319	| serial-s02-e02 |	And then he's fattening
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:09,695	| serial-s02-e02 |	And then I said that a few times all they wanted
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:14,047	| serial-s02-e02 |	Again
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:18,655	| serial-s02-e02 |	Well after they're done then they put the blindfold back on in a throw blanket over my head
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:20,447	| serial-s02-e02 |	And then
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:20,959	| serial-s02-e02 |	Safe
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:26,079	| serial-s02-e02 |	I don't know where that went but then like little kids started throwing rocks at me
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:27,615	| serial-s02-e02 |	Send up
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:31,967	| serial-s02-e02 |	Kind of pretended there like Flinch from
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:35,039	| serial-s02-e02 |	On the Rocks hitting head which kind of loud me to shift my weight
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:36,831	| serial-s02-e02 |	Sounds like trying to
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:40,671	| serial-s02-e02 |	Get my hands from behind my back and pull them around
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:44,511	| serial-s02-e02 |	It so I could get them in front of me
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:46,047	| serial-s02-e02 |	That didn't work
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:49,375	| serial-s02-e02 |	So then go try to lean forward so he could use his knee to move
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:50,655	| serial-s02-e02 |	The cloth off of his face
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:53,215	| serial-s02-e02 |	I kinda got it to point where
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:56,543	| serial-s02-e02 |	Seems like half off my left eye
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:57,055	| serial-s02-e02 |	Almost
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:58,847	| serial-s02-e02 |	May I start a blanket on my head
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:04,991	| serial-s02-e02 |	Nobody was really stopping and I didn't hear any voices I just like you
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:06,271	| serial-s02-e02 |	This is the best day
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:08,575	| serial-s02-e02 |	That is probably going to get so I just
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:09,855	| serial-s02-e02 |	Set up
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:10,367	| serial-s02-e02 |	Colton
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:14,975	| serial-s02-e02 |	I didn't get more than maybe 20 or 30 feet before he was tackled
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:16,767	| serial-s02-e02 |	I want felt like the entire Village
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:18,815	| serial-s02-e02 |	I was day one of his captivity
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:27,263	| serial-s02-e02 |	Buy 2009 and Afghanistan the US forces and the Taliban have been fighting for 7 years
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:30,847	| serial-s02-e02 |	In all that time there's never been a situation like this
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:32,895	| serial-s02-e02 |	American Soldier captured
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:34,431	| serial-s02-e02 |	It was a new kind of crisis
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:37,759	| serial-s02-e02 |	Eastside also knew who they were dealing with
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:40,063	| serial-s02-e02 |	They could anticipate what each other's moves would be
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:46,463	| serial-s02-e02 |	In his first few days bus knew that whoever had but would be moving him constantly
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:49,023	| serial-s02-e02 |	Cuz the longer you stay in one place the more likely you are to get caught
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:55,935	| serial-s02-e02 |	They also knew that the Taliban goal would be to get BO2 a hideout in the tribal region of Western Pakistan
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:57,983	| serial-s02-e02 |	Because Pakistan is like home base
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:21:00,543	| serial-s02-e02 |	Or to put it in Tom and Jerry terms
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:03,871	| serial-s02-e02 |	Pakistan is a hole in the baseboard where Tom cannot go
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:09,247	| serial-s02-e02 |	Pakistan is a Sovereign Nation are reported Ally we are not at war with Pakistan
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:11,807	| serial-s02-e02 |	Pakistan we can't do much about it
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:16,928	| serial-s02-e02 |	In Afghanistan US forces can go anywhere they want can do almost anything they want
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:21,024	| serial-s02-e02 |	Pakistan is much much harder for the US military to operate
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:24,864	| serial-s02-e02 |	Here's the other thing that happens once bogus to Pakistan
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:27,168	| serial-s02-e02 |	She becomes much more valuable
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:29,984	| serial-s02-e02 |	Because his captors don't have to get rid of him in a hurry
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:31,776	| serial-s02-e02 |	They can take their sweet time
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:33,056	| serial-s02-e02 |	Making the deal they want to make
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:38,176	| serial-s02-e02 |	Of course the Taliban knew that the US knew they had for Pakistan
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:40,480	| serial-s02-e02 |	The Taliban did the opposite
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:43,808	| serial-s02-e02 |	Instead of heading straight East to the Pakistan border
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:45,856	| serial-s02-e02 |	The Taliban guy Sammy talk to you said
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:47,392	| serial-s02-e02 |	They first took Bo West
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:48,416	| serial-s02-e02 |	The ghazni province
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:50,208	| serial-s02-e02 |	When was Akira mindless
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:58,400	| serial-s02-e02 |	Yeah, heading meal that should move in contact with Ramon
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:21:59,680	| serial-s02-e02 |	Earlier for page one
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:05,824	| serial-s02-e02 |	For this interview Sammy had a car pick Ramon up and they talk to me on a burner cell phone from inside the car
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:08,640	| serial-s02-e02 |	Which is parked in a residential neighborhood known to be fairly safe
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:15,040	| serial-s02-e02 |	Yeah
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:18,368	| serial-s02-e02 |	The call dropped about a half-dozen times during our interview
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:24,000	| serial-s02-e02 |	Michigan Rahman told me by the time bird dog came to him the plan was already set
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:27,328	| serial-s02-e02 |	Italian Commander named Kyrie Ismael sulaimon.
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:29,120	| serial-s02-e02 |	Taken charge of bow
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:32,704	| serial-s02-e02 |	And arrange to deliver him to a group known as a haqqani network
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:33,472	| serial-s02-e02 |	In Pakistan
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:37,056	| serial-s02-e02 |	In the meantime we should give her mom's orders were to
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:40,384	| serial-s02-e02 |	Keep both alive and out of sight for a couple of days and nights
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:43,968	| serial-s02-e02 |	Until the pressure on the border East a little and they could sneak bow across
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:49,344	| serial-s02-e02 |	By the time Ramon took charge of the motorcycle Convoy about eight people he said
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:54,976	| serial-s02-e02 |	Was obvious to the Taliban that US forces for pouring into Eastern Afghanistan to search for Bo
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:07,776	| serial-s02-e02 |	Endocrine surgeon else who that is playing today
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:14,176	| serial-s02-e02 |	And that's that was a reason you know we were moving around and I would buy hours
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:16,224	| serial-s02-e02 |	Changing location and we were left
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:18,528	| serial-s02-e02 |	Even though I'm never changing
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:22,880	| serial-s02-e02 |	Barbie dolls dress and maybe would have even if we were changing our address
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:24,160	| serial-s02-e02 |	FanDuel
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:26,720	| serial-s02-e02 |	At one point a we came
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:33,632	| serial-s02-e02 |	Hey Anna close contact with American Ground Forces by 500 while bulldog
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:34,912	| serial-s02-e02 |	Was with us
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:42,848	| serial-s02-e02 |	Halal told Sammy that at one point his Convoy had come within a kilometer of fob sharana or bozone.
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:43,872	| serial-s02-e02 |	Italian was based
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:48,224	| serial-s02-e02 |	But even if bowhead wanted to scream or make a commotion he couldn't have
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:49,760	| serial-s02-e02 |	His hands were tied
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:52,832	| serial-s02-e02 |	Add a large cloth wrapped around his head
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:56,160	| serial-s02-e02 |	Partly to disguise them but probably just to keep the dust off his face
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:57,440	| serial-s02-e02 |	They all wear them against the Dust
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:24:02,560	| serial-s02-e02 |	These were probably the most stressful two days of any Mission he'd ever done
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:07,936	| serial-s02-e02 |	Korea smile stayed in constant contact with his guy in Pakistan from the haqqani network
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:12,544	| serial-s02-e02 |	Mom said they used fake names and locations of the walkie talkies to confuse the Americans
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:14,592	| serial-s02-e02 |	That US forces tracked him anyway
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:16,384	| serial-s02-e02 |	Attleboro occasions
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:20,224	| serial-s02-e02 |	Accu we stayed in at my location
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:24,064	| serial-s02-e02 |	And then there were three hours later
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:25,600	| serial-s02-e02 |	American forces
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:29,952	| serial-s02-e02 |	Team and add to that place to that house and search that has
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:35,072	| serial-s02-e02 |	By this time of course word has spread all over the region that a US Soldier had gone missing
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:37,632	| serial-s02-e02 |	The military air drop leaflets saying quote
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:41,472	| serial-s02-e02 |	One of our American guests is missing and give a phone number to call
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:45,568	| serial-s02-e02 |	Another one handed out about two weeks after bow disappeared was less gentle
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:47,872	| serial-s02-e02 |	It should arm Western forces kicking in a door
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:53,248	| serial-s02-e02 |	News report translator the text as quote if you do not free the American Soldier you will be targeted
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:55,296	| serial-s02-e02 |	The Army claimed the leaflets
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:56,576	| serial-s02-e02 |	Hunted not targeted
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:58,624	| serial-s02-e02 |	Which actually sounds scarier to me
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:00,672	| serial-s02-e02 |	They also distributed chocolate
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:06,816	| serial-s02-e02 |	Sami Yusuf say interviewed some of the people who lived in or near mustache run at the time and they remember the Chaka
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:08,096	| serial-s02-e02 |	Wrapped in shiny paper
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:10,144	| serial-s02-e02 |	They also remember helicopter
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:11,424	| serial-s02-e02 |	There's all over the place
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:13,728	| serial-s02-e02 |	And that the Americans were saying bergdahl's name
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:16,032	| serial-s02-e02 |	Or at least a word that had a bee sound in it

EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:19,776	| serial-s02-e02 |	Then a few hours later there's this intercept

EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:41,536	| serial-s02-e02 |	He said the intensity of the surge did suggest bow with a big shot
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:45,376	| serial-s02-e02 |	Why would they put all that effort and money into looking for him if he wasn't important
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:49,472	| serial-s02-e02 |	Ramon said he'd heard foreign soldiers were sometimes trained in martial arts

EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:06,368	| serial-s02-e02 |	And then because

EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:33,248	| serial-s02-e02 |	I didn't think of him as innocent
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:36,576	| serial-s02-e02 |	From his point of view but was like all US soldiers

EDL	00:28:01,408	00:28:04,992	| serial-s02-e02 |	And so the fact that Bo was labeled a guest in the situation
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:07,040	| serial-s02-e02 |	Made it clear to the lower down guys
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:10,368	| serial-s02-e02 |	Is under Korea Smiles command that they're not allowed to kill him

EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:29,696	| serial-s02-e02 |	It's a boy saying that scene in American low crawling on the ground
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:32,000	| serial-s02-e02 |	Or nearly fainting from dehydration
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:35,072	| serial-s02-e02 |	Couple of ports noted that they were also giving out candy to the kids
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:37,376	| serial-s02-e02 |	In one instance the kid got some Pop-Tarts
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:39,424	| serial-s02-e02 |	Which is notable
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:46,592	| serial-s02-e02 |	An army report on beau's disappearance suggests maybe it was our initial search maybe even this first Patrol

EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:52,480	| serial-s02-e02 |	But the soldiers handing out candy and asking these questions tip the kids off
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:54,528	| serial-s02-e02 |	And ultimately the adults
EDL	00:32:54,528	00:32:56,064	| serial-s02-e02 |	And then the Taliban
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:57,600	| serial-s02-e02 |	An American was missing
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:59,392	| serial-s02-e02 |	And so they went out looking for him and grabbed him
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:03,488	| serial-s02-e02 |	Which supports what Beau says that the Taliban rode right up to him on motorbike
EDL	00:33:06,560	00:33:08,864	| serial-s02-e02 |	Who says he hadn't told anyone what he plan to do
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:10,656	| serial-s02-e02 |	So no one in his unit or is

EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:27,808	| serial-s02-e02 |	And then that's where he
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:28,320	| serial-s02-e02 |	Was now

EDL	00:39:15,968	00:39:18,784	| serial-s02-e02 |	Screwing around on small roads or pass off and on motorcycles
EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:24,672	| serial-s02-e02 |	As soon as they saw her that the enemy was coming their way like we were charging
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:25,440	| serial-s02-e02 |	Pounds
EDL	00:39:25,440	00:39:30,560	| serial-s02-e02 |	Running out of our trucks like he's in here we're running to this clot that's Darrell Hanson again
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:32,864	| serial-s02-e02 |	A clot is a kind of compound
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:36,192	| serial-s02-e02 |	Going in with Guns by the fact I'll never forget we ran into
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:41,056	| serial-s02-e02 |	And as we're running in this freaking cow has a baby like right next to me
EDL	00:39:41,056	00:39:44,640	| serial-s02-e02 |	Outcome you scared the hell out of the cow and I just had it
EDL	00:39:46,176	00:39:48,736	| serial-s02-e02 |	So yeah it was it was very intense yeah
EDL	00:39:49,504	00:39:53,856	| serial-s02-e02 |	Just you know we're always seemed like one one one day behind where is that
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:39:58,464	| serial-s02-e02 |	The Americans were certainly on the right track
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:01,792	| serial-s02-e02 |	The Battalion leadership met with a local Afghan leader
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:05,120	| serial-s02-e02 |	Reported that Bill had been turned over to the local Taliban leader
EDL	00:40:05,120	00:40:05,888	| serial-s02-e02 |	Qari Ismail
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:07,680	| serial-s02-e02 |	Just like a little Sammy
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:13,312	| serial-s02-e02 |	Pretty sure those Taliban guys would turnbow over to the haqqanis and pack
EDL	00:40:13,312	00:40:14,080	| serial-s02-e02 |	Stan
EDL	00:40:14,080	00:40:15,616	| serial-s02-e02 |	In North waziristan to be precise
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:18,944	| serial-s02-e02 |	It also got an Intel that Bo might be in ghazni
EDL	00:40:18,944	00:40:20,224	| serial-s02-e02 |	Just like mujahid Rahman said
EDL	00:40:20,992	00:40:25,600	| serial-s02-e02 |	In fact your mom told me that a few days after he returned from delivering go to Pakistan
EDL	00:40:25,600	00:40:27,392	| serial-s02-e02 |	He got rolled up by The Americans
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:28,160	| serial-s02-e02 |	Detained
EDL	00:40:28,160	00:40:29,440	| serial-s02-e02 |	Questions about Bo
EDL	00:40:29,952	00:40:34,816	| serial-s02-e02 |	Ramon said everyone's getting questioned about though people from down south in Kandahar in from out west in herat
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:39,936	| serial-s02-e02 |	I sure the US had in front of them the very man who had shepherded bow to the haqqanis
EDL	00:40:40,448	00:40:42,240	| serial-s02-e02 |	Is Ramon told them
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:50,432	| serial-s02-e02 |	I have not seen this person and I don't know who this person and I haven't heard
EDL	00:40:51,456	00:40:53,760	| serial-s02-e02 |	So that was a lie
EDL	00:40:53,760	00:40:56,576	| serial-s02-e02 |	Add apply all the time to the Americans
EDL	00:40:57,600	00:40:59,648	| serial-s02-e02 |	Pulling into towns you're unfamiliar with
EDL	00:40:59,648	00:41:02,720	| serial-s02-e02 |	Based on single Source intelligence or conflicting intelligence
EDL	00:41:03,232	00:41:06,304	| serial-s02-e02 |	Almost no time to prepare your team for what's awaiting them
EDL	00:41:06,304	00:41:07,072	| serial-s02-e02 |	It's risky
EDL	00:41:07,840	00:41:12,704	| serial-s02-e02 |	Any more typical operation you mitigate the danger maximize the chance for success
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:17,056	| serial-s02-e02 |	By doing everything you can in advance to do what's called shape the battlefield
EDL	00:41:17,056	00:41:19,360	| serial-s02-e02 |	He might take a few days to plan and prepare
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:22,432	| serial-s02-e02 |	Now commanders were lucky if they got a few hours
EDL	00:41:22,432	00:41:23,968	| serial-s02-e02 |	Sometimes they felt like they were winging it
EDL	00:41:24,480	00:41:29,344	| serial-s02-e02 |	Special Operations Commander told me his team when I'm more than 50 missions looking for Bo
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:33,952	| serial-s02-e02 |	How many of those were during the day rather than at night when his guys have the advantage
EDL	00:41:33,952	00:41:35,488	| serial-s02-e02 |	Quote we don't work in the day
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:36,512	| serial-s02-e02 |	He said
EDL	00:41:38,560	00:41:39,840	| serial-s02-e02 |	Major Mike Waltz
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:42,144	| serial-s02-e02 |	Was commander of a special forces company
EDL	00:41:42,144	00:41:44,704	| serial-s02-e02 |	He's in charge of 7 Green Beret and one Navy SEAL Team
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:47,264	| serial-s02-e02 |	He took over the command on June 30th
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:48,032	| serial-s02-e02 |	Same-day bow left
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:52,895	| serial-s02-e02 |	Well infantry soldiers were out searching cars are going house-to-house in villages
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:55,199	| serial-s02-e02 |	What's his teams were conducting raids
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:56,223	| serial-s02-e02 |	Usually at night
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:42:01,087	| serial-s02-e02 |	Targeting specific compounds or houses where they hadn't elbow either was or had been
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:02,623	| serial-s02-e02 |	Any shred of evidence
EDL	00:42:03,135	00:42:04,927	| serial-s02-e02 |	That burger had been there with
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:06,207	| serial-s02-e02 |	We thought he was there
EDL	00:42:06,207	00:42:07,743	| serial-s02-e02 |	A sighting
EDL	00:42:07,743	00:42:09,023	| serial-s02-e02 |	It wasn't really vetted
EDL	00:42:09,535	00:42:14,911	| serial-s02-e02 |	It wasn't buttressed by other types of reporting there was there was just no time to check on it we just went
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:16,703	| serial-s02-e02 |	And I can't emphasize
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:19,775	| serial-s02-e02 |	I can't overemphasize how dangerous that is
EDL	00:42:20,543	00:42:22,847	| serial-s02-e02 |	1 sisters one mission that still freaks him out
EDL	00:42:23,359	00:42:24,895	| serial-s02-e02 |	His man went to ghazni
EDL	00:42:24,895	00:42:26,943	| serial-s02-e02 |	He says most of his missions were ordered in ghazni
EDL	00:42:27,455	00:42:33,343	| serial-s02-e02 |	And it had information that a young white male surrounded by Fighters have been seen in particular compound that day
EDL	00:42:33,855	00:42:37,439	| serial-s02-e02 |	So as fast as they could they got the helicopters together they heading out there
EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:38,207	| serial-s02-e02 |	What time is it
EDL	00:42:38,207	00:42:39,231	| serial-s02-e02 |	Substantiate anything
EDL	00:42:39,743	00:42:42,047	| serial-s02-e02 |	They arrived and walk into the compound
EDL	00:42:42,047	00:42:43,583	| serial-s02-e02 |	Define the whole thing is booby trap
EDL	00:42:44,095	00:42:47,935	| serial-s02-e02 |	The team went in and looked up and saw the ceiling lined with C4
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:51,007	| serial-s02-e02 |	And then there was also a car bomb
EDL	00:42:51,007	00:42:52,287	| serial-s02-e02 |	With with the trunk
EDL	00:42:52,287	00:42:54,847	| serial-s02-e02 |	Packed with explosives sitting in the middle of the compound
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:56,127	| serial-s02-e02 |	Now by the grace of God
EDL	00:42:56,895	00:43:02,271	| serial-s02-e02 |	They evacuated before the thing to go off and it never did but I would have easily lost 20 to 30
EDL	00:43:03,551	00:43:09,951	| serial-s02-e02 |	American Green Berets that night had that thing go off and it quickly became very apparent to us that the Taliban new
EDL	00:43:09,951	00:43:11,487	| serial-s02-e02 |	And our sources began telling us
EDL	00:43:11,999	00:43:16,095	| serial-s02-e02 |	That the Taliban and the haqqani network knew that we were pulling out all the stops
EDL	00:43:16,095	00:43:16,863	| serial-s02-e02 |	To find him
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:19,935	| serial-s02-e02 |	And we're feeding false information into our informant Networks
EDL	00:43:28,895	00:43:29,663	| serial-s02-e02 |	All right
EDL	00:43:29,663	00:43:32,223	| serial-s02-e02 |	You got the most advanced military in the world
EDL	00:43:32,223	00:43:36,831	| serial-s02-e02 |	All this effort all this expertise and Technology are trying to find one person
EDL	00:43:37,599	00:43:40,415	| serial-s02-e02 |	Did you pull out all the stops just to get one soldier back
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:41,695	| serial-s02-e02 |	That's really something
EDL	00:43:42,719	00:43:43,999	| serial-s02-e02 |	Then they can't find it
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:47,839	| serial-s02-e02 |	And I'd only that in some instances there being played by the enemy
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:48,607	| serial-s02-e02 |	Learning to trap
EDL	00:43:49,631	00:43:50,399	| serial-s02-e02 |	What is going on
EDL	00:43:50,911	00:43:54,495	| serial-s02-e02 |	I don't quite understand if he should be impressed by this operation or dismayed
EDL	00:43:55,519	00:43:58,847	| serial-s02-e02 |	Jason Dempsey to answer this question for me
EDL	00:43:58,847	00:44:02,943	| serial-s02-e02 |	At the time bow disappeared Jason was a major in the 10th Mountain division
EDL	00:44:02,943	00:44:03,967	| serial-s02-e02 |	An operations officer
EDL	00:44:04,479	00:44:06,527	| serial-s02-e02 |	He planned military operations
EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:08,319	| serial-s02-e02 |	Battalion base in logar province
EDL	00:44:08,319	00:44:10,111	| serial-s02-e02 |	Just north of pek Tikka and bacteria
EDL	00:44:10,623	00:44:14,463	| serial-s02-e02 |	I've already Jason a couple of times now and what I've learned is that he's very smart
EDL	00:44:14,975	00:44:15,999	| serial-s02-e02 |	Mercante
EDL	00:44:15,999	00:44:17,279	| serial-s02-e02 |	Stop fidgeting
EDL	00:44:17,279	00:44:18,303	| serial-s02-e02 |	Can't sit still
EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:21,631	| serial-s02-e02 |	Ostensibly conducting counterinsurgency
EDL	00:44:21,631	00:44:26,751	| serial-s02-e02 |	Forgot the washing dishes
EDL	00:44:28,031	00:44:30,591	| serial-s02-e02 |	Jason's got a PhD and is taught at West Point
EDL	00:44:30,591	00:44:32,895	| serial-s02-e02 |	Centaurs in both Iraq and Afghanistan
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:36,479	| serial-s02-e02 |	And it's not a lot about what we did and didn't accomplish and I've got us
EDL	00:44:37,247	00:44:38,015	| serial-s02-e02 |	His knots
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:39,039	| serial-s02-e02 |	Surprised we didn't find Bo
EDL	00:44:39,807	00:44:43,135	| serial-s02-e02 |	When I think about what was happening I just have this image of
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:45,183	| serial-s02-e02 |	Like this
EDL	00:44:45,183	00:44:45,951	| serial-s02-e02 |	This big
EDL	00:44:46,975	00:44:48,767	| serial-s02-e02 |	Machine
EDL	00:44:48,767	00:44:53,887	| serial-s02-e02 |	That's like moving around in this region in Afghanistan and there's just like a mouse
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:45:00,287	| serial-s02-e02 |	Running through the legs on Star Wars
EDL	00:45:00,287	00:45:06,687	| serial-s02-e02 |	Comes with his little thing and he's just like type of the legs and falls over I mean I know that's not fair but but
EDL	00:45:06,687	00:45:08,991	| serial-s02-e02 |	True it's a great analogy right you got it
EDL	00:45:08,991	00:45:11,807	| serial-s02-e02 |	This big lumbering machine moving through
EDL	00:45:12,575	00:45:15,391	| serial-s02-e02 |	So I can destroy anything face on butt
EDL	00:45:15,391	00:45:19,231	| serial-s02-e02 |	It can't get it has no idea on a granular level
EDL	00:45:19,743	00:45:20,767	| serial-s02-e02 |	What's below it
EDL	00:45:22,303	00:45:26,143	| serial-s02-e02 |	Json says what's down there on the ground or towns we don't understand
EDL	00:45:26,143	00:45:31,007	| serial-s02-e02 |	Where regular people and government officials and the Taliban are impossibly in mashed
EDL	00:45:31,775	00:45:36,383	| serial-s02-e02 |	We're civilians might hate the Taliban but they might hit the Karzai government even more
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:39,455	| serial-s02-e02 |	So it's not clear at all that the u.s. is the team to root for
EDL	00:45:39,455	00:45:39,967	| serial-s02-e02 |	Help
EDL	00:45:40,479	00:45:45,087	| serial-s02-e02 |	It's not as simple as these people are loyal to our side and those people are loyal to their side
EDL	00:45:45,087	00:45:45,599	| serial-s02-e02 |	It's fluid
EDL	00:45:46,623	00:45:52,767	| serial-s02-e02 |	At that time and that part of Afghanistan we just didn't understand incredibly complicated politics of these town
EDL	00:45:53,279	00:45:55,583	| serial-s02-e02 |	Yeah we we pékin Target or track
EDL	00:45:57,119	00:46:02,495	| serial-s02-e02 |	Individual network but we never really wrabel the tie-in okay Which towns and Villages and
EDL	00:46:03,007	00:46:05,567	| serial-s02-e02 |	People who know their relatives who are
EDL	00:46:05,567	00:46:06,847	| serial-s02-e02 |	Happy to give them
EDL	00:46:06,847	00:46:08,383	| serial-s02-e02 |	Safe passage or
EDL	00:46:08,895	00:46:14,271	| serial-s02-e02 |	I can walk through usually even after even after 7 years
EDL	00:46:14,271	00:46:15,295	| serial-s02-e02 |	Of War at this
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:18,111	| serial-s02-e02 |	When we don't know we don't we don't know the networks
EDL	00:46:18,111	00:46:18,623	| serial-s02-e02 |	Well enough
EDL	00:46:19,135	00:46:20,415	| serial-s02-e02 |	No remember
EDL	00:46:20,415	00:46:22,463	| serial-s02-e02 |	When you say 7 years of war
EDL	00:46:22,975	00:46:24,767	| serial-s02-e02 |	It means we rotated
EDL	00:46:25,279	00:46:27,327	| serial-s02-e02 |	2000 dudes through the air
EDL	00:46:27,839	00:46:29,119	| serial-s02-e02 |	Every 7 to 12
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:32,447	| serial-s02-e02 |	Where there is no institutional knowledge
EDL	00:46:32,959	00:46:34,751	| serial-s02-e02 |	The US military in Afghanistan
EDL	00:46:34,751	00:46:36,287	| serial-s02-e02 |	Nearly nun
EDL	00:46:37,311	00:46:38,847	| serial-s02-e02 |	We never were there long enough
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:42,687	| serial-s02-e02 |	Actually get engaged within the supplies unfortunately after 2010 as well
EDL	00:46:43,199	00:46:44,479	| serial-s02-e02 |	We've never had anybody
EDL	00:46:46,783	00:46:48,063	| serial-s02-e02 |	Are we engaged
EDL	00:46:48,063	00:46:49,599	| serial-s02-e02 |	At all I was asking
EDL	00:46:52,415	00:46:54,719	| serial-s02-e02 |	Jason said that's the whole thing right there
EDL	00:46:55,231	00:46:57,791	| serial-s02-e02 |	The spider web of connections we never could untangle
EDL	00:46:58,303	00:47:02,399	| serial-s02-e02 |	We come into Afghanistan in 2001 and ousted the Taliban
EDL	00:47:02,399	00:47:05,471	| serial-s02-e02 |	We did a pretty good job of that through 2003
EDL	00:47:05,471	00:47:06,751	| serial-s02-e02 |	Then afterwards
EDL	00:47:06,751	00:47:08,799	| serial-s02-e02 |	Jason said our mission languished
EDL	00:47:08,799	00:47:12,383	| serial-s02-e02 |	And the Taliban use the intervening years to refresh and regroup
EDL	00:47:12,383	00:47:14,687	| serial-s02-e02 |	To learn how we operate how we track them
EDL	00:47:15,199	00:47:18,015	| serial-s02-e02 |	And now they were pushing back into the country in a big way
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:20,063	| serial-s02-e02 |	And exactly this region
EDL	00:47:20,831	00:47:22,623	| serial-s02-e02 |	Betty kapadia ghost
EDL	00:47:23,135	00:47:24,159	| serial-s02-e02 |	Right where bow goes missing
EDL	00:47:28,511	00:47:31,839	| serial-s02-e02 |	That's what the soldiers of the five-oh-first were up against
EDL	00:47:31,839	00:47:34,399	| serial-s02-e02 |	They were total Outsiders looking for their guy
EDL	00:47:34,399	00:47:37,983	| serial-s02-e02 |	And knowing their chances of finding him where diminishing everyday that passed
EDL	00:47:38,751	00:47:40,543	| serial-s02-e02 |	Clint Baker commander of the 1st
EDL	00:47:40,543	00:47:41,567	| serial-s02-e02 |	Italian of the five-oh-first
EDL	00:47:42,079	00:47:44,639	| serial-s02-e02 |	Said it was as high-risk in operation as he's ever had
EDL	00:47:45,151	00:47:47,199	| serial-s02-e02 |	In part because there was no clear endpoint
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:49,759	| serial-s02-e02 |	Any military hearing he testified
EDL	00:47:49,759	00:47:53,855	| serial-s02-e02 |	And I mean frankly I felt a bit of a loss on you know what to do
EDL	00:47:54,367	00:47:58,719	| serial-s02-e02 |	My entire time in the Army I can't think of a time where I felt that kind of adversity
EDL	00:47:58,719	00:48:00,767	| serial-s02-e02 |	Just. And really did not
EDL	00:48:00,767	00:48:03,071	| serial-s02-e02 |	You know I wasn't able to overcome it and quote
EDL	00:48:04,095	00:48:06,143	| serial-s02-e02 |	The relentlessness was what was so crushing
EDL	00:48:07,167	00:48:08,447	| serial-s02-e02 |	Is John Thurman
EDL	00:48:08,447	00:48:09,471	| serial-s02-e02 |	Darrell Hanson
EDL	00:48:09,983	00:48:11,263	| serial-s02-e02 |	They got to the point where
EDL	00:48:11,263	00:48:12,543	| serial-s02-e02 |	Sleep I mean
EDL	00:48:12,543	00:48:13,567	| serial-s02-e02 |	Sort of became
EDL	00:48:14,591	00:48:15,615	| serial-s02-e02 |	A distant reality
EDL	00:48:16,895	00:48:20,223	| serial-s02-e02 |	Twenty-four hours a day 7 days a week nose
EDL	00:48:20,223	00:48:21,247	| serial-s02-e02 |	Sleep no nothing
EDL	00:48:22,015	00:48:26,367	| serial-s02-e02 |	Ucae just ran out of juice who all the guys are just miserable and
EDL	00:48:27,135	00:48:29,439	| serial-s02-e02 |	It's just I like how on Earth you know
EDL	00:48:29,951	00:48:34,303	| serial-s02-e02 |	Of course Afghanistan was dangerous and conditions were rough before bowl last also
EDL	00:48:34,815	00:48:39,679	| serial-s02-e02 |	But now because operation Tempo was roughly doubled or even tripled in some cases
EDL	00:48:39,679	00:48:41,471	| serial-s02-e02 |	There's just more contact with the danger
EDL	00:48:42,239	00:48:46,079	| serial-s02-e02 |	Blackfoot 3rd platoon for instance hit 3 IEDs in one day
EDL	00:48:46,847	00:48:50,175	| serial-s02-e02 |	Major silvino silvino testified that the battalions mrap
EDL	00:48:50,175	00:48:53,759	| serial-s02-e02 |	Does huge armored trucks that are built to sustain IED explosion
EDL	00:48:53,759	00:48:57,087	| serial-s02-e02 |	But about 80% of them or damaged during the search.
EDL	00:48:57,087	00:48:59,647	| serial-s02-e02 |	A half a damage was caused by iuds
EDL	00:49:00,159	00:49:01,951	| serial-s02-e02 |	Therefore mine rollers all destroyed
EDL	00:49:03,231	00:49:06,815	| serial-s02-e02 |	Those numbers are one way to quantify the danger and the damage
EDL	00:49:07,327	00:49:13,727	| serial-s02-e02 |	Crystal Reckoning of the consequences including the enormous question of whether people were wounded or died looking for bow
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:16,287	| serial-s02-e02 |	Become publicly much later
EDL	00:49:16,799	00:49:18,079	| serial-s02-e02 |	After Bill came home
EDL	00:49:24,735	00:49:27,551	| serial-s02-e02 |	I saw some pictures Darryl Jansen took from that time
EDL	00:49:27,551	00:49:31,135	| serial-s02-e02 |	One shows him and another guy standing next to a carcass on a spit
EDL	00:49:31,903	00:49:32,671	| serial-s02-e02 |	Is that a goat
EDL	00:49:33,439	00:49:35,743	| serial-s02-e02 |	Yes that's a ghost
EDL	00:49:35,743	00:49:37,791	| serial-s02-e02 |	What was going on in that picture
EDL	00:49:39,327	00:49:41,631	| serial-s02-e02 |	What's going on is a retired of MREs
EDL	00:49:41,631	00:49:44,959	| serial-s02-e02 |	So they buy goat off of local farmer have some meat that wasn't Vacuum Pack
EDL	00:49:45,727	00:49:51,871	| serial-s02-e02 |	Some of these units couldn't go back to their fobs for what's called refit where you clean and resupply Equipment a shower you get a hot meal

EDL	00:51:49,631	00:51:53,215	| serial-s02-e02 |	The other battalions within the organization or looking for him to
EDL	00:51:53,215	00:51:54,239	| serial-s02-e02 |	And so what you know

EDL	00:52:04,223	00:52:06,271	| serial-s02-e02 |	Until you see somebody

EDL	00:52:17,279	00:52:18,047	| serial-s02-e02 |	It's War
EDL	00:52:18,047	00:52:19,327	| serial-s02-e02 |	And this is what they signed up for
EDL	00:52:20,095	00:52:21,887	| serial-s02-e02 |	Well it's a no
EDL	00:52:21,887	00:52:24,959	| serial-s02-e02 |	Their job was to go find and rescue one of their own
EDL	00:52:24,959	00:52:26,751	| serial-s02-e02 |	They knew that and they accepted it
EDL	00:52:26,751	00:52:29,055	| serial-s02-e02 |	Is the right thing to do to go look for him
EDL	00:52:29,055	00:52:30,847	| serial-s02-e02 |	And I genuinely wanted to find him
EDL	00:52:31,359	00:52:32,639	| serial-s02-e02 |	But they also knew
EDL	00:52:32,639	00:52:34,175	| serial-s02-e02 |	Or we're at least pretty confident
EDL	00:52:34,687	00:52:37,247	| serial-s02-e02 |	The bowhead left Mesto P voluntarily
EDL	00:52:37,759	00:52:40,319	| serial-s02-e02 |	I know they felt like they were going through hell on his behalf
EDL	00:52:41,343	00:52:43,391	| serial-s02-e02 |	And it wasn't just bozone platoon doing it but other
EDL	00:52:43,903	00:52:44,927	| serial-s02-e02 |	Other battalions
EDL	00:52:45,951	00:52:48,767	| serial-s02-e02 |	What's the people I talked to you about this time they said
EDL	00:52:48,767	00:52:51,839	| serial-s02-e02 |	The search inflicted such major damage on morale
EDL	00:52:52,351	00:52:54,399	| serial-s02-e02 |	It can be a delicate thing to maintain in The Best of Thai
EDL	00:52:55,679	00:52:59,263	| serial-s02-e02 |	At the end of July about a month in major Larry glasscock

EDL	00:53:22,559	00:53:24,095	| serial-s02-e02 |	So they knew that the risk
EDL	00:53:24,095	00:53:26,399	| serial-s02-e02 |	Afghanistan for our Battalion had increased
EDL	00:53:27,423	00:53:28,703	| serial-s02-e02 |	And it was
