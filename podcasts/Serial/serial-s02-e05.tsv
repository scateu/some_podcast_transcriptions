EDL	00:01:13,472	00:01:18,336	| serial-s02-e05 |	You need to think about what you're going to say
EDL	00:01:20,640	00:01:24,992	| serial-s02-e05 |	From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial one story told me
EDL	00:01:30,112	00:01:34,464	| serial-s02-e05 |	In very early July of 2009 just a few days after but went missing
EDL	00:01:34,976	00:01:39,072	| serial-s02-e05 |	A woman named Kim Harrison winter local police department in Portland Oregon
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:41,632	| serial-s02-e05 |	And I had to go to the microphone
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:42,656	| serial-s02-e05 |	Because I don't have it
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:43,936	| serial-s02-e05 |	A person out in front
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:46,496	| serial-s02-e05 |	It's pretty big Police Department I think it's part of it
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:50,080	| serial-s02-e05 |	Excuse me can I
EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:52,896	| serial-s02-e05 |	Talk to somebody I need to report a missing person
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:54,432	| serial-s02-e05 |	Hamsa
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:58,016	| serial-s02-e05 |	Yeah it me at the time I know this is they're going to think I'm insane
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:02:02,368	| serial-s02-e05 |	I feel what you're saying is I'm reporting a missing person out of
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:03,648	| serial-s02-e05 |	Mest Afghanistan
EDL	00:02:03,648	00:02:07,232	| serial-s02-e05 |	Well I didn't really want to say that right off the bat because I knew I wouldn't get
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:09,536	| serial-s02-e05 |	The person missing was Bo
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:10,304	| serial-s02-e05 |	Of course
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:13,888	| serial-s02-e05 |	Person missing from a place roughly seven thousand miles away
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:17,472	| serial-s02-e05 |	Who is this person and I said well as sub soldier in the
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:22,080	| serial-s02-e05 |	Can't. He's a military personnel why would you do that full it's complicated
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:23,616	| serial-s02-e05 |	So complicated
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:25,664	| serial-s02-e05 |	Here's what happened
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:27,712	| serial-s02-e05 |	Kim is a close friend of bows
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:28,992	| serial-s02-e05 |	They're like family to each other
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:30,016	| serial-s02-e05 |	He's friends with her kids
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:35,392	| serial-s02-e05 |	Full list of Kim in Army forms as a person to notify if something happened to him
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:41,024	| serial-s02-e05 |	June 30th 2009 Army officials came to Kim's house to tell her he was missing
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:44,096	| serial-s02-e05 |	Kim is not a person to sit by
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:45,376	| serial-s02-e05 |	That is not her nature
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:47,424	| serial-s02-e05 |	That first day she thinks
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:48,448	| serial-s02-e05 |	How can I fix this
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:49,728	| serial-s02-e05 |	What can I do who can I call
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:51,520	| serial-s02-e05 |	And then she thinks
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:52,032	| serial-s02-e05 |	Interpol
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:54,848	| serial-s02-e05 |	The friend who happens to be high up at Interpol
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:56,128	| serial-s02-e05 |	The international police force
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:03:00,224	| serial-s02-e05 |	She calls him and he says maybe our pole can help
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:02,528	| serial-s02-e05 |	Turn on Military non-political
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:04,064	| serial-s02-e05 |	They have Cooperative agreements
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:07,392	| serial-s02-e05 |	The police and more than 180 countries including Pakistan
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:09,952	| serial-s02-e05 |	They've been helping investigate the Mumbai terror attack
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:15,584	| serial-s02-e05 |	But it happened about seven months earlier which meant they've been looking into Taliban activity in India and Pakistan
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:19,168	| serial-s02-e05 |	Interpol can actually move around in Pakistan in ways the US military cannot
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:20,448	| serial-s02-e05 |	So
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:21,216	| serial-s02-e05 |	Interpol
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:22,240	| serial-s02-e05 |	Worth a shot
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:28,640	| serial-s02-e05 |	To get an investigation underway for bow Interpol would need to issue something called a yellow notice
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:34,016	| serial-s02-e05 |	Interpol's version of a missing-person report that gets distributed to police departments all over the world
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:39,392	| serial-s02-e05 |	To get that going out you need to establish the situation as Official Police business
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:40,928	| serial-s02-e05 |	Somewhere
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:44,000	| serial-s02-e05 |	Anywhere apparently which is why Kim ends up at the Portland PD
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:45,792	| serial-s02-e05 |	She needs them.
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:47,584	| serial-s02-e05 |	To file a missing-person report
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:50,656	| serial-s02-e05 |	Interpol intern can generate the yellow notice about bow
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:52,960	| serial-s02-e05 |	And they do they make a report
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:55,776	| serial-s02-e05 |	Kim sends Interpol photographs of Bones and stuff
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,056	| serial-s02-e05 |	Is fingerprints on it
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:03:57,824	| serial-s02-e05 |	DNA samples
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:03,456	| serial-s02-e05 |	The best thing she had for that was a Halloween mask you warned they all went as Alice in Wonderland characters
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:04,992	| serial-s02-e05 |	What was the Cheshire Cat
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:06,784	| serial-s02-e05 |	So she sent the Cheshire Cat mask
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:07,552	| serial-s02-e05 |	The Interpol
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:12,416	| serial-s02-e05 |	Is all ready to go the last thing they need before Interpol can issue the yellow notice
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:13,696	| serial-s02-e05 |	Is permission
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:14,720	| serial-s02-e05 |	From
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:16,256	| serial-s02-e05 |	The Department of Defense
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:20,863	| serial-s02-e05 |	How to say can we do this really have to get permission because he was a military personnel
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:24,191	| serial-s02-e05 |	And they denied permission instantly
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:30,847	| serial-s02-e05 |	Kim has notes she took from that time and in them it says the dod denied the yellow notice 12 hours after it was requested
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:37,503	| serial-s02-e05 |	A certain Colonel calls her and tells her the dod was working in concert with the FBI and the CIA
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:42,879	| serial-s02-e05 |	And that Interpol involvement could complicate jeopardize And Delay the investigation in the search
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:43,903	| serial-s02-e05 |	And PS
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:46,463	| serial-s02-e05 |	It was quote in her best interest to not get involved
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:50,303	| serial-s02-e05 |	Point is
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:50,815	| serial-s02-e05 |	Who's annoying
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:53,887	| serial-s02-e05 |	They were just like incredulous that I was
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:56,959	| serial-s02-e05 |	Just causing so much problem for them
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:58,239	| serial-s02-e05 |	I mean that's why they saw it
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:01,055	| serial-s02-e05 |	I might display
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:03,359	| serial-s02-e05 |	Squeaking nagging
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:05,663	| serial-s02-e05 |	Hino not behaving female
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:07,711	| serial-s02-e05 |	She keeps going
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:08,991	| serial-s02-e05 |	Women
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:13,087	| serial-s02-e05 |	Later that same day but Sunday Kim calls the colonel bag
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:14,111	| serial-s02-e05 |	Somehow gets his home number
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:15,903	| serial-s02-e05 |	And he reiterates
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:18,207	| serial-s02-e05 |	He does not foresee the yellow notice going forward
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:20,767	| serial-s02-e05 |	Congressman Chico
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:23,839	| serial-s02-e05 |	Call the senator maybe they can pressure the military to change the decision
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:24,863	| serial-s02-e05 |	No dice
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:26,143	| serial-s02-e05 |	That was that
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:31,007	| serial-s02-e05 |	The question Kim is left with to this day
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:34,591	| serial-s02-e05 |	Is what is the dod headset to Interpol yes
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,103	| serial-s02-e05 |	Go ahead
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:36,639	| serial-s02-e05 |	Creative work
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:38,431	| serial-s02-e05 |	Possibly gotten home sooner
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:42,527	| serial-s02-e05 |	When I heard the story the question I was left with was
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:43,807	| serial-s02-e05 |	What the heck
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:47,647	| serial-s02-e05 |	Chili Kim huffing it to the Portland PD is not the way this is supposed to work
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:49,183	| serial-s02-e05 |	So how is this
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:50,207	| serial-s02-e05 |	Bus to work
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:55,327	| serial-s02-e05 |	That's a bunch of people who worked on behalf of the military to get Bo home
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:57,375	| serial-s02-e05 |	Some on the record someone background
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:59,935	| serial-s02-e05 |	And they all talked about how much of a doozy this one was
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:01,471	| serial-s02-e05 |	Otherwise just know handbook
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:04,031	| serial-s02-e05 |	You had a US prisoner of war
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:07,615	| serial-s02-e05 |	There's being held in the friendly nation of Pakistan
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:11,199	| serial-s02-e05 |	By the designated terrorist group of the haqqani
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:13,759	| serial-s02-e05 |	On behalf of the lawful combatants
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:15,039	| serial-s02-e05 |	Like the Taliban
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:21,951	| serial-s02-e05 |	It's not like there was a Cadre of people inside the United States government who had experience on how to untie this
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:23,999	| serial-s02-e05 |	Killer not nobody had done this before
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:27,071	| serial-s02-e05 |	How do you how do you manipulate an entire country
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:29,119	| serial-s02-e05 |	Together
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:31,167	| serial-s02-e05 |	An enlisted Soldier home
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:33,727	| serial-s02-e05 |	How do you do that
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:38,079	| serial-s02-e05 |	You don't
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:43,199	| serial-s02-e05 |	Of course it wasn't a military operation that finally got Bo home
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:44,223	| serial-s02-e05 |	It was diplomacy
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:48,831	| serial-s02-e05 |	We negotiated with the Taliban and traded him for five minute of gitmo
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:52,927	| serial-s02-e05 |	And that in itself is a fascinating story and we'll get into all that
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:54,463	| serial-s02-e05 |	But for this episode
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:07:00,863	| serial-s02-e05 |	I'm going to lay out the twisty-turny and often emotional pass that came before the president sign off on that trade
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:04,959	| serial-s02-e05 |	Because before the most powerful person in the United States to call the buzz fade
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:09,311	| serial-s02-e05 |	Use my hands of well-meaning people much much lower down the chain
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:11,103	| serial-s02-e05 |	Or not in that chain at all
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:13,663	| serial-s02-e05 |	Because that's where the search for Bo lived
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:14,175	| serial-s02-e05 |	4 years
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:19,551	| serial-s02-e05 |	The same day but walks away the dust one goes into effect
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:21,599	| serial-s02-e05 |	For about a month and a half
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:26,463	| serial-s02-e05 |	There's this intense no-holds-barred military and intelligence effort inside
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:30,815	| serial-s02-e05 |	All this equipment hundreds of people redirected to search for bow
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:34,655	| serial-s02-e05 |	The nerve center for all that activity was back in the States
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:35,935	| serial-s02-e05 |	In Tampa Florida
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:39,007	| serial-s02-e05 |	That's where us Central Command is headquartered
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:40,031	| serial-s02-e05 |	Going to centcom
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:44,895	| serial-s02-e05 |	Centcom has a group of people whose whole job is to find missing or captured people
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:48,223	| serial-s02-e05 |	Guarantee are not public relations but Personnel recovery
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:52,063	| serial-s02-e05 |	I talked to two people who worked in the pr office at that time
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:53,599	| serial-s02-e05 |	Intel analyst
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:57,695	| serial-s02-e05 |	And they might search for anyone who's been reported missing from a conflict Zone
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:08:00,255	| serial-s02-e05 |	Not just US military personnel and not just America
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:04,351	| serial-s02-e05 |	Could be a contractor someone working for an NGO
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:06,143	| serial-s02-e05 |	Hiker foreign Nationals
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:06,911	| serial-s02-e05 |	Recorders
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:10,495	| serial-s02-e05 |	Imagine their office as a super high-tech workspace
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:12,287	| serial-s02-e05 |	Like the way NASA looks in the movies
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:14,591	| serial-s02-e05 |	It's not that sexy
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:17,663	| serial-s02-e05 |	It's definitely not sexy
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:19,711	| serial-s02-e05 |	That's Andrea not her real name
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:20,735	| serial-s02-e05 |	And she'll
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:21,247	| serial-s02-e05 |	Also not heard
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:23,807	| serial-s02-e05 |	They told me the office is
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:24,575	| serial-s02-e05 |	Cubicles
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:25,343	| serial-s02-e05 |	Computers
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:25,855	| serial-s02-e05 |	Telephones
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:28,927	| serial-s02-e05 |	International did not want to talk
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:30,719	| serial-s02-e05 |	Specifically about Bose case
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:31,999	| serial-s02-e05 |	Since its ongoing in military
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:34,559	| serial-s02-e05 |	What they told me applies to his
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:36,863	| serial-s02-e05 |	And two lots of other cases they work
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:40,191	| serial-s02-e05 |	Also these women didn't want to use their real names
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:43,519	| serial-s02-e05 |	Because anything bro related is so sensitive so hot
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:45,311	| serial-s02-e05 |	They worried they might suffer repercussions
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:48,127	| serial-s02-e05 |	Personally if the public knew they tried to bring boho
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:52,479	| serial-s02-e05 |	Anyway their job didn't stop when the dust one was called off
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:54,015	| serial-s02-e05 |	They kept going
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:54,783	| serial-s02-e05 |	Until it was over
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:56,063	| serial-s02-e05 |	5 years later
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:59,391	| serial-s02-e05 |	Again Andrew Michelle can't talk about the poor
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:00,415	| serial-s02-e05 |	Particulars of bows
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:04,255	| serial-s02-e05 |	But they were pretty candid about what made their job especially tricky
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:06,047	| serial-s02-e05 |	I said there were a bunch of fact
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:11,679	| serial-s02-e05 |	First of all at that time Andrea and then Michelle we're kind of it for Afghanistan
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:12,959	| serial-s02-e05 |	In terms of personnel recovery
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:16,543	| serial-s02-e05 |	DOD had a good system for recovering downed pilots in Afghan
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:21,919	| serial-s02-e05 |	But other than that there was no solid system in place to track people who went missing
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:22,943	| serial-s02-e05 |	Cassandra
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:26,271	| serial-s02-e05 |	They should have had two people
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:28,575	| serial-s02-e05 |	Or more sitting there in Afghanistan
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:31,135	| serial-s02-e05 |	Waiting to just support
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:32,159	| serial-s02-e05 |	Personnel recovery events
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:38,303	| serial-s02-e05 |	But instead everyone in the theater where dual had it or triple how did you know they had different jobs
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:40,863	| serial-s02-e05 |	And so when an event occurred they'd
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:43,167	| serial-s02-e05 |	You know they could help but they certainly weren't
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:43,935	| serial-s02-e05 |	Experts
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:47,775	| serial-s02-e05 |	And when that differed from say operations in Iraq and relax
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:51,359	| serial-s02-e05 |	What was the how do you compare laxatives what was in place
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:56,223	| serial-s02-e05 |	In Afghanistan versus what was in place in Iraq and 4 / Saturday
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:59,807	| serial-s02-e05 |	Iraq had a personal recovery division setup and they had upwards of
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:04,671	| serial-s02-e05 |	15 people sitting in the same room with the only job full-time job of
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:10,047	| serial-s02-e05 |	Is my only wish that we could have had something like that and I've got a
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:13,119	| serial-s02-e05 |	We ask for many many times
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:14,399	| serial-s02-e05 |	That's Michelle
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:15,935	| serial-s02-e05 |	I can't even begin to
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:17,215	| serial-s02-e05 |	Describe the
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:22,847	| serial-s02-e05 |	Leading of establishing a cell like that over there that would have helped us immensely
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:27,455	| serial-s02-e05 |	Many more people had gone missing from Iraq than from Afghanistan
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:30,527	| serial-s02-e05 |	So it made sense Rock was much better equipped for these events
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:35,135	| serial-s02-e05 |	But still with that man is that a certain point mashona and realized
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:36,927	| serial-s02-e05 |	We can't do this job from Tampa
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:41,791	| serial-s02-e05 |	I started rotating in and out of Afghanistan usually for months at a time
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:46,143	| serial-s02-e05 |	So they can manage their cases from the ground
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:47,679	| serial-s02-e05 |	When someone goes missing
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:52,031	| serial-s02-e05 |	PR team turns on every intelligence asset they can those assets
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:52,799	| serial-s02-e05 |	People

EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:57,151	| serial-s02-e05 |	Are human intelligence or sigint signals intelligence
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:59,455	| serial-s02-e05 |	Communication to pick up from cell phones are like
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:03,295	| serial-s02-e05 |	Electronic messages or geoint geospatial-intelligence
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:04,575	| serial-s02-e05 |	Images of a landscape
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:08,159	| serial-s02-e05 |	And their job ideally is to layer all this Intel
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:12,255	| serial-s02-e05 |	To get the clearest picture they possibly can of where the person is
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:14,047	| serial-s02-e05 |	And then if you can get that far
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:15,839	| serial-s02-e05 |	Hand that information off
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:18,399	| serial-s02-e05 |	To the people who can actually do something about it
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:21,983	| serial-s02-e05 |	Either militarily can we send in Special Forces for instance
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:26,079	| serial-s02-e05 |	Can we engineer an escape of some kind or drone strike to set the hostage free
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:31,455	| serial-s02-e05 |	Or diplomatically can we get our ambassador and whatever country to try to negotiate for a hostage

EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:32,735	| serial-s02-e05 |	A civilian
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:37,855	| serial-s02-e05 |	Remember when Bill Clinton went to North Korea in 2009 got those reporters at a prison there
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,647	| serial-s02-e05 |	Bose case
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:42,975	| serial-s02-e05 |	All of that work all of those potential Avenues
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:45,023	| serial-s02-e05 |	We're stymied by the defining fact
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:46,303	| serial-s02-e05 |	Geographical situation
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:47,583	| serial-s02-e05 |	News in Pakistan
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:50,143	| serial-s02-e05 |	In Afghanistan
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:50,911	| serial-s02-e05 |	.
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:51,935	| serial-s02-e05 |	Which Andrea Michelle Harper
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:54,239	| serial-s02-e05 |	DOD owns the battlespace
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:59,871	| serial-s02-e05 |	Meaning they have control they have authority to direct operations and use whatever assets they need
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:03,455	| serial-s02-e05 |	That's why the dust one for both could be as far-reaching and aggressive as
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:06,527	| serial-s02-e05 |	Once you no longer own the battle
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:12,159	| serial-s02-e05 |	You have to start relying much more on other US government agencies that might be operating a package
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:16,255	| serial-s02-e05 |	Pretty much any three-letter agency that has a Personnel recovery
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:18,047	| serial-s02-e05 |	NGA DIA
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:20,095	| serial-s02-e05 |	CIA FBI NSA
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:24,191	| serial-s02-e05 |	It's a CIA that has Authority for us operations in package
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:26,239	| serial-s02-e05 |	So you really need the CIA
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:28,799	| serial-s02-e05 |	Now it becomes a more
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:31,359	| serial-s02-e05 |	We're doing a lot more ask
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:32,639	| serial-s02-e05 |	For help
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:35,199	| serial-s02-e05 |	The priorities
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:38,783	| serial-s02-e05 |	Are all the other things that are happening inside of that country
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:43,135	| serial-s02-e05 |	Less important than this thing that we need right now
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:44,415	| serial-s02-e05 |	Or are you jumped
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:46,719	| serial-s02-e05 |	Trump for instance by current event
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:47,999	| serial-s02-e05 |	That often have

EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:53,631	| serial-s02-e05 |	Get in the way of your PR mission
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:55,679	| serial-s02-e05 |	During Bose case
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:58,239	| serial-s02-e05 |	We had some very rough patches in a relationship
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:58,751	| serial-s02-e05 |	Pakistan
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,287	| serial-s02-e05 |	2011

EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:14,367	| serial-s02-e05 |	That you're started with the Raymond Davis debacle number that one was bizarre
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:20,767	| serial-s02-e05 |	Davis was a CIA contractor who open fire on two guys riding a motorbike in the middle of a crowded intersection in the hor

EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:50,879	| serial-s02-e05 |	Like I'm going to go over there and talk to you PacSun please I'm going to
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:55,743	| serial-s02-e05 |	Do you work with peace organizations I'm going to go over there and try and go on the television
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:56,767	| serial-s02-e05 |	Stupid
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:58,047	| serial-s02-e05 |	Naive
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:59,583	| serial-s02-e05 |	I don't know what I'm thinking
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:01,375	| serial-s02-e05 |	This point there's got to be something
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:04,447	| serial-s02-e05 |	How hard you get with the like I'm going to go to pek
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:08,031	| serial-s02-e05 |	Cancel my passport
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:10,335	| serial-s02-e05 |	For my own safety I'm canceling your path
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:16,479	| serial-s02-e05 |	It wasn't a Sinister move by the government or anything like that just
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:17,759	| serial-s02-e05 |	Someone concerned about her safety
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:21,087	| serial-s02-e05 |	Who's parents were also active
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:22,879	| serial-s02-e05 |	Throughout trying to figure out what they could do
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:26,719	| serial-s02-e05 |	They decided not to speak to me on tape for this story
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:33,119	| serial-s02-e05 |	And an aside here I read nothing into that decision apart from their best intentions for their own family and for others
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:33,887	| serial-s02-e05 |	Hostages still in caps
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:37,215	| serial-s02-e05 |	Maven completely gracious to me throughout this process
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:38,239	| serial-s02-e05 |	And I'm grateful to them for
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:39,519	| serial-s02-e05 |	Anniversary
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:44,639	| serial-s02-e05 |	Perhaps things like what I'm about to tell you about Kim or happening to both parents
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:46,175	| serial-s02-e05 |	I just don't know for sure
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:52,063	| serial-s02-e05 |	Anyway Kim says in November of 2009 she did something
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:54,623	| serial-s02-e05 |	Which I can't talk about
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:56,159	| serial-s02-e05 |	Which sort of paid off
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:16:03,327	| serial-s02-e05 |	In one way and that was a got my name and telephone number to someone very obscure in Afghanistan
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:04,351	| serial-s02-e05 |	And he
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:06,399	| serial-s02-e05 |	Turned out to be someone that worked with the Taliban
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:13,567	| serial-s02-e05 |	About 6 weeks later Kim is at home in Portland and her cell phone rings weird number she doesn't answer
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:16,895	| serial-s02-e05 |	But didn't understand
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:19,199	| serial-s02-e05 |	A single syllable of it
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:25,599	| serial-s02-e05 |	And voicemail on my iPhone
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:26,623	| serial-s02-e05 |	Spell he didn't leave a message
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:29,439	| serial-s02-e05 |	I left a message in the third call I picked up
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:30,975	| serial-s02-e05 |	I thought I was on my phone
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:32,511	| serial-s02-e05 |	Weird sir
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:38,655	| serial-s02-e05 |	Wrong number you know Direct Mail you know
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:40,959	| serial-s02-e05 |	I did pick up
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:45,311	| serial-s02-e05 |	M&T speaking in past due is very obscene
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:48,127	| serial-s02-e05 |	I was not able to understand except for he said
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:51,455	| serial-s02-e05 |	So
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:52,735	| serial-s02-e05 |	That's where I went
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:55,295	| serial-s02-e05 |	You know this is what is going on
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:58,367	| serial-s02-e05 |	And my room was Adam like this
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:17:01,183	| serial-s02-e05 |	Person you know
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:04,511	| serial-s02-e05 |	Making faces at him as a missing to pass my
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:09,119	| serial-s02-e05 |	What do I do so
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:14,239	| serial-s02-e05 |	I told him and I said email email you know and he's going to email email
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:14,751	| serial-s02-e05 |	Okay
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:16,543	| serial-s02-e05 |	So he hangs up
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:21,151	| serial-s02-e05 |	I hang up I go online I try to find ways of pronouncing
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:22,431	| serial-s02-e05 |	Like phonetically
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:23,711	| serial-s02-e05 |	Letters
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:26,783	| serial-s02-e05 |	Write for my email like how I say
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:28,575	| serial-s02-e05 |	Kim blah blah blah
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:34,207	| serial-s02-e05 |	Where he'll get that butt
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:37,279	| serial-s02-e05 |	He called back like 10 minutes later
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,047	| serial-s02-e05 |	And
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:41,119	| serial-s02-e05 |	I'm trying to give him my email address with an ax
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:43,423	| serial-s02-e05 |	He's over at like 3 or 4 times
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:45,215	| serial-s02-e05 |	And if it worked
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:48,031	| serial-s02-e05 |	I had no
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,055	| serial-s02-e05 |	Hope
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:51,871	| serial-s02-e05 |	Hang up
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:53,919	| serial-s02-e05 |	30 seconds later playing I can email
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:58,271	| serial-s02-e05 |	It's not a single letter of
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:17:59,551	| serial-s02-e05 |	Of
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:02,367	| serial-s02-e05 |	Are letter forms except for booked all
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:03,903	| serial-s02-e05 |	The rest is in
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:10,303	| serial-s02-e05 |	So she cuts and pastes the message into one of those online translator sites to decipher
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:16,703	| serial-s02-e05 |	And what did it say complete gibberish the translation was like horrible
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:21,311	| serial-s02-e05 |	Happy happy celebrate Victory now
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:26,687	| serial-s02-e05 |	Hello haha Bridge
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:27,967	| serial-s02-e05 |	Tomorrow Bergdahl
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:30,271	| serial-s02-e05 |	That's not what it actually said just a friend stands
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,063	| serial-s02-e05 |	Understood the gist
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:34,879	| serial-s02-e05 |	This guy had information about bow
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:36,671	| serial-s02-e05 |	And he wanted something in return
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:42,815	| serial-s02-e05 |	So I decide I will I cannot help you I will find someone right now I will make phone calls I will find some
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:44,607	| serial-s02-e05 |	Very simple English
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:45,887	| serial-s02-e05 |	Soon
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:47,679	| serial-s02-e05 |	Can calls a friend
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:48,447	| serial-s02-e05 |	What should I do
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:49,983	| serial-s02-e05 |	A friend tells her
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:51,007	| serial-s02-e05 |	Uni the FBI
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:55,359	| serial-s02-e05 |	She contacts the FBI and eventually the FBI translates the message
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:57,663	| serial-s02-e05 |	He was proposing a deal
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:18:59,711	| serial-s02-e05 |	And the deal was
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:01,503	| serial-s02-e05 |	Tube chair
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:04,063	| serial-s02-e05 |	When heat when he had access to where
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:07,135	| serial-s02-e05 |	The locations were for where by would go
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:09,183	| serial-s02-e05 |	And where he was at any given time yet access
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:16,607	| serial-s02-e05 |	So he said I can give you information we're both going to be so that you guys can go get them in exchange
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:20,959	| serial-s02-e05 |	And I want out of the country I want how many family and how many eighths family members
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:23,263	| serial-s02-e05 |	It sounds too good to be true right
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:25,567	| serial-s02-e05 |	But incredibly this guy checked out
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:29,663	| serial-s02-e05 |	Kim can't say how the guy was connected to both situation
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:31,455	| serial-s02-e05 |	Or what proof he provided
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:35,807	| serial-s02-e05 |	But apparently he checked out to the extent that the FBI began exchanging emails with
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:38,879	| serial-s02-e05 |	They would do threaten copy
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:41,183	| serial-s02-e05 |	Vaguely tell me what it meant
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:47,071	| serial-s02-e05 |	I had stress them copy and paste it in my email and send it from my email address I'm like my computer
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:48,863	| serial-s02-e05 |	And not
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:53,727	| serial-s02-e05 |	Different location because of their guarantee he's watching my at the end and he would know with somebody else
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:55,263	| serial-s02-e05 |	So you are basically
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:58,335	| serial-s02-e05 |	The FBI at this point is communicating with
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:20:02,431	| serial-s02-e05 |	The sky through you very clear that
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:04,223	| serial-s02-e05 |	I have to
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:07,295	| serial-s02-e05 |	Get the emails if I'm not getting emails and he's going to stop
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:08,831	| serial-s02-e05 |	So
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:13,183	| serial-s02-e05 |	Horse meat you know what lol I was willing to do whatever I'm sure I'm here on this is just
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:14,463	| serial-s02-e05 |	At least
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:18,047	| serial-s02-e05 |	He knew he was also communicating with the government
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:22,911	| serial-s02-e05 |	When she got that first call Bo had been a prisoner with the Taliban for about 6 months
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:25,727	| serial-s02-e05 |	He's going through the worst winter of his whole five years
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:27,519	| serial-s02-e05 |	He was the coldest
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:28,543	| serial-s02-e05 |	The sickest hungry
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:31,359	| serial-s02-e05 |	Of course Kim didn't know any of that
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:32,383	| serial-s02-e05 |	But she was hopeful
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:33,919	| serial-s02-e05 |	Maybe this could spare him
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:35,967	| serial-s02-e05 |	The best scenario
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:42,623	| serial-s02-e05 |	They'll give him location of flying and Superman up and take him home you know
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:43,903	| serial-s02-e05 |	And
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:44,927	| serial-s02-e05 |	That would be great
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:46,207	| serial-s02-e05 |	Announcer what happened
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:49,535	| serial-s02-e05 |	Kim doesn't entirely know
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:52,863	| serial-s02-e05 |	Because your communication with the FBI was a one-way proposition
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:54,911	| serial-s02-e05 |	Thermometer to her was
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:55,679	| serial-s02-e05 |	Need to know
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:56,703	| serial-s02-e05 |	For good reason
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:21:00,287	| serial-s02-e05 |	All Kim does know is that for two years running
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:03,615	| serial-s02-e05 |	She signed releases so that the NSA could monitor
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:05,151	| serial-s02-e05 |	Phone or computer TV
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:07,967	| serial-s02-e05 |	Good follower if they wanted or hang out in front of her house
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:10,527	| serial-s02-e05 |	And then after that two years was up
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:11,039	| serial-s02-e05 |	Nothing
EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:13,855	| serial-s02-e05 |	So just kind of fizzled away
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:14,367	| serial-s02-e05 |	After a while
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:16,416	| serial-s02-e05 |	From my perspective
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:17,952	| serial-s02-e05 |	I found out what happened
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:21,536	| serial-s02-e05 |	The FBI cultivated this source for a while
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:23,584	| serial-s02-e05 |	And then passed him along to the Department of Defense
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:26,144	| serial-s02-e05 |	And it turned out this guy
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:28,448	| serial-s02-e05 |	Call Kim on her cell phone one day
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:30,752	| serial-s02-e05 |	Because of some secret thing she did
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:31,776	| serial-s02-e05 |	On her own
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:33,056	| serial-s02-e05 |	To get her number to the Taliban
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:36,896	| serial-s02-e05 |	This turned out to be one of the best leads they ever had in Bo's case
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:40,480	| serial-s02-e05 |	One person tasked with finding bow told me quote
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:42,784	| serial-s02-e05 |	I thought for sure that was the answer on quote
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:45,088	| serial-s02-e05 |	But they could never quite make it happen
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:47,648	| serial-s02-e05 |	The guy wanted to bring his relatives over
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:51,488	| serial-s02-e05 |	And if you bring nine people to the US under some version of Witness Protection
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:54,560	| serial-s02-e05 |	What government agency is going to have to take care of them
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:55,328	| serial-s02-e05 |	For their whole lives
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:21:59,168	| serial-s02-e05 |	And my source told me none of the agencies raise their hand
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:02,752	| serial-s02-e05 |	Even so Visa papers started to be drawn up just in case
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:05,056	| serial-s02-e05 |	And then the guy withdrew
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:07,616	| serial-s02-e05 |	You didn't respond when asked for details about his family member
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:08,640	| serial-s02-e05 |	The paperwork
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:12,480	| serial-s02-e05 |	Over the years when they go back to the drawing board it.
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:15,296	| serial-s02-e05 |	Trying to think up solutions for finding Bo
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:17,088	| serial-s02-e05 |	Someone would always write this guy on the list
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:18,624	| serial-s02-e05 |	What about him
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:19,904	| serial-s02-e05 |	He was willing once
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:21,696	| serial-s02-e05 |	You still there still active
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:22,464	| serial-s02-e05 |	Trying again
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:24,000	| serial-s02-e05 |	But no one Pursuit at
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:29,888	| serial-s02-e05 |	When Intel expert
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:32,448	| serial-s02-e05 |	If you have all the tools you need
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:34,496	| serial-s02-e05 |	You can find someone in less than 30 days
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:38,080	| serial-s02-e05 |	So you can rescue them in 30 days but you can at least find them
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:41,920	| serial-s02-e05 |	Abo's case. He did not have all the toys
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:46,528	| serial-s02-e05 |	Was never able to say with 100% certainty where Bo was
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:51,392	| serial-s02-e05 |	The US didn't have reliable human intelligence sources on the ground in waziristan
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:54,720	| serial-s02-e05 |	Connie's have that area lockdown so tightly
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:57,536	| serial-s02-e05 |	And you're so good at propagating misinformation
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:23:01,120	| serial-s02-e05 |	That they either couldn't get in till or couldn't trust what until they did get
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:04,448	| serial-s02-e05 |	How to figure out Bose exact location
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:05,472	| serial-s02-e05 |	Which neighborhood
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:05,984	| serial-s02-e05 |	Which compound
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:08,032	| serial-s02-e05 |	They need it for instance
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:08,544	| serial-s02-e05 |	Drones
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:11,616	| serial-s02-e05 |	And the drones have to be what's called unblinking
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:12,896	| serial-s02-e05 |	You can't look away
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:14,944	| serial-s02-e05 |	He doesn't have
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:19,296	| serial-s02-e05 |	Drones operating in Pakistan so you have to ask other agencies to take a look for you
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:20,320	| serial-s02-e05 |	Such as the CIA
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:22,368	| serial-s02-e05 |	And occasionally they would
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:24,672	| serial-s02-e05 |	They might give them a few hours here there
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:25,952	| serial-s02-e05 |	It wasn't nearly enough
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:32,352	| serial-s02-e05 |	Because unless Sabo happens to get escorted to the Train on that day at that time you're not going to see him
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:34,656	| serial-s02-e05 |	You need to watch and listen
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:36,192	| serial-s02-e05 |	Solidly for say a week
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:40,288	| serial-s02-e05 |	The catch was going in and out what they're saying maybe you follow one of those people
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:43,872	| serial-s02-e05 |	In other words of the drugs give you a much better chance of
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:45,152	| serial-s02-e05 |	Pinpointing his location
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:48,224	| serial-s02-e05 |	And with the location you can at least plan a Rescue Bots
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:52,320	| serial-s02-e05 |	One former DOD employee told me quote
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:54,112	| serial-s02-e05 |	It was literally two years
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:55,648	| serial-s02-e05 |	Of asking for drones and quote
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:04,096	| serial-s02-e05 |	CIA declined to talk to us for the story they referred us to the dod
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:06,144	| serial-s02-e05 |	What was going on
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:09,216	| serial-s02-e05 |	CIA or the NSA or other agencies
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:10,240	| serial-s02-e05 |	They have their own boss
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:12,032	| serial-s02-e05 |	Their own priorities
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:15,616	| serial-s02-e05 |	These parties aren't General and a cereal there specific
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:18,176	| serial-s02-e05 |	They're written down they must be approved by the president
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:21,248	| serial-s02-e05 |	For the CIA their priorities were things like
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:24,064	| serial-s02-e05 |	Targeting top Al-Qaeda and haqqani members
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:28,160	| serial-s02-e05 |	Well Hast recovery might have been on the list on their radar
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:29,952	| serial-s02-e05 |	It certainly wasn't at the top
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:32,000	| serial-s02-e05 |	Umberto's specifically wasn't on anybody's
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:39,168	| serial-s02-e05 |	It's understandable that the CIA can't just turn over their resources and manpower to a PR mission that isn't there
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:44,032	| serial-s02-e05 |	In some instances these other agencies were doing the best I could under the circumstances
EDL	00:24:47,360	00:24:50,944	| serial-s02-e05 |	This tension is shot through all of these hostage cases
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:53,248	| serial-s02-e05 |	Are we doing enough
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:56,576	| serial-s02-e05 |	The answer to that depends in part on where you're sitting
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:25:00,672	| serial-s02-e05 |	If your Andrea Michelle this is all you think about all day
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:01,440	| serial-s02-e05 |	Getting your hostages
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:03,488	| serial-s02-e05 |	What else can we do
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:05,536	| serial-s02-e05 |	They said they had to fight
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:06,048	| serial-s02-e05 |	Complacency
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:07,072	| serial-s02-e05 |	Malaise
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:09,632	| serial-s02-e05 |	Because their priority wasn't everyone's
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:11,936	| serial-s02-e05 |	Even if on paper it was supposed
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:15,776	| serial-s02-e05 |	Michelle said they'd have to get Wiley sometimes
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:16,800	| serial-s02-e05 |	Just to get the meeting today
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:19,616	| serial-s02-e05 |	Specific
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:20,384	| serial-s02-e05 |	General
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:23,200	| serial-s02-e05 |	In his exact and I've been talking back and forth
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:25,760	| serial-s02-e05 |	I don't know if I can get
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:32,672	| serial-s02-e05 |	Really good friends with she worked with
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:41,888	| serial-s02-e05 |	We have sorry lost out there and she needs time with his General and can make that happen
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:48,544	| serial-s02-e05 |	Cuz she calls me she's like I think I can get that done for you but he really likes Johnnie Walker Black Label
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:49,312	| serial-s02-e05 |	If you can
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:54,944	| serial-s02-e05 |	Maybe but not on his desk maybe throw in some beef jerky
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:56,224	| serial-s02-e05 |	I think we can make that happen
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:01,600	| serial-s02-e05 |	Things like that you're like unbelievable
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:05,184	| serial-s02-e05 |	Just to get in front of someone to talk about significant
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:06,976	| serial-s02-e05 |	Personnel recovery event
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:11,584	| serial-s02-e05 |	I'm sure I'm sure
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:19,776	| serial-s02-e05 |	They do the most basic things just to remind people that yes
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:21,568	| serial-s02-e05 |	There are American hostages
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:22,592	| serial-s02-e05 |	Is in Syria
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:24,384	| serial-s02-e05 |	Ernest and Pakistan
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:25,664	| serial-s02-e05 |	They put up posters
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:26,688	| serial-s02-e05 |	Make a rubber bracelet
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:28,224	| serial-s02-e05 |	Chris Michelle
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:30,272	| serial-s02-e05 |	Adrian I'd gone to a
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:35,136	| serial-s02-e05 |	Is Veterans Day or poww Mi a day but we
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:36,416	| serial-s02-e05 |	She'd made
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:37,184	| serial-s02-e05 |	Shirts
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:38,208	| serial-s02-e05 |	Or us
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:39,488	| serial-s02-e05 |	To this event
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:44,096	| serial-s02-e05 |	We're walking in and
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:45,632	| serial-s02-e05 |	A colonel stop doesn't
EDL	00:26:46,656	00:26:48,192	| serial-s02-e05 |	What the hell is that on your shirt
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:55,872	| serial-s02-e05 |	This is Bernthal and he's been missing for about that
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:58,688	| serial-s02-e05 |	Are you kidding education
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:27:02,272	| serial-s02-e05 |	Bulletin I can't believe that story
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:05,600	| serial-s02-e05 |	It's it's insane and it's
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:07,904	| serial-s02-e05 |	You're the one that breaks my heart is Coleman
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:10,976	| serial-s02-e05 |	She gave birth in captivity why are we not talking about
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:12,512	| serial-s02-e05 |	That's Andrea
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:15,840	| serial-s02-e05 |	Caitlan Coleman and her husband Joshua Boyle
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:17,888	| serial-s02-e05 |	Disappeared in Afghanistan in 2012
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:19,424	| serial-s02-e05 |	Kaitlyn was pregnant at the
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:22,496	| serial-s02-e05 |	You just made spit makes my heart hurt
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:25,056	| serial-s02-e05 |	And
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:25,824	| serial-s02-e05 |	You asked
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:28,896	| serial-s02-e05 |	The America the average American on the street who she is no no no
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:32,736	| serial-s02-e05 |	I just want to talk for a second
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:37,856	| serial-s02-e05 |	About this very human thing that overlays again not just bows case but all these hostage
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:40,160	| serial-s02-e05 |	Pittcon Rutherford
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:42,208	| serial-s02-e05 |	He's a young guy in Canadian
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:45,024	| serial-s02-e05 |	He was freed from the Taliban last week
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:46,304	| serial-s02-e05 |	After more than 5 years
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:49,376	| serial-s02-e05 |	You've been traveling in Afghanistan when he went missing
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:55,776	| serial-s02-e05 |	And the day he was released the Canadian press covered it not the details of how and why just the fact of his
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:56,544	| serial-s02-e05 |	Return
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:28:00,128	| serial-s02-e05 |	Any online comments immediately or things like this
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:02,176	| serial-s02-e05 |	Who goes on vacation to Afghanistan
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:07,808	| serial-s02-e05 |	Boneheads or this headline should read idiot rescued who cares about the
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:14,720	| serial-s02-e05 |	I'm tempted to be all sanctimonious and say that's awful how can people be so awful
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:17,792	| serial-s02-e05 |	Truth is I thought things like this
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:20,352	| serial-s02-e05 |	I mean it's great there home but you know also
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:23,680	| serial-s02-e05 |	Throne damn fault I admit it
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:25,216	| serial-s02-e05 |	And I'll wager we've all thought things
EDL	00:28:26,496	00:28:32,640	| serial-s02-e05 |	It's not unconflicted which makes us no different than a lot of the people charged with finding
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:36,480	| serial-s02-e05 |	Caitlan Coleman arc on Rutherford or Bowe Bergdahl
EDL	00:28:37,248	00:28:38,272	| serial-s02-e05 |	The only difference is
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:44,160	| serial-s02-e05 |	Those people are not supposed to think like that circumstances of capture are not supposed to come into play
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:51,840	| serial-s02-e05 |	Adrienne Michelle told me repeatedly they really do not care about circumstances of capture first you get the person
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:55,168	| serial-s02-e05 |	Max and then come consequences judgement punishment
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:55,936	| serial-s02-e05 |	Not the other way around
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:59,264	| serial-s02-e05 |	Because there isn't a hostage situation out there
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:02,336	| serial-s02-e05 |	It doesn't involve some aspect of wrong place wrong time
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:04,384	| serial-s02-e05 |	Some element of human error
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:07,456	| serial-s02-e05 |	The surprise of their job was
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:09,504	| serial-s02-e05 |	Their colleagues didn't always feel the same way
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:11,808	| serial-s02-e05 |	I think the biggest shock for me was
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:12,576	| serial-s02-e05 |	The salesmanship
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:15,904	| serial-s02-e05 |	I didn't realize that I was going to have to
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:18,976	| serial-s02-e05 |	Convince them
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:21,024	| serial-s02-e05 |	That supporting
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:23,840	| serial-s02-e05 |	My mission was something that they should do
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:26,912	| serial-s02-e05 |	I just I didn't think that that would be an issue
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:28,192	| serial-s02-e05 |	Hand wipes
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:31,520	| serial-s02-e05 |	When you're standing before your peers
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:33,312	| serial-s02-e05 |	In addressing
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:35,616	| serial-s02-e05 |	The meeting and 1st
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:38,432	| serial-s02-e05 |	And foremost you have to get over the misconceptions
EDL	00:29:38,944	00:29:40,480	| serial-s02-e05 |	Circumstances of capture
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:42,528	| serial-s02-e05 |	And this Rings true to a lot of
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:44,064	| serial-s02-e05 |	If you know you hear this
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:45,344	| serial-s02-e05 |	The comet
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:49,184	| serial-s02-e05 |	He's just a journalist you should have been there anyways why should we help them
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:51,744	| serial-s02-e05 |	Ro they were just hiking
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:54,048	| serial-s02-e05 |	Why would they be hiking there they can hike
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:54,816	| serial-s02-e05 |	In Colorado
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:57,888	| serial-s02-e05 |	Even that the kid that walked off base
EDL	00:29:58,656	00:30:00,704	| serial-s02-e05 |	Yeah I can't even begin to
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:03,776	| serial-s02-e05 |	Tell you the amount of times that we heard
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:06,080	| serial-s02-e05 |	Why should I care
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:10,944	| serial-s02-e05 |	For she did this or this is
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:22,976	| serial-s02-e05 |	Bose case of course
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:25,024	| serial-s02-e05 |	So why should I care attitude was
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:25,792	| serial-s02-e05 |	Doubled
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:27,072	| serial-s02-e05 |	Maybe even cubed
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:29,632	| serial-s02-e05 |	Are the information that he walked off on his own
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:31,680	| serial-s02-e05 |	For the hardship you put other soldiers through
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:33,472	| serial-s02-e05 |	Are the rumors of treachery
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:37,312	| serial-s02-e05 |	Lieutenant Colonel Jason a Marino retired
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:38,336	| serial-s02-e05 |	Also worked on post
EDL	00:30:39,104	00:30:40,640	| serial-s02-e05 |	You know if you ask
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:42,176	| serial-s02-e05 |	People about Bergdahl
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:43,200	| serial-s02-e05 |	If they were
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:46,528	| serial-s02-e05 |	Completely uninformed it was so that's the traitor
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:48,064	| serial-s02-e05 |	If there's someone
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:49,344	| serial-s02-e05 |	Informed it would be
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:51,904	| serial-s02-e05 |	Oh that guy yeah I heard it was a pressure
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:58,816	| serial-s02-e05 |	And if they're a little better informed it would be well people say this but I hear he was a traitor I mean
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:31:03,168	| serial-s02-e05 |	The refrain was was almost always that the guy is a traitor even know
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:04,448	| serial-s02-e05 |	Actually wasn't
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:05,472	| serial-s02-e05 |	Eddie Albert
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:05,984	| serial-s02-e05 |	The trader
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:09,312	| serial-s02-e05 |	So that attitude
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:11,616	| serial-s02-e05 |	Was everywhere up and down the chain of command
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:16,480	| serial-s02-e05 |	Jason said he was once in a meeting with a general and they had to cut it short
EDL	00:31:16,480	00:31:19,808	| serial-s02-e05 |	Because a general got so worked up about the fact that Bo had walked off
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:22,368	| serial-s02-e05 |	The general was emotional about it Jason said
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:26,208	| serial-s02-e05 |	It's not that people refuse to help or refuse to do their jobs
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:29,280	| serial-s02-e05 |	Everyone I talk to who is involved in both cases
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:31,328	| serial-s02-e05 |	Said so many people tried so hard on this
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:33,632	| serial-s02-e05 |	It's just that you start to wonder
EDL	00:31:34,400	00:31:36,704	| serial-s02-e05 |	If his attitude is lurking all the way to the
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:37,472	| serial-s02-e05 |	The top
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:39,776	| serial-s02-e05 |	Then what ideas are not getting through
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:40,800	| serial-s02-e05 |	What's not even getting
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:41,568	| serial-s02-e05 |	Opposed
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:44,384	| serial-s02-e05 |	Because someone Lowdown fear saying something unpopular
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:48,992	| serial-s02-e05 |	Several people told me that for quite a while
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:55,136	| serial-s02-e05 |	Bose case languished because no one working on it was influential enough to make big decisions
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:59,744	| serial-s02-e05 |	Who are you who are you
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:02,048	| serial-s02-e05 |	Well I
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:04,096	| serial-s02-e05 |	I am an intelligence analyst
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:05,632	| serial-s02-e05 |	I have been
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:08,960	| serial-s02-e05 |	1999
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:11,264	| serial-s02-e05 |	Is it a person to call Nathan
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:12,800	| serial-s02-e05 |	That is not his real name
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:19,200	| serial-s02-e05 |	You don't want to use his real name because although he's no longer in the military you still working for the military sometimes
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:20,992	| serial-s02-e05 |	And what he did in Bose case
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:23,552	| serial-s02-e05 |	Was so out of school so not done
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:26,112	| serial-s02-e05 |	Are you worried about the consequences for his current job
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:29,696	| serial-s02-e05 |	Nathan did not work directly on Bose case not officially
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:31,744	| serial-s02-e05 |	He was very close to it
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:33,024	| serial-s02-e05 |	Watching from the sidelines
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:36,608	| serial-s02-e05 |	Watching all these people not be able to accomplish much of anything
EDL	00:32:37,888	00:32:39,168	| serial-s02-e05 |	4 times along the way where
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:41,472	| serial-s02-e05 |	Various plans
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:42,752	| serial-s02-e05 |	Options
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:43,776	| serial-s02-e05 |	2
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:45,824	| serial-s02-e05 |	Get him freed
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:47,360	| serial-s02-e05 |	But nobody could
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:49,152	| serial-s02-e05 |	Position or at least
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:49,920	| serial-s02-e05 |	But they could they didn't
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:55,040	| serial-s02-e05 |	Again we're not talking about why Nathan got so personally frustrated
EDL	00:32:55,552	00:32:56,576	| serial-s02-e05 |	But know that he did
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:33:00,416	| serial-s02-e05 |	Especially when it came to what officials were saying to both parents
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:01,440	| serial-s02-e05 |	Bob and Jani Bergdahl
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:03,744	| serial-s02-e05 |	This whole telling them every day or
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:05,792	| serial-s02-e05 |	I once a week or once a month
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:07,328	| serial-s02-e05 |	We're doing everything that we can
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:08,096	| serial-s02-e05 |	Right
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:08,608	| serial-s02-e05 |	That's not enough
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:11,680	| serial-s02-e05 |	You need to do more you need to be doing
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:12,704	| serial-s02-e05 |	What it is you can't
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:15,008	| serial-s02-e05 |	The only way to make that happen
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:17,824	| serial-s02-e05 |	Nathan's estimation with push the topic up
EDL	00:33:17,824	00:33:20,640	| serial-s02-e05 |	Higher than the captains and Majors were working on Bose case
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:22,688	| serial-s02-e05 |	I needed to go as high as it could go
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:27,040	| serial-s02-e05 |	Until it reach someone who could afford to expend political capital on Bo
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:29,856	| serial-s02-e05 |	Meaning ultimately the president himself had to get involved
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:31,904	| serial-s02-e05 |	So Nathan start thinking about
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:34,464	| serial-s02-e05 |	How do you catch the president's attention
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:37,280	| serial-s02-e05 |	He did what an Intel analyst does
EDL	00:33:37,280	00:33:39,328	| serial-s02-e05 |	He thought what assets haven't we tapped
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:40,608	| serial-s02-e05 |	And it came to him
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:41,632	| serial-s02-e05 |	The berghoff
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:44,960	| serial-s02-e05 |	He thought he could get both parents to push the buttons
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:46,752	| serial-s02-e05 |	Maybe Bo's case could get unstuck
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:49,568	| serial-s02-e05 |	About a year-and-a-half into the case
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:52,128	| serial-s02-e05 |	Nathan sent a message to the bergdahl's on Facebook
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:55,456	| serial-s02-e05 |	He said to them the things that nobody else seemed to want to say
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:33:58,016	| serial-s02-e05 |	Like what were the bun things you could say that
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:00,064	| serial-s02-e05 |	Refinish it bad
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:01,600	| serial-s02-e05 |	You know that
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:02,112	| serial-s02-e05 |	I'd listen to
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:04,416	| serial-s02-e05 |	It's not as
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:06,464	| serial-s02-e05 |	This is difficult
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:06,976	| serial-s02-e05 |	And here's why
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:11,840	| serial-s02-e05 |	Nobody wanted to they want to tiptoe around
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:14,400	| serial-s02-e05 |	Nathan said contacting them was the
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:16,192	| serial-s02-e05 |	The scariest thing he'd baby ever done
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:18,240	| serial-s02-e05 |	Because he wasn't a high of guy
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:19,520	| serial-s02-e05 |	Wasn't even his job to look for
EDL	00:34:20,544	00:34:23,360	| serial-s02-e05 |	And well it wasn't illegal he wasn't telling them anything classified
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:25,152	| serial-s02-e05 |	Contacting them
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:25,920	| serial-s02-e05 |	Was so on
EDL	00:34:25,920	00:34:26,944	| serial-s02-e05 |	Professional in the world
EDL	00:34:26,944	00:34:27,456	| serial-s02-e05 |	She comes from
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:28,736	| serial-s02-e05 |	It's
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:31,040	| serial-s02-e05 |	You don't want to get personal info
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:33,088	| serial-s02-e05 |	Typically with an analyst
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:35,392	| serial-s02-e05 |	You definitely want to keep your personal feelings out of it
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:37,184	| serial-s02-e05 |	You start injecting bias in there
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:40,000	| serial-s02-e05 |	Starts becoming a problem
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:42,048	| serial-s02-e05 |	In most cases
EDL	00:34:42,560	00:34:44,864	| serial-s02-e05 |	This was definitely a case though that's
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:46,912	| serial-s02-e05 |	You needed to be personal
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:48,448	| serial-s02-e05 |	You needed to
EDL	00:34:49,472	00:34:50,496	| serial-s02-e05 |	There needs to be a face on
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:53,312	| serial-s02-e05 |	The bird dolls where the sad
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:56,128	| serial-s02-e05 |	Scared Fierce determined parents of a p o w
EDL	00:34:56,896	00:34:58,688	| serial-s02-e05 |	Nathan says he made it plain to them
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:35:00,480	| serial-s02-e05 |	You have more power than you know
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:01,760	| serial-s02-e05 |	People will take meetings
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:03,808	| serial-s02-e05 |	People will return your calls
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:05,344	| serial-s02-e05 |	At least give you 5 minutes
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:11,744	| serial-s02-e05 |	Bob was no slouch he knew how to use his 5 minutes he'd studied the conundrum of his son circumstances
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:18,144	| serial-s02-e05 |	Begin to learn Pashto poured over Islamic law read about pashtun tradition to see if there was some loophole he
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:20,704	| serial-s02-e05 |	Can find some argument he can make for bows release
EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:23,520	| serial-s02-e05 |	He understood the history and the politics of the region
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:26,848	| serial-s02-e05 |	And he was already knocking on doors and asking questions
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:29,152	| serial-s02-e05 |	Nathan tried to leverage that
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:32,480	| serial-s02-e05 |	Why don't you go talk to somebody to join Chiefs
EDL	00:35:32,480	00:35:33,504	| serial-s02-e05 |	And I'm in bed
EDL	00:35:33,504	00:35:35,552	| serial-s02-e05 |	Weather going to tell you no
EDL	00:35:36,064	00:35:37,088	| serial-s02-e05 |	So
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:44,000	| serial-s02-e05 |	He he would and he eventually
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:45,280	| serial-s02-e05 |	Eventually
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:52,704	| serial-s02-e05 |	The chairman of the Joint Chiefs is the principal military advisor to the Secretary of Defense and to the Press
EDL	00:35:52,704	00:35:59,104	| serial-s02-e05 |	President who didn't have 25 media companies writing an open letter urging action by the secretary
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:36:05,248	| serial-s02-e05 |	State that sometimes happens for foreign correspondents he didn't have Ransom insurance as employees of private companies
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:10,880	| serial-s02-e05 |	His parents weren't switch DC players there are people who lived in rural Idaho
EDL	00:36:10,880	00:36:13,440	| serial-s02-e05 |	Bose case wasn't going anywhere
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:19,584	| serial-s02-e05 |	They needed someone heavy to think Bo was were thinking about and then they needed that person to give it a push
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:21,888	| serial-s02-e05 |	So that was the plan
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:23,936	| serial-s02-e05 |	Apply pressure in Myriad ways
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:29,056	| serial-s02-e05 |	Make it so that people with influence just happened to start hearing about Bowe Bergdahl from various sources
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:31,360	| serial-s02-e05 |	Get them to perk up taking interest
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:34,176	| serial-s02-e05 |	And then that way inch closer and closer to the present
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:37,504	| serial-s02-e05 |	Nathan began talking to the bird dogs regularly
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:40,576	| serial-s02-e05 |	Maybe monthly maybe weekly depending on what was going on
EDL	00:36:41,088	00:36:42,368	| serial-s02-e05 |	E-Sword guiding them
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:46,976	| serial-s02-e05 |	You know that person or that group or that commander who says he's doing everything he can
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:47,744	| serial-s02-e05 |	Well
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:48,768	| serial-s02-e05 |	He could be doing this
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:52,608	| serial-s02-e05 |	And were they then going back to that commander and saying
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:56,192	| serial-s02-e05 |	What if what if you tried apps have you done that
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:56,960	| serial-s02-e05 |	Yes
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:36:58,752	| serial-s02-e05 |	There was a manipulation
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:36:59,520	| serial-s02-e05 |	Indian going on
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:00,800	| serial-s02-e05 |	That's what makes this bird gif
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:03,360	| serial-s02-e05 |	Were you telling them here's what you need to
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:04,896	| serial-s02-e05 |	Yeah
EDL	00:37:04,896	00:37:06,944	| serial-s02-e05 |	Your face looks worried when you
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:09,248	| serial-s02-e05 |	You say that responded I am quite worried
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:10,528	| serial-s02-e05 |	New York
EDL	00:37:12,320	00:37:13,344	| serial-s02-e05 |	It's just messy
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:13,856	| serial-s02-e05 |	Just message
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:15,904	| serial-s02-e05 |	A question might be
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:20,256	| serial-s02-e05 |	Is the United States could pay blood money to get the CIA contractor Raymond Davis
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:21,536	| serial-s02-e05 |	Out of a Pakistani jail
EDL	00:37:22,048	00:37:24,096	| serial-s02-e05 |	They maybe do something similar for Bo
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:26,912	| serial-s02-e05 |	Some sort of Ransom issue payment that isn't Ransom
EDL	00:37:27,680	00:37:30,240	| serial-s02-e05 |	I'm making that up but that seems like a good question right
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:33,312	| serial-s02-e05 |	I feel like you're kind of running this
EDL	00:37:35,616	00:37:39,968	| serial-s02-e05 |	I don't know Scrappy 2nd and secrets
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:45,600	| serial-s02-e05 |	Mission almost that's like a she was like the shadow of the thing that's happening at the office
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:48,416	| serial-s02-e05 |	Yes we're running support
EDL	00:37:48,416	00:37:50,720	| serial-s02-e05 |	Right-wing supporter totally unofficial
EDL	00:37:50,720	00:37:51,488	| serial-s02-e05 |	Totally unofficial
EDL	00:37:52,256	00:37:53,280	| serial-s02-e05 |	Nathan said
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:53,792	| serial-s02-e05 |	It worked
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:56,352	| serial-s02-e05 |	I can't be specific about how it worked
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:37:57,376	| serial-s02-e05 |	What is it work
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:37:59,680	| serial-s02-e05 |	Bob's Rolodex filled up
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:02,496	| serial-s02-e05 |	With people at the Pentagon and also the White House and
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:03,264	| serial-s02-e05 |	State Department
EDL	00:38:04,032	00:38:07,872	| serial-s02-e05 |	And Nathan believes the continued pressure created a sense of urgency about those case
EDL	00:38:08,384	00:38:10,688	| serial-s02-e05 |	And got it on the desks of the people they were aiming for
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:13,504	| serial-s02-e05 |	It was another part of the strategy
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:14,272	| serial-s02-e05 |	G2
EDL	00:38:14,272	00:38:15,296	| serial-s02-e05 |	To make noise
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:16,064	| serial-s02-e05 |	Sometimes public
EDL	00:38:16,576	00:38:18,112	| serial-s02-e05 |	In a way they hoped would keep those safe
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:21,440	| serial-s02-e05 |	When the ubl raid
EDL	00:38:21,440	00:38:22,464	| serial-s02-e05 |	Osama Bin Laden raid happy
EDL	00:38:22,976	00:38:24,000	| serial-s02-e05 |	That threw everything up
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:25,280	| serial-s02-e05 |	And I would
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:27,328	| serial-s02-e05 |	What's going to happen
EDL	00:38:27,328	00:38:28,864	| serial-s02-e05 |	Is there going to be retaliatory
EDL	00:38:29,376	00:38:30,912	| serial-s02-e05 |	It's on
EDL	00:38:30,912	00:38:32,960	| serial-s02-e05 |	Sergeant Bergdahl they going to take him out in the street
EDL	00:38:34,240	00:38:35,264	| serial-s02-e05 |	Luke Walton
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:36,800	| serial-s02-e05 |	You want to do that then here's this
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:39,360	| serial-s02-e05 |	Nobody knew what was going to happen
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:41,920	| serial-s02-e05 |	That's about the time that Bob put out that video
EDL	00:38:42,944	00:38:44,224	| serial-s02-e05 |	I'm father of capture
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:44,992	| serial-s02-e05 |	US soldier
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:46,016	| serial-s02-e05 |	Robert Burke
EDL	00:38:47,552	00:38:48,320	| serial-s02-e05 |	These are my thoughts
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:50,880	| serial-s02-e05 |	I can remain silent no longer
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:54,208	| serial-s02-e05 |	May of 2011
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:56,256	| serial-s02-e05 |	Just a few days after the bin Laden raid
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:38:57,792	| serial-s02-e05 |	Bob released a video on YouTube
EDL	00:38:58,560	00:39:00,608	| serial-s02-e05 |	Futurist Melissa Holguin and haqqani is
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:02,656	| serial-s02-e05 |	What is main message was straight
EDL	00:39:02,656	00:39:03,680	| serial-s02-e05 |	The Pakistani government
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:05,984	| serial-s02-e05 |	Address the Pakistani Armed Forces
EDL	00:39:07,520	00:39:08,544	| serial-s02-e05 |	I personally appeal
EDL	00:39:09,056	00:39:09,824	| serial-s02-e05 |	General kayani
EDL	00:39:10,848	00:39:11,360	| serial-s02-e05 |	General Pasha
EDL	00:39:12,896	00:39:15,456	| serial-s02-e05 |	Our family is counting on your professional integrity
EDL	00:39:15,968	00:39:16,480	| serial-s02-e05 |	And honor
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:19,040	| serial-s02-e05 |	Secure the safe return of our sun
EDL	00:39:20,064	00:39:22,880	| serial-s02-e05 |	Pasha was commander of Pakistan's intelligence service
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:23,648	| serial-s02-e05 |	Psoriasis
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:26,720	| serial-s02-e05 |	Kayani was the Pakistan Army chief of staff
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:27,488	| serial-s02-e05 |	We are
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:28,256	| serial-s02-e05 |	Fat urination
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:30,048	| serial-s02-e05 |	Diligently help
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:31,584	| serial-s02-e05 |	Our son
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:34,144	| serial-s02-e05 |	Be freed from his captivity
EDL	00:39:35,680	00:39:37,728	| serial-s02-e05 |	There's another striking thing about this video
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:39,008	| serial-s02-e05 |	And that is
EDL	00:39:39,008	00:39:41,568	| serial-s02-e05 |	Bob is asking something of Pakistan
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:42,336	| serial-s02-e05 |	So directly
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:44,128	| serial-s02-e05 |	American officials would not
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:46,432	| serial-s02-e05 |	Are Soldiers there
EDL	00:39:46,944	00:39:48,736	| serial-s02-e05 |	We know they know he's there
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:50,528	| serial-s02-e05 |	Somewhere in What's called the fata
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:52,320	| serial-s02-e05 |	Federally administered tribal areas
EDL	00:39:53,088	00:39:57,952	| serial-s02-e05 |	And all this time the US is setting aside billions of dollars in Aid and Military Support to Pakistan
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:05,120	| serial-s02-e05 |	According to a recent Congressional report between 2002 and 2014 we gave him roughly Thirty billion dollars Ulta
EDL	00:40:05,888	00:40:06,400	| serial-s02-e05 |	Big money
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:08,960	| serial-s02-e05 |	Get we don't seem to be able to say
EDL	00:40:08,960	00:40:09,984	| serial-s02-e05 |	Hey Pakistan
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:10,752	| serial-s02-e05 |	Give them back
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:12,288	| serial-s02-e05 |	Why is that
EDL	00:40:13,312	00:40:15,616	| serial-s02-e05 |	Well again lots of experts later
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:16,384	| serial-s02-e05 |	Now I see why
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:19,456	| serial-s02-e05 |	Diplomacy isn't a snap your fingers kind of business
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:20,224	| serial-s02-e05 |	It's a long game
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:24,320	| serial-s02-e05 |	And in the long run would like to stay on decent terms with Pakistan
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:25,856	| serial-s02-e05 |	For some important reasons
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:32,256	| serial-s02-e05 |	Pakistan have nuclear weapons which would really like them to keep a lid on it also like to keep our air and ground supply lines
EDL	00:40:32,256	00:40:33,024	| serial-s02-e05 |	Open in Pakistan
EDL	00:40:33,536	00:40:39,936	| serial-s02-e05 |	Get stuff for people in Afghanistan Pakistan Al Qaeda leaders and somehow
EDL	00:40:39,936	00:40:46,336	| serial-s02-e05 |	Continue many influential people in our government would also like our drones to keep flying and some
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:52,224	| serial-s02-e05 |	Killing people inside Pakistan as well and we've got long-term development goals are to
EDL	00:40:52,224	00:40:58,624	| serial-s02-e05 |	We'd like to keep helping pakistanis with education and clean water maybe because we're just nice like that but more like
EDL	00:40:58,624	00:41:04,768	| serial-s02-e05 |	Likely because we want to keep them on our side because of Pakistan goes away of say Iran becomes our enemy
EDL	00:41:05,280	00:41:06,304	| serial-s02-e05 |	Plus those nuclear weapons
EDL	00:41:07,072	00:41:09,376	| serial-s02-e05 |	That's the scenario would very much like to avoid
EDL	00:41:10,400	00:41:14,496	| serial-s02-e05 |	So when we might risk our relationship with Pakistan in order to take out Osama bin Laden
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:17,312	| serial-s02-e05 |	We're not going to jeopardize it not to that degree
EDL	00:41:17,312	00:41:18,592	| serial-s02-e05 |	41 US servicemen
EDL	00:41:19,104	00:41:22,176	| serial-s02-e05 |	We are not going to come out publicly and boss Pakistan around
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:23,456	| serial-s02-e05 |	If if we could do that
EDL	00:41:23,456	00:41:25,504	| serial-s02-e05 |	Or call their leaders a bunch of liars
EDL	00:41:27,040	00:41:32,160	| serial-s02-e05 |	Ambassador Marc Grossman who is the state Department's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan
EDL	00:41:32,160	00:41:35,744	| serial-s02-e05 |	Meetings with high-level Pakistani government officials
EDL	00:41:36,512	00:41:37,792	| serial-s02-e05 |	But he didn't expect them to do much
EDL	00:41:38,560	00:41:40,352	| serial-s02-e05 |	He said expectations are low
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:42,912	| serial-s02-e05 |	But you do it because it's right and you never know what's going to happen
EDL	00:41:44,192	00:41:47,264	| serial-s02-e05 |	And he said if you say to the bird dolls and to the public
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:48,800	| serial-s02-e05 |	We're doing everything we can
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:51,360	| serial-s02-e05 |	Then you better be doing everything you can
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:56,991	| serial-s02-e05 |	2012-2013
EDL	00:41:57,503	00:41:59,551	| serial-s02-e05 |	Couple of army generals decided to do something
EDL	00:42:00,063	00:42:00,575	| serial-s02-e05 |	Separately
EDL	00:42:01,343	00:42:05,439	| serial-s02-e05 |	One of the generals realized the PRT Matt centcom was willfully understaffed
EDL	00:42:05,439	00:42:06,207	| serial-s02-e05 |	Wasn't getting anywhere
EDL	00:42:06,975	00:42:09,023	| serial-s02-e05 |	You signed an elite unit to the task
EDL	00:42:09,023	00:42:09,791	| serial-s02-e05 |	A Delta Force
EDL	00:42:10,303	00:42:10,815	| serial-s02-e05 |	Big deal
EDL	00:42:13,375	00:42:14,143	| serial-s02-e05 |	Which helped
EDL	00:42:14,143	00:42:17,215	| serial-s02-e05 |	Leaving so the pr team never got the until it hoped for
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:19,263	| serial-s02-e05 |	And then another Jenner
EDL	00:42:19,775	00:42:21,567	| serial-s02-e05 |	Soon-to-be 4-star also got involved
EDL	00:42:22,079	00:42:23,871	| serial-s02-e05 |	General Bob Bergdahl also met with

EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:08,415	| serial-s02-e05 |	Jason is as close as you could get to putting GI Joe on the Bergdahl case
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:14,303	| serial-s02-e05 |	His Stellar career nearly unraveled last year in connection with his work on hostage recovery
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:15,583	| serial-s02-e05 |	Which maybe you heard about

EDL	00:43:26,847	00:43:30,175	| serial-s02-e05 |	That was supposed to find solutions to some of the Army's biggest problems
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:35,295	| serial-s02-e05 |	This group work for General John Campbell who was in charge of operations and plans for the Army
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:37,599	| serial-s02-e05 |	My producer David Chavez interview Json
EDL	00:43:38,111	00:43:39,647	| serial-s02-e05 |	General Campbell just seemed
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:41,695	| serial-s02-e05 |	Almost
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:44,511	| serial-s02-e05 |	Haunted by the fact that
EDL	00:43:45,023	00:43:49,119	| serial-s02-e05 |	That we had gotten Bergdahl home it was just the way he said it to us
EDL	00:43:49,887	00:43:52,447	| serial-s02-e05 |	That this wasn't just idle banter it was really
EDL	00:43:52,959	00:43:54,751	| serial-s02-e05 |	If there's anything you could do
EDL	00:43:54,751	00:43:58,079	| serial-s02-e05 |	You know more emotional than than a tactical sword
EDL	00:43:58,591	00:44:02,943	| serial-s02-e05 |	Yeah absolutely with General Campbell it was a heartfelt
EDL	00:44:03,967	00:44:05,503	| serial-s02-e05 |	Do you know how do we get him home
EDL	00:44:08,319	00:44:09,087	| serial-s02-e05 |	That struck me
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:11,647	| serial-s02-e05 |	And after the meeting
EDL	00:44:11,647	00:44:13,439	| serial-s02-e05 |	I grabbed a couple of my planners
EDL	00:44:14,207	00:44:14,719	| serial-s02-e05 |	And
EDL	00:44:15,743	00:44:16,767	| serial-s02-e05 |	Yeah I said to him
EDL	00:44:18,559	00:44:20,607	| serial-s02-e05 |	It seems like something is really f***** up here
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:22,911	| serial-s02-e05 |	Man. That was just the feeling that I had
EDL	00:44:25,727	00:44:28,543	| serial-s02-e05 |	Jason and his team decided to do an audit of Bose case
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:31,359	| serial-s02-e05 |	Who was doing what all those years why I hadn't work
EDL	00:44:32,127	00:44:34,943	| serial-s02-e05 |	What they found is that the effort seems to be moving along to track
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:37,503	| serial-s02-e05 |	Socom was trying to put together plans
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:41,343	| serial-s02-e05 |	So, Special Operations Command which runs elite units
EDL	00:44:41,343	00:44:43,135	| serial-s02-e05 |	Think Delta Force or Navy Seals
EDL	00:44:43,647	00:44:46,719	| serial-s02-e05 |	And then Jason said they could see that the state department was on it
EDL	00:44:46,719	00:44:47,999	| serial-s02-e05 |	Trying to work with Qatar
EDL	00:44:47,999	00:44:50,047	| serial-s02-e05 |	Trying to get the Taliban to the negotiating
EDL	00:44:50,047	00:44:50,559	| serial-s02-e05 |	Table
EDL	00:44:51,071	00:44:57,215	| serial-s02-e05 |	A meeting seed had with FBI and others Jason learned but wasn't the only one being held hostage by the haqqanis
EDL	00:44:57,727	00:45:00,799	| serial-s02-e05 |	There's Caitlan Coleman and Josh Boyle and their child
EDL	00:45:00,799	00:45:02,847	| serial-s02-e05 |	And there were others also nearby
EDL	00:45:02,847	00:45:06,943	| serial-s02-e05 |	Warren Weinstein was being held by Al-Qaeda he was subsequently killed in a drone strike
EDL	00:45:07,967	00:45:14,111	| serial-s02-e05 |	Knowing about all these others shook Jason pretty hard I was in uniform for 27 years
EDL	00:45:14,111	00:45:17,183	| serial-s02-e05 |	Yeah for me the notion of not leaving a soldier behind
EDL	00:45:17,183	00:45:19,487	| serial-s02-e05 |	Do you know that you internalize that
EDL	00:45:19,487	00:45:21,023	| serial-s02-e05 |	And for me it was just always
EDL	00:45:21,535	00:45:24,863	| serial-s02-e05 |	A false assumption that America doesn't leave Americans behind
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:26,911	| serial-s02-e05 |	I I've never been
EDL	00:45:26,911	00:45:29,471	| serial-s02-e05 |	Put in such a ridiculous position before
EDL	00:45:30,495	00:45:33,311	| serial-s02-e05 |	Wait through these Americans that nobody gives a f*** about
EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:35,871	| serial-s02-e05 |	Nobody is doing anything to get them home
EDL	00:45:37,919	00:45:41,503	| serial-s02-e05 |	Are greater bureaucracy is treating their families
EDL	00:45:41,503	00:45:45,087	| serial-s02-e05 |	Horribly while telling the families to just shut up and wait
EDL	00:45:45,087	00:45:46,111	| serial-s02-e05 |	I mean
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:51,487	| serial-s02-e05 |	Tamia it was bordering on criminal how we're treating our common citizens
EDL	00:45:52,255	00:45:55,071	| serial-s02-e05 |	Jason's Mission had been to try to figure out how to get bow back
EDL	00:45:55,583	00:45:57,119	| serial-s02-e05 |	Now he added another mission
EDL	00:45:57,631	00:45:58,655	| serial-s02-e05 |	Why not try for more Hosta
EDL	00:46:01,215	00:46:03,263	| serial-s02-e05 |	So Jason's team comes up with a couple of alternative
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:07,615	| serial-s02-e05 |	He start shopping around one idea in particular and gets pretty far with it
EDL	00:46:08,383	00:46:09,151	| serial-s02-e05 |	But then
EDL	00:46:09,151	00:46:15,551	| serial-s02-e05 |	He can't tell who exactly is in charge of a new headset, that is soon so calm had it yet so
EDL	00:46:15,551	00:46:19,391	| serial-s02-e05 |	Dokkan that assumed the state department had it and months later
EDL	00:46:19,391	00:46:25,023	| serial-s02-e05 |	I after a lot of meeting so I finally figure out that the state department assume that the military had
EDL	00:46:25,023	00:46:30,143	| serial-s02-e05 |	Wow it was this big lupus and come to friend is so come so come to front of the state department
EDL	00:46:30,655	00:46:33,983	| serial-s02-e05 |	And the state department really just referring to DOD
EDL	00:46:34,751	00:46:40,383	| serial-s02-e05 |	But there wasn't anybody there asking the question Steven figure out that it was that big of a mass
EDL	00:46:41,151	00:46:43,455	| serial-s02-e05 |	Jason took the problem to a congressman
EDL	00:46:43,455	00:46:47,807	| serial-s02-e05 |	Which rather surprisingly led to Jason being investigated by the army
EDL	00:46:47,807	00:46:49,087	| serial-s02-e05 |	Country that was all dropped
EDL	00:46:49,599	00:46:51,903	| serial-s02-e05 |	The congressman representative Duncan Hunter
EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:53,951	| serial-s02-e05 |	A veteran of both the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars
EDL	00:46:54,463	00:46:57,023	| serial-s02-e05 |	Proposed legislation to try to fix hostage policy
EDL	00:46:57,791	00:47:01,631	| serial-s02-e05 |	Other people have spoken to in government say Jason's assessment Leeson bows case
EDL	00:47:02,143	00:47:02,911	| serial-s02-e05 |	Wasn't quite Act
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:07,775	| serial-s02-e05 |	That the various agencies were more aware of each other's plans and Jason gave them credit for
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:13,151	| serial-s02-e05 |	But still everyone I talked to agreed with Jason that our system for dealing with us
EDL	00:47:13,151	00:47:14,175	| serial-s02-e05 |	Just wasn't great
EDL	00:47:14,687	00:47:17,247	| serial-s02-e05 |	Cooperation between agencies with Shaggy
EDL	00:47:17,247	00:47:18,527	| serial-s02-e05 |	Policies were sometimes
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:20,319	| serial-s02-e05 |	Inconsistent people weren't on the same page
EDL	00:47:21,087	00:47:24,415	| serial-s02-e05 |	It was especially clear after reporter James Foley was killed
EDL	00:47:24,415	00:47:25,951	| serial-s02-e05 |	Gruesomely and publicly
EDL	00:47:25,951	00:47:26,463	| serial-s02-e05 |	Syria
EDL	00:47:26,975	00:47:28,767	| serial-s02-e05 |	A couple of months after Bill came home
EDL	00:47:29,535	00:47:33,887	| serial-s02-e05 |	December of 2014 President Obama ordered a review of how the US deals with
EDL	00:47:34,399	00:47:35,167	| serial-s02-e05 |	She says
EDL	00:47:35,167	00:47:37,983	| serial-s02-e05 |	And six months later he announced an update and hostage policy
EDL	00:47:38,495	00:47:40,031	| serial-s02-e05 |	Saying that he'd met with the families
EDL	00:47:41,311	00:47:44,127	| serial-s02-e05 |	Acknowledge to them in private what I want to say publicly
EDL	00:47:44,895	00:47:49,759	| serial-s02-e05 |	But it is true that there have been times where are government regardless of Good Intentions as let them down
EDL	00:47:50,527	00:47:52,063	| serial-s02-e05 |	I promised them that we can do better
EDL	00:47:56,415	00:48:02,815	| serial-s02-e05 |	When I first started looking into this question of what did we do to get bow back frankly I didn't think it would be all that difficult
EDL	00:48:02,815	00:48:03,583	| serial-s02-e05 |	To answer
EDL	00:48:04,607	00:48:07,935	| serial-s02-e05 |	Silly me baby but still at least I thought the answer would be linear
EDL	00:48:07,935	00:48:10,239	| serial-s02-e05 |	The chain of events would reveal itself
EDL	00:48:10,239	00:48:12,543	| serial-s02-e05 |	One link leading to another attached to another
EDL	00:48:13,311	00:48:16,895	| serial-s02-e05 |	Instead I found a bunch of people whose stories were all pretty different
EDL	00:48:16,895	00:48:18,943	| serial-s02-e05 |	Baidu central theme was the same
EDL	00:48:18,943	00:48:19,967	| serial-s02-e05 |	Frustration
EDL	00:48:20,479	00:48:23,039	| serial-s02-e05 |	Why are we doing more who's blocking this effort why
EDL	00:48:23,807	00:48:25,087	| serial-s02-e05 |	They describe struggling
EDL	00:48:25,087	00:48:25,855	| serial-s02-e05 |	Against
EDL	00:48:25,855	00:48:29,951	| serial-s02-e05 |	Tangle of competing interests they couldn't control sometimes can't even see
EDL	00:48:29,951	00:48:32,767	| serial-s02-e05 |	It sounded as if there was a scandal to uncover
EDL	00:48:33,535	00:48:37,375	| serial-s02-e05 |	And maybe there was dishonesty and even malevolence in some corners
EDL	00:48:37,375	00:48:39,935	| serial-s02-e05 |	But mostly I think it's because the truth is
EDL	00:48:39,935	00:48:40,703	| serial-s02-e05 |	There's a limit
EDL	00:48:40,703	00:48:44,287	| serial-s02-e05 |	There have to be limits on how much we risk how much we give up
EDL	00:48:44,287	00:48:45,567	| serial-s02-e05 |	I got one person back
EDL	00:48:46,591	00:48:48,639	| serial-s02-e05 |	For long-time balloons
EDL	00:48:48,639	00:48:49,407	| serial-s02-e05 |	Small
EDL	00:48:49,407	00:48:51,455	| serial-s02-e05 |	But of course he wasn't worth it
EDL	00:48:51,455	00:48:54,527	| serial-s02-e05 |	He was tucked in among so many other crises
EDL	00:48:55,039	00:48:56,319	| serial-s02-e05 |	A small fire
EDL	00:48:56,319	00:48:59,135	| serial-s02-e05 |	Smoldering among all these giant fires that also need to
EDL	00:49:00,671	00:49:03,743	| serial-s02-e05 |	The time to deal with him is when he becomes something else
EDL	00:49:03,743	00:49:07,839	| serial-s02-e05 |	Something useful way to put out a bigger fire
EDL	00:49:08,863	00:49:13,727	| serial-s02-e05 |	Family was always against a rescue attempt
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:20,127	| serial-s02-e05 |	He said he studied the afghanistan-pakistan Border in minut detail on Google Earth for 2 weeks after bow went missing
EDL	00:49:20,127	00:49:22,431	| serial-s02-e05 |	Based on where he figured Bo was
EDL	00:49:22,431	00:49:28,063	| serial-s02-e05 |	He thought a rescue in a place like miramshah even for an elite special operations unit wouldn't be viable
EDL	00:49:28,575	00:49:29,855	| serial-s02-e05 |	Was just too dangerous
EDL	00:49:29,855	00:49:34,463	| serial-s02-e05 |	Quote we thought it unethical to risk the lives of numerous individuals
EDL	00:49:34,463	00:49:39,327	| serial-s02-e05 |	Especially when we knew back-channel communication was possible or even actually happening
EDL	00:49:39,327	00:49:42,143	| serial-s02-e05 |	We Believe glow would agree with that ethic unquote
EDL	00:49:43,935	00:49:47,263	| serial-s02-e05 |	Mark talked about not exactly this
EDL	00:49:47,775	00:49:49,823	| serial-s02-e05 |	They talked about how much should have in soccer
EDL	00:49:49,823	00:49:50,591	| serial-s02-e05 |	Device to find him
EDL	00:49:51,103	00:49:52,383	| serial-s02-e05 |	And that initial dose one.
EDL	00:49:53,151	00:49:56,991	| serial-s02-e05 |	Mo said in an Ideal World which he gets isn't the one the military lives in
EDL	00:49:57,503	00:49:59,295	| serial-s02-e05 |	But if he could have directed the initial
EDL	00:50:00,063	00:50:01,343	| serial-s02-e05 |	You would have made it voluntary
EDL	00:50:01,855	00:50:04,415	| serial-s02-e05 |	And he would have been okay with soldiers who hadn't volunteered
EDL	00:50:04,927	00:50:07,487	| serial-s02-e05 |	Because he gets that they didn't understand his true motives
EDL	00:50:12,095	00:50:12,863	| serial-s02-e05 |	Right
EDL	00:50:15,935	00:50:20,031	| serial-s02-e05 |	What's happening because from what they're looking at
EDL	00:50:30,527	00:50:33,343	| serial-s02-e05 |	But what if they had known exactly why I walked
EDL	00:50:33,343	00:50:35,135	| serial-s02-e05 |	What specifically boaz seeing
EDL	00:50:35,903	00:50:36,927	| serial-s02-e05 |	Would it make any difference
