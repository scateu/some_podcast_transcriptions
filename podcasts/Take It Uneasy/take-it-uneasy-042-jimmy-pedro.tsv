EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:38,368	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	So the question for me is
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:39,392	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Your father now
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:40,928	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Your coach now
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:46,048	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Do you and did your dad's struggle that balance between
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:49,120	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	No letting your kid do whatever they want
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:49,632	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	And
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:52,448	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Dragging them Kicking and Screaming to training
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:57,824	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Well I'm a different I'm a different father than my dad was but I also have
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:04:00,384	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	My kids have to live in different shoes than I had to live in
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:06,528	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	So my father wasn't an Olympic champion he wasn't you know a national hero in in
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:10,112	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	He fell short of making the Olympics himself
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:13,696	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	So I was I was almost doing it with him and in for him
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:17,791	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Where's my kids feel like you're doing it for me you know where they
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:18,303	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	State
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:24,191	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Every tournament they go to they have a ton of pressure cuz the whole world is watching them because they're Jimmy Pedro son
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:29,823	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	You know there's a lot of parents that are that can be obnoxious and when their kid beats my kid it's
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:33,407	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	It's the biggest deal on the world so my kids have to deal with all that pressure that
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:34,687	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	No kid should have to deal with
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:39,039	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	So I'm a different father I I give my children to choice
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:43,903	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	What sports to play of course as a yacht as young individuals at all did you know
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:46,719	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	They all competed up until they were teenagers
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:52,607	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	But it's at point I let them decide what sports they want to play what they want to do right now I have a son who's
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:54,911	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Ranked number one in the nation in the sport of wrestling
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:57,215	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	As a sophomore in high school
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:59,519	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Now he's chose wrestling as a sport
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:05,663	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	I have a daughter that went on to play hockey and softball and now she's a freshman in college at Bentley University
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:12,319	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	But I think that they're digital training that they did get when they were young helped mold them as individuals and as good peep
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:15,391	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	And so I wanted him to do it for that same reason
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:19,999	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Anything is possible what certainly is possible but
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:21,791	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	The path to success is
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:23,071	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Doesn't have to acquire
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:27,423	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Excessive pressure from the coaches in the parenting in the early years
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:28,447	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Everybody's different
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:32,287	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	I think everybody is different a response that pressure differently
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:40,479	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	You know what had I been given a choice I could tell you right now I probably would never have made any Olympic teams or
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:41,247	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Wouldn't have
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:44,575	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Excelled in the Sportage you at all cuz it's not something I would have pursued
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:47,903	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	My dad didn't give me the choice and it wasn't until I was about
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:50,975	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	15 years old where I started to become a man
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:54,303	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Start to really want to do this for digital for myself
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:59,935	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Up until that point I was too immature and it didn't understand what was going on and
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:01,471	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	You know I felt all that
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:06,079	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Pressure from my father and I despise doing the training sometimes or
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:12,991	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	You know it was difficult but as 1516 was am pretty damn good at this thing
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:16,831	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	You know what I like being around other athletes and I get to see the
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:22,719	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	At that in a white 1560 is that the travel you start to go away from home you going to Kansas City
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:26,559	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	In Oklahoma or Florida are you going on trips overseas
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:28,863	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Try to become fun as a teenager right
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:30,399	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Get to see the world show
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:33,471	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	That's when I started doing it for me and that's when it really became enjoyable
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:36,799	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	And so in those years. Late teens
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:37,823	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	How did your
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:38,847	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Relationship
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:39,359	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Evolve
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:46,015	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Then it really became I was motivated you know I was always a self-motivated kid anyway but
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:49,599	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Really when I was 15 to 16 I turn the corner and I and I
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:51,647	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Decided that I was
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:55,999	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Giving 100% all the time and in my dad truly became
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:58,559	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Not just a father but
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:02,655	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	I saw him as a great coach somebody that that had a wealth of knowledge
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:07,263	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	That new how to train athletes that knew how to get the most out of his athletes
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:12,383	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	And it did actually expose me to the world I think the biggest credit I can give to my father as a coach
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:14,943	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Is that he sent me away
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:15,967	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	To learn from other people
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:18,783	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	The biggest mistake most coaches make
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:19,807	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Is that
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:22,111	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	They keep their students
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:25,439	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	To themselves and they hold them back from reaching their potential
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:26,719	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Because you were afraid
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:32,863	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Did that students going to go on and learn something special from somebody else and no longer give their their original Coach credit

EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:52,192	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	And it wasn't that the pressure got to me it's just that first round I had
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:56,032	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	The Korean guy was top five guy in the world and he was always a tough match
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:58,592	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	So I just didn't wasn't meant to be
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:01,664	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	But going into 2004
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:03,456	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	I was old I had experience
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:04,992	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	But I wanted it
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:08,832	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	I was hungry again I wasn't afraid I didn't have pressure I will put weight
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:10,112	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	To compete
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:11,136	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	2004
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:13,184	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	You know so I was older
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:15,488	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	But I have the hunger
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:18,304	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	And what happened was ironic with Kayla Harrison
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:22,400	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	You know when she was world champion 2010
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:25,216	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	She tried to repeat
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:26,752	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	In 2011
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:30,848	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Well all you could see it in her training
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:32,384	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	You can see it in her competitions
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:33,152	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	The pressure
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:34,944	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	I'm trying to repeat as world champion
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:42,112	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Was so great she kind of cracked under the pressure she felt it similar to what I did in NC
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:43,392	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Didn't you feel the pressure you don't
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:46,208	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Not sure if you're doing enough you're not sure if you're ready
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:47,488	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	And
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:50,560	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Probably the best thing that ever could have happened to her
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:53,120	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	In 2011 was to lose and finish third
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:54,656	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Because
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:55,424	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	It shut her up
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:28:59,008	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	She wasn't the top dog going into London
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:04,384	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	She was one of the favorites but she wasn't ranked number one she was number four
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:06,944	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	And she's Underdog
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:11,296	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	And she wanted to climb back on the top of the podium again so she she had she was hungry again

EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:40,864	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Replace the Olympic Games for me was a total failure considering I was supposed to win the Olympics so
EDL	00:33:40,864	00:33:45,216	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	That was a hard one to swallow and that's why I couldn't ever swallow it forever
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:46,496	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	I needed to fight again
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:53,408	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	But yeah I could see how somebody like a Taraji who didn't medal in the Olympics super suit

EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:08,512	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	And you can see that like I said in sport
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:12,864	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	You really don't get that same sense of elation
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:14,656	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Anything else in life

EDL	00:47:53,087	00:47:54,367	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	In most people

EDL	00:48:08,703	00:48:09,983	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Because they don't think it's possible
EDL	00:48:11,007	00:48:14,335	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	I never talked about it that is something you taught her and then she just felt like

EDL	00:48:22,271	00:48:24,063	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	She's almost walking through the
EDL	00:48:24,063	00:48:28,671	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Right does the steps that she's visualize a million times I was able to pass that on
EDL	00:48:28,671	00:48:30,975	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	And they say sports is
EDL	00:48:30,975	00:48:31,743	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Like

EDL	00:48:43,519	00:48:44,287	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	We all do the physical
EDL	00:48:48,639	00:48:52,223	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Focus on that side of the game as well as the strategy and
EDL	00:48:52,223	00:48:55,551	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Looking at videos and studying how to be disappointed
EDL	00:48:55,551	00:49:01,695	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	In what are objectives are in this match and I think that also rather than just walk out blindly and just fight
EDL	00:49:03,231	00:49:04,255	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Strategy going in
EDL	00:49:05,791	00:49:08,607	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	I think taking that professional approach to the game
EDL	00:49:09,887	00:49:11,679	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	You know and with our system
EDL	00:49:12,191	00:49:14,495	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	You look at the number of people we have in this dojo
EDL	00:49:15,007	00:49:16,287	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	In terms of elite athletes
EDL	00:49:17,055	00:49:20,127	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	The number of bodies we have to train with this go every doing something right
EDL	00:49:20,639	00:49:25,759	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Right because Japan and Russia and France and everywhere else
EDL	00:49:25,759	00:49:28,063	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	With what we have and we don't have very much money either
EDL	00:49:28,831	00:49:31,391	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	So we're Up Against All Odds yet we're still getting it done
EDL	00:49:33,695	00:49:37,023	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	I'd say hi. How is it different I think I'm a little bit more syrebral
EDL	00:49:37,023	00:49:41,631	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	As a coach then I wasn't it as an athlete because I had to learn a lot of it on my own
EDL	00:49:42,399	00:49:42,911	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	One of the player
EDL	00:49:43,935	00:49:44,959	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Last topic
EDL	00:49:48,543	00:49:50,079	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	But in the last half-decade
EDL	00:49:52,383	00:49:54,175	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Ijf the international Judo Federation
EDL	00:49:54,943	00:49:56,735	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Has made a lot of rule changes

EDL	00:49:59,551	00:50:00,319	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Like crabs

EDL	00:50:05,439	00:50:09,535	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Say whether you think they have had an overall positive or negative effect on Judah
EDL	00:50:10,559	00:50:12,351	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	The IGA have goal
EDL	00:50:12,351	00:50:14,655	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Ways to differentiate

EDL	00:50:16,447	00:50:16,959	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Wrestling

EDL	00:50:19,775	00:50:20,543	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Sports Chalet
EDL	00:50:20,543	00:50:22,079	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	In case the Olympic Committee
EDL	00:50:22,591	00:50:28,991	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	We need to get rid of another sport which sport are we getting rid of
EDL	00:50:28,991	00:50:29,503	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Just get rid of one
EDL	00:50:30,527	00:50:32,063	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	So they really want to differentiate
EDL	00:50:32,063	00:50:35,903	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Itself
EDL	00:50:37,183	00:50:38,719	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Show that was one reason
EDL	00:50:39,743	00:50:42,047	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Second is they tried to make it a little bit more
EDL	00:50:43,327	00:50:44,351	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Fan friendly
EDL	00:50:44,351	00:50:50,751	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Wright's old men how much time has been gripping you know in ripping and gripping so they've taken a lot of the gripping rules
EDL	00:50:50,751	00:50:53,823	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Who's out of the game and you not allowed to break rib so many times anymore
EDL	00:50:54,591	00:50:56,639	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	They thought that was a boring elements of Judo
EDL	00:50:57,151	00:51:00,991	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	But the reality of the situation is that Judith never going to be
EDL	00:51:00,991	00:51:02,527	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Fast and friendly live sport
EDL	00:51:03,039	00:51:03,551	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Interested

EDL	00:51:06,111	00:51:09,183	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	And if you're not a judoka and you don't have an interest in
EDL	00:51:10,463	00:51:11,487	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Fighting is boring
EDL	00:51:12,767	00:51:15,071	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	You'll can be very sore and spectacular
EDL	00:51:15,071	00:51:17,375	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	If you create a story behind it
EDL	00:51:17,887	00:51:19,935	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	And you do a one hour show
EDL	00:51:19,935	00:51:22,239	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	We only showing highlights of

EDL	00:51:27,615	00:51:31,455	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Then show his series of fights and show his throws a submissions and
EDL	00:51:31,455	00:51:33,759	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Income up to watch the final and then
EDL	00:51:34,271	00:51:39,903	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	When the final happened just show the best clips of the final and have some commentary going about what's going on
EDL	00:51:40,927	00:51:45,279	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Then it can be a good sport never be a good live sport because it's very boring and it
EDL	00:51:45,791	00:51:46,559	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Always will be
EDL	00:51:46,559	00:51:47,839	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	No matter what rules you put in
EDL	00:51:48,607	00:51:50,399	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	I love I love wrestling
EDL	00:51:50,399	00:51:52,447	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	But wrestling if you don't know who
EDL	00:51:52,447	00:51:53,727	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Is wrestling
EDL	00:51:53,727	00:51:54,495	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Belaboring
EDL	00:51:57,823	00:52:00,639	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Same with American football know if you truly
EDL	00:52:00,639	00:52:04,991	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	All the Europeans age football so boring you start your stop you start your stop and get it
EDL	00:52:06,015	00:52:09,599	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Aunt because they don't have an interest in any of any team that they don't care who wins
EDL	00:52:10,367	00:52:12,927	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	They're not from New England rooting for the Patriots you know
EDL	00:52:13,695	00:52:15,743	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Set when we watch soccer As Americans
EDL	00:52:16,255	00:52:16,767	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Abhorrent
EDL	00:52:17,279	00:52:23,167	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	We're not rooting for any team that's really the story that people fall in love
EDL	00:52:23,167	00:52:28,543	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Like yeah they do the game
EDL	00:52:28,543	00:52:32,127	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	The fan was at who has never done Judo
EDL	00:52:32,127	00:52:34,943	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Is ever going to enjoy watching Judo and less
EDL	00:52:34,943	00:52:39,039	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	It's a highlight reel in real life
EDL	00:52:39,039	00:52:40,063	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Cool stuff going on
EDL	00:52:40,575	00:52:44,927	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	So I think all the rule changes for for not I don't think they're affecting
EDL	00:52:44,927	00:52:47,487	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	They're not going to check the popularity of the sport
EDL	00:52:47,999	00:52:49,535	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Unquestionably the knock-on effect
EDL	00:52:50,047	00:52:50,815	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	I go to
EDL	00:52:50,815	00:52:52,863	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	All of these big Grand Slam tournaments
EDL	00:52:53,375	00:52:55,167	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	In Abu Dhabi and there's nobody in the stands
EDL	00:52:55,935	00:52:58,495	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	You know you go to all these tournaments and there's nobody watching
EDL	00:52:59,007	00:53:01,311	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Everybody's watching online but nobody's watching
EDL	00:53:01,823	00:53:02,335	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	So
EDL	00:53:02,847	00:53:04,127	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	I think the rule changes
EDL	00:53:04,639	00:53:07,967	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	To be honest with you I think it's gotten more towards sport
EDL	00:53:08,991	00:53:12,831	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Rushed towards if you think about what Judah was founded on it was founded on
EDL	00:53:13,343	00:53:16,927	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	On sport the Olympic sport was founded on self defence
EDL	00:53:16,927	00:53:21,279	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Write as an element as an element of the sport Judo has no self-defense element
EDL	00:53:21,279	00:53:23,327	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Whatsoever anymore it's all about sports
EDL	00:53:24,351	00:53:26,143	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	No dojos really teach
EDL	00:53:27,167	00:53:28,447	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Self defense element of Judo
EDL	00:53:29,471	00:53:30,751	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	In what Allegra
EDL	00:53:30,751	00:53:34,847	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	It's really like grabbing self-defense and some guy attacked me with his legs
EDL	00:53:35,871	00:53:39,967	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Right so they're taking that out of it and even as a judo player who's in the sport
EDL	00:53:39,967	00:53:42,527	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Some guy who's very 6 ft 1
EDL	00:53:42,527	00:53:44,063	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	M545
EDL	00:53:44,063	00:53:47,135	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	He's got really long legs so if he comes in high should be able to grab it
EDL	00:53:47,903	00:53:50,207	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	So you're taking that part of the sports I disagree with that
EDL	00:53:52,255	00:53:57,375	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	I mendakota you know that they're the prearranged movement Nobody Does that anymore really
EDL	00:53:57,375	00:53:59,167	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	You know I was lost a lot of its
EDL	00:53:59,167	00:54:01,983	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	I'm down to just being an Olympic sport
EDL	00:54:01,983	00:54:02,751	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	These days
EDL	00:54:02,751	00:54:04,287	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Which is impractical
EDL	00:54:05,567	00:54:06,335	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	For the masses
EDL	00:54:07,103	00:54:07,615	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Because
EDL	00:54:08,127	00:54:10,687	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	The masses are never going to compete in the sport is too dangerous
EDL	00:54:11,711	00:54:12,223	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Do physics
EDL	00:54:13,503	00:54:19,391	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	So if you like Jiu-Jitsu succeeded because it's taking it to a safe place it's taking it to the ground
EDL	00:54:19,903	00:54:23,487	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Nobody's tumbling and falling and doing 360s in
EDL	00:54:23,487	00:54:24,511	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	They're rolling
EDL	00:54:24,511	00:54:27,327	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	They're getting a good workout during some self-defense
EDL	00:54:31,167	00:54:35,007	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	But that's okay that's what if you want to make the sport popular
EDL	00:54:35,775	00:54:37,567	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Everybody has to be able to do it
EDL	00:54:38,079	00:54:39,103	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	In right now
EDL	00:54:39,615	00:54:41,663	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Judah has become a sport that only the young can do
EDL	00:54:43,199	00:54:44,479	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	That's why I think it's failing
EDL	00:54:45,247	00:54:48,063	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	The question is Judo Olympics in 60
EDL	00:54:48,063	00:54:49,087	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	496
EDL	00:54:49,087	00:54:50,111	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Before that's exactly
EDL	00:54:50,111	00:54:51,391	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	50 years ago
EDL	00:54:52,927	00:54:53,695	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	So
EDL	00:54:53,695	00:54:54,719	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Martial arts
EDL	00:54:54,719	00:54:57,535	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	In general has gone a long way in life
EDL	00:54:57,535	00:54:59,327	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	50 years
EDL	00:54:59,839	00:55:01,119	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	And even night
EDL	00:55:01,119	00:55:04,703	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	I think very importantly thanks to mix martial arts where they kind of
EDL	00:55:05,471	00:55:09,823	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	I'll put like Sumo in karate and all these things together and you realize that
EDL	00:55:09,823	00:55:12,639	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	The grappling Arts have a lot to contribute to
EDL	00:55:13,663	00:55:15,199	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	This is a really effective are
EDL	00:55:16,223	00:55:17,503	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Exciting art
EDL	00:55:17,503	00:55:20,319	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	So where do you think Juno will be this is a weird question
EDL	00:55:20,319	00:55:21,343	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	50 years from now
EDL	00:55:22,367	00:55:24,159	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	So do you think there's something
EDL	00:55:25,951	00:55:26,719	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Timeless
EDL	00:55:27,231	00:55:29,791	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	In the sport of Judo
EDL	00:55:32,863	00:55:34,911	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Jill is trying to become more professional
EDL	00:55:36,191	00:55:39,007	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Right but it's also becoming a very expensive sport
EDL	00:55:39,775	00:55:42,079	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	So then what I see happening over the course of time
EDL	00:55:42,847	00:55:45,151	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Is all of the big programs
EDL	00:55:45,151	00:55:49,759	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	I'm going to continue to be big in the sport of Judo because there in the world
EDL	00:55:50,271	00:55:51,551	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	It's only a big program
EDL	00:55:52,319	00:55:54,111	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	So what's going to happen right now
EDL	00:55:54,879	00:55:56,415	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	They have a Cadet Circle
EDL	00:55:56,415	00:55:58,719	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Show kids 14 to 18 years old
EDL	00:55:58,719	00:56:03,839	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	They can get on a world ranking list and there's a Cadet other Cadets
EDL	00:56:03,839	00:56:05,375	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Then there's a junior circuit
EDL	00:56:05,375	00:56:08,447	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	You know that's up to 21 years old and all these juniors
EDL	00:56:08,959	00:56:11,263	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Have world rankings
EDL	00:56:11,263	00:56:13,823	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Competitions all over the world to develop
EDL	00:56:14,335	00:56:15,359	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	And then there's a senior circuit
EDL	00:56:16,127	00:56:16,895	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	The problem is
EDL	00:56:17,663	00:56:23,039	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	The big countries like a like a Japan and a Brazil and France and Russia
EDL	00:56:23,551	00:56:25,343	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	In all lot of European countries
EDL	00:56:25,855	00:56:29,183	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	They have the budgets and they're investing in their youth
EDL	00:56:29,183	00:56:30,719	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Ultimately Road
EDL	00:56:30,719	00:56:32,511	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Run from Cadet to Junior to
EDL	00:56:33,279	00:56:33,791	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Tasheen
EDL	00:56:34,303	00:56:39,679	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	So they're going to continue to flourish as countries and get stronger and invest more money in
EDL	00:56:40,191	00:56:40,959	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Grow
EDL	00:56:40,959	00:56:43,519	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	All of the other countries including America
EDL	00:56:44,287	00:56:45,567	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Who don't have money
EDL	00:56:46,079	00:56:50,175	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Why don't we invest any money right now at all
EDL	00:56:50,175	00:56:52,735	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Not even I figured our Cadets are cadets
EDL	00:56:52,735	00:56:54,271	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	We the parents
EDL	00:56:54,271	00:56:57,343	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Have to pay us Judo just to have their kid dude you know but
EDL	00:56:58,367	00:57:00,159	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	We don't give us nothing and I Junior
EDL	00:57:00,159	00:57:01,695	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Cuz we don't have the budget for it
EDL	00:57:01,695	00:57:06,303	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	So all we focus on it the elite side and it's becoming more and more expensive
EDL	00:57:07,071	00:57:07,583	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	2
EDL	00:57:08,863	00:57:11,423	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Fun visa to qualify for the Olympics
EDL	00:57:11,423	00:57:14,751	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Soon as you shut off that opportunity for us to qualify for the Olympics
EDL	00:57:15,775	00:57:16,799	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Gerald's gone in America
EDL	00:57:17,311	00:57:18,335	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	It'll be non-existent
EDL	00:57:19,103	00:57:19,871	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Okay so
EDL	00:57:19,871	00:57:23,967	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	That's the direction we're headed we have less Elite athletes today in America
EDL	00:57:23,967	00:57:24,991	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Then we did
EDL	00:57:24,991	00:57:26,271	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	4 years ago
EDL	00:57:26,271	00:57:29,087	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Then we did eight years ago then we did back in the 70
EDL	00:57:29,599	00:57:31,647	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Is less elite players today than there was that
EDL	00:57:33,951	00:57:35,487	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	The more expensive it becomes
EDL	00:57:35,999	00:57:38,303	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	I don't even see countries countries like
EDL	00:57:40,095	00:57:40,607	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Peru
EDL	00:57:41,375	00:57:42,143	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	And
EDL	00:57:42,911	00:57:47,007	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	A lot of the South American countries Argentina
EDL	00:57:47,007	00:57:48,799	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Good full teams of athletes
EDL	00:57:49,311	00:57:53,407	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Nowadays the number of athletes that are competing at the world
EDL	00:57:53,407	00:57:56,735	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	The less and less and less and less there less money
EDL	00:57:56,735	00:57:59,039	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	If no budgets they're going to disappear
EDL	00:57:59,039	00:58:01,087	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	So what you do is going to be, is going to become
EDL	00:58:01,855	00:58:03,903	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	A much smaller sport
EDL	00:58:04,671	00:58:07,231	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	In terms of number of countries that participate
EDL	00:58:07,231	00:58:11,327	| take-it-uneasy-042-jimmy-pedro |	Cuz there's no going to be any programs in any of those other countries that can compete with the rest of the world
