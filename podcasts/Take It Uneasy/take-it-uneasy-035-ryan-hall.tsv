EDL	00:00:58,112	00:00:58,624	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	About the
EDL	00:00:59,392	00:01:01,184	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Value of keeping a stoic expression
EDL	00:01:02,208	00:01:03,744	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	No matter how difficult things get
EDL	00:01:05,536	00:01:06,304	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Explain that principle
EDL	00:01:06,816	00:01:10,400	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Absolutely I think obviously at you know things that we
EDL	00:01:10,912	00:01:17,056	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And it was thinking internally you know are expressed outwardly and all in the way that we act in the way we feel in the way again on the
EDL	00:01:25,760	00:01:27,296	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Smiling and feeling happy
EDL	00:01:30,880	00:01:33,696	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Angry she kind of face you know not only am I
EDL	00:01:34,208	00:01:40,608	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Showing what that whatever my opponent or the other guy his doing is bothering me which is certainly,
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:41,632	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	For anybody that's kind of tough
EDL	00:01:42,912	00:01:49,312	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I'm also telling myself that I'm concerned and whatnot so it's no different than if somebody hit you really hard in the face just stare
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:53,152	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Nothing happened that's irrelevant
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:55,456	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I'm all that matters is that you're not going to show
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:03,904	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Can you watch Jerry Rice score a touchdown
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:07,744	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Take some ball headed to the referee and kind
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:10,560	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Watch out cuz I think he has a feeling he'll be back in there later today
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:15,936	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	What's he drops a passenger he's frustrated but he doesn't throw a tantrum
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:20,288	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Because it's not going to contribute positively towards catching the ball in anyway
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:24,640	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And if anything is going to show the opposition that he's getting frustrated that they can get to him
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:30,784	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	So I think it is very very important regardless of you know the situation to again and try to keep your emotions in check
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:32,064	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	They take you out to develop
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:41,536	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Again in of course she and you can
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:46,912	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Anyone can be frustrated anyone can be happy to be several people we all have emotions and what not butter
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:53,824	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Basically you know. The more you can train yourself to master that the better because people
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:55,616	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Pretty tops with you say it a little bit flustered
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:59,200	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And they become less so and everyone is is subject to that
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:06,112	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	So in the same way that we trained technique can we train you know conditioning and we try and try and we try and everything else we should be training on
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:09,440	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Has Walter try to respond in as much as we control the fashion as possible
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:12,000	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	You talked about moral victory
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:15,328	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Can you explain how your morality contributes to
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,352	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Do AC
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:17,376	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	The value of winning
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:21,728	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I think there's absolutely
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:25,568	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	They are trying to manipulate you or trying to get you to buy something
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:28,384	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Differently in two directions
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:31,200	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Can you compete against
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:32,736	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	A real black hole
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:39,136	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And you compete against
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:41,952	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Is almost zero
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:46,560	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	However if you go out there and you try hard
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:49,120	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Whether you come off the mat
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:51,680	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	To be very fortunate unlikely but
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:57,568	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	If you want answering you tried and you again I'll let you had some nerves but
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:58,848	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Captainshack
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:00,128	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Can you fart hard you didn't like it
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:00,640	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	The better of you
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:03,712	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	You know that would be in my opinion a moral
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:06,784	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Will be nothing wrong for recognizing
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:08,064	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Shots now that's not the same thing
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:09,600	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Is an actual physical victory
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:12,160	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But there's nothing wrong with saying what's a
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:15,232	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Your your opponents 260000 you're a hundred and twenty
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:16,512	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And you tie
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:18,559	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	They get the decision
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:24,959	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Hey you know that happened in the world
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:25,471	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	2008
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:29,055	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Bellator super heavyweight
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:35,455	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Generally speaking if you end up
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:36,479	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Level
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:39,551	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Considering that I have all the resources you don't
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:47,743	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Make sure that I'm not shooting
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:49,791	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I'm shooting for the actual
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:51,071	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But every now and then
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:56,191	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	It's very important to keep in mind that you know I might just asking myself and my conduct myself in a way
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:59,519	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	That I respect that hopefully other people of value or respect
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:02,847	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And also a way that I believe is going to produce
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:05,919	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Actual Victory and actual positive results in a long run
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:07,711	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I think it's important to recognize that
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:10,783	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Because sometimes you'll see people get very frustrated let's say Frances if I
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:12,831	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Box against people that have much more experience than me all the
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:17,695	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Anyone that tells you differently
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:20,767	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Has is either not training with people that are very good or B
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:22,047	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	They have no idea what they're talking
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:23,839	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:30,239	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	What I can say is hey did I do a little bit better today
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:34,335	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	More able to kind of keep my keep my focus and see what I wanted execute
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:41,759	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I'm moving in the right direction so as far as I'm concerned is all sorts of different types of moral Victory but it will be there
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:44,063	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	The same thing as you know that's a princess
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:45,343	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	You know your mother
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:47,135	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	You got ahead of me
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:48,415	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	You have to
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:50,207	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	He's going to kick the s*** out of you almost certain
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:51,999	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Have to hit him
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:54,559	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	It would not be it would be
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:57,887	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I didn't get hurt so that's a win if you ran away
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:06:00,191	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But that would be the opposite of the moral Victory and
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:03,775	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Losing would still be I would say the honorable thing to do
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:06,847	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	So you're saying sometimes you have to pay the price for them all the time
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:10,175	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Absolutely but the reality is is the martial arts a dozen
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:15,551	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Just teaches about how to beat someone offer technique of this is that that's really not the core of the martial arts Decor the martial arts
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:18,623	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Heart discipline dedication Focus
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:20,671	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And if you have those things
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:22,463	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Better than you
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:26,559	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But that's not the only metric by which you can judge performance or judge a person
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:29,375	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	You competed more than
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:32,447	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Many of the elite level guys
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:34,495	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Some
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:37,823	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And you
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:38,591	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Competition
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:41,663	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	What do you think is the value of competition for martial artists
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:46,015	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I believe that the value of competition is and that it teaches you the true
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:46,783	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Purpose of
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:51,647	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Martial arts

EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:17,247	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And strong opposition it will force YouTube
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:22,879	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	The better your opposition is if you focus and you take your what you're doing serious is the better you become

EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:51,551	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	That was a cowardly way to approach
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:53,343	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Did you intentionally left yourself an hour
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:54,111	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Which was

EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:18,175	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	My gym and that's not how we conduct ourselves
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:19,455	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And it has
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:20,735	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Weigh less to do about this
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:22,783	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	The physical you know the result

EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:08,863	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Performance perspective is the most honest
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:12,191	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Because
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:14,751	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Courage and take some heart to really properly prepare
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:16,543	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And put it online because you're risking

EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:33,087	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And if you search for discipline
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:34,111	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Define liberty
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:37,183	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Because you're able to make yourself do what you want
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:43,327	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	In the long run where is it

EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:58,943	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But as long as you're making it
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:02,271	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Incredibly large amount of respect
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:07,135	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	The level of dedication that end the level of commitment
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:08,671	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Risk that it that you're taking
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:10,719	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Emotionally psychologically
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:13,023	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Like I said you work 20 years you get that gold medal
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,583	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But there's other people that work 20 years

EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:38,623	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Themselves they won't like most people would press a button in my experience
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,903	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Look like
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:40,671	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	The thing then
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:44,511	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	That's it that's fine but

EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:59,359	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But you guarantee that the I mean from a physical
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:04,223	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	You'll have to learn discipline you will have shown
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:06,783	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	You showed that
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:10,879	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	You are the master of your own mind of your own body and if you're on circumstance and you can
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:14,975	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Discipline yourself in focus and you deny yourself certain things
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:16,511	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	In the pursuit of something
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:18,047	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Something that is valuable
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:25,215	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Not talking to me why the same reason that you'll see guys that were
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:25,983	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	You know like
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:29,567	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	High-level military like kind of big dogs in SF world
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:32,127	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Get hired by let's say for instance the Fortune 500
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:34,175	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	What would they know about
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:34,943	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Business
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:35,455	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Nothing
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:36,991	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Everything
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:38,271	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Because
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:41,599	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	That level of focus and dedicated like you don't get to that level of a

EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:43,391	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	By accident
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:47,743	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	That's what I think
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:49,535	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	What they do competition
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:50,047	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Serious
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:53,887	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Because if you don't get the gold medal is a you may not
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:54,911	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	You may not walk out of it
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:55,935	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But basically on
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:01,055	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And able to
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:02,335	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Over the Long Haul put that
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:03,359	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	What time-in but I have to
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:07,455	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Walking off the mat
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:08,991	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Having to be carried off the
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:10,271	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	It means
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:15,647	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Approaching reassessing reevaluating saying how can I be better
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,671	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:25,631	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	How will I believe I look at myself I'm still buy
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:27,167	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I'm still looking
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:27,935	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	At myself
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:28,703	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	What should I be due
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:30,751	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Don't better I'm going to find other people that I respect
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:32,543	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	People that can tell me and then I'm going to ask them
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:34,591	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	The courage to listen to them
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:36,383	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And I just as much with their saying out of
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:39,711	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And if you're doing those things that I believe that a lot of time to work
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:43,295	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Working hard but I know plenty of people to come in

EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:56,863	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But they could be really really really good
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:59,423	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Because they understand how to be direct and how to focus
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:02,239	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Disgusting all before
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:04,799	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Went with some other ain't no friends of mine
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:09,407	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Distressing whatever

EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:35,775	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	A regular person
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:42,943	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	So I think that ultimately the skill it's not.
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:49,343	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Knows how to work their ass off and
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:49,855	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Comprehend
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:55,743	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Yeah and be brutally honest
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:56,511	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Kill yourself
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:59,839	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Sometimes you know it is I think it's
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:00,863	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	The price of
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:01,887	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Eight of looking inward
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:03,679	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	You know objectively is that
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:05,983	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	You're not going to like what you see a lot
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:08,543	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Because even if you're like all men
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:10,591	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I'm 90% the way I want to be
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:14,175	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	If you are going to take the next step in my opinion it's you're going to focus on the temperature
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:16,991	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Because it's like home and we're doing
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:18,271	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Let's talk about what we need to improve on
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:23,647	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	It's what's
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:27,999	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	It's what's going to drive you to a higher level but at the same time I think it's what makes a lot of people that are like that
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:30,559	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	A little bit neurotic and naughty by comparing by a normal standard
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:32,095	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But again you show me someone that
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:35,167	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Super well-adjusted and I'll show you someone that's probably not a high fever
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:37,983	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	In a class you
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:39,775	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	UEFA says they were working with
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:41,055	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Basic laws of physics
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:44,127	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	So I just read the Einstein's biography
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:47,199	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	He was obsessed with finding a single theory that we unify
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:49,503	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	All the fundamental forces of nature
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:54,111	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Do you think their existing unified theory of grappling we can boil everything down to just
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:54,879	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Just a few principles
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:16:01,279	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Unified theory I would sincerely
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:05,887	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Question my ability to go that way but something like that could potentially exist absolutely
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:08,191	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Even if it doesn't
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:11,775	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	A belief in the possibility of it and the search for it
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:14,591	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Leave you better off
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:16,639	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And where you started where as if I was at
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:18,431	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	B******* that would never end and I don't look
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:22,015	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Because I didn't look this certain things I want learn
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,807	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I think you know a lot of times
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:26,623	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	What's Alchemy
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:32,511	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Girls maybe that's
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:34,047	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	That kind of nutty and Dino
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:38,399	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Highly unlikely probability of success Pursuit
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:39,167	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Yielded
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:40,959	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Scientific progress elsewhere
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:42,751	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	In the search for that even though again
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:52,479	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Well if you spend
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:53,759	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	A principle based approach to graph
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:56,319	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	What's your

EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:04,255	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	After all the years of experience what's your process like for learning new details and understanding the principles
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:04,767	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Behind
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:06,047	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Techniques
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:10,911	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I bet you're going to believe that I have
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:11,679	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Like a
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:12,703	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	A singular
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:13,983	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Perfect approached by any stretch of the imagination
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:16,287	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But I mean I guess what I try to do is
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:18,335	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Block out extraneous
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:19,615	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Princess
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:20,639	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Both feet a lot of
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:21,663	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	People want to talk about
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:24,479	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	55 details and reasons for something this
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:25,247	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	What's going on in the reality
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:27,039	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	That you're clouding your thought process
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:28,831	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	There was a reason not to
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:29,599	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Political
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:31,647	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But there was a recent issue where
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:33,439	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I remember
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:35,999	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And they use the new drug
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:39,327	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And it was painful
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:40,863	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	What do you believe that capital
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:43,423	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Is valid or not I think it's
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:43,935	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	It's against it
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:47,007	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	In fact I think most of the arguments that make sense or against it
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:48,799	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Pain has
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:50,079	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	F*** all to do with it
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:52,383	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	You know I don't care if that's like
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:52,895	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	The helix
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:54,175	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I'm going to kill you
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:56,223	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But don't worry it's not going to hurt
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:03,647	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Show me the steak
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:08,511	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	If someone's going to sting I'm still going to try to fight you to the death
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:12,095	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	If someone wants to say hi
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:15,679	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Let's go let's cut the b******* like fili feelings out of here and say hello
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:16,703	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	You forget the pain
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:20,543	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Does this person deserted
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:22,079	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Is there a potential for human error
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:25,407	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Is there potential for someone having this
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:25,919	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Political games
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:31,551	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	It has nothing to do with does it hurt
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:35,135	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Orc which drug is it
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:36,415	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Hey
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:38,207	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	We're focusing on the wrong
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:44,607	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	In the public in
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:45,375	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Arena
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:46,911	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	They always focus on the wrong thing
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:49,215	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And always hooks on the wrong address
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:51,519	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Good reasons or bad
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:52,287	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	To do almost anything
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:55,103	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But generally speaking people will focus on
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:56,639	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Hundred other ones
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:57,919	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Extraneous and retarded
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:58,687	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	So what I want
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:07,647	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And this guy likes
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:11,231	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	It's really important
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:13,279	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	It's very very important
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:17,631	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:21,471	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Clearly they all work
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:26,591	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Under the right circumstances and don't work on the wrong one and it has nothing to do or very little to do
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:30,175	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	With each other
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:33,503	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Would you prefer to be painless or horrific leaf
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:34,271	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Okay
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:36,575	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	If it's already a foregone conclusion
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:39,135	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I will start to talk about
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:40,415	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Like whether or not it's going to sting
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:46,815	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Hey let's focus on the
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:47,583	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I need to do this
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:48,863	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Okay so
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:53,983	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Yeah it doesn't matter
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:59,359	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But it's a hell of a lot less important than 2500
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:02,687	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Things that make all of the difference
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:03,199	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Is a lot of people
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,503	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Bulshit you
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:07,039	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Will focus on 45 little
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:10,111	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Description details for this technique
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:12,415	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Okay that's true but
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:13,695	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	What are the two most important
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:17,279	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Because it don't matter
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:19,839	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But just like anything else in life is a highway
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:22,911	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Because would you say that would you say that
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:25,727	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Happiness and self-actualization is a valuable thing in life
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:27,519	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I would as well
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:29,567	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And you know what we have the luxury of saying
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:30,335	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	That type of thing
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:35,199	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Because we're sitting at 50/50 Jiu Jitsu in Falls Church Virginia and there's no one trying to kill us rapist
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:36,479	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And we are also
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:37,759	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I know where food is
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:42,879	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	That if you were to walk.
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:43,391	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Feeling
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:44,927	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Stare at you
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:47,231	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	F****** retarded I'm starving
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:48,511	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I'm hungry
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:53,375	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	My issue are you are you satisfied in your life
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:56,959	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	So that's even the deeper question is are you eating something
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:21:01,567	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Right
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:03,103	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	First time we start to work
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:04,127	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Self-actualization
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:09,247	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Don't tell me about where you're placing your

EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:11,551	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	It's like you're all leaning out in your

EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:18,464	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	You know

EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:21,792	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Giving you a philosophy
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:24,096	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	It's like this is retarded
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:25,376	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Doesn't make any sense
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:27,936	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Build a better wall a sharper knife and get some food
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:29,728	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And then we'll cover the all the others
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:37,408	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Feel to be the most important
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:37,920	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Component parts
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:39,200	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And then
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:40,224	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	If I won
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:43,296	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Reach the level of where these tiny Details Matter
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:44,064	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	That's fantastic
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:45,088	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	The difference
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:47,136	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Between you know the ability to
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:48,416	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	The past

EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:58,144	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	It's also presupposing that you're in proper
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:21:58,656	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Preposition
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:01,216	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	That even allow these details
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:01,984	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Become relevant
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:03,008	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And I think that a lot of times
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:05,568	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	That's problematic
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:08,128	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Are there still in your opinion
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:11,968	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Undiscovered position submissions a techniques in Jiu-Jitsu
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:12,736	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I would say that
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:14,272	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	They're absolutely
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:18,624	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Think that what we see is you get you now don't get me wrong to the core never change
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:20,160	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Because
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:21,696	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Physics doesn't change physics
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:25,024	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Which is the same thing that's why I get a kick out of people that loves like self-defense argument
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:27,072	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Bullshit has another no physics
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:29,632	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Beyond the fact yes you can
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:31,680	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I've never seen anything like that in real life
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:37,568	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But you're crossing a pretty serious psychological line if you're putting your knuckles too dumb to Knuckles deep into somebody's eyes
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:41,152	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Forget the fact that
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:42,688	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I've never done that before
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:44,480	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Before I wouldn't do it lightly then probably
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:46,784	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Hesitation there what do so anyway
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:49,600	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	What makes it different is the psychological component
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:52,416	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And all these other things going on with
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:55,744	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	No it's not
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:22:58,816	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	It is absolutely not
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:22:59,584	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	What are you talk
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:00,608	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Physics of different inside of
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:03,936	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And they are out in the field
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:05,728	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Exactly the same
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:08,544	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Now if I try to sport grapple you
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:10,592	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Under a non sport grappling
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:18,272	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Jiu-Jitsu is physics is is proper expression of his insanely boxing
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:22,368	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	So
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:26,464	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I would say that as long as something adheres to the principles that that allows
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:28,512	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	To be effective and
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:30,816	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Do you know and fundamentally sound
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:32,608	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	That you can do almost anything
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:34,912	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Take the people will continue for tickling the kids going to get nuts
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:36,960	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I'm just a level of the amount of
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:38,496	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Things that you can get away with it
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:39,008	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Conduent
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:40,544	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Different grips that you can make
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:44,128	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But I'd say what we're looking at right now
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:45,152	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Is going to look
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:45,664	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Only someone
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:47,456	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Like what you just going to look like
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:48,224	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	In 30 years
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:50,272	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	The same way that you get to we see now is
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:52,064	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	So much fundamentally
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:54,624	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Better honestly and and more evolved
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:56,416	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	That it was
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:57,184	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	20 years ago
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:24:01,280	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And people will swear up and down
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:02,560	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Well even 20 years ago
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:05,120	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Understanding hadoop
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:05,888	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Deal with jiu-jitsu
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:09,472	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Very reduced so you can get away with all sorts of
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:11,264	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Pretty questionable
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:13,824	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	. like sitting in front of someone in clothes.
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:15,360	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Jordan have them not completely kick the s*** out of you
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:22,016	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	It is
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:24,064	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	That's I always hesitate to say
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:24,576	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Invent
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:26,112	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Don't like the word invent
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:27,648	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Certain people use a lot
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:31,488	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I'd say discover because you could show me I can come up with something
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:33,792	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	You know
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:37,888	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And I could be doing that in a way that no one ever taught me
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:41,472	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Because you've been doing it forever
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:46,592	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But basically it's a show me the details
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:50,688	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	High-powered I discovered
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:51,456	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Who invented the dab
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:53,248	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	People in head two arms and two legs
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:54,784	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Long as I can
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:56,320	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Probably longer than that
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:24:59,648	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	So in the history books
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:01,696	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	You're a Grappler

EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:20,384	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	All right yeah I hesitate to use the word someone a real judo player will come in and just just facepalm and stare at me
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:22,688	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Mailboxes
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:29,088	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	What do you think is the best martial art
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:32,672	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	For defending yourself against an untrained opponent
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:34,720	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Untrained
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:37,792	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Statistically speaking you go through life
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:41,888	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Minimize the chance of yourself being hurt by the untrained opponent
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:43,680	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	So Street Bar
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:49,056	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Are there so many different factors
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:52,640	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	There's about
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:55,712	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	An ass whipping like seven people vs 3 people in
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:59,552	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Okay that the more variables you add and it gets very very difficult I would say them
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:01,344	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	The best fighting style is using your brain
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:04,672	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Because when winning the fight
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:10,048	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Now I know nothing about investing
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:11,072	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Which is why I don't do it
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:14,912	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But let's say for instance
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:23,872	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Did you get in here
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:28,224	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But he said there's nothing
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:28,992	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	To do the best
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:29,504	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Can do is wait
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:33,344	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But you're Warren Buffett tell me the best investment
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:34,880	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Are the best investment today still suck
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:37,952	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Talk to me next week and I'll see what's up
EDL	00:26:42,304	00:26:42,816	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Maybe
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:47,168	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And then
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:49,216	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	You're going to kill everyone
EDL	00:26:49,984	00:26:50,752	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And you are armed

EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:55,872	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But for whatever reason

EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:37,856	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Because regular people can't fight for s***
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:41,440	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Literally crippled

EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:45,280	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	The other two guys unless they're really serious
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:46,304	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Oh and it hasn't
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:51,936	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	4 people
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:58,336	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Free People
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:28:02,688	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	All these different things factor in so I would say that when it comes to the physical expression of how to best
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:03,968	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Defend yourself the most important thing is
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:05,504	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Situational awareness
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:09,856	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And understanding what's going on around you because you could be the world

EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:14,208	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And still run yourself into a lose-lose situation
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:15,744	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Because
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:16,512	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Starbucks
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:18,816	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And you teach him a runic a joke
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:23,680	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And then you let him put Rodger Gracie in that we're naked choke Rodger Gracie the greatest Grappler
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:24,960	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	In the world

EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:29,056	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And you let him put Rodger in that Renee control can you
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:33,408	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	You think Rodger gets out
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:35,712	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Padres probably bad
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:37,248	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	He's one of the best escape artist
EDL	00:28:37,248	00:28:38,016	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Escape artist
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:42,112	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	You're like a tier 1
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:44,928	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Best of the best f****** tip of the spear awesomedude
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:45,952	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I shoot you in the face
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:46,976	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Do you live
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:49,536	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Mature immature
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:51,584	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Good fight
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:54,144	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	At a certain at a certain point it's gone too far
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:56,448	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	So now who thinks that
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:28:57,728	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	The above average
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:03,872	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Very very slim
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:06,944	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Almost non-existent
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:09,248	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Knockout Floyd Mayweather
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:11,808	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	If you let me hit him
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:13,600	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:15,904	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I don't think I would come in spitting distance of him
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:17,184	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	If he didn't want me to
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:18,976	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I would have no teeth
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:19,744	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Before I even tried
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:22,048	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But if he sits there and let you hit them
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:23,584	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	He is a man
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:24,096	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	He is mortal
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:26,656	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	So basically under the right circumstances
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:27,424	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Does anyone can win
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:29,984	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Under the wrong circumstances
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:32,800	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	So in Spa
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:34,080	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Shredabull
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:35,104	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	As a martial artist
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:35,872	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	In particular Grappler
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:37,664	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Even if she
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:39,968	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Allows the situation to get to far
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:40,992	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	It becomes a
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:42,016	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Lose situation
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:42,528	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Even for him
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:44,064	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	So
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:48,160	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I would say that understanding that is step one
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:48,928	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Effective
EDL	00:29:48,928	00:29:50,208	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Effective strategist
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:51,232	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Can read a situation you say
EDL	00:29:54,304	00:29:55,328	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	4 seconds and run for it
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:30:00,192	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	The physical expression of everything you want to
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:01,472	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	What's a friendship
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:04,544	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Best things for defending yourself in real life
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:08,128	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Say probably wrestling or jiu-jitsu
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:10,432	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Probably Jiu-Jitsu really in my opinion
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:11,456	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:13,248	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Fighting
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:14,016	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I would say
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:17,856	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Beat up more than one person right now it implies that I can wrestle
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:19,648	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Or I can just
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:23,488	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Actually horrible
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:26,048	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	The boxing would be nice as well
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:28,096	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But let's say you're great boxer
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:29,632	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Angular person
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:37,056	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	For sure but it also
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:37,824	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Basically
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:39,872	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	If I had to pick one art and everyone knows nothing
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:41,152	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Owl pictures
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:43,456	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But in my opinion
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:44,992	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Jiu-Jitsu at a high level
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:45,760	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Involves wrestling
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:47,552	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Lookaside grappling is
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:48,832	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	This is bigger
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:50,368	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Everything that involves wrestling June 11
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:54,464	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Inside control
EDL	00:30:55,488	00:30:56,256	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	It's not pleasant
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:31:00,608	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	So it's a popular idea and Jiu-Jitsu that egos
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:01,632	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	You know your greatest enemy
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:03,168	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Have you had
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:05,216	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Made any progress in defeating that out of me
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:08,032	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Does it get stronger as you just a game is better
EDL	00:31:16,480	00:31:17,248	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And they love that s***
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:32,608	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But that's when you also know it
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:35,168	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I don't trust large groups of people
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:37,472	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	And I certainly don't trust their thought process
EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:39,776	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Show me someone that takes losing well
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:45,920	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	What's a princess

EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:49,248	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Because what am I doing

EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:51,808	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But if I go
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:53,600	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	I'm not okay with what just happened
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:31:59,744	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	You're either
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:01,024	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	You're possibly

EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:06,144	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Or more than
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:07,680	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Because again

EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:36,608	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Get out of here
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:39,424	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	If you ask what's
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:50,944	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But the reality is a liar
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:52,736	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	He's bullshitting
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:32:59,648	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	You can say yes
EDL	00:32:59,648	00:33:00,160	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	He is the best
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:01,952	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Or the British was

EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:04,512	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Does that mean he's perfect
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:06,304	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	No absolutely not
EDL	00:33:12,704	00:33:13,216	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But not
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:16,288	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Devolving into like a ridiculous self-love
EDL	00:33:17,824	00:33:20,384	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Patting yourself on the back
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:22,944	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Because you want to believe that with proper working with
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:24,480	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Proper effort that you can achieve
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:24,992	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Anything
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:26,272	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	But
EDL	00:33:26,272	00:33:28,064	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Just you being you
EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:28,576	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Does not do any

EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:35,744	| take-it-uneasy-035-ryan-hall |	Rather than like
