EDL	00:01:01,270	00:01:09,850	| E67_SiE_6 |	People who are a fishing noodles of the second world war knows that the rhythm of the second world war reminds you of an opera. 
EDL	00:01:09,850	00:01:18,710	| E67_SiE_6 |	Or a musical theater production where the end is going to be like the end of the world, a Ragnarok, the regatta damn around in the whole last year of the war is whipping. 
EDL	00:01:18,710	00:01:23,290	| E67_SiE_6 |	Yourself up like a roller coaster going up hill, waiting for that giant dip where you're. 
EDL	00:01:23,290	00:01:38,240	| E67_SiE_6 |	Building up to that horrific the last year, the second world war is the worst year of the second world war and the kind of numbers that demonstrate that are, for example, casualties, killings, look at the German deaths, for example, in January. 
EDL	00:01:38,240	00:01:39,180	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:01:39,180	00:01:40,100	| E67_SiE_6 |	That's a month that is mine.

EDL	00:01:41,180	00:01:41,420	| E67_SiE_6 |	The. 
EDL	00:01:41,420	00:01:43,950	| E67_SiE_6 |	Germans will have more than 400000 of their soldiers. 
EDL	00:01:43,950	00:01:47,170	| E67_SiE_6 |	Maybe close at a 450000 of their soldiers die. 
EDL	00:01:47,170	00:01:51,980	| E67_SiE_6 |	In that month alone, for comparison purposes. 
EDL	00:01:51,980	00:01:52,320	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:01:52,320	00:01:55,600	| E67_SiE_6 |	That is, more military deaths than the United States suffered. 
EDL	00:01:55,600	00:02:14,530	| E67_SiE_6 |	All branches of service all cause of mortality for the whole war, historian Neil Ferguson says the German military loses more soldiers in the last year of the war than the entire rest of the war put together, and some of the latest estimates of casualty numbers suggest the Germans were losing on average. 
EDL	00:02:14,530	00:02:29,680	| E67_SiE_6 |	10000 soldiers every day in 1945, so from January 1st to May 8th, when the war ended in Europe 10000 a day on average, that is almost twice as many people as the United States lost at the battle of Antietam.

EDL	00:02:39,680	00:02:44,210	| E67_SiE_6 |	If you think to yourself and if this would be totally understandable, who cares. 
EDL	00:02:44,210	00:02:46,770	| E67_SiE_6 |	Right, the Germans are reaping what they sowed. 
EDL	00:02:46,770	00:02:49,430	| E67_SiE_6 |	Oh, that would be fine, except it's hardly just the Germans. 
EDL	00:02:49,430	00:02:49,840	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:02:49,840	00:02:50,490	| E67_SiE_6 |	In his book. 
EDL	00:02:50,490	00:02:56,270	| E67_SiE_6 |	"How Wars Ends" Arthur Gideon Rose says that every month in 1945. 
EDL	00:02:56,270	00:03:01,940	| E67_SiE_6 |	Between 100000 and 250000 non combatants in Asia were dying.

EDL	00:03:02,300	00:03:03,220	| E67_SiE_6 |	Again, every month. 
EDL	00:03:03,220	00:03:05,480	| E67_SiE_6 |	Due to the actions of Japanese forces. 
EDL	00:03:05,480	00:03:06,510	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:03:06,510	00:03:12,760	| E67_SiE_6 |	These are data points, but you have to add all the other data points up to and see the conveyor belt(传送带) of death. 
EDL	00:03:12,760	00:03:14,840	| E67_SiE_6 |	The factory assembly line. 
EDL	00:03:14,840	00:03:18,850	| E67_SiE_6 |	Of human destruction that's going on in 1945 or really the last year of the war. 
EDL	00:03:18,850	00:03:20,340	| E67_SiE_6 |	I mean, you don't have to. 
EDL	00:03:20,340	00:03:25,810	| E67_SiE_6 |	Really imagine too much to just know that the holocaust is going on during this time period in Europe. 
EDL	00:03:25,810	00:03:28,550	| E67_SiE_6 |	And people are dying in those camps every day. 
EDL	00:03:28,550	00:03:33,220	| E67_SiE_6 |	So every day the war continues, that tally goes up reliably.

EDL	00:03:34,460	00:03:38,490	| E67_SiE_6 |	I'm reminded of a song by the rock band the M C 5 from the late 1960 s. 
EDL	00:03:38,490	00:03:42,940	| E67_SiE_6 |	Early nineteen seventies, they wrote a song which I think is about the Vietnam War.

EDL	00:03:48,150	00:03:48,680	| E67_SiE_6 |	And to me. 
EDL	00:03:48,680	00:03:50,890	| E67_SiE_6 |	The imagery as horrific as it is. 
EDL	00:03:50,890	00:03:53,160	| E67_SiE_6 |	Works better for the second world war and especially the. 
EDL	00:03:53,160	00:03:55,800	| E67_SiE_6 |	End of the second world war than it does for Vietnam.

EDL	00:03:56,280	00:04:15,494	| E67_SiE_6 |	A lawn mower that cuts human beings of blades of grass or an assembly line that's reliably heading towards a furnace or a chopping machine with people on it, and when the lead singer would say the words, the human being lawnmower, he would emphasize what was going on by then saying. 
EDL	00:04:15,494	00:04:17,309	| E67_SiE_6 |	Chop, chop, chop chop chop human being. 
EDL	00:04:17,309	00:04:18,720	| E67_SiE_6 |	One more chop chop chop chop chop.

EDL	00:04:19,140	00:04:21,690	| E67_SiE_6 |	That's what's going on in the last year of the war. 
EDL	00:04:21,690	00:04:37,710	| E67_SiE_6 |	So why is the last year of the war still going on, Neil Ferguson in his book the war of the world, quotes an aide to US general Omar Bradley, who is fighting the Third Reich in Europe, and the aid made this statement, Ferguson says at the end of 1944. 
EDL	00:04:37,710	00:04:42,010	| E67_SiE_6 |	And the statement was quote, if we were fighting "reasonable people"
EDL	00:04:42,010	00:04:48,640	| E67_SiE_6 |	They would have surrendered long ago, end quote, but they're not fighting reasonable people. 
EDL	00:04:48,640	00:04:50,510	| E67_SiE_6 |	Clearly, they're fighting. 
EDL	00:04:50,510	00:04:53,300	| E67_SiE_6 |	A fanatical(狂热的) regime in the Third Reich, which is committed.

EDL	00:05:30,310	00:05:38,220	| E67_SiE_6 |	And in the Japanese situation, their military is planning for a last ditch stand. 
EDL	00:05:38,220	00:05:40,490	| E67_SiE_6 |	On the home islands, if it comes to that. 
EDL	00:05:40,490	00:05:46,390	| E67_SiE_6 |	The army thinks they can put two and a half million Japanese soldiers into Japan's built up cities. 
EDL	00:05:46,390	00:05:48,090	| E67_SiE_6 |	And then add to those numbers with a. 
EDL	00:05:48,090	00:05:50,950	| E67_SiE_6 |	Ton of civilians that, as we said in the last segment of training. 
EDL	00:05:50,950	00:05:53,760	| E67_SiE_6 |	With bamboo spears by this time, yeah. 
EDL	00:05:53,760	00:05:56,640	| E67_SiE_6 |	And make life impossible for an invading army.

EDL	00:05:58,000	00:05:58,840	| E67_SiE_6 |	What's the goal. 
EDL	00:05:58,840	00:06:05,930	| E67_SiE_6 |	What's the end game while both the Germans and the Japanese are hoping to inflict a last

EDL	00:06:11,270	00:06:12,340	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:06:12,340	00:06:17,070	| E67_SiE_6 |	Because as you know, even a cursory understanding of the second world war makes
EDL	00:06:17,070	00:06:20,330	| E67_SiE_6 |	clear the peace terms are unconditional. 
EDL	00:06:20,330	00:06:21,930	| E67_SiE_6 |	Surrender and the. 
EDL	00:06:21,930	00:06:24,580	| E67_SiE_6 |	Reason we know that is, the allies made. 
EDL	00:06:24,580	00:06:25,550	| E67_SiE_6 |	And attempt.

EDL	00:06:37,550	00:06:40,760	| E67_SiE_6 |	If the terms of surrender are going to be that harsh. 
EDL	00:06:40,760	00:06:43,960	| E67_SiE_6 |	The axis powers are going to fight longer than they otherwise.

EDL	00:07:00,030	00:07:04,280	| E67_SiE_6 |	Look at the sources that you need an unconditional surrender. 
EDL	00:07:04,280	00:07:08,080	| E67_SiE_6 |	If you're going to finally end this recurring problem. 
EDL	00:07:08,080	00:07:11,540	| E67_SiE_6 |	And the Germans especially are seen as a recurring problem.

EDL	00:08:25,830	00:08:31,200	| E67_SiE_6 |	And people like Winston Churchill sometimes seem to vary. 
EDL	00:08:31,200	00:08:44,110	| E67_SiE_6 |	In his views that you find on whether or not he was for it or open to some sort of conditional piece in his book series the second world war, which cannot be taken as gospel truth, you know. 
EDL	00:08:44,110	00:08:49,190	| E67_SiE_6 |	You take it with a grand assault because he's he's bolstering his own post war image. 
EDL	00:08:49,190	00:08:51,700	| E67_SiE_6 |	But he knows that unconditional surrenders controversial. 
EDL	00:08:51,700	00:08:54,400	| E67_SiE_6 |	So he tries to defend it, and he says that they. 
EDL	00:08:54,400	00:08:58,100	| E67_SiE_6 |	Tried to sit down and come up with conditional terms, right. 
EDL	00:08:58,100	00:09:00,110	| E67_SiE_6 |	If if it was not gonna be unconditional. 
EDL	00:09:00,110	00:09:02,350	| E67_SiE_6 |	Should the surrender terms be. 
EDL	00:09:02,350	00:09:13,760	| E67_SiE_6 |	And he wrote quote they looked so terrible when set forth on paper, and so far exceeded what was in fact done that their publication would only have stimulated German resistance. 
EDL	00:09:13,760	00:09:15,660	| E67_SiE_6 |	They had in fact only to be written. 
EDL	00:09:15,660	00:09:25,100	| E67_SiE_6 |	Out to be withdrawn and quote, we should also recall that there were political reasons in the allied alliance for doing this to. 
EDL	00:09:25,100	00:09:29,810	| E67_SiE_6 |	The soviets were very suspicious that the western allies would cut a separate deal with Germany.

EDL	00:09:30,530	00:09:32,720	| E67_SiE_6 |	And sort of leave them in the lurch. 
EDL	00:09:32,720	00:09:40,830	| E67_SiE_6 |	A an announced public pledge for an unconditional surrender helped bind all the allies together United cause right? 
EDL	00:09:40,830	00:09:42,640	| E67_SiE_6 |	No one's going to make a separate piece. 
EDL	00:09:42,640	00:09:43,340	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:09:43,340	00:10:00,130	| E67_SiE_6 |	But it meant the war would go on longer, and both Japan and Germany were hoping for some sort of last ditch punch in the nose that would wake the allies up to the fact that you know this worker continue for years if you didn't come up with a better peace deal. 
EDL	00:10:00,130	00:10:01,250	| E67_SiE_6 |	I mean, that's really. 
EDL	00:10:01,250	00:10:03,410	| E67_SiE_6 |	What's something like the battle of the bulls, the second. 
EDL	00:10:03,410	00:10:12,360	| E67_SiE_6 |	Battle of the ardan in that could be the only reason to do that because there was no war winning element, the whole point was to do. 
EDL	00:10:12,360	00:10:19,620	| E67_SiE_6 |	Such damage and maybe have a whole bunch of allied troops sort of surrounded and endangered, so you could maybe bargain with them. 
EDL	00:10:19,620	00:10:20,600	| E67_SiE_6 |	And in Japan. 
EDL	00:10:20,600	00:10:30,090	| E67_SiE_6 |	They were continually looking for the last great battle that would help wake the allies up to the idea that unconditional surrender was a bridge too far.

EDL	00:10:33,250	00:10:37,410	| E67_SiE_6 |	The battle of Saipan in July well. 
EDL	00:10:37,410	00:10:44,420	| E67_SiE_6 |	The navy, the Japanese Navy, had thought that the war had been decided some of the naval experts after the battle of Guangzhou. 
EDL	00:10:44,420	00:10:45,670	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:10:45,670	00:10:50,870	| E67_SiE_6 |	And most of the rest, at least after the battle of midway in the Japanese war. 
EDL	00:10:50,870	00:10:58,110	| E67_SiE_6 |	Journal of imperial headquarters, quoted in Richard bee frank's book downfall, they. 
EDL	00:10:58,110	00:11:00,110	| E67_SiE_6 |	Were very open, and this is official. 
EDL	00:11:00,110	00:11:02,670	| E67_SiE_6 |	That the war was over in terms of who was going to win. 
EDL	00:11:02,670	00:11:03,230	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:11:03,230	00:11:08,790	| E67_SiE_6 |	And it said, quote, we can no longer direct the war with any hope of success. 
EDL	00:11:08,790	00:11:17,500	| E67_SiE_6 |	The only course left is for Japan's 100 million people to sacrifice their lives by charging the enemy to make them lose the will to fight. 
EDL	00:11:17,500	00:11:22,900	| E67_SiE_6 |	And a quote that is an amazing statement. 
EDL	00:11:22,900	00:11:35,600	| E67_SiE_6 |	We will sacrifice all the people in this country to get a better deal than unconditional surrender, and what was it that the Japanese really were holding out for the emperor. 
EDL	00:11:35,600	00:11:36,560	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:11:36,560	00:11:36,810	| E67_SiE_6 |	They. 
EDL	00:11:36,810	00:11:39,280	| E67_SiE_6 |	Were worried that an unconditional surrender might. 
EDL	00:11:39,280	00:11:42,690	| E67_SiE_6 |	Mean that the emperor and the entire imperial system. 
EDL	00:11:42,690	00:11:46,690	| E67_SiE_6 |	Would be tossed out, and this was something they could not live with. 
EDL	00:11:46,690	00:11:47,200	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:11:47,200	00:11:57,510	| E67_SiE_6 |	What's more, the idea that the emperor might be treated as a war criminal and might be hung or something after the war was intolerable to a ton of Japanese people. 
EDL	00:11:57,510	00:11:58,830	| E67_SiE_6 |	Including a ton of civilians. 
EDL	00:11:58,830	00:12:00,150	| E67_SiE_6 |	I mean, remember that. 
EDL	00:12:00,150	00:12:02,600	| E67_SiE_6 |	A decent number of Japanese folk who consider this person. 
EDL	00:12:02,600	00:12:03,640	| E67_SiE_6 |	To live in god.

EDL	00:12:06,810	00:12:11,580	| E67_SiE_6 |	I mean, there's a whole lot of stuff that makes this an almost superhuman figure in the idea. 
EDL	00:12:11,580	00:12:11,950	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:12:11,950	00:12:13,810	| E67_SiE_6 |	That the country might have to lose. 
EDL	00:12:13,810	00:12:15,790	| E67_SiE_6 |	There really weren't 100 million people in Japan. 
EDL	00:12:15,790	00:12:17,980	| E67_SiE_6 |	It's more like 70 or 75 million, but I mean. 
EDL	00:12:17,980	00:12:21,990	| E67_SiE_6 |	You might have to sacrifice that to keep one guy on the throne. 
EDL	00:12:21,990	00:12:23,310	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	00:12:23,310	00:12:29,310	| E67_SiE_6 |	Wow, that's well, if we were fighting reasonable people, it would have been over already of. 
EDL	00:12:29,310	00:12:29,840	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:12:29,840	00:12:31,100	| E67_SiE_6 |	This is not reasonable. 
EDL	00:12:31,100	00:12:31,610	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:12:31,610	00:12:36,260	| E67_SiE_6 |	I read a couple different takes on this that suggested it was a lot more than the emperor. 
EDL	00:12:36,260	00:12:41,090	| E67_SiE_6 |	This is the imperial system, which includes a lot of what we would call the oligarchy or the old guard. 
EDL	00:12:41,090	00:12:46,940	| E67_SiE_6 |	There's a lot of people who have a stake in the imperial system, and they would all be thrown to the wolves if this went away. 
EDL	00:12:46,940	00:12:47,980	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:12:47,980	00:13:05,150	| E67_SiE_6 |	But it would seem to be the kind of thing where you're going to keep the human being lawnmower operating at breakneck speed to keep a single guy from the gallows after the war may the problem Japan has is different than Germany. 
EDL	00:13:05,150	00:13:12,460	| E67_SiE_6 |	Because one of the things we said at the end of the last segment was that the famous plot against Adolf Hitler on July 20th, operation valkyrie. 
EDL	00:13:12,460	00:13:13,750	| E67_SiE_6 |	Where a bomb exploded in.

EDL	00:13:14,910	00:13:24,380	| E67_SiE_6 |	Attempting to take Hitler out, well, that's an attempt to get rid of the fanatic in chief, right, I mean, as I said, if we were fighting reasonable people, the war would be over long ago, but in Germany, you got rid. 
EDL	00:13:24,380	00:13:27,880	| E67_SiE_6 |	You have to get rid of the unreasonable person at the top to have a chance to do that. 
EDL	00:13:27,880	00:13:29,710	| E67_SiE_6 |	Japan's government's very different. 
EDL	00:13:29,710	00:13:30,540	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:13:30,540	00:13:37,020	| E67_SiE_6 |	It's hard to put your finger on who's in charge, and we we dealt with this extensively in the first segment of the program, pointing out. 
EDL	00:13:37,020	00:13:43,910	| E67_SiE_6 |	That Japan's system was one that outsiders certainly, but even insiders sometimes could have a tough time figuring where. 
EDL	00:13:43,910	00:13:44,430	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:13:44,430	00:13:47,750	| E67_SiE_6 |	Luck stops author e and w toll. 
EDL	00:13:47,750	00:13:50,340	| E67_SiE_6 |	Had written um a line that just. 
EDL	00:13:50,340	00:13:54,750	| E67_SiE_6 |	I think was a perfect summation of that, where he said quote. 
EDL	00:13:54,750	00:14:01,660	| E67_SiE_6 |	The same institutional defects that had produced Japan's irrational decision to launch the war in 1941. 
EDL	00:14:01,660	00:14:07,420	| E67_SiE_6 |	Now prevented a rational decision to end it and s. 
EDL	00:14:07,420	00:14:11,920	| E67_SiE_6 |	C m pain in his book the wars for Asia 1911, 1945. 
EDL	00:14:11,920	00:14:19,830	| E67_SiE_6 |	Had said that Japan's government had been called a government by acquiescence or a system of irresponsibility. 
EDL	00:14:19,830	00:14:21,050	| E67_SiE_6 |	And he said quote because. 
EDL	00:14:21,050	00:14:28,310	| E67_SiE_6 |	If everyone is responsible for policy, that policy formation becomes anonymous so that no one is actually held accountable. 
EDL	00:14:28,310	00:14:28,660	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:14:28,660	00:14:34,720	| E67_SiE_6 |	The primary value emphasized in decision making was a consensus reached through informal procedures. 
EDL	00:14:34,720	00:14:39,920	| E67_SiE_6 |	And quote a consensus that required the most die hard, fanatical elements of. 
EDL	00:14:39,920	00:14:43,220	| E67_SiE_6 |	The military to be on board and at least the army. 
EDL	00:14:43,220	00:14:45,260	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 2.0 secs ]
EDL	00:14:45,260	00:15:01,930	| E67_SiE_6 |	And this about the way is why everybody spends so much time talking about the 19th century development of the Japanese constitutional system design and everything to get us to the second world war because the second world wars were a couple of years, major things happen when you just go. 
EDL	00:15:01,930	00:15:02,280	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:15:02,280	00:15:16,280	| E67_SiE_6 |	Um, it's almost like a tragic flaw in Greek theater where there it was built into the Japanese system a long time ago, and it only comes out when the systems under massive stress like you know, a world war, but the fact that the army and navy. 
EDL	00:15:16,280	00:15:21,690	| E67_SiE_6 |	For example, have an outsize amount of control, and influence tends to bend the decision making. 
EDL	00:15:21,690	00:15:23,770	| E67_SiE_6 |	In a more hard line sort of way. 
EDL	00:15:23,770	00:15:24,190	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:15:24,190	00:15:30,260	| E67_SiE_6 |	And people who want to talk about peace actually put their own lives in danger to do so. 
EDL	00:15:30,260	00:16:02,160	| E67_SiE_6 |	So in both Germany and Japan, as the war starts to grind in to the last year, anybody who tries to bring up the idea of peace or who suggests that the war may be lost are enemies of the regime in Germany and last year, the war between 10 and 20000 people I read were hung or executed in some other way soldiers and civilians alike on charges of what was called defeatism in Japan, Marius B. 
EDL	00:16:02,160	00:16:03,060	| E67_SiE_6 |	Jensen, the historian. 
EDL	00:16:03,060	00:16:15,770	| E67_SiE_6 |	Says that the military was watching the people and had jailed some people for high level defeatism as it was called, and Subaru i anaga in his book the Pacific war. 
EDL	00:16:15,770	00:16:19,520	| E67_SiE_6 |	Talked about how careful those were his translated words.

EDL	00:16:22,700	00:16:29,440	| E67_SiE_6 |	He says that they faced assassination or a coup when he blames the army, but that's who he blames for a lot of things.

EDL	00:16:29,840	00:16:32,400	| E67_SiE_6 |	The point being that even bringing up. 
EDL	00:16:32,400	00:16:34,070	| E67_SiE_6 |	What might be a rational question? 
EDL	00:16:34,070	00:16:46,210	| E67_SiE_6 |	Like do we have to have armageddon, is that the way this thing has to go could get you charged as an enemy of the state and in a place like Germany could get you hung, so rationality isn't just in short supply. 
EDL	00:16:46,210	00:16:48,130	| E67_SiE_6 |	It's actively punished by deaf.

EDL	00:17:20,540	00:17:21,680	| E67_SiE_6 |	There are gonna be people who say. 
EDL	00:17:21,680	00:17:23,030	| E67_SiE_6 |	Well, then they shouldn't have started the war. 
EDL	00:17:23,030	00:17:26,300	| E67_SiE_6 |	They shouldn't have mistreated all of the populations they dealt with. 
EDL	00:17:26,300	00:17:26,530	| E67_SiE_6 |	So. 
EDL	00:17:26,530	00:17:29,320	| E67_SiE_6 |	Much, which is a fair point, but let's remember that. 
EDL	00:17:29,320	00:17:31,410	| E67_SiE_6 |	If the Japanese are going to die. 
EDL	00:17:31,410	00:17:35,170	| E67_SiE_6 |	Because they're going to have to be rooted out of all these buildings, somebody's going to have to. 
EDL	00:17:35,170	00:17:51,040	| E67_SiE_6 |	Do the rooting out, and this is what my stepfather was referring to ones when he he talked to me about how it was a kind of a double edge sword reading in the newspapers about how well the war was going because my stepdad's.

EDL	00:18:00,130	00:18:04,700	| E67_SiE_6 |	So like a lot of people, by the end of the war, he was kind of trying to time it out in his head, right? 
EDL	00:18:04,700	00:18:07,720	| E67_SiE_6 |	Is this thing going to be over before i'm on the front line areas?

EDL	00:20:43,310	00:20:51,550	| E67_SiE_6 |	This is in terms of a game like a geostrategic card game and the danger with that is all the decisions look so much easier.

EDL	00:21:19,350	00:21:22,930	| E67_SiE_6 |	It's still hard for me to not look at this sometimes like a card game.

EDL	00:21:26,450	00:21:31,150	| E67_SiE_6 |	Is that the Germans and the Japanese only have a few meaningful cards left to play.

EDL	00:21:38,030	00:21:40,480	| E67_SiE_6 |	Little bit of rocket fuel, if you will, that they've kept. 
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:41,300	| E67_SiE_6 |	Aside. 
EDL	00:21:41,300	00:21:44,120	| E67_SiE_6 |	For just this time, so what do you do with it. 
EDL	00:21:44,120	00:21:45,150	| E67_SiE_6 |	What do you use it for? 
EDL	00:21:45,150	00:21:47,770	| E67_SiE_6 |	What is it worthy goal. 
EDL	00:21:47,770	00:22:01,590	| E67_SiE_6 |	To use some of your last remaining strength for if winning the war probably isn't on the table, I never like to say it's never on the table because war is full of weirdness to the degree you just ever you can't ever say ever. 
EDL	00:22:01,590	00:22:02,100	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

EDL	00:22:05,760	00:22:10,480	| E67_SiE_6 |	There are no war winning cards left to play, at least no obvious war winning cards left to play. 
EDL	00:22:10,480	00:22:12,470	| E67_SiE_6 |	So how do you play what cards you still have left. 
EDL	00:22:12,470	00:22:13,690	| E67_SiE_6 |	That's fascinating to me. 
EDL	00:22:13,690	00:22:14,710	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:22:14,710	00:22:20,010	| E67_SiE_6 |	The Germans offensive in late 1944, the one in the second. 
EDL	00:22:20,010	00:22:22,810	| E67_SiE_6 |	Ardent as it's called, we Americans call it the battle of the bulge.

EDL	00:22:27,090	00:22:28,150	| E67_SiE_6 |	Let's use it here. 
EDL	00:22:28,150	00:22:29,560	| E67_SiE_6 |	What was he trying to do? 
EDL	00:22:29,560	00:22:34,000	| E67_SiE_6 |	Historians and armchair generals ever since have been critiquing that decision. 
EDL	00:22:34,000	00:22:37,880	| E67_SiE_6 |	There were a lot of people, even at the time that maybe would have liked to have seen all of that stock.

EDL	00:22:39,480	00:22:43,870	| E67_SiE_6 |	Against the red army instead, to maybe forestall what happened in Berlin. 
EDL	00:22:43,870	00:22:45,320	| E67_SiE_6 |	Long enough to let the allies get. 
EDL	00:22:45,320	00:22:47,300	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 2.0 secs ]
EDL	00:22:47,300	00:22:58,150	| E67_SiE_6 |	The western allies would be a better way to put it right because the Soviet unions and allies as well, but regardless, you know, hindsight's 20 right the Japanese cards. 
EDL	00:22:58,150	00:22:59,850	| E67_SiE_6 |	That they have to play. 
EDL	00:22:59,850	00:23:00,610	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:23:00,610	00:23:04,620	| E67_SiE_6 |	They're playing early on in 1944. 
EDL	00:23:04,620	00:23:09,340	| E67_SiE_6 |	I mean, they launch an offensive in the Burma India theater. 
EDL	00:23:09,340	00:23:14,210	| E67_SiE_6 |	In March 1944, and then a month later, they launched the largest offensive. 
EDL	00:23:14,210	00:23:19,860	| E67_SiE_6 |	The war on their part, and I think I read the largest offensive in imperial Japanese army history. 
EDL	00:23:19,860	00:23:22,050	| E67_SiE_6 |	With the itchy go campaign in China. 
EDL	00:23:22,050	00:23:22,760	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:23:22,760	00:23:31,992	| E67_SiE_6 |	We mentioned both these campaigns actually uh briefly in the last segment, but the itchy go campaign is the kind where you look at and you don't even know how the Japanese do it. 
EDL	00:23:31,992	00:23:33,838	| E67_SiE_6 |	We mentioned a long time ago that, that. 
EDL	00:23:33,838	00:23:38,140	| E67_SiE_6 |	To me, the Japanese look like one of the peoples on the planet that punch above their weight. 
EDL	00:23:38,140	00:23:39,630	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:23:39,630	00:23:53,300	| E67_SiE_6 |	Because they are able to pull off stuff where you would look at their population numbers and their geographical questions and their history and think that they're they're they're not gonna be able to do that, and then they achieve it anyway. 
EDL	00:23:53,300	00:24:16,010	| E67_SiE_6 |	And I sometimes wonder, looking at their history if maybe they we've talked about the limitation of their somewhat dysfunctional subpar, usually in terms of outcome government design, we've talked about the problems that they have with the organization of the military and how you have this issue with mid level officers able to exert an undue. 
EDL	00:24:16,010	00:24:23,520	| E67_SiE_6 |	Amount of control and influence over military policy, these are all things that put the Japanese into very tough situations and time and again. 
EDL	00:24:23,520	00:24:23,870	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:24:23,870	00:24:27,690	| E67_SiE_6 |	Somehow, despite all of the impediments in the odds against them. 
EDL	00:24:27,690	00:24:36,430	| E67_SiE_6 |	The Japanese people managed to pull the fat out of the fire more times than I read somewhere there for the itchy go offence of the Japanese stockpiled. 
EDL	00:24:36,430	00:24:43,440	| E67_SiE_6 |	Ammunition for two years an aviation air-fuel for eight months and when they launch. 
EDL	00:24:43,440	00:24:51,150	| E67_SiE_6 |	This multi stage offensive that will go from April uh 1944 to at least December 1944. 
EDL	00:24:51,150	00:25:03,410	| E67_SiE_6 |	I believe there's still significant fighting going on in January 1945, the half a million Japanese troops, more than 15000 vehicles, more than 100 animals launched. 
EDL	00:25:03,410	00:25:05,820	| E67_SiE_6 |	This assault on China that is ferocious. 
EDL	00:25:05,820	00:25:06,480	| E67_SiE_6 |	And you know. 
EDL	00:25:06,480	00:25:12,640	| E67_SiE_6 |	We should point out that nowhere in the Pacific was anybody facing armies like 500000 Japanese soldiers. 
EDL	00:25:12,640	00:25:14,180	| E67_SiE_6 |	These are land war. 
EDL	00:25:14,180	00:25:21,480	| E67_SiE_6 |	Asia sized armies, okay, I mean, the the big battles in the Pacific later on are going to be fractions of.

EDL	00:25:23,340	00:25:26,450	| E67_SiE_6 |	The only exception I can think of is the Philippines campaign.

EDL	00:25:28,580	00:25:32,300	| E67_SiE_6 |	The Japanese are more on the defensive there, whereas in China on the itchy.

EDL	00:25:43,410	00:25:43,720	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:25:43,720	00:25:49,110	| E67_SiE_6 |	The Japanese are often outnumbered in fighting multiple Chinese armies, which means lots of troops. 
EDL	00:25:49,110	00:25:50,590	| E67_SiE_6 |	You better have lots of troops. 
EDL	00:25:50,590	00:25:51,650	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:25:51,650	00:25:56,620	| E67_SiE_6 |	The irony of the whole thing is that the Japanese will in large part.

EDL	00:25:57,300	00:26:00,110	| E67_SiE_6 |	Succeed in many ways in this offensive. 
EDL	00:26:00,110	00:26:10,710	| E67_SiE_6 |	If you were judging this offensive outside of the context of the war, you go wow, and they pulled off a lot of sets here, almost knocked the nationalists out of the war, did retake the American airbases they wanted.

EDL	00:26:14,800	00:26:20,270	| E67_SiE_6 |	I was reading pointed out, so you took this giant amount of remaining rocket. 
EDL	00:26:20,270	00:26:25,320	| E67_SiE_6 |	Fuel you'd stored up and saved to use somehow, and you did it in a way that won't slow.

EDL	00:26:32,200	00:26:35,570	| E67_SiE_6 |	Was that a wasted card, you actually achieved a lot of what you wanted to achieve. 
EDL	00:26:35,570	00:26:37,590	| E67_SiE_6 |	It actually worked out pretty well, judging by. 
EDL	00:26:37,590	00:26:51,360	| E67_SiE_6 |	You know, a non contextual sort of standard, but in a contextual sort of standard didn't do anything to slow down the losing of the needless to say, it keeps the human being lawn lower working overtime. 
EDL	00:26:51,360	00:26:56,630	| E67_SiE_6 |	I mean, 750000 Chinese soldiers may have been killed.

EDL	00:26:57,960	00:27:02,010	| E67_SiE_6 |	I've seen like 100000 Japanese is as a death toll. 
EDL	00:27:02,010	00:27:24,730	| E67_SiE_6 |	Sometimes the numbers are hard to trust and differ source to source, and the methodology is different, and I bet there may have been 200000 Chinese civilian deaths due to this offensive, and in the same way that there are critics of Hitler's decision to use some of his last precious rocket fuel against the western allies instead of against the soviets.

EDL	00:37:31,130	00:37:37,620	| E67_SiE_6 |	Has some similarities because Martin, if the king modeled some of his tactics on gandhi's nonviolent approach.

EDL	00:40:24,400	00:40:29,920	| E67_SiE_6 |	It's a joker card right to introduce a little chaos into the equation and see what happens. 
EDL	00:40:29,920	00:40:34,420	| E67_SiE_6 |	And let's recall that the Japanese propaganda has been laying the groundwork. 
EDL	00:40:34,420	00:40:40,190	| E67_SiE_6 |	For this for years, that's why we brought it up much earlier in this conversation. 
EDL	00:40:40,190	00:40:46,710	| E67_SiE_6 |	But I think maybe in the very first segment where we talked about pan Asian ism, which is an intellectual doctrine with a with. 
EDL	00:40:46,710	00:40:50,400	| E67_SiE_6 |	A long history and many countries have their own version of it, but the Japanese took a.

EDL	00:40:50,910	00:40:55,480	| E67_SiE_6 |	That and injected it into their concept of an economic union. 
EDL	00:40:55,480	00:41:08,660	| E67_SiE_6 |	The famous greater east Asia co prosperity sphere, they were consistently saying things like their troops were pushing for Asia for the asiatics we had quoted again in the first show. 
EDL	00:41:08,660	00:41:14,260	| E67_SiE_6 |	I think uh that Japanese soldier who said that he was fired up by his teacher back in. 
EDL	00:41:14,260	00:41:21,510	| E67_SiE_6 |	I think it was their version of high school who was talking about the white man and what he was doing in in Asia to asians. 
EDL	00:41:21,510	00:41:25,330	| E67_SiE_6 |	And that same teacher talked about black folks in the United States. 
EDL	00:41:25,330	00:41:28,060	| E67_SiE_6 |	Native Americans in the United States and this Japanese soldiers.

EDL	00:41:30,400	00:41:31,890	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:41:31,890	00:41:39,260	| E67_SiE_6 |	In 1943, the Japanese make a big show of giving independence to a bunch of these countries like Burma, for example. 
EDL	00:41:39,260	00:41:43,030	| E67_SiE_6 |	Although they're not really giving it, it's a great propaganda tool. 
EDL	00:41:43,030	00:41:46,380	| E67_SiE_6 |	And back in 1941 to to name just one example, the Japanese Foreign.

EDL	00:42:16,250	00:42:23,060	| E67_SiE_6 |	If you look at the rules, sometimes not all places were the same, but they're living under rules that make them seem like second class citizens. 
EDL	00:42:23,060	00:42:27,930	| E67_SiE_6 |	Some of the rules i've seen remind one of the Jim Crow south or apartheid South Africa.

EDL	00:42:40,030	00:42:50,880	| E67_SiE_6 |	And if the Japanese had only been able to walk the walk a little bit better and live up to their hype a little bit, who knows what they might have accomplished, but as we said over and over. 
EDL	00:42:50,880	00:42:55,230	| E67_SiE_6 |	They didn't, and I don't know if that's because it the entire thing was nothing. 
EDL	00:42:55,230	00:42:56,560	| E67_SiE_6 |	And this is what I learned growing up, by the way.

EDL	00:54:24,090	00:54:37,480	| E67_SiE_6 |	Jungle and mountain terrain has a way of frustrating large forces being used, and in an earlier discussion, when we were talking about Guadalcanal and places like that, we quoted from Eric burger, his book.

EDL	00:56:11,110	00:56:14,720	| E67_SiE_6 |	Add to that the fact that battle is a very strange. 
EDL	00:56:14,720	00:56:15,340	| E67_SiE_6 |	Term. 
EDL	00:56:15,340	00:56:22,130	| E67_SiE_6 |	To use for twentieth century large scale conflict because it's so different than all the previous errors. 
EDL	00:56:22,130	00:56:34,850	| E67_SiE_6 |	That came before it when a battle usually and one really horrible, the really terrible battles in human history up until the modern era are two or three days long. 
EDL	00:56:34,850	00:56:35,650	| E67_SiE_6 |	Now we're not talking about. 
EDL	00:56:35,650	00:56:38,020	| E67_SiE_6 |	Sieges which can go on for month or even. 
EDL	00:56:38,020	00:56:38,950	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:56:38,950	00:56:44,980	| E67_SiE_6 |	But a battle is generally something on a small enough area where if you can get above the fray and the dust and the commotion. 
EDL	00:56:44,980	00:56:49,100	| E67_SiE_6 |	And the chaos get up to a hill, maybe with a a little spy glass. 
EDL	00:56:49,100	00:56:51,110	| E67_SiE_6 |	You can usually see the whole thing. 
EDL	00:56:51,110	00:56:54,160	| E67_SiE_6 |	Not here, not in the twentieth century. 
EDL	00:56:54,160	00:56:57,850	| E67_SiE_6 |	You're better off referring to these things to avoid confusion, and they. 
EDL	00:56:57,850	00:57:04,970	| E67_SiE_6 |	Often are referred to instead of battles as operations operations that. 
EDL	00:57:04,970	00:57:14,920	| E67_SiE_6 |	Are the sum total of thousands of potentially fatal tasks, so when you read the accounts of a veteran in these modern operations. 
EDL	00:57:14,920	00:57:20,520	| E67_SiE_6 |	Their entire war experience may be when they ran into a concealed gun. 
EDL	00:57:20,520	00:57:29,780	| E67_SiE_6 |	In a hill a mile away from the road that they're on, that shuts down road traffic until they can figure out a way to out flank the gun and take it out, right? 
EDL	00:57:29,780	00:57:31,230	| E67_SiE_6 |	That's one of those. 
EDL	00:57:31,230	00:57:36,660	| E67_SiE_6 |	You know, thousands of little potentially fatal tasks that when you add them all together equals. 
EDL	00:57:36,660	00:57:40,100	| E67_SiE_6 |	An operation like the EMF all CO hema campaign. 
EDL	00:57:40,100	00:57:41,680	| E67_SiE_6 |	But it sure makes it less. 
EDL	00:57:41,680	00:57:45,030	| E67_SiE_6 |	Dramatic in the big picture sense and much harder to follow. 
EDL	00:57:45,030	00:57:45,540	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:57:45,540	00:57:53,430	| E67_SiE_6 |	But in the small unit sense, it is as dramatic and horrifying as any encounter you'll find in the war may be worse. 
EDL	00:57:53,430	00:57:54,970	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:57:54,970	00:58:00,140	| E67_SiE_6 |	If you look at the big picture timeline in the first week of March, the Japan. 
EDL	00:58:00,140	00:58:07,210	| E67_SiE_6 |	He's crossed the win river, as we had said, they blow past the flanks of one major units surrounded. 
EDL	00:58:07,210	00:58:10,990	| E67_SiE_6 |	And it has to fight its way out, then they advance on, involve and CO.

EDL	00:58:19,980	00:58:22,160	| E67_SiE_6 |	Those places would be cut off. 
EDL	00:58:22,160	00:58:27,240	| E67_SiE_6 |	And the British and imperial troops in those places would begin to run out of ammunition. 
EDL	00:58:27,240	00:58:30,410	| E67_SiE_6 |	They wouldn't have any reinforcements they would run out of medical supplies. 
EDL	00:58:30,410	00:58:33,090	| E67_SiE_6 |	They would run out of food, and that would be that.

EDL	00:58:33,910	00:58:35,250	| E67_SiE_6 |	The difference here though. 
EDL	00:58:35,250	00:58:37,970	| E67_SiE_6 |	Is, and this is what frustrates the Japanese. 
EDL	00:58:37,970	00:58:38,600	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:58:38,600	00:58:42,140	| E67_SiE_6 |	The allies have the ability to supply the cutoff.

EDL	00:58:44,530	00:58:48,230	| E67_SiE_6 |	This is huge and it's a new development, right, and it. 
EDL	00:58:48,230	00:58:53,050	| E67_SiE_6 |	Was only really in the second world war that the capability existed even tried this. 
EDL	00:58:53,050	00:58:54,960	| E67_SiE_6 |	And past attempts had been hit. 
EDL	00:58:54,960	00:59:05,730	| E67_SiE_6 |	Or missed to say the least, I mean, when the German army is surrounded by the so yeah, it's at stolen grad, the lift welfare tries to fly in supplies. 
EDL	00:59:05,730	00:59:22,550	| E67_SiE_6 |	And they can't manage to provide anywhere near enough for a starving army running out of ammunition that has to surrender, but here there are American air assets that have been flying supplies over what's called the hump, which. 
EDL	00:59:22,550	00:59:24,920	| E67_SiE_6 |	Are a bunch of mountain ranges into China. 
EDL	00:59:24,920	00:59:26,090	| E67_SiE_6 |	It's also called the. 
EDL	00:59:26,090	00:59:30,090	| E67_SiE_6 |	Skyway to hell and the British are able to borrow some of these. 
EDL	00:59:30,090	00:59:46,850	| E67_SiE_6 |	Big heavy supply planes to add to their spitfire and hurricane fighters, which they're using in a mostly ground attack, roll to change the entire equation and begin to supply their cut off troops with what they need to keep fighting and recall. 
EDL	00:59:46,850	00:59:50,960	| E67_SiE_6 |	The Japanese have only a limited amount of this stuffed themselves. 
EDL	00:59:50,960	00:59:51,340	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:59:51,340	00:59:53,610	| E67_SiE_6 |	They can't do the air supply thing.

EDL	00:59:54,450	00:59:57,970	| E67_SiE_6 |	And if they can't take the supplies of the people that they. 
EDL	00:59:57,970	01:00:02,860	| E67_SiE_6 |	Cut off and are fighting it in falling off, they're gonna run out of supplies themselves. 
EDL	01:00:02,860	01:00:03,230	| E67_SiE_6 |	I liked. 
EDL	01:00:03,230	01:00:10,090	| E67_SiE_6 |	The way the British general in charge of this operation describes it his name, by the way, is a lieutenant general William slim. 
EDL	01:00:10,090	01:00:11,560	| E67_SiE_6 |	He's a very fine general. 
EDL	01:00:11,560	01:00:11,920	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	01:00:11,920	01:00:20,670	| E67_SiE_6 |	He cops to his mistakes initially here underestimating the Japanese speed and size, and whether or not they can get through the jungle with their troops.

EDL	01:00:21,010	01:00:24,470	| E67_SiE_6 |	But then explains really the entire battle. 
EDL	01:00:24,470	01:00:28,210	| E67_SiE_6 |	In the terms that will decide it and he says, quote. 
EDL	01:00:28,210	01:00:28,800	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	01:00:28,800	01:00:41,740	| E67_SiE_6 |	As I struggled hard to redress my errors and to speed by rail and air these reinforcements, I knew that all depended on the steadfastness of the troops already meeting the first impetus of attack. 
EDL	01:00:41,740	01:00:42,090	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	01:00:42,090	01:00:46,440	| E67_SiE_6 |	If they could hold until help arrived, all would be well. 
EDL	01:00:46,440	01:00:55,490	| E67_SiE_6 |	If not, we were near disaster, so that's what has to happen, and the air supply helps, but bottom line. 
EDL	01:00:55,490	01:00:55,960	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	01:00:55,960	01:01:00,150	| E67_SiE_6 |	It's a question of heroism, and I am not a glory guy when it comes. 
EDL	01:01:00,150	01:01:01,940	| E67_SiE_6 |	Mr war, put me in the camp of.

EDL	01:01:02,280	01:01:05,400	| E67_SiE_6 |	The William to come to sherman's the American general. 
EDL	01:01:05,400	01:01:08,650	| E67_SiE_6 |	Who had said that wars, glory is all moonshine. 
EDL	01:01:08,650	01:01:10,970	| E67_SiE_6 |	I don't think killing other people's glorious. 
EDL	01:01:10,970	01:01:11,390	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	01:01:11,390	01:01:21,960	| E67_SiE_6 |	But I think surviving against incredible odds, putting up with the privation in the hardship, enduring the unendurable. 
EDL	01:01:21,960	01:01:26,860	| E67_SiE_6 |	For the sake of whatever is motivating you to do, so can often be heroic. 
EDL	01:01:26,860	01:01:27,420	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	01:01:27,420	01:01:33,550	| E67_SiE_6 |	And it's a shame that things like the colonial overtones or if you're the Japanese or the Germans, the. 
EDL	01:01:33,550	01:01:37,120	| E67_SiE_6 |	Evil cause in which your your fighting. 
EDL	01:01:37,120	01:01:48,950	| E67_SiE_6 |	That, that somehow or sometimes overshadows the heroism of the troops involved, um, rarely do you read combat accounts where the troops are talking about things like. 
EDL	01:01:48,950	01:01:51,800	| E67_SiE_6 |	Um, you know, a German soldier saying he's ready to fight. 
EDL	01:01:51,800	01:01:54,860	| E67_SiE_6 |	And die for more Lebanese realm for Germany, right.

EDL	01:02:14,050	01:02:21,590	| E67_SiE_6 |	Or a place like that, ready to lay down his life so Britain can maintain its colonial dominance of a place like India. 
EDL	01:02:21,590	01:02:23,570	| E67_SiE_6 |	That's generally not what. 
EDL	01:02:23,570	01:02:24,440	| E67_SiE_6 |	At bottom line. 
EDL	01:02:24,440	01:02:27,010	| E67_SiE_6 |	Of course, it's about killer be killed, but. 
EDL	01:02:27,010	01:02:29,900	| E67_SiE_6 |	Above that, you will read so many accounts where soldiers are fighting. 
EDL	01:02:29,900	01:02:38,190	| E67_SiE_6 |	For their comrades or their unit or the esprit, a core of the group that they belong to or may be just to not let down.

EDL	01:02:41,210	01:02:55,060	| E67_SiE_6 |	It's very baseline stuff, your your worldview and your your horizon shrinks and the lens you view things through is very narrow and um immediate, so I don't like the idea that.

EDL	01:02:56,230	01:02:57,330	| E67_SiE_6 |	This is a problem in India. 
EDL	01:02:57,330	01:03:04,980	| E67_SiE_6 |	I read that the Indians have a hard time, sometimes trying to fix how to portray this whole affair because it's so overshadowed with the colonial question, we're.

EDL	01:03:23,670	01:03:29,990	| E67_SiE_6 |	But that shouldn't overshadow what was done there by all the soldiers on all sides. 
EDL	01:03:29,990	01:03:31,550	| E67_SiE_6 |	I mean, read some of the accounts.

EDL	01:03:33,340	01:03:48,460	| E67_SiE_6 |	First of all, the Japanese threw themselves at the enemy wave after wave, sometimes suicidally the British general of a slim was very critical of the throwing away of Japanese lives.

EDL	01:04:00,110	01:04:05,140	| E67_SiE_6 |	Well, let me just quote what's said in um Robert lehman's book Japan's last bid for victory.

EDL	01:46:25,490	01:46:32,710	| E67_SiE_6 |	And you absolutely every single day are going from one position to another position to another position, rooting out and killing the people in each of these positions.

EDL	01:46:37,920	01:46:38,440	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	01:46:38,440	01:46:45,740	| E67_SiE_6 |	Was on Palau trying to cross an open air field, which a lot of the soldiers remembered under artillery and motor fire, he said quote. 
EDL	01:46:45,740	01:46:50,230	| E67_SiE_6 |	To be shelled by mast, artillery and mortars is absolutely terrifying. 
EDL	01:46:50,230	01:46:57,100	| E67_SiE_6 |	But to be shelled in the open is terror, compounded beyond the belief of any one who hasn't experienced it. 
EDL	01:46:57,100	01:47:07,650	| E67_SiE_6 |	The attack across pello loose airfield was the worst combat experience I had during the entire war, it surpassed by the intensity of the blast and shock of the bursting shells.

EDL	01:47:13,760	01:47:15,700	| E67_SiE_6 |	That sort of mere is what.

EDL	01:47:21,130	01:47:43,630	| E67_SiE_6 |	Under artillery attack was like being tied to a and having somebody swinging at your head with a sledge hammer over and over again and just missing by a little, but you were sure that the next shot of the sledgehammer was going to get surviving that artillery barrage while you run and try to avoid getting hit is the sort of thing that will give you nightmares. 
EDL	01:47:43,630	01:47:45,160	| E67_SiE_6 |	The rest of your life, but he. 
EDL	01:47:45,160	01:47:56,300	| E67_SiE_6 |	Has two other incidents in the book that fall in my mind under the category of this is not what you're ready for when you go to war, you're ready to to take on the enemy and deal with. 
EDL	01:47:56,300	01:47:58,850	| E67_SiE_6 |	Uh, you know, shooting at somebody or or being shot at. 
EDL	01:47:58,850	01:48:00,850	| E67_SiE_6 |	But but he talks about, for example. 
EDL	01:48:00,850	01:48:04,020	| E67_SiE_6 |	One incident where they're all on patrol at night in on Palau. 
EDL	01:48:04,020	01:48:04,770	| E67_SiE_6 |	And it's dark. 
EDL	01:48:04,770	01:48:13,180	| E67_SiE_6 |	And they're trying to maintain quiet and secrecy, and then one of their guys cracks up and starts raving and screaming and threatening the whole unit. 
EDL	01:48:13,180	01:48:13,960	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	01:48:13,960	01:48:15,730	| E67_SiE_6 |	And they don't know what to do, they're panicking. 
EDL	01:48:15,730	01:48:16,720	| E67_SiE_6 |	What do we do with this guy. 
EDL	01:48:16,720	01:48:18,100	| E67_SiE_6 |	He's our friend, he's our buddy. 
EDL	01:48:18,100	01:48:23,070	| E67_SiE_6 |	So first, they try to give him morphine, then they try to knock him out with a punch to the jaw. 
EDL	01:48:23,070	01:48:25,080	| E67_SiE_6 |	Then more morphine and nothing is working. 
EDL	01:48:25,080	01:48:32,580	| E67_SiE_6 |	And eventually one of officers or the sergeant says using an entrenching tool, knock him out, and they hit him in the head with basically a shovel. 
EDL	01:48:32,580	01:48:33,240	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	01:48:33,240	01:48:38,680	| E67_SiE_6 |	And instead of injuring him, he dies and the person who hit him in the head with a shovel has to live with that. 
EDL	01:48:38,680	01:48:39,840	| E67_SiE_6 |	The rest of his life, you know. 
EDL	01:48:39,840	01:48:40,580	| E67_SiE_6 |	It's one thing to say. 
EDL	01:48:40,580	01:48:43,140	| E67_SiE_6 |	I killed the enemy and they were a bunch of fanatical robots. 
EDL	01:48:43,140	01:48:43,570	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	01:48:43,570	01:48:45,940	| E67_SiE_6 |	And they did terrible things to our troops, so I don't feel bad about it. 
EDL	01:48:45,940	01:48:49,740	| E67_SiE_6 |	It's another thing to hit your own guy in the head with an entrenching tool and kill him. 
EDL	01:48:49,740	01:48:57,580	| E67_SiE_6 |	Sledge tells a worse story than that later on when he's talking about um, and this is like horror movie stuff like Freddie Cruger jump scare. 
EDL	01:48:57,580	01:49:04,130	| E67_SiE_6 |	Horror stuff, but the Japanese at night with infiltration tactics drove the Americans crazy and and over and over. 
EDL	01:49:04,130	01:49:06,070	| E67_SiE_6 |	You read veteran saying I hated the night. 
EDL	01:49:06,070	01:49:06,540	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	01:49:06,540	01:49:09,490	| E67_SiE_6 |	They would be in two man foxhole so one person could sleep. 
EDL	01:49:09,490	01:49:15,820	| E67_SiE_6 |	While the other person watched and stayed on guards, but the problem is, is that night, you thought you every single sound was the Japanese. 
EDL	01:49:15,820	01:49:18,730	| E67_SiE_6 |	And they'd come close to the foxholes and scream things at you to keep. 
EDL	01:49:18,730	01:49:19,800	| E67_SiE_6 |	You on edge. 
EDL	01:49:19,800	01:49:21,850	| E67_SiE_6 |	But sometimes they do more than scream. 
EDL	01:49:21,850	01:49:22,200	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	01:49:22,200	01:49:25,900	| E67_SiE_6 |	They grabbed a couple of edged weapons and jump into some of these fox holes. 
EDL	01:49:25,900	01:49:28,630	| E67_SiE_6 |	And not only did the people in the fox holes who all of a sudden had. 
EDL	01:49:28,630	01:49:31,440	| E67_SiE_6 |	Japanese in their foxholes with them have to deal with.

EDL	01:49:32,170	01:49:35,370	| E67_SiE_6 |	But so did every American around that foxhole. 
EDL	01:49:35,370	01:49:37,380	| E67_SiE_6 |	Who could hear what was happening. 
EDL	01:49:37,380	01:49:38,570	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	01:49:38,570	01:49:44,890	| E67_SiE_6 |	I read this over and over again with different marines in different books, talking about the sounds, I mean. 
EDL	01:49:44,890	01:49:47,470	| E67_SiE_6 |	What does it sound like when one guy is gouging out another. 
EDL	01:49:47,470	01:49:49,870	| E67_SiE_6 |	Guy's eyes and kills him by doing that.

EDL	01:49:50,250	01:49:52,370	| E67_SiE_6 |	Miss sledge says quote. 
EDL	01:49:52,370	01:50:02,610	| E67_SiE_6 |	With a wild yell, the Japanese jumped into the hole with the two marines, a frantic, desperate hand to hand struggle ensued, a need by the most gruesome combination of curses. 
EDL	01:50:02,610	01:50:06,620	| E67_SiE_6 |	Wild babbling, animalistic, guttural noises and grunts. 
EDL	01:50:06,620	01:50:10,780	| E67_SiE_6 |	Sounds of men hitting each other and thrashing around came from the fox hole. 
EDL	01:50:10,780	01:50:11,360	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	01:50:11,360	01:50:13,560	| E67_SiE_6 |	And quote, okay, again. 
EDL	01:50:13,560	01:50:17,050	| E67_SiE_6 |	Though, that's combat, right, you're going to wake up with some nightmares from that. 
EDL	01:50:17,050	01:50:27,390	| E67_SiE_6 |	But it's what happens next that gives a different sort of vibe to the whole thing when sledge says a man jumps out of the fox hole and starts running in the dark toward the other marine fox holes. 
EDL	01:50:27,390	01:50:33,490	| E67_SiE_6 |	So a marine stands up, uses his gun like a club and smacks the figure in the head, knocking him down. 
EDL	01:50:33,490	01:50:35,200	| E67_SiE_6 |	That figure stays around in the dark. 
EDL	01:50:35,200	01:50:37,170	| E67_SiE_6 |	Groaning and thrashing around until another. 
EDL	01:50:37,170	01:50:38,060	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	01:50:38,060	01:50:39,670	| E67_SiE_6 |	Goes up and shoots him in the head.

EDL	01:50:40,430	01:50:45,420	| E67_SiE_6 |	And in the morning, they find out that it wasn't a Japanese soldier that they shot in the head. 
EDL	01:50:45,420	01:50:46,520	| E67_SiE_6 |	It was one of their own.

EDL	01:50:49,600	01:50:59,170	| E67_SiE_6 |	A few hours later, as objects around me became faintly visible with the dawn, I noticed that the still form lying to my left didn't appear Japanese. 
EDL	01:50:59,170	01:51:04,000	| E67_SiE_6 |	It was either an Emmy and marine zhiyun g aries or leggings, or it was a marine. 
EDL	01:51:04,000	01:51:09,120	| E67_SiE_6 |	I went over to find out which before I got to the prone body, its identity was obvious.

EDL	01:51:10,070	01:51:22,760	| E67_SiE_6 |	My god, I said in horror, several men looked at me and asked what was the matter, it's bill by and quote he then is asked by the officer who shot him. 
EDL	01:51:22,760	01:51:24,830	| E67_SiE_6 |	Did he get killed by one of the jobs he said. 
EDL	01:51:24,830	01:51:30,120	| E67_SiE_6 |	And sledgehammers, which was sledge's nickname, says quote, I didn't answer. 
EDL	01:51:30,120	01:51:32,200	| E67_SiE_6 |	Just looked at him with a blank stare and felt. 
EDL	01:51:32,200	01:51:37,440	| E67_SiE_6 |	Sick, I looked at the man who had crawled past me to check on the groaning man in the dark. 
EDL	01:51:37,440	01:51:39,440	| E67_SiE_6 |	He had shot bill through the temple. 
EDL	01:51:39,440	01:51:42,060	| E67_SiE_6 |	Mistakenly assuming him to be Japanese.

EDL	01:51:42,850	01:51:50,830	| E67_SiE_6 |	And then he says, as the realization of his fatal mistake hit him, the man's face turned action, his jaw trembled. 
EDL	01:51:50,830	01:52:05,550	| E67_SiE_6 |	And he looked as though he were going to cry and quote, this is something above and beyond what you expect when you go to kill the enemy, and I understand so much better after reading sledges book why it was so hard. 
EDL	01:52:05,550	01:52:09,700	| E67_SiE_6 |	Sometimes impossible to get these Pacific war veterans, especially these marines.

EDL	01:52:12,430	01:52:26,210	| E67_SiE_6 |	Because how could you have understood what sort of context did you have to properly assess what this person was trying to make you understand and sledge addresses this too, and says, quote.

EDL	01:52:26,910	01:52:30,760	| E67_SiE_6 |	To the non combatants and those on the periphery of action. 
EDL	01:52:30,760	01:52:56,100	| E67_SiE_6 |	The war bent only boredom or occasional excitement, but to those who entered the meat grinder itself, the war was another world of horror from which escape seemed less and less likely as casualties mounted and the fighting drag on and on time had no meaning life had no meaning the fierce struggle for survival in the abyss of Pellew eroded the veneer of civilization.

EDL	01:53:40,100	01:53:45,190	| E67_SiE_6 |	And you don't even have to do that for the Japanese because they lose between 11 and 13000.

EDL	01:57:36,260	01:57:42,200	| E67_SiE_6 |	Edited by David C Evans and what it really is a sort of a debriefing of the Japanese admirals after the war. 
EDL	01:57:42,200	01:57:45,520	| E67_SiE_6 |	And they all but nobody cared about this. 
EDL	01:57:45,520	01:57:49,520	| E67_SiE_6 |	They blame it on the Japanese pensions for the offense, right. 
EDL	01:57:49,520	01:57:50,580	| E67_SiE_6 |	They want the colorful. 
EDL	01:57:50,580	01:58:02,960	| E67_SiE_6 |	Offense, they want the the big, decisive naval battles, which by the way, the Americans and the Japanese both subscribe to the to the mayhem idea of the decisive naval battle, so neither one of those countries, navies. 
EDL	01:58:02,960	01:58:12,070	| E67_SiE_6 |	Were really excited about things like commerce writing, but the Japanese didn't put any effort into it at all, one admiral had said. 
EDL	01:58:12,070	01:58:12,680	| E67_SiE_6 |	That if. 
EDL	01:58:12,680	01:58:18,230	| E67_SiE_6 |	They had thought the United States would use their submarines the way the Germans were using you boats in the Atlantic.

EDL	01:58:18,530	01:58:21,400	| E67_SiE_6 |	To go after merchant shipping, they might not have launched the war at all.

EDL	01:58:24,480	01:58:28,010	| E67_SiE_6 |	And as we had said earlier, one of the things about naval wrong fare. 
EDL	01:58:28,010	01:58:29,040	| E67_SiE_6 |	Is in general. 
EDL	01:58:29,040	01:58:32,100	| E67_SiE_6 |	If you find out that you haven't built the right ships. 
EDL	01:58:32,100	01:58:39,510	| E67_SiE_6 |	That is a problem that takes at least a couple of years to solve, like when you find out because of experience in the second world war. 
EDL	01:58:39,510	01:58:43,700	| E67_SiE_6 |	The aircraft carriers are going to be the new queen of the season, not battleships well. 
EDL	01:58:43,700	01:58:45,760	| E67_SiE_6 |	You don't magically have aircraft carriers. 
EDL	01:58:45,760	01:58:48,520	| E67_SiE_6 |	You've got to go and make some in that takes years. 
EDL	01:58:48,520	01:58:53,380	| E67_SiE_6 |	So if you find out that you don't have enough escorts for your merchant ships. 
EDL	01:58:53,380	01:58:54,250	| E67_SiE_6 |	That's a problem. 
EDL	01:58:54,250	01:59:04,210	| E67_SiE_6 |	You can't solve all that quickly, and it took the Japanese a while to realize it because it took the Americans and the other allies a to really make a dent in the enemy's commercial shipping. 
EDL	01:59:04,210	01:59:07,690	| E67_SiE_6 |	There's lots of reasons for this, and we mentioned one of them earlier in the series. 
EDL	01:59:07,690	01:59:12,370	| E67_SiE_6 |	We talked about the absolute terribleness of American torpedoes. 
EDL	01:59:12,370	01:59:16,160	| E67_SiE_6 |	And i've read all kinds of accounts where I mean, it's called a scandal, a national disgrace. 
EDL	01:59:16,160	01:59:17,730	| E67_SiE_6 |	People should have gone to jail, I mean.

EDL	01:59:20,380	01:59:31,380	| E67_SiE_6 |	Ships coming back into port with unexploded American torpedos sticking out of the side of the merchant vessels are all the American pilots who dropped their torpedoes right right close by. 
EDL	01:59:31,380	01:59:31,680	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

EDL	01:59:36,980	01:59:38,110	| E67_SiE_6 |	Well, that. 
EDL	01:59:38,110	01:59:46,030	| E67_SiE_6 |	Will impact your submarine success rate until you fix that, but by mid 1944, the Americans have fixed that. 
EDL	01:59:46,030	01:59:50,740	| E67_SiE_6 |	And now you start to see the tonnage totals of Japanese merchant shipping skyrocket. 
EDL	01:59:50,740	01:59:54,910	| E67_SiE_6 |	It and submarines will account for about 60 percent. 
EDL	01:59:54,910	01:59:59,450	| E67_SiE_6 |	Of the Japanese merchandise that are sent to the bottom of the sea with aircraft. 
EDL	01:59:59,450	02:00:05,130	| E67_SiE_6 |	Allied aircraft of all kinds from all countries, accounting for most of the rest. 
EDL	02:00:05,130	02:00:06,200	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	02:00:06,200	02:00:07,510	| E67_SiE_6 |	But when you look at the numbers. 
EDL	02:00:07,510	02:00:13,580	| E67_SiE_6 |	You get an idea of how the impact is affecting the Japanese ability to do anything. 
EDL	02:00:13,580	02:00:16,360	| E67_SiE_6 |	When we had talked about the supply problems in Burma. 
EDL	02:00:16,360	02:00:33,540	| E67_SiE_6 |	How do the Japanese get supplies over those mountains through those jungles on those terrible roads, while the Pacific even worse, the Japanese at the time of the Pearl Harbor tax had about 6 million tons of merchant and no nation in the second world war has enough merchant shipping is always in short supply. 
EDL	02:00:33,540	02:00:49,820	| E67_SiE_6 |	For everyone, including the United States, who can build merchant ships faster than anyone ever thought possible, the Japanese will build another three and a half million tons of merchant shipping during the war, but by December 1944, even with all that, they're down to 2500000 tons. 
EDL	02:00:49,820	02:00:54,545	| E67_SiE_6 |	And the Americans are sinking hundreds of thousands of tons a month. 
EDL	02:00:54,545	02:01:00,760	| E67_SiE_6 |	And the only way that, that number will slow down and you'll start thinking less merchants shipping. 
EDL	02:01:00,760	02:01:04,850	| E67_SiE_6 |	Is because eventually they're so successful, they run out of targets. 
EDL	02:01:04,850	02:01:05,890	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	02:01:05,890	02:01:31,310	| E67_SiE_6 |	Essentially by late 1944, American submarines are doing to Japan what German u-boats were hoping to do to Britain, another island nation back during the battle of the Atlantic in 19 starve an island nation of the resources that it needs to continue to fight the war, bring them to their knees.

EDL	02:01:32,730	02:01:43,550	| E67_SiE_6 |	But the German navy's idea of bringing Britain to its knees in 1942 in the battle of the Atlantic would have involved some sort of peace arrangement.

EDL	02:01:51,130	02:01:51,430	| E67_SiE_6 |	Right. 
EDL	02:01:51,430	02:01:51,940	| E67_SiE_6 |	We know if these. 
EDL	02:01:51,940	02:01:52,760	| E67_SiE_6 |	Were reasonable people. 
EDL	02:01:52,760	02:01:54,310	| E67_SiE_6 |	They would have surrendered long ago. 
EDL	02:01:54,310	02:01:56,540	| E67_SiE_6 |	What if you cripple them and they don't. 
EDL	02:01:56,540	02:02:15,190	| E67_SiE_6 |	Give in any there's fantastic anecdote and E And W told, by the way, as an author is so good at finding these historical anecdotes that helps dramatize both where the supply problem has the Japanese in terms of options, by OC taobao 1944.

EDL	02:02:21,780	02:02:27,290	| E67_SiE_6 |	I think it to finding this so interesting, but i've always been fascinated with that mood that you find. 
EDL	02:02:27,290	02:02:42,870	| E67_SiE_6 |	Well, we always say the extremes of the human experience, but think about the people in Hitler's bunker, you know, as the battle of Berlin is ramping up, so Hitler during the last month and what it's like in that room, and all those people psychotic the logical states under that kind of crushing pressure.

EDL	02:03:24,190	02:03:35,160	| E67_SiE_6 |	That the Americans are going to land in the Philippines and probably on lady, and so they have a plan that's been ready for a little while to go disrupt this, and they're basically going to throw in.

EDL	02:03:51,470	02:03:56,610	| E67_SiE_6 |	You know, how is this going to be worth the fuel that we're going to use.

EDL	02:04:05,810	02:04:17,230	| E67_SiE_6 |	Tons of oil to Japan right now and that the fleet would basically use all of that, whereas we could use that 60000 tons of oil to do a lot of things for the civilians for the other war effort areas. 
EDL	02:04:17,230	02:04:17,690	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	02:04:17,690	02:04:27,440	| E67_SiE_6 |	And it's funny because 60000 tons of oil a couple years ago would not have been anywhere near this important, but we understand that scarcity makes things valuable law of supply and demand and all that.

EDL	02:04:27,750	02:04:30,880	| E67_SiE_6 |	But when the general says this to the navy. 
EDL	02:04:30,880	02:04:38,700	| E67_SiE_6 |	He essentially exposes the fact that this is less about the Japanese Navy trying to make a war winning difference here, although they'd like to.

EDL	02:04:51,010	02:05:00,100	| E67_SiE_6 |	The Japanese have been doing on land with thousands of their soldiers will run into machine gunfire with bayonets, but that's where we are. 
EDL	02:05:00,100	02:05:07,980	| E67_SiE_6 |	In this story and one of the things that tolls anecdote deals with is the fact that these hard bitten old military guys who were.

EDL	02:11:33,910	02:11:34,530	| E67_SiE_6 |	The plan. 
EDL	02:11:34,530	02:11:35,370	| E67_SiE_6 |	By the way. 
EDL	02:11:35,370	02:11:35,890	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	02:11:35,890	02:11:43,080	| E67_SiE_6 |	Is one similar to a naval playing the Japanese tried earlier in the war, essentially in order to get to these cargo ships. 
EDL	02:11:43,080	02:11:49,110	| E67_SiE_6 |	And these oilers and these supply ships, the Japanese have to lure the warships that are protecting them away. 
EDL	02:11:49,110	02:12:09,280	| E67_SiE_6 |	So if you think about a defenseless flock of sheep, the Japanese plan here calls for something to be used as bait to try to attract the sheep dog and take them away from the flock, and then the Japanese divided into several separate flotillas coming from several different angles will pounce on the beach head area. 
EDL	02:12:09,280	02:12:16,610	| E67_SiE_6 |	And each one of these separate flotillas has its own destiny in its own story in the giant battle of lengthy gulf.

EDL	02:12:28,240	02:12:46,080	| E67_SiE_6 |	Leeds and their destinies the Japanese flotilla that is designed to be the bait in this plan is using the very best sort of lure that you can have if you're trying to attract late 1944 admirals.

EDL	02:13:21,780	02:13:26,750	| E67_SiE_6 |	Far away from the beach heads the other Japanese flip tillers can come in from multiple angles and destroy.

EDL	02:23:29,370	02:23:38,780	| E67_SiE_6 |	But you bought the paper view, so they always had to have a post fight analysis segment where somebody would have to try to find a way that the other guy might have won. 
EDL	02:23:38,780	02:23:39,320	| E67_SiE_6 |	You know, oh. 
EDL	02:23:39,320	02:23:42,550	| E67_SiE_6 |	He tapped him on the chin at the sixteen second mark. 
EDL	02:23:42,550	02:23:45,520	| E67_SiE_6 |	And if if that had hurt Mike, we had a whole different fight right here. 
EDL	02:23:45,520	02:23:47,590	| E67_SiE_6 |	And that's kind of how I feel about the battle of late egolf.

EDL	02:35:12,240	02:35:14,900	| E67_SiE_6 |	From these people's fascinating first of all. 
EDL	02:35:14,900	02:35:18,610	| E67_SiE_6 |	They all seem to be patriots, even if they disagree with the government.

EDL	02:35:21,640	02:35:25,670	| E67_SiE_6 |	Looking forward to helping the postwar Japan emerge. 
EDL	02:35:25,670	02:35:32,340	| E67_SiE_6 |	A lot of them think about themselves as helping their families back home and trying to make a difference to see that they don't end up bombed or occupied. 
EDL	02:35:32,340	02:35:33,790	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	02:35:33,790	02:35:36,290	| E67_SiE_6 |	Some of the pilots expressed. 
EDL	02:35:36,290	02:35:39,700	| E67_SiE_6 |	All sorts of worry and remorse about the way their own army. 
EDL	02:35:39,700	02:35:40,800	| E67_SiE_6 |	Were treating captive.

EDL	02:35:45,640	02:35:46,760	| E67_SiE_6 |	I was thinking how. 
EDL	02:35:46,760	02:35:47,550	| E67_SiE_6 |	Very different. 
EDL	02:35:47,550	02:35:48,240	| E67_SiE_6 |	This is right. 
EDL	02:35:48,240	02:35:53,120	| E67_SiE_6 |	How you couldn't expect any other military major military in the second world war to do something like this. 
EDL	02:35:53,120	02:35:53,500	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	02:35:53,500	02:35:55,760	| E67_SiE_6 |	But the then I was doing some research and I came across. 
EDL	02:35:55,760	02:36:00,080	| E67_SiE_6 |	I think it was like a letter to the editor or something like that by a person who identified themselves as. 
EDL	02:36:00,080	02:36:04,450	| E67_SiE_6 |	US marine they didn't say in what era all they had written, though. 
EDL	02:36:04,450	02:36:11,920	| E67_SiE_6 |	Was if they had found themselves in a situation where their country was about to be occupied, where their government or their military superiors said that they could. 
EDL	02:36:11,920	02:36:14,160	| E67_SiE_6 |	Reduce the chances of that happening if they be. 
EDL	02:36:14,160	02:36:21,210	| E67_SiE_6 |	Willing to sacrifice their lives flying their plane into an enemy ship, this person who identified as a US marine, said he would be happy. 
EDL	02:36:21,210	02:36:21,850	| E67_SiE_6 |	To do that. 
EDL	02:36:21,850	02:36:26,870	| E67_SiE_6 |	And then I thought to myself, the Japanese are just like everyone else, only more so right, I mean. 
EDL	02:36:26,870	02:36:28,870	| E67_SiE_6 |	You can kind of see we're all tails from. 
EDL	02:36:28,870	02:36:29,220	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	02:36:29,220	02:36:31,520	| E67_SiE_6 |	They just took it to levels that in most. 
EDL	02:36:31,520	02:36:33,830	| E67_SiE_6 |	Societies are theoretical. 
EDL	02:36:33,830	02:36:34,840	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	02:36:34,840	02:36:38,670	| E67_SiE_6 |	The one part that really got to me the most um. 
EDL	02:36:38,670	02:36:41,320	| E67_SiE_6 |	Well, there were several, I mean, there was the one about the Christian pilot. 
EDL	02:36:41,320	02:36:58,290	| E67_SiE_6 |	You forget that there's a sizable Christian population in Japan and and you think of suicide as being prohibited by the religion, but there were Japanese k a makasi pilots who brought their bibles into the cockpit with them tape the photo of their mother to their *****, and when I was reading about this. 
EDL	02:36:58,290	02:37:03,680	| E67_SiE_6 |	One person that said, what isn't suicide frowned upon by the church, and someone else explained that they just didn't see it as suicide. 
EDL	02:37:03,680	02:37:04,920	| E67_SiE_6 |	They look at it as. 
EDL	02:37:04,920	02:37:08,870	| E67_SiE_6 |	The war bringing death to them rather than they seeking it out some. 
EDL	02:37:08,870	02:37:13,850	| E67_SiE_6 |	Of these, other people were making very rational calculations, because as another historian pointed out. 
EDL	02:37:13,850	02:37:19,990	| E67_SiE_6 |	They weren't making a choice between a suicide attack that killed them and a wonderful world of rainbows and unicorns, right. 
EDL	02:37:19,990	02:37:21,050	| E67_SiE_6 |	That wasn't their other option. 
EDL	02:37:21,050	02:37:22,170	| E67_SiE_6 |	Their other option was probably. 
EDL	02:37:22,170	02:37:26,440	| E67_SiE_6 |	Dying somewhere else, maybe, um, anonymously your corpse. 
EDL	02:37:26,440	02:37:30,040	| E67_SiE_6 |	Left in a decaying jungle somewhere, your family never known. 
EDL	02:37:30,040	02:37:32,680	| E67_SiE_6 |	What even happens to you or you could die a hero. 
EDL	02:37:32,680	02:37:35,230	| E67_SiE_6 |	And I think I read don't quote me on this that they got the. 
EDL	02:37:35,230	02:37:37,350	| E67_SiE_6 |	Comicosity products got an immediate increase. 
EDL	02:37:37,350	02:37:37,660	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	02:37:37,660	02:37:38,760	| E67_SiE_6 |	In two ranks. 
EDL	02:37:38,760	02:37:40,860	| E67_SiE_6 |	2 military ranks, and if that's the case. 
EDL	02:37:40,860	02:37:41,200	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	02:37:41,200	02:37:42,940	| E67_SiE_6 |	Well, now it's even a financial decision. 
EDL	02:37:42,940	02:37:51,050	| E67_SiE_6 |	Right, you can die in a jungle somewhere and your families at one level of poverty, or you could increase the amount of money that the state pays to. 
EDL	02:37:51,050	02:37:55,350	| E67_SiE_6 |	You know, grieving families and widows for upkeep and all that sort of stuff, um, if. 
EDL	02:37:55,350	02:37:56,460	| E67_SiE_6 |	You get your rank right, I mean. 
EDL	02:37:56,460	02:37:58,680	| E67_SiE_6 |	So you start to see actual. 
EDL	02:37:58,680	02:37:59,620	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	02:37:59,620	02:38:10,940	| E67_SiE_6 |	Maybe thinking going on in some of these decisions, and then one other thing that just moved me was how the the they were supposed to be volunteers, but many historians will use the word volunteer with quotation marks because the circumstances. 
EDL	02:38:10,940	02:38:11,360	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	02:38:11,360	02:38:17,240	| E67_SiE_6 |	These 20 to 24 year old guys were put in were such that they were forced into moral quandaries. 
EDL	02:38:17,240	02:38:21,390	| E67_SiE_6 |	And the only people that passed the moral quandaries and became the comicosity pilots. 
EDL	02:38:21,390	02:38:21,700	| E67_SiE_6 |	In other words. 
EDL	02:38:21,700	02:38:36,180	| E67_SiE_6 |	The only ones that this strategy worked on, we're sort of the most moral amongst them, for example, that a lot of these volunteer sessions were framed in a way that you understood that if you said no, that you wouldn't volunteer, that meant that your refusal was consigning some. 
EDL	02:38:36,180	02:38:50,500	| E67_SiE_6 |	Other person to death and a lot of these people couldn't handle that, but the part that moved me the most because it's one of those things I wonder about, I wondered in a show we did on executions once what goes through your mind the night before your own execution. 
EDL	02:38:50,500	02:38:51,620	| E67_SiE_6 |	This is similar. 
EDL	02:38:51,620	02:38:52,450	| E67_SiE_6 |	You wonder, okay. 
EDL	02:38:52,450	02:38:56,660	| E67_SiE_6 |	If you're a comic cozy pilot and you, you know tomorrow's go time. 
EDL	02:38:56,660	02:38:58,460	| E67_SiE_6 |	What's your last night like. 
EDL	02:38:58,460	02:39:01,060	| E67_SiE_6 |	And apparently, the last night, we're not spent alone. 
EDL	02:39:01,060	02:39:03,470	| E67_SiE_6 |	You spent it with the other people that were gonna go with you. 
EDL	02:39:03,470	02:39:03,770	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	02:39:03,770	02:39:07,240	| E67_SiE_6 |	And in um, oh nuki tierney's book. 
EDL	02:39:07,240	02:39:15,150	| E67_SiE_6 |	She quotes a guy who wrote all this in a letter decades later to somebody else whose job it was to cater to these pilots on their last night of life. 
EDL	02:39:15,150	02:39:15,730	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	02:39:15,730	02:39:17,790	| E67_SiE_6 |	And he writes what that was like. 
EDL	02:39:17,790	02:39:19,650	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.9 secs ]
EDL	02:39:19,650	02:39:23,650	| E67_SiE_6 |	He is identified by the way, as kasuga Takeo. 
EDL	02:39:23,650	02:39:38,340	| E67_SiE_6 |	And he wrote quote at the hall where their farewell parties were held, the young student officers drank cold socci the night before their flight, some gulped the socket in one swallow, others kept gulping down a large amount. 
EDL	02:39:38,340	02:39:49,390	| E67_SiE_6 |	The whole place degenerated into chaos, some broke hanging lightbulbs with their swords, some lifted chairs to break and tore white table cloths. 
EDL	02:39:49,390	02:39:56,920	| E67_SiE_6 |	A mixture of military songs and curses filled the air while some shouted in rage, others cried aloud. 
EDL	02:39:56,920	02:40:23,930	| E67_SiE_6 |	It was their last night of life they thought of their parents, their faces and images, lovers, faces and their smiles a sad farewell to their fiancees all went through their minds like a running horse lantern, although they were supposedly ready to sacrifice their precious youth the next morning for imperial Japan and for the emperor, they were torn beyond what words can express some putting their heads on the table. 
EDL	02:40:23,930	02:40:33,980	| E67_SiE_6 |	Some writing their wills, some folding their hands in meditation, some leaving the hall and some dancing in frenzy while breaking flower faces. 
EDL	02:40:33,980	02:40:41,830	| E67_SiE_6 |	They all took off with the rising sun headband the next morning, but the scene of utter desperation has hardly been reported. 
EDL	02:40:41,830	02:40:44,770	| E67_SiE_6 |	I observed it with my own eyes as I took care of their daily. 
EDL	02:40:44,770	02:40:46,190	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	02:40:46,190	02:40:51,980	| E67_SiE_6 |	And quote, now I don't know how representative that account is.

EDL	02:40:52,440	02:40:55,370	| E67_SiE_6 |	Of the comic cozy last night experiences.

EDL	02:40:56,450	02:40:58,110	| E67_SiE_6 |	There may be different experiences. 
EDL	02:40:58,110	02:41:05,940	| E67_SiE_6 |	I would imagine there were, and we should also point out that it was hardly just as pilots that these young people. 
EDL	02:41:05,940	02:41:06,260	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	02:41:06,260	02:41:12,060	| E67_SiE_6 |	Who the government could count on to reliably kill themselves, trying to kill the enemy wasn't just airplanes. 
EDL	02:41:12,060	02:41:15,830	| E67_SiE_6 |	I mean, they had something known as a human torpedo. 
EDL	02:41:15,830	02:41:16,270	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	02:41:16,270	02:41:18,200	| E67_SiE_6 |	They had bombs that they dropped. 
EDL	02:41:18,200	02:41:19,820	| E67_SiE_6 |	I think they may be rocket propelled bombs. 
EDL	02:41:19,820	02:41:22,560	| E67_SiE_6 |	They dropped from from aircraft that have a human pilot. 
EDL	02:41:22,560	02:41:29,030	| E67_SiE_6 |	They have motor boats that they load with explosives that designed to be driven into the enemy ships. 
EDL	02:41:29,030	02:41:35,930	| E67_SiE_6 |	I mean, there's a whole bunch of ingenious ways to utilize the willingness of your young men to kill themselves for the cause.

EDL	02:41:36,890	02:41:47,370	| E67_SiE_6 |	But it's this regardless of their positions on the issues and regardless of how much they might dislike the government or whatever it might be, there's a strain of patriotism that runs through these people. 
EDL	02:41:47,370	02:41:53,820	| E67_SiE_6 |	That's noticeable in all their writings, a love of country that did not always mean a love of emperor or a government or any of these things. 
EDL	02:41:53,820	02:41:56,120	| E67_SiE_6 |	Sometimes it was just a concept of Japan.

EDL	02:42:17,560	02:42:23,880	| E67_SiE_6 |	You know, patriotism on the part of their people and turn it up to an above maximum level, turn it up to 11.

EDL	02:43:54,190	02:43:57,180	| E67_SiE_6 |	There's probably some of us actually have been under a bombing attack.

EDL	02:44:04,190	02:44:07,260	| E67_SiE_6 |	Or not, because these bombing attacks have a lot more planes. 
EDL	02:44:07,260	02:44:09,550	| E67_SiE_6 |	And a lot less accuracy and. 
EDL	02:44:09,550	02:44:13,600	| E67_SiE_6 |	Part of the reason you have so many more planes is because you are so much less accurate, you.

EDL	02:44:14,180	02:44:17,170	| E67_SiE_6 |	Lots of planes and lots of bombs over a wide area to.

EDL	02:44:24,270	02:44:33,190	| E67_SiE_6 |	But that doesn't lessen the fact that if you're a Japanese civilian, maybe a Japanese civilian who's heavily filtered news reports about how the war is going.

EDL	02:44:33,520	02:44:38,630	| E67_SiE_6 |	If you have bombs, all of a sudden falling on your capital city and most of the planes that drop.

EDL	02:45:00,980	02:45:10,960	| E67_SiE_6 |	The US idea about precision bombing seems to founder on the rocks of Japan's cloudy weather and high winds.

EDL	02:45:11,770	02:45:14,746	| E67_SiE_6 |	There's all sorts of reasons that, that might be an issue. 
EDL	02:45:14,746	02:45:18,280	| E67_SiE_6 |	And in addition to that, they're losing a decent number of planes.

EDL	02:45:47,720	02:45:53,640	| E67_SiE_6 |	They just have an admitted yet, and the problem here is that even though it's almost over, it's.

EDL	02:46:07,500	02:46:11,600	| E67_SiE_6 |	Just look like they're just been battered from pillar to post. 
EDL	02:46:11,600	02:46:14,180	| E67_SiE_6 |	So this should be getting easier for the. 
EDL	02:46:14,180	02:46:15,540	| E67_SiE_6 |	I was fighting them, but it's not.

EDL	02:46:17,700	02:46:30,690	| E67_SiE_6 |	The casualties are getting worse, the civilian casualties are starting to absolutely go through the roof, and if we wanted to think of what's about to happen here in 1945, it's worth thinking about as a whole. 
EDL	02:46:30,690	02:46:32,370	| E67_SiE_6 |	Instead of this happened, then this happened. 
EDL	02:46:32,370	02:46:37,240	| E67_SiE_6 |	And this happened because if you're waking up reading your morning paper in the middle of Iowa one day.

EDL	02:47:00,850	02:47:04,120	| E67_SiE_6 |	Macarthur will be wanting them just where there will be wanting them in the central Pacific. 
EDL	02:47:04,120	02:47:08,580	| E67_SiE_6 |	I mean, so all of this is happening at the same time, if you're in the Japanese high command. 
EDL	02:47:08,580	02:47:17,780	| E67_SiE_6 |	You are being bad incident after incident after incident, and it seems to be having no effect on the main leadership's opinion on.

EDL	02:48:14,480	02:48:18,660	| E67_SiE_6 |	Which is, you know, sort of a colonial concrete stone?

EDL	02:50:44,190	02:50:44,880	| E67_SiE_6 |	Because this is. 
EDL	02:50:44,880	02:50:48,010	| E67_SiE_6 |	As we said, something that is remorseless, it's month to month. 
EDL	02:50:48,010	02:50:59,500	| E67_SiE_6 |	It's uh, it's a reliable tally of people, and this is what those statistics boiled down to on the ground in the book rampage, John M Scott tells the story of.

EDL	02:51:09,240	02:51:14,710	| E67_SiE_6 |	And this is the sort of stuff mccarthy was worried when he was worried about the pow having something happened to them. 
EDL	02:51:14,710	02:51:20,160	| E67_SiE_6 |	So Scott's piece starts with these men being rounded up, um taken to this school. 
EDL	02:51:20,160	02:51:25,830	| E67_SiE_6 |	And then eventually moved out to this canal at night, and they had their hands tied behind their back. 
EDL	02:51:25,830	02:51:36,310	| E67_SiE_6 |	And the Japanese has a flashlight and they start cutting off the heads of the people in this group has been taken to the canal by flashlight. 
EDL	02:51:36,310	02:51:40,110	| E67_SiE_6 |	And then when it is the turn of this gentleman that in Scott's book um.

EDL	03:42:07,630	03:42:17,400	| E67_SiE_6 |	So nothing has stopped the jack bombing Chinese cities and chilling civilians before the second world war even started for most countries, and they were dropping.

EDL	04:33:47,360	04:34:03,040	| E67_SiE_6 |	This one night, I shot, and when it came daylight, it was a woman there and a baby tied to her back, the bullet had gone through her and out the baby's back that still bothers me that how I still feel I committed murder.

EDL	04:38:30,620	04:38:40,790	| E67_SiE_6 |	I mean, there's a lot of people in Germany killing themselves as the red army approaches their territories, and there's whole books on that, but the experience in the Pacific is different.

EDL	04:39:07,350	04:39:19,780	| E67_SiE_6 |	Give them all a bunch of grenades to kill themselves, but there's not enough grenades and a bunch of the ones they they get our duds, so they have to figure out a way without any weapons, how they're all going to kill each other, and they're all relate. 
EDL	04:39:19,780	04:39:29,100	| E67_SiE_6 |	These are family members and just to make matters worse, by the way, as soon as the first grenades do go often, these people start committing suicide. 
EDL	04:39:29,100	04:39:42,570	| E67_SiE_6 |	Americans outside the cave, think that they're being attacked, so they start shooting into the cave, so the civilians are caught between people blowing themselves up in one part of the cave and Americans shooting into the cave, thinking that they are being attacked the man's name.

EDL	04:39:42,910	04:40:03,670	| E67_SiE_6 |	Is Kinjo, who's having this memory, and he says that between the American shooting from one side and people blowing themselves up from the other, and he was sort of in a state of shock, but then as his eyes clear, he notices a former official who had picked up a piece of wood and who had started bashing his wife and children with it.

EDL	04:40:21,360	04:40:24,860	| E67_SiE_6 |	And this is where it gets mind boggling.

EDL	04:40:40,490	04:40:48,140	| E67_SiE_6 |	Now those people who had not been able to take their own lives with grenades were worried about being left alive. 
EDL	04:40:48,140	04:41:00,150	| E67_SiE_6 |	They had to find other ways to kill themselves and the former ward chairman's behaviour of the guy who bashed his family had set the example, some used sides and razor blades to slash themselves. 
EDL	04:41:00,150	04:41:10,890	| E67_SiE_6 |	While others strangled themselves with lengths of rope as the mayhem unfolded, they found all sorts of ways to kill, including bashing others to death with rocks and sticks.

EDL	04:41:33,490	04:41:47,700	| E67_SiE_6 |	Quote Kinjo and his elder brother also had to fulfil their role, everything that was happening around them made them understand that they had to carry out their duty as well, kinjo said, quote, I think it was our mother. 
EDL	04:41:47,700	04:42:09,660	| E67_SiE_6 |	We hit first and quote as he and his brother began bashing her in the head, kinjo screamed out until she became a blur through the tears flowing from his own eyes for the first time in life, he wept uncontrollably, quote, I have never wailed like that sense, and quote the account. 
EDL	04:42:09,660	04:42:15,760	| E67_SiE_6 |	Then, says quote the brothers used sticks to rain blow after blow on their mother.

EDL	04:43:53,180	04:44:31,120	| E67_SiE_6 |	We had also never waged a war in which large forces were isolated from mainland support, thus not to taken prisoner became a fixed principle part of our military education since the middle of the greater east Asia war, most Japanese garrisons in the Pacific islands adhere to the supreme Japanese principle, never surrendered to the enemy officers and men, he writes, usually committed suicide as a last resort to avoid the ultimate shame of capture, our 32nd army was now faced with this situation, must 100000 soldiers die because of tradition.

EDL	04:49:12,440	04:49:25,100	| E67_SiE_6 |	What about the civilians, the numbers of Okinawans who died range anywhere from 30000 to i've seen a hundred and fifty hundred sixty thousand is numbers thrown out there. 
EDL	04:49:25,100	04:49:27,620	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 2.5 secs ]
EDL	04:49:27,620	04:49:33,960	| E67_SiE_6 |	Extrapolate that out for Japanese civilians, and maybe you say, well, listen, once again, this is the enemy side. 
EDL	04:49:33,960	04:49:36,090	| E67_SiE_6 |	I'm not gonna worry too much about their people. 
EDL	04:49:36,090	04:49:58,280	| E67_SiE_6 |	Okay, what about your people and I don't know how many non Americans were going to participate in the eventual invasion of Japan, but the American casualties on Okinawa are frightful, the worst in the Pacific war so far, 50000 casualties basically almost 13000 dead. 
EDL	04:49:58,280	04:50:22,630	| E67_SiE_6 |	5000 sailors dead Arthur Richard b frank had said that the navy and marine losses at Okinawa by themselves constituted about 17 percent of all the casualties sustained by the navy and the for the whole war, so there's an idea of how nasty things are.

EDL	04:50:24,340	04:50:48,670	| E67_SiE_6 |	Oh yeah, another sign may be of sort of war fatigue is that you can see the casualties, the psychological casualties on the us side, spike, i've heard all sorts of possible reasons for this sum, saying that the battlefield in Okinawa was sometimes so like a first world war battlefield that you started to see a lot of the same combat fatigue battle fatigue. 
EDL	04:50:48,670	04:50:49,940	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]

EDL	04:51:00,410	04:51:02,900	| E67_SiE_6 |	I mean, the stories are legendary. 
EDL	04:51:02,900	04:51:22,720	| E67_SiE_6 |	If you read them about how quickly those people tend to die when they arrive in battle, the first time they haven't acquired the skills necessary to survive, they always remind me when you read the stories of those of those sea turtles that have to hatch on the shore and then run the gauntlet of predators and threats to make it to the safety of the sea. 
EDL	04:51:22,720	04:51:24,150	| E67_SiE_6 |	Well, those replacement soldiers, if they if. 
EDL	04:51:24,150	04:51:31,660	| E67_SiE_6 |	They can last a little bit in combat, will develop the skills necessary to survive the competitors so unforgiving that tons of them get wiped out. 
EDL	04:51:31,660	04:51:36,940	| E67_SiE_6 |	You know very quickly, and the old soldiers don't ever want to get to know them very well because they die so fast.

EDL	04:51:39,060	04:51:46,560	| E67_SiE_6 |	But it's not just in a military sense at all that you're starting to see the the psychological tension mounting um. 
EDL	04:51:46,560	04:52:06,010	| E67_SiE_6 |	Earlier, we quoted a letter from a mother that navy secretary forestall had released to the public, which you know it cuts right through the emotion of a personal letter like that cuts right through the names and dates and places, and and all the other narrative uh and somehow re-establishes a little bit of the emotional connection to the story.

EDL	04:52:06,500	04:52:19,260	| E67_SiE_6 |	And in ah implacable photos of historians Waldo henricks and mark glacio do the same thing, they use a letter as part of trying to give a sense of how done with this. 
EDL	04:52:19,260	04:52:20,710	| E67_SiE_6 |	The American people are. 
EDL	04:52:20,710	04:52:23,640	| E67_SiE_6 |	I mean, Okinawa comes after iwojima, which comes after Pello. 
EDL	04:52:23,640	04:52:46,820	| E67_SiE_6 |	I mean, these are um body blows in terms of a war that listen, if you've never been through a pandemic and you're just ready to take the mask off and go back to normal and not have a lot of deaths, that's how Americans and a lot of people in the rest of the world are feeling by 1945 and henrickson Galligan writing this by the way. 
EDL	04:52:46,820	04:53:23,160	| E67_SiE_6 |	While the Okinawan battle is still the battle for Okinawa dragged on as the casualties mounted, so did the questioning of American strategy in mid-may following one of his daily war journal broadcasts radio commentator Martin at grand ski received an angry letter from a missus, C J H the mother of a soldier on Okinawa asking why the army war department and American leaders generally were not being held accountable for quote all this slaughter of American boys and quote an. 
EDL	04:53:23,160	04:53:34,800	| E67_SiE_6 |	Anguished string of questions followed, now quoting the questions from the letter, why haven't reinforcements reached those boys on Okinawa, why must the same troops fight for 45 days? 
EDL	04:53:34,800	04:53:43,330	| E67_SiE_6 |	Why only six divisions in the first place, why must every battle in the Pacific be bloody, it was bloody Tarawa, bloody siphon.

EDL	04:54:34,590	04:54:36,070	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]

EDL	04:55:06,120	04:55:16,710	| E67_SiE_6 |	He's the first American president without the initials fdr that anyone's experience in a dozen years, but he gives a warning to Japan, the Japanese people. 
EDL	04:55:16,710	04:55:24,140	| E67_SiE_6 |	In fact, the entire world, then if you don't want to have the same thing happen to you that happened to Germany, give up now.

EDL	04:55:38,030	04:56:06,490	| E67_SiE_6 |	To do that, we are now engaged in the process of deploying millions of our armed forces against Japan in a mass movement of troops and supplies and weapons over 14000 miles, a military and naval feet unequalled in all history, substantial portions of Japan's key industrial centers have been leveled to the ground in a series of record incendiary raids.

EDL	04:56:39,330	04:56:56,060	| E67_SiE_6 |	We have no desire, our intention to destroy it are enslaved the Japanese people, but only surrender can prevent the kind of ruin which they have seen come to Germany as a result of continued useless resistance. 
EDL	04:56:56,060	04:56:56,390	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	04:56:56,390	04:57:03,330	| E67_SiE_6 |	The whole situation in Germany is creating all sorts of very interesting societal and economic problems around the world. 
EDL	04:57:03,330	04:57:04,600	| E67_SiE_6 |	And especially in the United States. 
EDL	04:57:04,600	04:57:11,800	| E67_SiE_6 |	I mean, when you have a war ending in Europe with millions of men under arms there, what happens to them do some fight. 
EDL	04:57:11,800	04:57:29,480	| E67_SiE_6 |	The Japanese do some get demobilized and what happens to all the domestic political concerns and labor and management issues and all these things that have been put on hold as part of the unifying efforts that the country and many countries did the same thing put together for the war effort. 
EDL	04:57:29,480	04:57:37,800	| E67_SiE_6 |	A lot of this stuff is starting to rise up to the surface again before the Americans and the allies have reached the wars finished line here. 
EDL	04:57:37,800	04:57:53,030	| E67_SiE_6 |	Right, just because Germany's defeated doesn't mean Japan is, and as we've said earlier, the Americans really have to gird themselves for what's to come because the plans for the invasion of Japan are harrowing, slated to start in late 1945. 
EDL	04:57:53,030	04:58:02,600	| E67_SiE_6 |	Moved to the to the more important islands where places like Tokyo are by 1946, and the casualty limits are horrific. 
EDL	04:58:02,600	04:58:13,480	| E67_SiE_6 |	I'm not sure what the proper adjective to use is when the high numbers begin to look like a million men will be casualties worth pointing out, though that even today. 
EDL	04:58:13,480	04:58:15,910	| E67_SiE_6 |	We argue over what the casualty numbers would have been. 
EDL	04:58:15,910	04:58:24,900	| E67_SiE_6 |	No one knew what's more, the tendency in the Pacific on the allies part has been to underestimate the casualties that they'll suffer. 
EDL	04:58:24,900	04:58:32,530	| E67_SiE_6 |	So no one knows the basic plans, though that are being batted around, boil down to two main ideas. 
EDL	04:58:32,530	04:58:43,380	| E67_SiE_6 |	Some people want to blockade the country, which is already under a naval blockade to some degree, but tighten that, have ships, just keep everything from coming in fuel, medicine, food. 
EDL	04:58:43,380	04:58:48,540	| E67_SiE_6 |	Everything starving to death, and then keep bombing them the way you're bombing them. 
EDL	04:58:48,540	04:59:07,880	| E67_SiE_6 |	This may sound, by the way, like a merciful strategy, blockades often do sound like the lesser of two evils, but ask anyone who's ever lived through 1 um when you start denying food and medicine people, you have a horrific circumstance without any bombs exploding and in the blockade and bombing scenario. 
EDL	04:59:07,880	04:59:10,590	| E67_SiE_6 |	You're still gonna have Japanese cities burned out. 
EDL	04:59:10,590	04:59:18,040	| E67_SiE_6 |	The other idea is to bomb them the way you're bombing them and then invade both of those ideas downsides.

EDL	04:59:18,460	04:59:35,220	| E67_SiE_6 |	The navy certainly understands after Okinawa that they're going to be facing constant and withering attacks from common causes when they invade the home islands, maybe they had 40 straight days at one point on okan, that's going to be something that whittles down strength and kills a lot of sailors over a long period of time. 
EDL	04:59:35,220	04:59:36,600	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	04:59:36,600	04:59:42,010	| E67_SiE_6 |	But an invasion with ground troops, this is a terrifying concept. 
EDL	04:59:42,010	04:59:45,870	| E67_SiE_6 |	And no one knows how many people might die in something like that.

EDL	04:59:57,620	04:59:58,060	| E67_SiE_6 |	By the way. 
EDL	04:59:58,060	04:59:59,660	| E67_SiE_6 |	There's going to be a very big conference.

EDL	05:00:17,700	05:00:18,620	| E67_SiE_6 |	They had this conference. 
EDL	05:00:18,620	05:00:20,310	| E67_SiE_6 |	That's mostly about what we do in Europe. 
EDL	05:00:20,310	05:00:21,940	| E67_SiE_6 |	What's the postwar situation looked like? 
EDL	05:00:21,940	05:00:34,240	| E67_SiE_6 |	Oh, yeah, and what about the Japanese who are still fighting when the conference is ongoing, something happens back in the United States that changes the whole equation in Churchill has to be informed about this.

EDL	05:00:58,980	05:01:04,600	| E67_SiE_6 |	And he wrote about it in his history of the second world war and said this quote, the president. 
EDL	05:01:04,600	05:01:12,700	| E67_SiE_6 |	Meaning Truman invited me to confer with him forthwith he had with him general Marshall and and emerald lady up to this moment. 
EDL	05:01:12,700	05:01:30,450	| E67_SiE_6 |	We had shaped our ideas towards an assault upon the homeland of Japan by terrific air bombing and by the invasion of very large armies, we had contemplated the desperate resistance of the Japanese fighting to the death with samurai devotion not only in pitched battles. 
EDL	05:01:30,450	05:01:33,890	| E67_SiE_6 |	But in every cave and dug I had in my mind. 
EDL	05:01:33,890	05:01:40,140	| E67_SiE_6 |	He writes the spectacle of Okinawa island, where many thousands of Japanese rather than surrender. 
EDL	05:01:40,140	05:02:02,340	| E67_SiE_6 |	Had drawn up in line and destroyed themselves by hand grenades after their leaders had solemnly performed the right of suicide is what he means to quell the Japanese resistance man by man and conquer the country yard by yard might well require the loss of 1 million American lives, and half that number of British or more. 
EDL	05:02:02,340	05:02:06,500	| E67_SiE_6 |	If we could get them there for we were resolved to share the agony. 
EDL	05:02:06,500	05:02:13,260	| E67_SiE_6 |	Now all this nightmare picture had vanished in its place was the vision fair and bright.

EDL	05:02:19,000	05:02:44,980	| E67_SiE_6 |	I thought immediately myself of how the Japanese people whose courage I had always admired might find in the apparition of this almost supernatural weapon, an excuse which would save their honour and release them from their obligation of being killed to the last fighting man and quote, I have a hard time here in the 21st century.

EDL	05:02:58,030	05:03:24,470	| E67_SiE_6 |	But perhaps this should be taken into account that i'm not living in the world where cities are being bombed and incinerated multiple times a week, and Churchill and these allied leaders making these decisions what to them might seem a an incremental step up in nastiness to us seems like something that should never ever ever be done.

EDL	05:03:25,420	05:03:35,720	| E67_SiE_6 |	Now someone might say we're reacting to this emotionally and in the time period where they're operating, they're using logic, right, this is the human being lawn mower logic, isn't it. 
EDL	05:03:35,720	05:03:48,670	| E67_SiE_6 |	The idea that anything puts a halt to the conveyor belt of death and saves more lives long term is the greater moral good, but you've got to do some really horrific things to get there. 
EDL	05:03:48,670	05:03:55,640	| E67_SiE_6 |	I mean, look how it perverts the entire goals of this atomic bomb, I mean. 
EDL	05:03:55,640	05:04:08,160	| E67_SiE_6 |	In a way, if the goal here and it is is to shock, a stubborn Japanese leadership been definitely seen the light here that they've lost the war, a little like slapping the hysterical patients to get them to calm down enough to take in reality. 
EDL	05:04:08,160	05:04:12,480	| E67_SiE_6 |	You want this bomb to be as horrible and terrible as possible, the worse it.

EDL	05:04:27,480	05:04:36,340	| E67_SiE_6 |	Isn't it, we called it logical insanity in the shows that we did on this evolution of the logic of things like strategic bombing, but this is a lot bigger than that.

EDL	05:35:32,570	05:35:40,090	| E67_SiE_6 |	It's interesting to contemplate because a lot of societies evolve politically through bloodshed. 
EDL	05:35:40,090	05:35:50,730	| E67_SiE_6 |	I mean, how many countries get independence from other countries through bloodshed, how many get independence from their own oppressive governments by political revolution, right, the American Revolution, the French revolution. 
EDL	05:35:50,730	05:35:51,870	| E67_SiE_6 |	Bloody affairs. 
EDL	05:35:51,870	05:35:52,370	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	05:35:52,370	05:36:02,080	| E67_SiE_6 |	There's just a different vibe, isn't there, when it's people from outside your country who have to kill your soldiers, your civilians, destroy your cities. 
EDL	05:36:02,080	05:36:06,140	| E67_SiE_6 |	Occupy your territory in order to give you these good things. 
EDL	05:36:06,140	05:36:21,040	| E67_SiE_6 |	It's fascinating to think about and like so much of the frayed ends of the rope at the end of the second world war, how many loose ends here leave us wondering about moral questions. 
EDL	05:36:21,040	05:36:36,280	| E67_SiE_6 |	I mean, how about the number one question that often comes out of this time period, the morality of the dropping of the atomic bomb now I am on record as saying that I think this is one of the most important ethical sorts of circumstances. 
EDL	05:36:36,280	05:36:49,990	| E67_SiE_6 |	One can ask themselves about something that the entire potential future of humanity could rest on, and its importance becomes clear any time. 
EDL	05:36:49,990	05:37:04,810	| E67_SiE_6 |	The issue actually raises its ugly head, like in the middle of the Cuban Missile crisis, everyone instantly understood the import of this in a moral issue known as nuclear weapons. 
EDL	05:37:04,810	05:37:13,520	| E67_SiE_6 |	And this almost Shakespearean question of to atomic bomb or to not atomic bomb, what is not helpful, useful. 
EDL	05:37:13,520	05:37:31,870	| E67_SiE_6 |	Satisfying, or in any way instructive for the next time we might consider using such a weapon is to take it out of the context of the times because you end up creating a moral choice that never really existed for the people who had to make it, and then judging them on that. 
EDL	05:37:31,870	05:37:32,380	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	05:37:32,380	05:37:33,940	| E67_SiE_6 |	It's as though you have a plan. 
EDL	05:37:33,940	05:37:44,310	| E67_SiE_6 |	A drop atomic weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki or plan b don't drop atomic weapons on them, and they can live happily ever after, but that was never planned. 
EDL	05:37:44,310	05:37:53,720	| E67_SiE_6 |	B plan b is the one that makes plan a something that people would consider plan b is not to drop the atomic bomb. 
EDL	05:37:53,720	05:37:55,940	| E67_SiE_6 |	But to continue with the fire bombing. 
EDL	05:37:55,940	05:38:14,280	| E67_SiE_6 |	Which continued after the atomic bombs were dropped as well, historically continue with the fire bombing tightened the blockade on Japan, and they're already dropping sea mines from the air on Japan's harbors, so get that to a point where millions are dying from starvation or lack of medicine. 
EDL	05:38:14,280	05:38:15,160	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	05:38:15,160	05:38:33,580	| E67_SiE_6 |	And then had the inevitable land invasion against a bunch of civilians who are training with bamboo spears in 1945, that was the ethical choice, and it becomes a lot more murky, and when those are the planning and plan b choices, what should be pointed out. 
EDL	05:38:33,580	05:38:51,680	| E67_SiE_6 |	Those sometimes is that our views on these things have been colored by the intervening history, and when you read what historical participants on the allied side saw these weapons like sometimes you might compare them to x caliber. 
EDL	05:38:51,680	05:39:06,060	| E67_SiE_6 |	A super weapon that has fallen into the hands of people who see themselves as king Arthur and a weapon like x calibre in the hands of an individual like king Arthur is a potential awesome force for good. 
EDL	05:39:06,060	05:39:07,940	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.9 secs ]
EDL	05:39:07,940	05:39:21,910	| E67_SiE_6 |	See how murky and morally I mean, this is, this is the ethical dilemma of sour Ron's ring right in the lord of the rings isn't I hope you will forgive me for once again. 
EDL	05:39:21,910	05:39:22,270	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	05:39:22,270	05:39:29,620	| E67_SiE_6 |	Somehow, with my cynical nature, seeing a silver lining to the dark cloud, that is. 
EDL	05:39:29,620	05:39:36,500	| E67_SiE_6 |	The atomic bombings of Japan and it's a similar silver lining to the 1 I see for the holocaust. 
EDL	05:39:36,500	05:39:37,840	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	05:39:37,840	05:39:53,610	| E67_SiE_6 |	I think that after the holocaust, the fact that there was a holocaust saved a lot of lives, I think those who died in concentration camps probably created such an international historical shock. 
EDL	05:39:53,610	05:40:03,680	| E67_SiE_6 |	I don't know how long it lasts, but it certainly lasted pretty strongly since that created an international line in the sand that has been violated many times since. 
EDL	05:40:03,680	05:40:05,420	| E67_SiE_6 |	I mean, look at Rwanda, for example. 
EDL	05:40:05,420	05:40:06,220	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	05:40:06,220	05:40:15,220	| E67_SiE_6 |	That has created a situation where it is radioactive to commit genocide on people. 
EDL	05:40:15,220	05:40:16,530	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	05:40:16,530	05:40:27,620	| E67_SiE_6 |	The weaker is notwithstanding, perhaps I think the genocides that would have happened had the holocaust not happened, haven't happened, and therefore, I think the holocaust saves lives. 
EDL	05:40:27,620	05:40:28,070	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	05:40:28,070	05:40:30,080	| E67_SiE_6 |	I feel the same way about the atomic bombings. 
EDL	05:40:30,080	05:40:40,510	| E67_SiE_6 |	I I don't know if humanity ever collectively learns lessons, but if we do, I often think it comes with the equivalent of us. 
EDL	05:40:40,510	05:41:07,200	| E67_SiE_6 |	You know, touching history's hot stove, and in this case in 1945, maybe the hot stove was an atomically heated, and had we not had an example of what these weapons do to people and to our society and the things that we build, you know, the power is that one historian said to turn everything into nothing. 
EDL	05:41:07,200	05:41:07,650	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	05:41:07,650	05:41:19,110	| E67_SiE_6 |	That's a theoretical power until you see it, and seeing it is shocking and the shock of it may have prevented us maybe from thinking we ever had to try to use these weapons again. 
EDL	05:41:19,110	05:41:24,150	| E67_SiE_6 |	I mean, think about had the weapon been delayed another year. 
EDL	05:41:24,150	05:41:50,390	| E67_SiE_6 |	And the war ended before nuclear weapons were ever used, do you think given what you know about how we are that we wouldn't have used them in the interim just to see what they do, and we were tempted many times, and it was always Hiroshima Nagasaki zi example that created, if not a feeling on the parts of the military or the political leaders may be as strongly as we wanted. 
EDL	05:41:50,390	05:42:02,290	| E67_SiE_6 |	Certainly a feeling on the parts of of global humanitarian public opinion and the pressures you know exerted by them and the that were certainly, for example. 
EDL	05:42:02,290	05:42:17,940	| E67_SiE_6 |	Cascading through president Kennedy's brain as he contemplated the decisions he was making in the 1962 Cuban Missile crisis when he was looking at 6 or 700 million people dying, you know, in a few days. 
EDL	05:42:17,940	05:42:19,870	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.9 secs ]
EDL	05:42:19,870	05:42:49,470	| E67_SiE_6 |	Is it possible the humanity and the Japanese specifically suffered a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand two hundred and fifty thousand deaths from a couple of ten kiloton atomic bombs, maybe a 15 kiloton one in nagasakiya case to teach us not to use dozens or hundreds of 30 megaton ones. 
EDL	05:42:49,470	05:42:51,230	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]
EDL	05:42:51,230	05:43:01,020	| E67_SiE_6 |	I mean, if that's the case, is this the atomic age beginning nightmarish, so that it doesn't have to end that way someday. 
EDL	05:43:01,020	05:43:01,470	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	05:43:01,470	05:43:14,160	| E67_SiE_6 |	So that we don't have to have, you know, the war after the next war occur with our very best technological capabilities and those being sticks and stones. 
EDL	05:43:14,160	05:43:22,330	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 8.2 secs ]
EDL	05:43:22,330	05:43:23,330	| E67_SiE_6 |	Hi, everyone, Dan, here. 
EDL	05:43:23,330	05:43:25,520	| E67_SiE_6 |	We're just a couple of quick words before we leave. 
EDL	05:43:25,520	05:43:26,240	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	05:43:26,240	05:43:31,730	| E67_SiE_6 |	The first one is if you were interested enough in the ideas surrounding strategic bombing. 
EDL	05:43:31,730	05:43:42,190	| E67_SiE_6 |	That's the bombing of cities or the early history development use theories, ah, trying to come to grips with its potential destructive power of atomic and nuclear weapons. 
EDL	05:43:42,190	05:43:45,400	| E67_SiE_6 |	We do have past shows on both of those subjects. 
EDL	05:43:45,400	05:43:46,060	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	05:43:46,060	05:44:00,500	| E67_SiE_6 |	1 is still in the free feed as of this recording anyway, and that is the destroyer of worlds that's about 6 hours on that subject, so maybe wait for a long car drive, but we also have in the pay for archives off of our website. 
EDL	05:44:00,500	05:44:03,940	| E67_SiE_6 |	They're like two or three bucks, I think, um, logical insanity. 
EDL	05:44:03,940	05:44:13,040	| E67_SiE_6 |	The title of which we referenced in the past show you just heard twice, maybe and also logical insanity extra for the stuff that didn't fit into logical insanity. 
EDL	05:44:13,040	05:44:16,070	| E67_SiE_6 |	And those are um available on the website that sounds interesting to you. 
EDL	05:44:16,070	05:44:16,470	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	05:44:16,470	05:44:21,150	| E67_SiE_6 |	Once again, I want to thank you for being the most patient audience on the planet, and we appreciate it. 
EDL	05:44:21,150	05:44:24,070	| E67_SiE_6 |	It allows us to do the work with the way we wanna do. 
EDL	05:44:24,070	05:44:25,380	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	05:44:25,380	05:44:43,430	| E67_SiE_6 |	Also another announcement for those of you who didn't get to see and want to see our first world war immersive, experienced exhibit war remains just wanna let you know that it is now a part of the national world war I museum and memorial in Kansas City Missouri, and you can go see it there. 
EDL	05:44:43,430	05:44:43,880	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	05:44:43,880	05:44:44,990	| E67_SiE_6 |	This is the full set. 
EDL	05:44:44,990	05:44:46,250	| E67_SiE_6 |	By the way we're talking, I mean. 
EDL	05:44:46,250	05:44:49,280	| E67_SiE_6 |	There's a home version of this, but it doesn't have the actual set. 
EDL	05:44:49,280	05:44:49,660	| E67_SiE_6 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	05:44:49,660	05:45:03,080	| E67_SiE_6 |	It doesn't have the giant speakers under your feet to make the sound of things like shells vibrate through your spinal column is a whole bunch of things that the actual we we said it combined like virtual reality in a haunted house when you were a kid in terms of you know. 
EDL	05:45:03,080	05:45:04,730	| E67_SiE_6 |	You can reach out and touch things. 
EDL	05:45:04,730	05:45:08,270	| E67_SiE_6 |	And they're there, right, barbed wire rats. 
EDL	05:45:08,270	05:45:16,880	| E67_SiE_6 |	Everything feels just the way, um the people at M W M and at flight school and at skywalker sound um. 
EDL	05:45:16,880	05:45:19,810	| E67_SiE_6 |	They outdid themselves with this, and if you have the home edition, that's great too. 
EDL	05:45:19,810	05:45:27,350	| E67_SiE_6 |	But there's nothing like standing on those speakers and just having it, you know, knock your socks off, so if you find yourself in Kansas City Missouri. 
EDL	05:45:27,350	05:45:32,550	| E67_SiE_6 |	And you'd like to experience it head over to the national world war I museum and memorial, and I check it out. 
EDL	05:45:32,550	05:45:33,400	| E67_SiE_6 |	Would you tell em? 
EDL	05:45:33,400	05:45:33,950	| E67_SiE_6 |	I sent you.
