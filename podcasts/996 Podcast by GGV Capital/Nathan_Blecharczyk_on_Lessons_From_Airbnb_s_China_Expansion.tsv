EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:30,784	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	We didn't end up being a master then
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:34,624	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	But fortunately for years later we became one has been quite interesting Journey
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:35,136	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Working with
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:38,208	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Now we on their baby itself but also on the
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:38,976	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	China
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:41,024	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	So you have recently been appointed
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:42,816	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	As a chairman of a Airbnb China
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:46,144	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	But he had been involved with China on all four for a while
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:47,168	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Numbers from the very beginning
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:52,544	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Take us through. Journey how did you guys start thinking about
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:55,616	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	China and what the process engineer you took to get to where you are today
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:58,944	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Yeah well as a founder
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:03,296	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Been thinking about China since we first got involved in the story goes that
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:09,696	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I'm going to go way back so we made our first real International push outside of the US in 2011 and 2012
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:13,792	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And the focus then was on Europe that's what we're facing lot of competition at the time
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:19,424	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	But by 2013 European really settle down and we're looking towards Asia
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:26,336	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And in 2014 we basically one of our four strategic initiatives for 2014 was what we called when
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:27,104	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Asia
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:31,968	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And very quickly going into that we had a realization that
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:36,832	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That China was going to drive a lot of the network effects in Asia
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:43,232	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That's all the Travelers are coming from China around the world but also in Asia has a huge huge percentage of the in
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:45,280	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	About travel at these other countries
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:46,560	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	We actually at the time
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:52,960	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Had an otherwise contemplated really focusing on China we have heard all the stories about how challenging is
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:53,984	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Enter the market
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:57,312	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	How what western companies tech companies are often not successful
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:59,872	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	It's a we were actually focused on places like Japan
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:00,640	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Korea
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:06,016	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	But it was to that realization that all the inbound Travelers may be coming from China that we realized that
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,040	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Okay China
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:08,320	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	A critical part of this equation
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:10,112	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:11,136	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Then the question became
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:14,720	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	How do we do this in a way that we think we can beat
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:15,744	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Successful because my
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:18,047	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Our starting assumption was after hearing all these stories
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:20,863	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That the default is to be unsuccessful
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:26,751	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Do we have to have a pretty strong rationale for 4/4 kind of how we're going to approach this in
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:28,031	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	You have to be
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:28,799	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Choiceful
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:29,567	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:32,383	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	R R Us
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:35,199	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	We realize our unfair Advantage is there
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:35,967	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Global Network
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:37,759	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That we have the fact that we have today
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:40,575	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	4 1/2 million homes in 191 different country
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:42,111	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And we thought okay
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:46,207	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	We're really the only company in the world that can provide an outbound travel solution to Chinese
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:46,975	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Travelers
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:48,511	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Let's just focus on that
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:50,303	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	In other words we're not focused on the domestic
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:51,583	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	China
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:53,887	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And we're very explicit about
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:55,167	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That really shaped
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:56,703	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The first
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:59,007	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Probably two or three years of our China story
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:01,823	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Starting in basically mid-2014
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:06,431	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Initially the focus was all on
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:07,711	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Really product
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:10,527	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Actually there's a lot of product and simply didn't work in China
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:12,575	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I do too
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:15,135	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Restrictions we had a lot of dependencies on
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:16,927	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	On Facebook on Google
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:18,463	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Question Alaska for load
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:22,303	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	It said we had to basically pull out those dependencies
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:23,583	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	How to find other Solutions
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:28,191	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	In a lot of stuff just wasn't relevant to in terms of like social network integration so we had to
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:31,519	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Connected to local app stores local social networks
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:33,055	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Local payments
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:35,359	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	So this is actually
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:36,383	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	You know if they're not at work.
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:38,431	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	It is still ongoing but I say the first
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,223	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Year
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:42,783	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	You're in a half was really dominated by just fixing the Prada
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:43,551	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The basic
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:44,319	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Make it work
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:45,343	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Which of course made
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:46,367	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Remarkable difference
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,391	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	What's the products aren't working
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:49,439	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Growth really did start to take off
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:53,023	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I would say
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:55,327	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Parallel to that we were exploring setting up a local
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:57,375	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And that took a lot of time I think
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,423	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Going into the market
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:02,751	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Yeah we had heard all the stories and then people ask you all these questions that are
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:05,055	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	A little bit daunting like you know how do you think about
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:07,615	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Data privacy in corporate structure in
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:10,687	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Yeah there's all these things that as a newcomer
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:14,015	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	You know you don't really have a strong perspective on or any instincts
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:15,807	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:17,343	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And I think at the time we definitely
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:21,183	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Basically asked every company that experience why did China ask them
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:22,975	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	How they approach these things
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:23,743	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	He's really learning
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:24,255	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	A lot
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:26,559	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	It took a while to get through that
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:31,167	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Yeah it wasn't really until probably two years and that we really had a
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:32,959	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Look like to be up and running
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:37,055	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That was properly licensed and everything like that and that's when we started to hiring
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:38,079	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The team
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:39,615	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Sew-in not basically
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:40,895	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Mid-2015
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:41,919	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	We started building the team
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:45,503	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	It was quite small for a while will pass worth it today
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:48,063	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	We have a hundred fifty people in Beijing
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:49,855	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	It's going pretty quickly
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:51,903	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Started 2017 with around 30
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:54,463	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:57,023	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And we saw a big
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:58,815	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Transition about a year-and-a-half ago which is
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:01,887	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Although the initial Focus was on outbound travel
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:04,959	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	What happened in China what just happened elsewhere to is
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:07,775	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Travel Store Broad and they have a good experience on Airbnb
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:08,543	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Then they come home
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:11,615	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	PlayStation hey maybe I can do it at home
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:16,991	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so organically a lot of people are signing up to host who had previously been Travelers
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:18,527	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	In China
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:21,855	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so today we have about a hundred seventy-five thousand
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:22,623	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Homes in China
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:26,975	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That have largely materialized organically over the last 2 years
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:30,303	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And we spent actually very little money
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:33,119	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	To create this domestic business
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:38,239	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Eisenhower domestic is actually a very important part of the strategy to but I think we'll get more into that later

EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:20,479	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so we
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:24,319	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Would make us to China and we would go visit

EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:08,607	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Tech platform
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:09,887	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Yeah it really isn't a

EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:18,079	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Resistant that idea
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:21,407	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	But yeah so many people tell you even today
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:23,455	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That it without a local partner

EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:52,127	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	A lot of time

EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:07,487	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I think Q2 informative it's just
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:10,047	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Look what's happening organically

EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:27,455	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I've been a part of it
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:30,783	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Kind of decision-making on the bigger things from the beginning I was a huge
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:34,111	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Advocate of taking asleep
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:35,647	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Focusing on China
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,159	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Incel

EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:53,055	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:54,847	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	You need to do a lot of learning

EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:04,575	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	It would be less interesting ever

EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:32,735	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	After about a month after I had to stop

EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:39,135	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I guess
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:40,927	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Also people have proven that it's not
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:42,207	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Extremely nice
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:44,767	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Language but it really high
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:51,679	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Sounds like a challenge
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:56,799	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	So I wonder what is airbnb's trying to team working on now you mentioned there over a hundred people there

EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:04,735	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	60a say about of those people
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:06,527	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	60 are working on the product
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:09,599	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And we intend to grow that never quite a lot
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:10,879	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	How we think product is
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:14,719	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Probably the biggest sleeper in general for the business
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:17,791	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And it is very measurable and
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:20,351	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The second largest
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:23,423	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Yeah contention would be able to host Community operations
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:23,935	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Really
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:27,775	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Enmarket on the ground feet on the street type thing
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:28,543	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Where where
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:29,823	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Hosting meetups
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:31,359	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Inspecting property
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,663	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Things of that nature
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:35,199	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	There's probably easily
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:38,015	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	40 people in that group
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:40,831	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And then I say every function has at least
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:42,879	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That 10 to 25 people
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:44,415	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	It's a complex business
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:46,719	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so you know we have a
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:48,511	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Very build-out marketing team
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:49,279	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:49,791	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Yeah
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:54,399	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I will be putting out a variety of home-grown campaigns throughout the year
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:59,775	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	In other words not leveraging Global assets but everything kind of original from the ground up
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:00,799	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Even the concept
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:04,895	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Public policy horse has a big deal for us
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:07,455	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so that varies
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:09,759	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Save-A-Lot municipality by municipality and so
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:11,551	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That also requires a lot of people
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:12,831	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	So
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:14,623	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	There's quite a lot going on
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:17,695	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I will say that part of our precious
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:19,231	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	China has been to build up
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:21,535	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I'm at autonomous a team as possible which
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:24,351	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Largely comes down to making sure that
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:25,887	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	All the resources needed to ask

EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:29,983	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And we've really tried to cut all the execution
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:32,031	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	From San Francisco
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:32,543	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Possible
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:36,895	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	John the early days a lot of product working and other work is getting done here or out of the Singapore
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:39,199	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And we've really gotten quite strict about that
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:43,295	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I mean despite the fact that there are others in the company you want to help out we've really

EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:50,975	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	But if we take
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:51,743	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Separate
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:53,023	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Cannabis antutu
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:54,303	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And talk about album

EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,399	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Artifact is the strongest

EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:05,311	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	China's largest outbound tourism marketing
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:07,615	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And grab the largest was a busy
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:08,127	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	44u
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:12,223	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	How do you plan a skill that business
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:14,271	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Does it require a separate team to manage
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:16,575	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	All the inventory worldwide
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:18,367	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Cater to the Chinese
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:19,391	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Tuscaloosa
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:25,023	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	It does not really require that much of a separate approach
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:27,583	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Especially on the supply home side
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:33,471	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The homes that Chinese Travelers are booking are no different than anyone else around the world
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:34,751	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Thus far
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:36,031	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:38,079	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That doesn't seem to have slowed us down
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:41,151	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I do think there's a question on my mind which is as we
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:45,503	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Become more mainstream and we move Beyond Tier 1
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:46,783	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Tr2 tr3
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:48,831	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	You know what
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:49,855	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	How did the requirements change
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:53,695	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I'd say a lot of our travels right now
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:55,999	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Have some comfort level of English
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:58,303	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And of course that's not representative of the market
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:14:59,839	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:06,239	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Yeah we have experiment thought about you know how can we better match Chinese Travelers with Chinese hosts abroad but
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:07,007	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	How can we
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:09,055	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Help translate user-generated content
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:12,127	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I think of that nature but by and large dust by we having
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:13,407	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Gone that way yet
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:16,991	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I'd say
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:18,271	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	On the domestic front
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:19,295	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	You know we've got a lot of things
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:21,855	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Totally naked China
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:24,415	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Free sample
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:27,231	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	We have a much bigger emphasis on quality
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:29,535	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Making sure that
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:32,351	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Philosophical
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:33,887	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Philosophically want to make sure that
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:36,191	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	We don't have what we call a two-tier system
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:41,823	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	We want to shut that the quality of the product in China is of equal quality to that
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:42,847	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Globally
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:46,687	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And it's a little bit challenging at different prices
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:49,247	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	What's peanuts drastically there's just a far lower price point
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:53,599	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And there's also an abundance of
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:54,367	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Home Inventory
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:55,135	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Make it home
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:57,183	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	In China
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:15:59,231	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	You get a lot of inbound homes.
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:01,023	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Are kind of empty shells
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:03,583	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Yeah that doesn't doesn't happen that aren't actually lived in
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:04,863	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:08,447	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	We have actually prioritize quality over growth
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:09,471	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And we actually
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:12,031	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I routinely taking down properties in China
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:14,847	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That we feel don't best represent the brand
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:19,199	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I'd say if we let the business grow completely organically in China
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:20,735	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	It might tend towards
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:22,527	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Kind of service department
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:23,807	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	A little bit more professional
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:25,599	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And

EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:38,143	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Some of the operational things to do
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:38,655	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Support that
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:40,959	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	On the ground photography
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:43,519	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Brassy doing in person
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:45,311	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Inspections on homes in certain cases
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:48,895	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Everything that gets posted on a cyclist reviewed at least online
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:52,991	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And often results in a phone call where we coach and we talked about how to
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:55,551	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Make this host even more successful
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:57,599	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	It's all just a lot more Hands-On in China
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:58,879	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Then we've done anywhere else
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:02,719	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Speaking of the brand in the lower-tier cities
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:06,815	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Are they white issued a lot of Western companies face when they expand into China
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:11,935	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Is that their brand is perceived to be very Western and it's hard for them to connect with the grassroot users
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:14,239	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Many of the Miranda lower-tier cities
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:18,335	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	So is perceived to be podc or not connected with
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:19,615	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Energy of the land
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:22,175	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I wonder if that is that something behind
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:25,503	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The decision to name Airbnb I being in Chinese
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:28,063	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Which means welcome each other with love in Chinese
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:30,879	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	What efforts have been made to make sure the brand is
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:32,415	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Perceived as more grass
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:39,327	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Absolutely. That's one star Chinese
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:40,607	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Brand name
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:41,631	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Ciara go now
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:45,727	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so they're actually a few years that we eat when we had Airbnb
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,263	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And that
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:48,031	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Yeah I don't
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:50,079	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	There's no evidence that that was slowing us down
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:53,663	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That being said as we thought about becoming more mainstream
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:55,455	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Yeah there is a hypothesis
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:56,479	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Just that we needed a local
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:56,991	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Name
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:17:58,783	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I would say 1 year in
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:00,831	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I think we are correct about that
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:02,111	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Sada latest kind of marker
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:02,879	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Getting surveys
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:05,439	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I wish definitely showed that I'd being is
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:10,559	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Resonating a lot more and more memorable than Airbnb
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:13,631	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Did I'm sure it's very difficult for a local person to
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:15,935	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Just to say I remember since
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:17,727	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Has nothing to do with the language
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:19,263	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	So I think
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:24,383	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I think that was a good choice for us but if you look at our history at starting about that it wasn't really necessary on day one
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:28,223	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I think it's more nicer now everything about growing the domestic business
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:30,271	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And branching out
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:31,039	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Her2 Q3 study
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:36,671	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	So when you enter China than the market was in a blank slate like there were quite a few
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:40,511	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Other company domestic companies that were doing home rental or Home Sharing
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:43,327	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	How confident were you that you were going
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:45,375	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	To be able to carve out a meaningful Market
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:48,191	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	How do you perceive Local Company
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:50,751	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Well
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:53,567	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I was always very confident about the outbound p
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:58,175	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	It's because I knew that something that we could do uniquely well it'll be a long time before local companies
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:59,199	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Build an outbound business
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:01,503	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so that part I think was always
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:04,319	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Pretty clear in and honestly that was our only aspiration
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,087	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Begin with
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,879	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Maybe there was an assumption that the mess
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:07,647	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Business
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:09,183	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	What's likely going to be too hard
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:09,951	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:11,999	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	We explicitly did not focus on that for
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:12,767	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Two to three years
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:16,607	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	It was until we saw that organic growth that we started getting a little bit more ambitious
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:17,887	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Looking at
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:22,495	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The competition which there's been a lot I think at one point there was about a dozen companies
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:24,543	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	In the earlier days now.
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:25,311	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Just a few
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:27,615	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	There's been a lot of consolidation in the meantime
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:30,687	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	We've kind of seen some of the story in other countries
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:32,991	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	As well I mean it certainly has been a lot of Airbnb
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:34,271	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Clowns in Europe
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:35,295	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And I'll swear
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:36,319	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:38,623	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Yeah I think there's a few learnings that we
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:40,671	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Seen elsewhere which is that
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:43,231	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Airbnb is a Marketplace
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:46,559	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Airbnb's of C2C Marketplace consumer-to-consumer
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:47,839	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	It's a community
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:49,887	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And it's built on
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:50,399	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Trust
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:53,471	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And often through use a referral
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:54,495	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And that
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:56,543	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Growing that kind of business takes
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:57,055	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Time
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:19:59,359	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And what we seen with
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:00,383	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Competition
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:01,151	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Around the world
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:02,687	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Is that
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:05,503	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	They look at us and they say that's a successful model
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:07,039	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I'm going to raise a bunch of money
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:07,551	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I try to speak
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:08,575	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Quickly
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:11,647	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I think that is a common mistake
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:12,159	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Because
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:13,951	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	To build
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:17,279	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The kind of business we built we purposely have kind of gone slow
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:20,095	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And it's been built through word-of-mouth
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:21,631	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And use our testimony and Trust
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:22,399	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Building
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:23,679	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And not through direct sales
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:26,495	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so what we've seen in other countries
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:29,055	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Not specifically, but other countries is
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:31,615	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	People raise a hundred million dollars
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:33,151	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Hirevue sales team
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:35,199	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And it really becomes hard like a Beetle seat
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:36,735	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Model almost right off the bat
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:41,087	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And if it starts out that way it's really hard to then back into a C2C model
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:42,111	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The minute
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:44,671	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	All your homes feel like the professionals
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:47,743	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Suddenly the average person doesn't feel like they belong
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:48,255	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	In that commit
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:49,535	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:51,839	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Oh that's one generalization I would make
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:53,887	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	You know the other thing is that
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:55,167	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	We've been nothing
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:58,239	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Very honest with ourselves which is to recognize that
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:21:00,543	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	We will never move as fast as it truly local come
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:02,079	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	We will try to
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:03,871	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	But I think
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:06,687	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I think you have to be honest about you know what your strengths and weaknesses are
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:10,271	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so you know the weaknesses that
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:11,039	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	We will
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:14,623	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Never move as fast as local company and will probably never have the appetite
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:15,903	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	To spend as much
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:17,952	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Money as a local company would be wild
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:19,744	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I mean it is truly
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:20,256	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Eye-opening
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:23,328	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	How much are oil companies willing to spend spend spend
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:25,120	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	With very little Revenue
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:28,192	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	But based on the idea that you know it's kind of winner-take-all
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:30,496	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:31,520	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And I think that works
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:32,544	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Floor companies
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:35,616	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	As an outside I can do that just something that

EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:39,456	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Why did that would work as the outbound

EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:53,536	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	High School to explain what Twitter is and how

EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:28,096	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And we also saw in the market that there is a shout out to
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:32,448	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Nothing more but much more quiet my price point than the both Airbnb into jaw

EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:42,944	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	At like 10 bucks 15 bucks a night
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:44,224	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Type of accommodation
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:45,760	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:47,040	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	China Hustle
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:49,600	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	4 tier cities and at least in this Eichmann
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:50,880	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	3tier competitors
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:53,184	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Ichiban house, 424
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:57,280	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	But obviously we think that the market is big enough you can come in multiple 1
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:22:58,816	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Did the way I was
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:00,608	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Describe the difference between say aramid touche
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:03,680	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And it goes back to what I said earlier about how they
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:04,960	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	How to bootstrap your business
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:10,336	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Immediately went after at Sunset apartment buildings that had 20 vacant units at a time
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:12,128	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Yeah sometimes even hotels
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:12,896	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Network service
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:13,664	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Apartments
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:15,200	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so they brought on a lot of
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:16,224	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Inventory lot of homes
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:18,784	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Apartments very quickly
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:20,064	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	But they're all fairly generic
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:23,136	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And they didn't have the same above character
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:24,928	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That are individually owned
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:26,208	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Homer Park
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:26,976	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	At what
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:31,840	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so there is a large quantity of inventory but it didn't necessarily stand out as being
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:33,120	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I think
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:33,632	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That much
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:36,704	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	More unique or cool relative to a hotel
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:40,032	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so I think it was hard to build a
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:42,336	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Interesting consumer brand around that
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:45,664	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I think they've done a very good job and having a lot of supply
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:48,480	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I think they've had a much harder job
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:49,760	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Building Supply
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:51,552	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Consumers I think part of that is
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:53,856	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Because there isn't as much of a brand
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:56,160	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I'm around 2
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:59,744	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Respect in China
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:00,512	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I've grown
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:01,024	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Expendable
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:02,560	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:03,584	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Unlike in the US where
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:05,376	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Go to one of the
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:06,912	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Big hotel chains in the US
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:07,936	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Most of that building
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:09,472	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	All rooms haven't been
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:10,752	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Refurnish
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:11,520	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Where
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:13,568	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Upgraded in the last 10 years
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:15,872	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Internal audit new hotels coming
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:19,456	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	So to be to win against the hotel business
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:21,504	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	You need to have something that could differentiate
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:23,296	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Are BBQ to do it through
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:24,064	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Community Building
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:25,600	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And

EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:39,168	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Jerry yang founder of Yahoo has said on her show that

EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:47,936	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	In which an Enterprise from Singapore
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:48,960	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	It's trying to sell

EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:17,120	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Even with
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:18,400	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Government relations I think it's
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:18,912	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The super elevator
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:21,984	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Which is to say going to the conferences
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:24,032	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Talking about the topics
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:25,824	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That are important
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:26,592	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	2
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:27,360	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The officials
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:30,688	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Get out grabbing the meetings telling the story
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:33,248	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Signing the memorandum of understanding
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:34,528	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	You all these
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:37,856	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Things go a long way and I'd say are you a fairly unique
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:40,416	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The China some of its Asian more Broadway
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:42,464	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	But I say in China
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:42,976	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	These
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:45,280	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Things have really open doors
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:45,792	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Brusque
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:49,120	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Where you guys we have taken care of the western approach
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:50,912	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I think we would be kind of
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:51,680	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Shut up
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:52,448	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:52,960	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And I think
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:55,008	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I wouldn't have known any of this
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:56,032	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Without having a local tea
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:58,848	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And I think that's another part of like our approach
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:27:59,616	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Has been to
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:01,152	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Build a local team in Beijing
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:03,200	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Really Empower them
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:03,968	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Make sure that
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:05,760	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	All the execution happen to that
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:07,552	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	They basically guide me

EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:16,768	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	What would otherwise be probably can I eat with thrush
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:18,304	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Randall you have
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:19,328	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	About Honda 50
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:20,096	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	People in China
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:21,376	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	In August is a huge Market
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:22,912	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	You can easily see
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:25,216	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	10x if not hundreds
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:26,240	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Nice ice
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:28,288	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	How do you plan to
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:29,824	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Rollatini China over
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:34,688	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Well in general with our model it is relatively operationally light
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:37,504	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I will say one of the unique things about China is
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:42,368	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The cost of Labor can be laughing so enables a lot more operational model
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:44,928	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	How did you see us a lot of the Shanghai to make
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:47,488	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	NY China economy so successful in China
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:49,536	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The fact that
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:53,376	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	There's so much labor available to assist in making the transaction goes smooth
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:54,912	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That being
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:55,680	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Said
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:56,448	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And I think
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:28:59,008	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	We're still going to take a relatively disciplined approach
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:00,032	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Tuacahn
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:01,568	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	How we grow
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:03,360	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Bad can't have a growth class like I said earlier
EDL	00:29:03,872	00:29:07,200	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I acknowledge that we probably will never be willing to spend as much
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:07,968	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	At the competitors
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:14,368	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	But we will definitely spend more than we do another country is in fridge that but we're doing a China
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:16,672	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Having under 50 people on the ground we've done nowhere else
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:18,720	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And it is our only product
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:19,744	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Team outside of the US
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:21,024	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:22,816	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	We're definitely willing to think different
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:23,840	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I do think
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:24,352	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Look at that
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:26,912	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The discipline can also be good
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:30,496	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	How much does a reflection of how we approach the market
EDL	00:29:31,776	00:29:33,568	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	There's a fine balance between
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:35,104	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	High conviction and paranoia
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:36,384	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And I think you need both
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:39,456	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I think we went to the market
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:44,320	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Having done a lot of reflection on her strategy but we've also could have stuck to a gun to that strategy
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:45,600	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	At the same time
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:48,160	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I'm constantly paranoid about
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:49,696	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	What are we missing
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:50,976	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	How are we doing
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:53,792	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Are we falling behind we're getting ahead
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:54,560	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And I think
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:57,888	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	It's a fine balance between conviction and paranoid because when you're paranoid
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:30:00,960	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	You can easily question your conviction and change direction
EDL	00:30:01,728	00:30:04,032	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Which if you do that too many times this big problem
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:06,592	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	At the same time if you have so much conviction
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:08,640	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:09,920	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	You know you're kind of have a
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:12,224	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	You got your kind of overly confident
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:12,992	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That's a big problem
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:14,784	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	So I think that's
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:17,600	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Been critical as we think about
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:20,160	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Yeah do we do things like we do here do we do things like
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:21,952	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	We see others doing in China
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:23,488	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	It's definitely a both
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:24,512	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:27,584	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I think finding that middle ground and sticking with it
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:30,144	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	While also being very reflective is critical
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:33,472	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Travels inherently a very Network driven business
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:36,032	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That the bigger you are the more dependents you have
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:38,080	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The network is that it's going to be worth more
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:40,128	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	One of the simple math we did
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:42,688	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Before investing you guys in 2014

EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:56,256	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	But you have something that's harder for them to replicate
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:59,328	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	In China the taking a more indirect approach that you know
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:01,888	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Lately investing super early on

EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:16,224	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	After using the indirect approach
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:17,248	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Is a
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:18,016	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Feasible approach
EDL	00:31:18,528	00:31:22,368	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I do think that by strategically investing other companies in China
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:24,672	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That it is a productive work out for them

EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:29,280	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I think it's certainly is it's a safe approach
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:30,560	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:32,096	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	It's
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:33,120	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Somewhat of an incremental
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:35,936	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I think
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:37,472	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That can be a very smart way to
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:37,984	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Start
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:40,544	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And based on what they weren't that experiences
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:42,592	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	They might decide to lean into it more
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:44,128	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Which I think they have over
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:44,896	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	4 time
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:46,432	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And it's not unlike us
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:48,224	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Right where we started off making
EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:51,040	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Basically a product decision to invest and resources and fix

EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:54,880	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Then we decide to set up a local entity but really still
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:56,416	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Limit our involvement out battles

EDL	00:31:58,208	00:31:59,488	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The now it's a full-fledged

EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:09,472	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so there's been a progression there as we've learned
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:09,984	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And I think
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:11,776	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The decisions they've made in
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:13,312	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Play doubt
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:14,848	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	It's basically

EDL	00:32:37,376	00:32:40,192	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Yeah she can compete against local players in the in the
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:42,752	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	In the long run
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:47,872	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	How do you want to grow the Potomac business in what segment of the
EDL	00:32:47,872	00:32:49,152	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The populist do on the focus on
EDL	00:32:50,688	00:32:52,224	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I should have mentioned this
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:54,784	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The earlier one of the questions but you're the reason why we
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:55,552	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	We
EDL	00:32:55,552	00:32:57,856	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	How to expand it in bishan
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:33:01,184	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	To include domestic wasn't simply because it was organically taking off
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:02,720	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I mean that was
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:04,000	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That gave us confidence
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:06,304	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I think from a strategic perspective lights
EDL	00:33:06,304	00:33:08,096	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Actually really critical that were successful
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:09,376	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	What's a domestic
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:09,888	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Is that
EDL	00:33:10,400	00:33:11,680	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Domestic is more frequent
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:15,264	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And it's relevant to a larger part of the population
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:18,848	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so we have a concern that if we're not successful at domestic
EDL	00:33:19,616	00:33:21,920	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Then somebody else would I find what Home Sharing is
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:23,968	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	China and it won't be Airbnb
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:26,016	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so as
EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:28,576	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	As outbound travel becomes more common
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:32,160	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Those outbound Travelers will already be customer
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:32,928	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Hours of The Local Company
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:34,720	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And end
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:37,024	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	It will not be natural for them to now come to Airbnb
EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:40,096	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Until I actually think our success domestically is
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:41,120	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Is a little bit of a race
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:44,448	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	To educate the market and build a relationship
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:47,008	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That will hopefully blossom into an outbound
EDL	00:33:47,520	00:33:48,288	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Travel
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:49,568	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The other kind of
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:51,872	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Codependency between domestic and outbound is that
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:53,664	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	There's a very different
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:55,968	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Adra dr's average daily rate
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:58,272	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Especially the price people are willing to pay per night
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:34:00,576	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	This one Chinese Travelers go brought they pay
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:01,344	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Going
EDL	00:34:01,344	00:34:02,368	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	International rate
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:03,904	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Which is your more on the order of
EDL	00:34:04,416	00:34:06,208	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	90 hundred bucks tonight
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:07,488	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Domestic travel
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:11,328	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Is that a much lower APR because there are a lot of inexpensive hotels
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:14,400	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And say yeah you're talking more in the $40
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:15,424	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Somewhere in there
EDL	00:34:15,936	00:34:16,960	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:18,496	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	What that means though is it
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:21,568	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Is very different economics what is your class structure isn't really that different
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:23,360	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	In other words
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:25,664	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	We justify a lot of our expenses
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:27,712	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Based off of outbound wrapping
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:31,040	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	A lot of those Investments actually benefit our domestic
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:31,808	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Big business
EDL	00:34:31,808	00:34:34,880	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Where is the local companies they only have domestic Revenue
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:36,160	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	So they actually have a
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:38,976	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Much smaller Revenue pool which to justify
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:40,512	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Their cost that are willing
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:42,560	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Burn a lot more money than we are
EDL	00:34:42,560	00:34:43,328	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so
EDL	00:34:43,328	00:34:44,096	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	They still spend
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:46,144	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	A lot even if they have less Revenue
EDL	00:34:46,656	00:34:49,728	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Shuffle my business model perspective we can sustain
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:50,240	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Our business
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:52,288	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	In a much more healthy terms
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:53,056	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Because of this

EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:10,528	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so I think there's kind of natural 10
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:17,440	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	To gravitate towards those same trusted providers that have your payment information on file that are already installed on your phone

EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:45,856	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The backend exec
EDL	00:37:45,856	00:37:47,392	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	She's quite expensive and I'll get that
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:48,160	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	On the front end
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:50,464	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	There's the obvious stuff
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:51,232	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	You know in terms of
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:54,560	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The maps in The Social Network Integrations and
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:57,632	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Mobile app store in the alley.
EDL	00:37:57,632	00:37:58,912	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And by the way
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:38:00,960	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Something like alipay when he added that
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:01,984	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Is like a business
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:03,264	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Increase 15% overnight

EDL	00:38:13,248	00:38:15,296	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Double-digit percentage overnight so I was
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:15,808	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Pretty cool
EDL	00:38:17,856	00:38:20,416	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	So that was very packable other things we do that
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:22,208	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Less noticeable
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:24,256	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The homepage is slightly different
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:25,024	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	In China
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:26,560	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	So I called the product
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:27,328	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	White Pages
EDL	00:38:27,328	00:38:29,888	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Set up the pages to profile pages that display the homes
EDL	00:38:29,888	00:38:30,656	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	It's different
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:33,984	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	They basically lay out the information differently prioritize different things
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:36,032	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	A funny enough
EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:40,128	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The changes that the China team came up with they then tested globally and actually work
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:41,408	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Well Global Excel
EDL	00:38:41,408	00:38:42,176	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Iced Out
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:43,456	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	We took some lessons out of China in
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:44,480	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Next part of the
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:47,296	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I would say a lot though is
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:49,344	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Similar in other words we made a decision
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:52,416	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	From the start not to Forfeit codebase
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:53,696	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Not to create a separate app
EDL	00:38:54,720	00:38:55,488	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:38:57,280	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The byproduct of that is
EDL	00:38:57,280	00:38:58,304	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	80%
EDL	00:38:58,816	00:38:59,328	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	85%
EDL	00:39:00,096	00:39:00,608	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Pretty similar
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:02,400	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	On the back end
EDL	00:39:02,400	00:39:03,424	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	There is a lot of
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:03,936	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Complexity
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:07,008	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That can easily go under-appreciated
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:08,544	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And that complexity is
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:09,824	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	To deal with
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:11,104	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The kind of data storage laws
EDL	00:39:11,616	00:39:13,152	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	To deal with

EDL	00:39:19,552	00:39:22,624	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Not as big a hurdle for us of course
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:23,136	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	There's that
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:25,440	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I would say fraud
EDL	00:39:25,440	00:39:29,280	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	In China is quite sophisticated and the fraud we see coming out in China
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:33,888	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Oh yes it is very different than fried we see elsewhere until we actually have a

EDL	00:40:15,872	00:40:18,432	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Because so often you realize that you know
EDL	00:40:18,432	00:40:21,760	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	5 15% of whatever you're saying
EDL	00:40:21,760	00:40:22,784	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Might not be for real
EDL	00:40:22,784	00:40:24,320	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	But and so
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:25,600	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I think that's another lesson
EDL	00:40:25,600	00:40:26,624	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	From China is that
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:28,928	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	You have to have a dedicated team
EDL	00:40:28,928	00:40:30,976	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	He just like that you can't Take Your Eye Off the Ball
EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:34,816	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And you can easily find yourself in a place where you thought your business was doing really great
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:36,608	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	But it was actually
EDL	00:40:36,608	00:40:37,888	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	All artificial activity
EDL	00:40:38,912	00:40:42,752	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	So in China Millennials now account for over half of the travel Market
EDL	00:40:43,264	00:40:46,592	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And they're known for their taste for adventure and there are more open-minded
EDL	00:40:48,128	00:40:54,528	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I think Milano's now account for over 80% of Airbnb trying to Airbnb China Market which is a high proportion.
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:55,040	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The other countries
EDL	00:40:55,552	00:40:58,368	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Do you make any special efforts to appeal to Chinese millennials
EDL	00:40:59,648	00:41:05,024	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I think it's a little bit less of what we do and it's more about what we don't do that has caused this and in other words
EDL	00:41:05,536	00:41:08,864	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Chinese Millennials are materially different than their
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:09,632	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Parents
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:10,912	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Which of course it's
EDL	00:41:10,912	00:41:13,984	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Does every country by an in China it's it's very start

EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:33,696	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	In a way that older Travelers
EDL	00:41:34,208	00:41:35,744	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Are prepared to take that leap
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:38,560	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	We've also like not invested in

EDL	00:41:43,680	00:41:44,448	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The order
EDL	00:41:44,448	00:41:45,216	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Market
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:45,728	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:48,288	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Contrast that with other countries
EDL	00:41:49,056	00:41:50,848	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	You know in China is 80%
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:54,431	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Millennial on the traveler side another countries that would be 50
EDL	00:41:54,431	00:41:55,199	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	2%
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:55,967	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	By comparison
EDL	00:41:56,479	00:41:59,039	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I think on the host side there's also a difference

EDL	00:42:01,855	00:42:03,135	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	From my anecdotal experience
EDL	00:42:03,647	00:42:04,415	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	First month's rent

EDL	00:42:09,279	00:42:13,119	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	They've come at it because they they traveled on Airbnb for
EDL	00:42:13,119	00:42:15,167	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Cesar from that angle where as in
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:15,935	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Other countries
EDL	00:42:16,447	00:42:19,775	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Typically the hosts are older property owners
EDL	00:42:19,775	00:42:20,543	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Empty nesters

EDL	00:42:31,295	00:42:33,087	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And there should be more of them than those who are
EDL	00:42:33,599	00:42:34,367	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	English
EDL	00:42:34,879	00:42:36,671	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Even when you can crack that

EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:46,911	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Maybe the next big challenge for us
EDL	00:42:46,911	00:42:47,679	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	In terms of
EDL	00:42:48,191	00:42:49,727	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Yeah we've accomplished a lot
EDL	00:42:49,727	00:42:51,519	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I think you're one cities
EDL	00:42:52,031	00:42:55,615	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Where networks are ubiquitous and extremely song

EDL	00:42:58,943	00:43:00,223	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The really big part of the market
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:01,759	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	M&M can weed
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:04,319	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Do as well there I think that will be interesting on the next year
EDL	00:43:04,319	00:43:06,879	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	In preparation for this podcast was look at something
EDL	00:43:07,391	00:43:09,183	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Basic Chinese authorization stats
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:10,463	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	They are
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:12,767	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I can cover like as Europe in US
EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:15,071	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	There are 14 cities in the US

EDL	00:43:18,143	00:43:22,239	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Heather 3 in the California here to San Diego San Jose and LA
EDL	00:43:22,239	00:43:24,287	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The three alone in Texas
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:25,823	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	San Antonio Houston and Dallas
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:27,359	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	There are
EDL	00:43:27,359	00:43:28,895	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Just under 40
EDL	00:43:28,895	00:43:31,711	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Of such cities with over a million people each in
EDL	00:43:31,711	00:43:32,991	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Europe
EDL	00:43:32,991	00:43:33,503	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Including turkey
EDL	00:43:34,015	00:43:36,319	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Putting China number is 160
EDL	00:43:36,831	00:43:38,111	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The number is going to double
EDL	00:43:38,623	00:43:39,647	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The next 10 to 15 years
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:42,975	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	So when we look at 162 360
EDL	00:43:43,487	00:43:46,815	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	With all these a million people each that's a huge Market
EDL	00:43:46,815	00:43:47,839	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	For Airbnb to tok
EDL	00:43:48,351	00:43:50,399	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Yeah and I think I may have much rather
EDL	00:43:50,399	00:43:52,191	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Be popular with millennials
EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:53,471	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Because yeah they're going to
EDL	00:43:53,471	00:43:59,871	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Grow older and and and you're going to try to go with them but I also think
EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:00,895	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	As millennials
EDL	00:44:00,895	00:44:03,199	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Go off at families they want to afford
EDL	00:44:03,711	00:44:04,735	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Larger homes
EDL	00:44:04,735	00:44:07,039	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	In urban areas which they have an affinity for
EDL	00:44:07,039	00:44:08,831	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I think we can be apart
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:10,367	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Of that Journey meaning I think
EDL	00:44:10,367	00:44:11,647	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	We can help them
EDL	00:44:11,647	00:44:17,023	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	To buy a bigger home to ever hire lifestyle and be that. That's what we seen elsewhere
EDL	00:44:17,791	00:44:19,583	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so I think you know
EDL	00:44:19,583	00:44:20,607	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	This is this
EDL	00:44:20,607	00:44:22,655	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	In China this move towards urbanization
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:27,775	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And when you look at these Urban centers are growing so quickly but also becoming so expensive
EDL	00:44:28,287	00:44:30,847	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The affordability is actually becoming quite low
EDL	00:44:30,847	00:44:33,663	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Especially in the new development which I think a lot of the
EDL	00:44:34,175	00:44:35,711	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Young Millennials aspire
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:36,479	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	To live in
EDL	00:44:36,479	00:44:38,527	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	I think we can actually be a part of the
EDL	00:44:38,527	00:44:40,575	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Dissolution that they're already familiar with
EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:41,855	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And help them to afford
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:42,367	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	A big arrest

EDL	00:44:46,975	00:44:47,999	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	B2xpress of 11
EDL	00:44:48,511	00:44:49,535	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	So the other
EDL	00:44:49,535	00:44:50,303	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	140 cities
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:52,095	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Are organized enough
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:54,911	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That connect the high-speed rail and then more Subway

EDL	00:46:22,463	00:46:26,815	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	So I think that's why we're seeing so much Innovation I'd also say like the government as
EDL	00:46:26,815	00:46:28,351	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Made a pretty strong message that like
EDL	00:46:28,351	00:46:29,631	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Innovation is welcome
EDL	00:46:29,631	00:46:34,239	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And for me it's such a different conversation when I go to China and
EDL	00:46:34,239	00:46:36,543	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	The general Outlook of policy-makers are
EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:38,335	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	What's the new models
EDL	00:46:38,335	00:46:39,871	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	To them are opportunist
EDL	00:46:40,895	00:46:45,503	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And there should be rules around his opportunities but they generally say new models are a good thing
EDL	00:46:45,503	00:46:46,527	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Let's do that
EDL	00:46:46,527	00:46:49,343	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	But like left we're on our way into it and take steps together
EDL	00:46:51,391	00:46:52,415	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Other countries
EDL	00:46:52,415	00:46:53,951	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Basically policymaker say
EDL	00:46:54,975	00:46:56,767	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Wow that sounds really cool
EDL	00:46:56,767	00:47:00,607	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	But I have all my existing constituents running on old model
EDL	00:47:00,607	00:47:02,399	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And so we really need to
EDL	00:47:02,399	00:47:03,167	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Be cautious
EDL	00:47:03,679	00:47:06,239	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And basically do optimize for the incumbent
EDL	00:47:06,751	00:47:07,775	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	In the industry
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:09,055	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And
EDL	00:47:09,055	00:47:10,591	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Kind of star from that mindset
EDL	00:47:10,591	00:47:11,871	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	As opposed to seeing
EDL	00:47:11,871	00:47:13,407	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Everything new as a big opportunity
EDL	00:47:13,919	00:47:15,455	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	It's so you know I think
EDL	00:47:16,223	00:47:17,759	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	That helped some of these ideas
EDL	00:47:17,759	00:47:20,319	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	To thrive Ematic bike sharing is a great example to

EDL	00:47:24,415	00:47:27,999	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And that's generally been accepted in a way that in the US at least
EDL	00:47:27,999	00:47:28,511	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Then I think other
EDL	00:47:29,023	00:47:30,303	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	Western world countries
EDL	00:47:30,303	00:47:34,655	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	People said no you like you just going to be a lot of ground rules about where you can discard your bike
EDL	00:47:35,167	00:47:36,703	| Nathan_Blecharczyk_on_Lessons_From_Airbnb_s_China_Expansion |	And frankly needing to be
