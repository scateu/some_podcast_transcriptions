EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:13,759	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Is that the tail end right in transitioning
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:15,551	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	The Marine Corps
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:16,831	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	That's so
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:19,903	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	This isn't a nice example where you can sort of talk about the original
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:20,927	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Idea of it
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:22,463	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	It's status now when
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:26,559	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Advanced RF
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:29,631	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Nothing is really known by the
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:35,007	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Name radio app that's it slid the shorthand we use for that program until the radium at program
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:41,407	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Is really trying to provide that basic Spectrum situational awareness what's happening in the Spectrum
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:45,503	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	As you say it's lit its invisible unless we make it visible through
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:47,039	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Computer visualization
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:48,319	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Olson so
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:49,855	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	I'm it's a mix of
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:53,439	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Sensing what's a out there so turning existing
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:59,839	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Radios things like that into RF sensor so you can see what's actually see what's going
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:01,631	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Only one in the Spectrum you can sample
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:03,423	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	What's going on in the Spectrum
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:06,751	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	You bring that back over tactical networks in our case
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:08,287	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Is that the Marine Corps
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:11,871	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	But you bring those back to essentially
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:12,895	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	PC think of a laugh
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:19,295	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And you run some algorithms on it and generate a visualization of what's happening in the in the
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:20,831	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	The Spectrum at any given area
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:23,391	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	In any given area and so if you may have
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:27,231	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Military units operating in a particular area they
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:30,815	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Generally many of those Marines Are Soldiers
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:31,839	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Have radios
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:35,935	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	You use those radios as your sensors you bring back
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:38,495	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Yeah all the measurements you can from that area
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:42,847	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	To that location where you can run the algorithms and generate
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:47,711	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	What looks like a heat map of colored visualization of what's Happening
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:50,271	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	In that geographic area in the Spectrum
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:56,415	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	The map shows you how much energy is there by the color of the of the map kind of the way that you do
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:57,439	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Signals are different
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:08:04,095	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Tell how strong the signals are if you think of like the weather radar that you see you know on the evening news
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:08,959	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	On that type of visualization is the way you used to look at the Spectrum
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:11,519	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And you can see here what essentially what's
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:12,799	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Radiating hot
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:14,079	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	In your area
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:17,407	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And that may be of interest you may be curious about what that is
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:23,295	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	I'm so we can't we have a display that shows Seattle kind of here's what's happening over all the Spectrum
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:29,695	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And then we have a display that shows you okay at this particular frequency at this particular part of the spectrum
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:33,023	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Say the frequencies where the Wi-Fi networks are
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:34,559	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	You can see where the hotspot
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:38,911	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	You can see how they are radiating away from there
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:40,191	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	There they say
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:43,775	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Situational
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:44,287	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Ernest Rady
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:45,823	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	I can look around in
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:46,335	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And see if there
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:47,871	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Maybe their adversaries like
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:49,663	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	At military assets
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:51,455	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	We have an adversary's might have
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:53,503	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	This is has always been sort of more of a
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:54,527	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Invisible sort of
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:56,319	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	A set of phenomena
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:58,623	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	As a war fighter if I know this
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:00,159	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Now
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:00,671	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Muhammad Ali
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:08,351	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Says I was a war fighter it's it's very valuable because you can start to identify maybe signals that you did not expect to be
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:14,751	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	They are so a particular example that we have from some Marine Corps exercises was a lance
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:19,103	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Scorpio was simply really that they playing with the radio map display
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:26,015	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And I saw something that was unusual and it turned out to be the sniper team that was out there hiding and not visit
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:31,647	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Otherwise other than there are at Spectrum emissions us are using there their radios
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:36,511	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	So they're things like that that that allow you to identify what's happening
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:42,911	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	I'm in the Spectrum and then you can decide if that's militarily important or or not you may decide
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:45,983	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Well that's an odd signal maybe I should send somebody over to take a look
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:47,519	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Things like things like that
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:50,079	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Are possible course of action that you're
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:52,895	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	You're presented once you can finally see what's happening in the
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:53,663	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Nerf
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:56,991	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Sucker right in the radio map is getting to what we
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:58,015	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Think of you
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:59,807	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	As one of the best finish line
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,087	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Technology development
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:02,367	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Graham can get to it
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:02,879	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Which is to say
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:04,927	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	You're going to hand this off
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:05,951	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	In this case right side
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:07,999	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	To the Marine Corps what are the next steps for that tab
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:12,351	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	What we're doing with the the Marine Corps is working with them on
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:14,655	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Some of these various exercises and and
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:15,679	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Experiments in
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:17,983	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	In parallel the Marine Corps has been very
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:20,543	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Forward-leaning in Spectrum operations
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:23,103	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Um Spectrum operation
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:25,919	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Since they have been adding it to their Doctrine
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:30,271	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	They have been looking at techniques procedures
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:34,111	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	How they might use the electromagnetic spectrum in a war fighting sense
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:36,927	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And so they've been for leading on Helen
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:40,511	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Some of these ideas of if they have the technology
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:45,887	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And so what we're doing dark has developed the technology and we are transitioning it
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:47,935	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	To the Marines where they can then start to use it
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:54,079	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	I'm in in exercises first and then in the in the forces we roll forward so
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:57,663	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	They have you know identify this is a key technology
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:01,503	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	That will be inserted as they roll forward in there
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:03,039	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Budget planning and their program
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:07,647	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Let's let's talk about another program that is when not as far along
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:08,927	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	About to be
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:09,439	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Detransition
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:13,535	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Yet this one goes by and acronym Spark
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:15,327	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	There's two s's in the front of that essay
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:16,863	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Sparcc
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:20,959	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	That stands for shared Spectrum access for radar
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:22,495	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And communication
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:26,591	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	This does relate to what we were just talking about specially in the sense of
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:27,359	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Where where are they
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:28,383	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	There's a very busy
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:30,943	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Electromatic magnetic Spectrum which
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:31,455	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	How to say where
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:32,735	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Kinds of
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:35,295	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	People and devices 1
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:37,343	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Kind of have access to that
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:41,951	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	So there you are exploring something called Spectrum sharing maybe we can just
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:42,463	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Talk about that
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:43,999	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Concept
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:44,767	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Becoming ever more
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:51,167	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Important sure so one of the issues with the spectrum is that it is very heavily used
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:56,031	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	You can just think of you were cellular your cell phones they are
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:12:02,431	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Using more and more of the spectrum there's Wi-Fi your millions and millions and millions
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:05,247	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	4 Dirhams water Wi-Fi and sell cell phones
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:06,527	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Pretty sure it is
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:09,855	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Answer there are there there's is heavy use of the RF Spectrum
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:13,439	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	That is a new modern phenomenon
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:15,231	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	If you look back in the
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:18,815	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Yam 1960 70s even the 80s
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:22,911	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Most of the RF Spectrum use tended to be governmental and Military
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:27,263	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And so the the Advent of cell phones and then
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:28,799	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Laptops and
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:35,199	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	IPads and so forth with wifi-connected refrigerators all of that has started to
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:41,599	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Did you really be the dominant use of the of the Spectrum which means that the military has to
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:45,183	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Adapt to having less and less freedom to to move in that spec
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:50,559	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And so one of the things that we're doing in the spark program is looking this idea of sharing
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:55,423	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Between Communications tactical Communications and even maybe commercial Communications
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:57,727	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And Military radar
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,775	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	We have looked at the
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:02,591	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Ladies Radars and how they might interact
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:04,895	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	With reuse the same Spectrum
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:08,735	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	As LTE cell phones and in some Spectrum bands
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:14,111	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And all we've also looked at how military systems can share with military sis
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:19,231	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	So for example we've done some things that I have transition to the Army
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:23,327	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Where they're developing a radar that will use the radar
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:25,631	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Free communications with other radar sites
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:29,727	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Oh and so there's that to get improve radar overall system
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:33,055	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	It's other things like that were that's smarter use of the
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:33,823	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	The Spectrum
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:36,127	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Enables the military to use less
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:41,759	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And the commercial world has this constant pressure that it needs more spectrum because of
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:43,295	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Used by individuals and
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:45,599	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	The individual consumer
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:48,927	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	What in this this sounds like it relate
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:49,439	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Its 2
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:50,975	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Awesome work
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:54,047	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	That colleagues in the Microsystems technology office
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:58,399	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Are working on I'm referring here to the Spectrum collaboration show
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:13:59,679	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Which also
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:02,751	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Is really all about trying to bring this whole idea
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:03,519	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Spectrum
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:07,359	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Sharing almost like a new ethicon how to use and think about the Spectrum
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:09,151	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Into a material ey
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:09,919	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	White contacts
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:10,687	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	You know where where you been
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:12,223	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	The radios
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:13,503	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	We'll have to get smarter
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:14,271	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And I know what's going on
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:20,415	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Absolutely going back a little bit in my personal history
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:23,231	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	In 2003-2005 I was a
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:25,023	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Program manager over at the national
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:25,535	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Science found
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:31,423	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And one of the things that I started today or was program looking at
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:35,007	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Taking smart radios and doing dynamic
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:35,519	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Access
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:41,151	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Listen to might not have heard that term before smart radio can you just
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:45,503	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Usher for so so smart radios really a software-defined
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:47,807	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Radio in the sense of the radio
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:49,599	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Characteristics it
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:52,159	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	The frequencies that uses the
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:56,255	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Types of waveforms that sends over the electromagnetic spectrum
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:15:00,351	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Those are all the find my scroll saw for familiar
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,375	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Am and
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:07,519	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Amplitude modulation frequency modulation at the at the lowest level Defenders
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:09,055	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Yeah you can think of Wi-Fi
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:10,335	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Why is being a have having it at
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:11,103	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Subway for mother
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:14,175	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	All of these
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:15,967	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Different types of waveforms
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:16,991	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Canby
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:19,295	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Basically implemented using software these days
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:22,111	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Because of the the vast increase in
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:23,647	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Computing power available
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:25,183	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	As well as improvements
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:25,695	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	The RF device
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:29,023	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Radios capable of doing
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:31,583	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Exactly
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:35,423	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And those capabilities are getting smarter and smarter more and more
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:37,727	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Capability is being jammed into
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:40,799	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	You know it's smaller and smaller handset
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:42,335	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Yeah I'd like your cell phone
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:44,127	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Tactical radios
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:45,407	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	In the military
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:52,575	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	So when I was at the National Science Foundation at NSF started this program on dynamically accessing this
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:53,343	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Spectrum
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:56,159	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	That is using different frequency bands
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:56,671	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	2
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:58,719	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	They are essentially
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:16:00,767	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Share the Spectrum were more intelligent
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:02,303	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	That was
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:03,583	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Academic work
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:08,703	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	A lot of that work has matured to the point where that starting to show up in
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:11,775	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	I'm chips and systems that can be used
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:15,103	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Throughout both the commercial world as well as the military world
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:16,895	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	MTO with a Michael
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:19,967	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Patron XO technology offices helping to
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:20,735	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	To move that
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:23,551	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Wave of Technology forward
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:25,087	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	By making better
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:27,135	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Devices and creating
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:28,671	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Better techniques
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:29,951	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Through things like the Spectre
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:30,975	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Challenge
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:32,767	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Me to wear
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:34,303	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	They're looking at different
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:35,071	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Techniques for sharing
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:39,423	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	There's definitely been a a movement throughout
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:41,215	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Academia industry
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:43,263	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	To try to make the the
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:44,031	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Spectrum access
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:45,311	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Play smarter
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:47,103	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And then we traditionally.
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:50,687	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	On the traditional way of accessing the Spectrum were
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:51,199	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Has been
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:54,271	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	The traditional bureaucratic top down
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:55,551	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Types of ways of managing
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:56,575	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	The Spectrum the FCC
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:17:00,159	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Normally would say you get to use
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:00,671	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	This
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:01,951	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Frequency
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:02,719	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	This time
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:04,511	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Under these conditions
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:05,791	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And what we're talking is making this
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:06,559	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Is Almar
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:07,327	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Fluid solo
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:08,351	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	My all of these connected
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:09,631	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Devices
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:10,911	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Can can figure out how to
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:12,703	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Make best use
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:15,519	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Of this incredible resource
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:18,079	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Absolutely
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:20,639	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Play in both the FCC and on the government side there's
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:21,663	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	The ntia Nash
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:23,455	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Haitian
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:23,967	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Information Age
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:26,527	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	AR
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:27,551	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Looking at
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:29,855	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	These new technologies as
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:30,879	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Kind of the way you feel * of the
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:35,487	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	We're hoping that some of these technologies that DARPA's developing
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:36,255	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Will
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:37,535	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Make their job easier
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:39,071	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Basically
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:40,095	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	In the future on the policy
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:42,911	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Okay so let's just touch on one other
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:44,703	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Rub your program since I know that some of your program
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:45,727	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Program Center on
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:49,823	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Innovative ways of ensuring access in a whenever a
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:50,335	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And wherever
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:51,871	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Oppressive in use
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:53,407	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Drones
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:55,711	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Attwifi
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:56,991	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Routers
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:17:58,271	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	That sort of thing
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:18:00,063	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Program I want to talk to you back here though is
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:02,111	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Called geospatial
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:02,879	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Cloud
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:03,391	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Analytics
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:06,975	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	By doing a lot more with satellite data than it has
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:07,743	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Has been
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:09,023	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Done before
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:10,047	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Things like using database
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:11,839	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Geospatial
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:12,351	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Characteristics
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:16,703	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Crops in distress and may be using that to the dated
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:20,031	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Predict things like security relevant
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:21,055	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	What phenomena like social
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:22,847	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Unrest that's
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:24,127	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	So
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:25,407	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Talk to me about
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:26,175	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Tell me what kind of
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:28,223	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Data is available that you're hoping to
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:32,063	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Accessing new ways and then how that might be valuable
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:34,879	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Some of the Genesis of this idea really.
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:35,903	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Major General
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:37,439	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Was the
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:40,767	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Vast amount of new geospatial data that
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:43,071	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Being created from commercial source
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:45,631	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	I'm so traditionally the
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:49,471	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Satellite imagery marketplace with government
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:53,055	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Special government satellites taking
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:57,663	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Pictures for either military use or for
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:58,687	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Things like
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:18:59,711	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Agricultural products
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:00,735	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Things like that
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:02,015	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Lamps at 4 Mass
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:03,551	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Some of those
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:06,879	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	That's radically changed
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:08,927	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Beers with the
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:09,695	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Launching of
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:11,487	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	How many new
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:14,303	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Commercial satellite some are already launched summer
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:16,607	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	I'm in various ages of
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:17,375	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Deployment
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:18,143	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:21,983	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	What that's providing is much more data on a
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:22,751	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	A daily basis
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:23,519	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	One of those
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:24,799	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Ways I like that
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:25,567	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Describe this is
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:31,199	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Yeah back when darker was found it a comeback in 1958 and it was really founded in response to Sputnik
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:32,479	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Being launched
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:33,503	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:37,087	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Some level of panaca in the populist valteau
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:42,719	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Well the Soviets can see what I'm doing all the time they're flying over with the satellite and
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:44,511	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And they can see me in my backyard
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:50,911	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Well what's interesting now is we're finally getting to a point where there are enough commercial satellites up there
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:54,495	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	That they are really are going over every day
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:56,287	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And imaging everywhere
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:20:01,919	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And it's one of those things that was unexpected I think
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:02,687	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	From a
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:04,479	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Governmental side
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:10,879	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	What the impact of that could be the the vast amount of new and useful data
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:13,183	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	That might come from the commercial side
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:19,583	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	So then this is pictures yo data as they they say like it Optical is a second
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:25,983	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	In The Biz it can be other things are there are satellite constellations that are collecting RF data is
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:27,775	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	They they fly ever
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:29,055	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Other
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:31,359	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Satellite constellations that are doing radar image
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:32,383	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	As well
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:37,759	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Combine all of these are Avast new data source to understand what's happening in
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:38,271	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	In the world
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:40,831	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	It is so much data however
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:42,367	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	That people can't keep up
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:47,999	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	It is a firehose of data to an extent that never been been really seen before
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:51,327	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	People talk about Big Data this is
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:52,351	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Bigger than big
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:53,119	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Data
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:56,447	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	I'm just in terms of the amount of data that's being collected from the satellite
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:21:00,543	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	So people can't keep up I can't look at all this data
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:03,615	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	So then you have to do automated processing
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:05,407	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Machine learning types of
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:07,711	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Show the algorithm so you really have to set up the
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:09,503	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	The pipeline's of
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:10,527	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Processing
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:12,831	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	To get useful information out
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:13,855	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Out of all that data
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:15,135	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:18,720	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	What we're trying to do in the gestational Cloud analytics program
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:21,280	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Is make use of all that data to set up
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:24,352	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	The architectures to do that and then setup
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:26,656	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	CenturyLink business model so that
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:30,752	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	DOD customers can get that information rather than just the data
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:33,312	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	I'm in a in a sensible way so
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:38,688	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	The geospatial part of the GCA of the geospatial cloud analytics program
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:44,576	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Geospatial part is all the new satellite constellations all that new geospatial data
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:47,904	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	There is the cloud part which is well you need
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:49,952	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	You put it in the Computing clouds the
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:55,328	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Yeah I hear about Google cloud and Amazon web services those
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:22:01,472	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	So becomes widely accessible and then also can be processed at high speeds
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:02,496	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	In those Cloud resource
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:04,288	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	So you can
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:05,056	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Actually
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:08,640	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Crunch through all that data in the cloud
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:12,480	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	In order to produce a result at the back that then a Warfighter
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:16,832	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	We're kind of where the analytics come in
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:18,880	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	So I imagine that the ideas
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:21,952	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Reply on Linux and various kinds of models where you
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:22,976	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Triton lconnect
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:23,744	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Redis raw data
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:27,328	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	The things that are even more interesting than raw data which is
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:28,608	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	What it might mean
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:31,680	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	To the conditions of crops and how
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:33,472	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	That can lead to
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:35,264	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Food security or insecurity and then
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:39,616	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Groups of people are behaving
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:45,248	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Exactly so it's so for example one of the thrust we have is looking at Food security
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:51,648	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And understanding what is happening in particular regions of the world in terms of how the wheat crop is devel
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:53,440	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Doll thing over over the year
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:57,792	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And a circle using these new data sources that are so much
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:22:59,072	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Phresher
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:03,424	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Then it ever was before using that new fresh state-of-the comes in
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:04,960	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Daily your
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:07,008	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Maybe weekly in some cases but
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:09,312	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Much more frequently than in the past
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:11,104	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Using that
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:11,872	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	2 then
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:14,432	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Crunchbase analytics algorithms that predict
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:20,576	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	You know that this crop is going to do well this year or this crop of wheat is is going to be poor
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:21,856	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	In this part of the world
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:23,136	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And what we
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:26,464	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Seen over even the past few years is
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:30,048	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	That crop failures can lead to social instability
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:34,144	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	The Arab Spring excited as one of those examples where that was kind of the spark
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:36,192	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	That led to the Arab Spring
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:42,592	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And so if we get our a little bit of more advanced warning maybe we can improve stability
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:44,896	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Why you no identifying
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:46,944	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	That there may be a need for
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:52,576	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Going to a particular parts of the world or at least EOD can position itself so that it's not a
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:53,088	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	A surprise
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:55,648	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	So that's one of the challenge problems
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:56,672	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	What's in the geospatial and
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:24:01,280	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Another one of our problem areas we've been looking at is
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:01,792	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Illegal fishing
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:06,912	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	There's a real problem in certain parts of the world with illegal in the unlicensed
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:07,680	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Fishing
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:14,080	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And there's also nongovernmental organizations looking at this problem as well but we're using that
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:17,920	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	As a way to try to identify when
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:19,456	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Vessels Maybe
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:21,504	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Showing out the in particular
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:23,552	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Territorial Waters where their unwanted
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:30,464	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	So we're trying to use the program to explore that space and really push the low
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:32,000	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Limit of what you can get from this
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:33,792	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Geospatial commercial GSP
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:35,840	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Right now I don't
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:39,424	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Usually think of the defense department is as policing unit
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:41,728	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Fishing practices around the world so can you just
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:45,824	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Explain a little bit about how that connects to what might be a DARPA and DOD interest
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:50,688	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Sure and Enzo in the in the case of illegal fishing it is a also a good
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:52,992	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Proxy problem for General
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:59,392	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Maritime situational awareness types of a problem so you know the Navy may desire assistant
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:05,792	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Understanding of what vessels are in a particular area and kind of large-scale
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:07,584	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	I want to know where
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:08,864	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	We are all of the
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:11,680	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Traffic is in the Pacific
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:17,056	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And so these new commercial data sources are providing a way to
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:18,336	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Ring together
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:19,872	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Satellite imagery
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:21,920	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Radar satellite data
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:26,272	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Things such as a is which is one of the beacons
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:27,040	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	On
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:31,136	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Commercial vessels that say I'm here in this is who I am
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:35,232	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	There are various things like that they can poop be brought together
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:39,840	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Just to improve overall the understanding of what's Happening
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:44,192	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	In the maritime just last night I was looking at
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:46,240	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Add a website that tries to track
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:53,152	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	As many of the aircraft that are in the air at any one time and uses something much like an assist
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:54,176	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	One of those Beacon
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:25:58,272	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And here I am systems I was amazed to learn that at the moment I was looking at this
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:26:01,600	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Realtime website that they were 14000 aircraft
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:02,624	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	In the air
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:06,976	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	At at that moment so so this in some ways is a little bit related more than
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:10,816	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Kind of contact exactly Enzo in the maritime contact
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:11,840	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	What's the trick is
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:17,984	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	That if a vessel doesn't want to be seen it will turn off it say I have speak and
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:20,800	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And so then you're interested in using some of those other
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:25,408	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Data sources from the the satellite data and so forth to understand
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:31,808	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Yeah well there really is a vessel there it just turned off its Beacon right now
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:32,320	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Doesn't mean that you
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:34,624	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Exactly
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:35,648	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Okay so
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:39,232	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	We're kind of getting toward the end of our discussion here but I
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:44,352	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Because you are someone who is experienced in Academia of experience
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:47,168	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	In the government that NSF before
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:48,192	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Coming here
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:51,520	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	If you have experience in
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:52,800	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	The private sector
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:56,384	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	You're somebody else a kind of interesting view on the overall
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:58,432	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Innovation ecosystem and symbol
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:27:00,480	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Now that you're here at DARPA
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:03,808	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	I'm just wondering what you know what you are discovering about
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:06,112	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Where a place like this
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:07,904	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Fits into that overall
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:08,928	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Innovation
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:13,536	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Obviously DARPA has been on the Leading Edge of of Technology
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:14,304	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Before
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:15,072	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Decade
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:16,864	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Certainly I've been
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:22,496	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Working on and around the internet for most of my career and DARPA
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:24,544	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Was that out there first in terms of networking
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:25,824	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Tat technology
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:32,736	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	So it's both LED the way and opened the doors for four things happening in the commercial
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:33,760	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	A world
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:37,344	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	And I mentioned yeah the Spectrum sharing work well
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:38,368	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	The same time as
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:40,672	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	I was at NSF working on on that
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:45,024	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Throws another program manager over here at DARPA working on similar issues and we
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:46,816	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	They would work together
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:49,120	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	The moves that that technology forward so
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:50,912	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	It's it's always been on the Leading Edge
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:56,288	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	One of the interesting things to me coming to to DARPA has been really the opportunity
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,312	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	You understand
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:59,872	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Even more death than I thought I had
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:01,920	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	The specific needs
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:03,200	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	For the millet
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:09,600	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Been very eye-opening what you know what problems there are that need to be solved and
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:11,648	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	One of the things that's been
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:14,720	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Phone is putting together programs the kind of address those
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:16,512	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Their specific needs
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:19,328	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	It's so dark of both those are the kind of
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:25,472	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Move the technology forward but the other part that's been very interesting to me is
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:31,360	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	That doctor really I believe is the key agency in terms of military innovation
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:31,872	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	For the Warfighter
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:33,152	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	The
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:34,688	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Opportunities to
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:35,968	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Think about
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:36,480	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	The
EDL	00:28:37,248	00:28:39,296	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Kind of big problems
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:40,832	| Episode 23 Joe Spectrum |	Facing
