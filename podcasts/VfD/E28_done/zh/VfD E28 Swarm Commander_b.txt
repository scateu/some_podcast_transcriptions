Stealth Technology, the Internet, GPS in the palm of your hand, autonomous operation 
Technology is a driver of our times since its founding in 1958, in the midst of the cold war, DARPA the defence advanced research project agency has been a driver of technology.
Welcome to Voices from DARPA, a window onto the DARPA's core of program managers, their job to redefine was possible
My name is Ivan Amato. I'm  your DARPA host
On this occasion, I've invited my colleague in DARPA's public affairs group Tabatha Thompson to join me as a co-host as we speak to doctor Timothy Chung, who joined the DARPA as a program manager in 2016.
You might hear some ambient sounds like birds or sirens
That's because recording our conversation from our respective homes, as we do our part to slow the spread of Covid19, as the pandemic has abandoned our daily routines
Work continues on more than 250 programs
Each was a vision of useful technology that's out of reach at the moment, but could become within reach in the future. 
Tabatha, you've been working closely with Dr. Tim Chung to help get word out about his program
So why don't you take it from here?
Thank you, Ivan.
I have been lucky to have a front row seat to the progress on two of those programs, OFFensive Swarm-Enabled Tactics, OFFSET for short and the DARPA of Subterranean challenges or SubT challenge for short. 
For the OFFSET program, two teams have developed two different swarm systems, open architectures in physical testbeds.
The program also has what I called swarms sprinters, organizations competitively selected through contract opportunities to focus on a particular technology through sierra
About every six months,
The program hosts a field tests for the sprinters to demonstrate and further develop their solutions
The SubT challenge is a price base challenge, with teams from all over the world competing, in the systems competition with physical platforms, 
the virtual competition, or in both. 
Team score when the robots accurately identified artifacts, a first responder or a war fighter might encounter underground like a backpack, drill or a thermal manikins(人体模型)
representing a survivor.
Tim, thank you for joining us to talk about your work. 
Yeah, it's a pleasure to be here.
Thank you so much
I'd like to hear more about your programs and technologies you're working toward
But I'd like to start with your research trajectory and how you came to DARPA
You have degrees in mechanical and aerospace engineering
But where did your interest start?
And are there any significant influences that could be people or events that stand out for you? 
Yeah, well, I mean, I think I always
really appreciated and was curious about how the world works.
And from that perspective, being an engineer means that we not only need to understand how things worked, but also also wants to try to fix them
if we can, of course, and come up with new ideas.
And so I think a lot of the excitement that goes on around robotics also touched me, especially as a undergrad where I had a chance to work on the Cornell University Robotic soccer team.
And that led to whole new experiences and really understanding what it means
to make the technology real
This is granted about playing robots soccer, but it meant that people had to come together, share ideas, worked together and then create the sets of robots that were doing, 
or be something really fun with a soccer, but doing a purpose
and that really inspired me to continue that line of research. 
Could you go from that experience with robot soccer to coming to DARPA as a program manager? 
The inspiration perhaps comes all the way back when my sister was a sophmore at west points, and I just started my first year in grad school
And that's when I am eleven hit
And I knew at that point, my sister being part of that, army would soon to be called upon to action, 
and it was really hard for me to sit in this supposed Ivory tower of academia, and think that my kid sister would be fighting, you know, this war 
and ponder(仔细琢磨) a lot about whether or not to, unless myself, pondered what I could do to serve my country in that sense
And I remember my mentor at the time said, I totally understand if you want to, or need to enlist(参军), you know, go, go, do that
but remember that there is this opportunity that the work that you do here, in pursuit of your advanced degrees, can ultimately, potentially do more and serve more and have deeper impact
And I think, from that point toward, I saw that my sister went into hammers' way, but I remain in grad school, finish my degree 
continue to always have in the back of my mind that I wanted to make the world a slightly safer, better place
And I think that let me to pursue in my position, my faculty position at the Naval post-graduate school, 
which allowed me to explore mission relevance, research problems while also engaging with junior officer core, which is incredibly rewarding, 
and then also ultimately led to a research portfolio there that brought exposure to 
the institution of DARPA and from that interaction, was able to find my way ultimately to DARPA to hopefully realize some of that quest that was inspired many many years ago. 
You've given a couple of examples of how your career interacted with DARPA before you actually join the agency as a principal investigator, and also not honesty
But knowing the team that was participating in a DARPA challenge, when you are at CalTech. 
Could you talk a little bit about how those experiences, in addition to those life experience, but I think were so important to informing your work, how they influence the way you shape the programs that you run for the agency.
It takes me back to think about the DARPA grand challenge
while I was a grad student
I saw, this announcement about this audacious(大胆的) effort to take robots and driving across the desert in autonomous fashion
And I remember thinking, and I was just a junior grad student, but leaning over to my fellow student Pierre saying
wow, this is really cool, and then discovered that the CalTech would be fielding(选派..上场) a team largely comprising undergraduates
But I still remember the inspiration of that challenge offered to me and my fellow graduate students and undergraduate student, and I think that kind of nugget of inspiration was something that continued burning
I think, it continues to be there and drives us to go and do 
sometimes really audacious things, and given this opportunity to come to DAPRA 
and have the opportunity to go off and do those types of audacious things that really inspired the nature of both of my programs
I think was able to work at the Naval post-graduate school, which I would really like to be an incubator
really great ideas
We have junior officers who have a lot of fleet experience
They come to getting their gradual level education. 
They bring with them a lot of experiences that meet academic research,
And boom, you have a really great fusion of need, and state-of-the-art 
And from my perspective seeing, NPS as an incubator
I view DARPA as an accelerator of those ideas, really take those ideas and run with them a bigger, bolder, faster. 
This is a good point for us to talk a little bit more about the programs in your portfolio SubT challenge and OFFSET offensive swarm enabled tactics, 
the obvious tie between the two is this focus on the autonomy and robotics
But there are some significant differences in the outcome goes too, 
for instance, the focus on human swarm teaming in OFFSET
Could you talk through some of these common teams, and then also some of the key differentiators for these two programs?
Sure. OFFSET is a program where we seek to discover the swarm system technologies 
that will allow operates of hundreds of 250 air and ground robots operating in complex urban environments in support of small unit operations
The Subterranean challenge is all about discovering innovative approaches to map, navigate and search in complex underground environments.
I think the unifying theme and what drives me is to see robots in the real world, operating in complex environments.
I think robotics is one of those fields where you can't just only work in theory, or you can't only work in kind of Trial and error.
You kind of need to bring both of them together and see robot working in the wild.
And so I think that's something that really inspires me is obtaining that strict, not something that we, roboticst, really embrace is seeing robots work. 
Until the key emphasis for both OFFSET and SubT challenge
is putting robots in really challenging environments in a field, robotic sense and seeing what they have to do, where the gaps might still be for what they're not yet able to do.
So for OFFSET we're interested in those really complex urban environment, 
specifically those aspects of the urban mess that stress autonomy today.
And that includes everything from the fact that you might not have a line of sites, 
because the building in the way you can't move as freely, because there is a lot of obstacles or things, blocking in your lanes, 
and the fact that you have to look up and around, because you have the superstructures(上部结构) all around this, well
And so, how do you get air and ground robots working in that kind of environment?
And then on top of that, and because this is DARPA, we'd like to push the envelope. 
how do we get hundreds of robots to be able to go off and do those kind of things in a complex environment?
I think the similarity with the Subterranean challenge is the [inaudible] these underground environments are equally complex
And not only are they complex, in the sense of, hey, we don't typically spend a lot of time in underground environments
one might argue, but also the fact that the unknown underground, it makes it even dangerous for people to go in
And so this is an opportunity for again, robots, to, to shine
And so whether those are in human-made tunnel-like environment, such as mines, to urban underground to naturally occurring cave environments.
This is an opportunity for, again, robots to understand what the current limitations of autonomy and robotics are today, 
and really inspired the type of researchers as necessary to conquer those environments in the future
I think both of the programs offered the opportunities for roboticst, but also just brought the researchers, geologists, city planners, even kind of micro climate researchers, 
to speak to what impact a holistic(整体的) systems design
And when I say systems, I'm not talking just about one robot
I'm talking about all the robots working together
The team, the humans supervisor 
or the human-swarm team member, understanding how that holistically comes together to deliver the capabilities that will help save lives in the end. 
Could I get you to talk a little bit more about human-swarm teaming, and just describe what's that looks like
Yeah, I'm an autonomy researcher is, is, however, described myself. 
But in thinking about autonomy and swarm autonomy, in the sense of having large scale teams of robots makes air and ground working together
We can't leave the human out of it because how we design that autonomy is impacted by how we envison the human swarm commander, working with a technology
And so the OFFSET program intentionally focuses on those two pillars of swarm autonomy and human teaming
And in that sense, the OFFSET programs about discovering what it means when you have hundreds of robots operating in a complex environment 
and the intense of the program is to kind of understand, you know what works and what doens't work
We certainly cannot have 100 or 200 marines runing around with joysticks in conducting and urban operation
So what does it mean when we try to consolidate(巩固) a lot of that team member commander role for large-scale teams of robot, 
what, what does it mean?
Does it mean.. 
We present information in a different way?
Does it mean that they have to interact with the robots at a much higher level, 
and so the way we think about it in the OFFSET program is in the context of translating commanders intents into these machine-understandable swarm tactics
These swarm tactics give us a glimpse as to how we can potentially interact 
with these large scale teams, and ultimately boils down to understanding what the language we called the swarm interaction grammar
What is the language by which the swarm can understand
the commander is trying to get done, commander's intent, 
and conversely(相反地), the commander understanding what the swarm's actually doing. 
is it doing what I ask it to on things of a nature, so the two ways tree, and that's why we call it the human swarm teaming, it is not a human swarm control
It's really about interaction between the human and the swarm
And so we imagine also that it's not just going to be a screen with a mouse
that's gonna solve this problem of interacting with these large scale teams
You know, gesture or voice or augmented and virtual reality
Maybe these are other tools that we can now take advantage of to help inform how we interact with these large-scale teams
For the SubT challenge, it's an extended event, so it's over a couple of years
that you are working with these teams.
And you divided it up into circuits.
Could you talk a little bit about your goal for each of the circuits and how you divided the challenge? 
Well as I mention we're really interested across my DARPA program portfolio of putting robots in the real world and having them operate in complex environments.
And when we take another look at underground environments,
There are so many different types of underground environments that just to solve the problem in one of the domain wouldn't be enough. 
I really ought to understand and identify what works and what doesn't work in underground environments.
And so what we've done is for the SubT challenge we highlighted that there're underground environment like tunnels and mines
We've articulated(清楚表达) there're urban underground environments
They are natural occuring cave systems and trying to figure out what kind of robotic technologies will allow us to operate relatively adaptively across all three of those types of underground environments
So what that boils down to is, how do we capture all of that
And so one way to do that is to focus on each individuals of domain 
and we're doing that in the context of three circle domains, namely the tunnel circuit, urban circuit and upcoming, we have a cave circuit. But, as I highlighted, it's not about being the best swimmer were the best runner
It's really about being the best Triathlete(铁人三项运动员) here
And so we want to see how these individual events in form the designs, and even the concept of operations for those technologies
But it's at final event where we will be able to merge elements of all three of those sub domains into the grand finale, epic final course, 
and understand what it means to have truly adaptive technology, robotic systems that can upgrade across those sub domains. 
Tim, both of your programs really inspired the imagination to think of all of this kind of interaction with with you are human beings and with machines all trying to work together to, you know, in new ways
The SubT, though, also comes to my mind as a kind of fascinating and endeavour(努力) that it forces you to think about being underground, right in most of the time
We think about being on the surface [..] or an plains all the time
But it's rare unless you're a spelunker, caver
to really think much about being underground, or if you're, you know, a metro worker, and you are in tunnels under the city
where trains go
But I'm just wondering if your experience with SubT has changed the way you think about in some ways, being in the world because your mind is so much underground. 
Hey, yeah, well. I'll say everything takes a different lens when you put in the context of each of these tester programs and SubT is no different
I think everything from when I am, you know, I don't know about if
you know, once upon a time, many ways, you know, taking a look every time I go. 
Or I go into a tunnel while I'm driving, or anything along those lines now, kind of inspires a little bit of SubT
And I say, for anyone who watches movies quite a lot, 
there are many occasions where there're folks in underground tunnels 
or there're basements, there're empty malls in sublevels or whatever. 
so now that I watch those movies with the SubT challenge lens. 
I'm often shouting out oh that's a great idea for the SubT challenge, 
but I maybe the other more technical, serious answer here is, I think, thinking about the underground has led me to understand that the challenges are quite severe -- 
You don't have GPS, and often times something we lean on to get the job done for for a robot
Communication is horrible down there
And so it makes us think a little bit differently about what it means to want to communicate what information do I want to share
And this isn't just for robots, it turned out that this is applicable to human teams that go down there as well
so that given both a stronger, inspirational motivation to push the boundaries of those technologies, 
but it's also really driven the appreciation, not just by me but also of all the participants of the challenges that resided underground. 
Well, thanks Tim, for sharing some of your personal notes from the underground and the challenges of working in Subterranean settings
And now let me pass the baton(指挥棒) back to Tabatha. 
Thank you, Ivan. 
Tim, you talked about your experience, working with graduate students from the SubT challenge perspective
But you worked with students in an earlier challenge when you first came to DARPA for the swarm challeng, could you describe that program and what you learn from it?
I know we talk about how I found my way to DARPA earlier, but in fact, I think it was
The swarm challenge concept that really seal the deal for bringing me to DARPA
And this idea was building on the research I done previously of getting large teams of air vehicles
In this case, my prior research was on getting 50 fixed-wing aircraft, the fixed-wing airplane-like drones aloft(在空中) and doing interesting things in the sky
And we were able to leverage that body of work 
and the idea that came from it, and what we built out here at DARPA 
upon my arrival was the service academies, swarm challenge that you referenced, 
this was really fun because we wanted to capitalize on this momentum of technology development of getting large numbers of aircraft aloft 
and also create an opportunity to help frame the next generation of military officer by working with the military services academies
Namely the naval academy, air force academy and the military academy at west point 
and bring those cadets and midshipmen and work with them to understand what it means to work with these types of swarm technologies
And the phrase we like to use was, how do you go from zero to swarm in 8 months 
because that was the time, these cadets and midshipmen had in their capstone design projects in their senior year to complete this, this project
And so that was basically getting a fixed wing and quadrotor drones
I gave each team, and they get to pick their own lineup of 25 drones on the side
We set up bounty castles on the opposing sides of the field, and this is in lifelike experimentation, and so we have bounty castles and you'll score points by landing your drones in the opposing teams'
bounty castle, but you want to defend your own home, bounty castle, of course, basically a simulated laser tag in the sky
And so it was this really great understanding how do you play strong offensive, how do you play strong defense 
and have a gears turned for these cadets, who had never worked with the this type of technology before and partnering them with research engineers and lives and others to make this all happen
It was incredibly rewarding to see cardets and midshipmen who never thought that they would be part of something that bold, that forward leaning in their time at the academies, I think, 
and they walked away, recognizing that there does exists an organization within the DoD that is thinking so far in advance that they have the region to, 20, 21 year old to the start the process of tech revolution, right?
So I think that again, inspired me
I think that that experience bolden and enforged(强化) my core team of challenge believers as a model for driving tech innovation,
and that allowed us to go forward with kind of pitching the Subterranean challenge as the next bold step in driving autonomy and robotics technologies
And so let me just follow that with an institutional question, 
I mean, DARPA is a place where engineers like you
Tim can develop a technology vision
And as I see in the opening of this podcast -- redefine what is possible
But what is it about DARPA institutionally, do you think, that creates these opportunities? 
I definitely believe DARPA has a secret sauce that it has continued to, been able to generate those ideas, but also create and execute and realize those ideas
I think, on the one hand, certainly from the technical technology office, from which I hear, 
we really love seeing technologies demonstrated so systems being brought together and realized in some sort of field test demonstration, and I think that's one end. 
on the other hand
We're interested in creating whole new, foundation whole new
areas of research that hadn't really been thought about.
And I think that being able of expand that spectrum and do it in the context of, you know, one hundred or so of programming and across 300 programs is a pretty phenomenal(不寻常)
I'd say, one another way that I describe DARPA, this was, uh, one of my colleagues had previously described research this way
Is there're a lot of folks out there that might say some research is impossible
or some vision is impossible
And my colleague at the time said, actually no, it's not impossible
It's rather, it's unpossible
It's just that it hasn't been done yet
It is not that it can't been done yet
and I like to embrace that philosophy and everything that I try to touch in the sense, just because I hadn't been done before
is not proof that it can't be done.
In fact, its challenge, say, that maybe I am the one who can do it, 
and DARPA really gives us both the tools and inspiration, 
and the kind of community, as to say, that both the support, but also my, you know, program manager colleagues, when I see all the amazing things they are making possible
it makes me think that the things might have been considered impossible, or simply just opportunities. 
We're getting towards the end here, but I want to get into a couple of questions that are more about technology in general
First, I want to ask you about the kinds of technology is developing
We're talking now here, about humans and machines working together
DARPA has a long long history going back even to 1960s, thinking about that particular kind of powerful dynamic.
So I'm just wondering what excites you most about these technologies? 
As you said it is the intersection of the human, machines synbiosis(协同生物) that is in a lot of DARPA's genetic code already
So I am leveraging understanding on their shoulders for sure
I think the thing that perhaps excites me a lot about these technologies
is the idea that we'll have to look at our robotic teams in [fuck] different ways
What I mean by that is a lot of maybe a research has been done on what it means to
work with a single robot, or maybe a few robots, but we're narrowly pushing what it means to work with multiple, many robots
And I think this is a really rich area of new research to be had in the sense that the way I would interact with my small team of researchers, or at a startup company, 
or something like that is very different men, how I would want to interact a larger company or a larger project team, and that goes analogously(类似的) with team of robots
And so I think how we work with mixed, but physically mixed in terms of your air and ground, but uh mixed as in the functions that these robots will play in a composition of a team
I think the type of [...] is really gonna open up not only new capabilities, but also plane proceeds for new foundation of research to be done as well
So that's gonna be one of the, interestingly, behind, if I can say that, both of these problems, is understanding what it means to work when you have high complexity in a robot team itself, 
and that warrants high complexity, warrants new math, new communication networks, new compute methodologies, new sensing approaches or new algorithms
And I think both of these programs have started to, bear some of the fruit out and lay some of the foundations
So that's been really, really exciting. 
And that's a lot of foundation to lay down
We all know how much it takes for people to work well together
So I'm not surprised to hear about the enormity(棘手) and complexity of the task to realize the mission in which humans and machines work together almost as if they were one hybrid organism, very cool stuff. 
It is, and I think it's important to know how that work is continuing
I've been reference
at the beginning of the episode, but there is no doubt Covid19 will be an historic marker for all of our lives. 
It would be interesting to know, Tim, how it is affected your work, and perhaps the near term goals in deliverables for some of these programs you're working on. 
Yeah, no doubt Covid19 has had its impact, one of the things about DARPA is that it's all about being able to be nimble(灵活) and adaptive, 
and so I think, even in the context of OFFSET and SubT challenge, the impact really is felt in the context of, as I mentioned earlier, is about trying to get robots in the real world
And when it's difficult to go to the real world to get those lessons learned and put a robot in those context, which, which Covid19 is really limited our ability to do that, it definitely does impact the type of progres and lessons learned we can achieve
But in that same vein, both of these problems have a theme of leveraging the virtual environment to, kind of, balance in couple and accelerate the lessons that we learn in the real world
And so, in OFFSET we have two virtual environments that allow us to explore, test, simulate swarm tactics and execution
And we do that with realistic environment. In test site we will have a 3D model of a test site, and we'll replicate what it is that we're testing in a synthetic environment
And the OFFSET program was structured from getgo whether there're robot, whether they're simulated real, don't know that they're plugged in to the simulated world. 
So we really leaned to that aspect, the OFFSET programs so that we can still continue to discover new ideas and strengthen the insights that we hope or translate to
the fourth dominic field test of OFFSET program for the SubT challenge again, that virtual environment plays a huge role for SubT and since that we have the virtual competition alongside the system's competition
So whereas(然而) we might be physically putting robots in underground environments, for the system's competition
we've created that SubT simulator that allows for teams to not only practice and test, but also compete in virtual environment
And so that virtual environment has given us another opportunity, 
and in some ways of relief alf for teams, who are constrained and being able to go to the site, to go on the test, I can still do some of that development in the simulated contexts to go 
and and you know keeping the ball rolling forward, 'cause OFFSET and SubT both about keeping up the momentum of a research, just like the rest of DARPA. I'd one of the other
impacts, of course, is that community I described earlier about getting people together and facilitating the exchange of information or bouncing ideas or seeing what works
imitating it in my own research, or whatever I mean, 
each of these teams benefits from the interaction in very different, but also in profound ways fastering the sense of community, through online community forum, or being able to open up a collaborative web space for teams to share their software
deliverables are ways that were trying to live in this normal. 
Tim, thank you for your time, for your insights into your work with DARPA. 
It's been a pleasure
Thank you so much.
I will encourage everyone to spend some time exploring the SubT challenge, play list on DARPA's youtube channel, to get an idea of how teams are tackling the underground
You can see a couple of recent OFFSET field experiments on the youtube channel as well
And Ivan, it's been great joing you as the co-hosts
I look forward to seeing you back in the studio. 
Yes, and it was my pleasure too to share
this is a tag team podcast with you Tabatha, and also just to learn so much about what you're doing
Tim, It's been really, really fascinating
And thanks listeners for sharing this time with us, I hope you join us again for the next Voices from DARPA.
