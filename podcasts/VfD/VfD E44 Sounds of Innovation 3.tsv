EDL	00:00:06,260	00:00:20,158	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Going to a science or engineering laboratory, close your eyes and listen in a biomedical lab, you might be an ultra central, huge raving up as a separate to the components of assemble in a mysql proportion research facility
EDL	00:00:20,158	00:00:26,850	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	You may hear the aggressive white noise from a test burn of a new experimental jet fuel in a computer simulation center
EDL	00:00:26,850	00:00:31,800	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	You might hear the harm from a variable or*****ra of cooling events in each setting
EDL	00:00:31,800	00:00:34,130	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	You can hear a sonic finger print of what goes on there
EDL	00:00:34,670	00:00:39,500	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Welcome back to sounds of innovation, a feature of our Voices from darker parkers
EDL	00:00:39,500	00:00:44,070	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	My name is iphone motel on your dark house in each sounds of innovation feature
EDL	00:00:44,070	00:00:52,475	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	You'll hear some of the soundscapes of research and development in the moments they are happening and learn just a little bit about what new capabilities
EDL	00:00:52,475	00:01:03,940	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Those things my friends go to the doctor, program managers and their teams, as well as to the research performers working under contract for those teams, for help in harvesting the sound, you are about to hear
EDL	00:01:04,890	00:01:11,390	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	In each case, I first will play the sound without telling you what it is as you listen, try to guess where the sound comes from
EDL	00:01:11,390	00:01:13,720	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Then I will tell you, alright, here we go
EDL	00:01:14,450	00:01:17,610	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Let me give you a few hints about these first two sound clips
EDL	00:01:17,610	00:01:24,210	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	One hit is that they come from researchers working on dark as persistent a quarter, leaving sensors program, or pales
EDL	00:01:24,590	00:01:29,980	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Another hint is that you are not about to hear recordings of big fat rain drops slamming onto A. 
EDL	00:01:39,970	00:01:42,480	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Now, for the second clip, it sounds little sad. 
EDL	00:01:53,480	00:01:58,186	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	What is coming to both of those clips is the right of crackling noises
EDL	00:01:58,186	00:02:01,122	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	They derive from a real life's superpower will die
EDL	00:02:01,122	00:02:17,441	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	A common committee and widespread secretary, known as snapping shrimp, turns out that these two cinema cross stations have some specialized cloud enemy, a tightly fitting pegging cup of sorts that can do wonders when the shrimp slams the pig into the cup structure
EDL	00:02:17,441	00:02:20,662	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	It produces a tiny jet water this interim generates
EDL	00:02:20,662	00:02:43,232	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	And I am not making this up a super carbon trading under sea bubble that, in mere microseconds, developed five thousand degree temperatures in midst a flash of light, and then as ocean pressure instantly squeeze the back out of existence, what amounts to an underwater club of thunder, one thousands of the shampoo snapping it sounds like a pumpkin popcorn, a hardware
EDL	00:02:43,232	00:02:45,290	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Or, as some have described it from. 
EDL	00:02:51,450	00:03:00,180	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	The energy from these implanting bubbles can stand and even kill nearby prayer, just what the snapping trip need to see the unresilient of another day
EDL	00:03:00,180	00:03:15,640	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Just a few more specifics on those sounds, the first one you heard was picked up from a hydrophone placed by the peer at town point in north africa, beginner by team of powers, research performers from the government due university and the underwater technology from cold octopus
EDL	00:03:15,640	00:03:24,330	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	The second sound clip was captured six thousand miles away by a set of power's performers from the neighborhood warfare center, based in new port
EDL	00:03:24,330	00:03:29,495	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	In their case, the hydrophone was immersed in the whale friendly waters by her poorer hawaii
EDL	00:03:29,495	00:03:34,800	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	One working, you might be asking yourself why dark cares about all of these snapping shrimp
EDL	00:03:34,800	00:03:41,190	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Well, because it is possible to think of all those swimming snaps as millions of sooner pinks get a good enough
EDL	00:03:41,190	00:03:55,030	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Understanding, uphold those pings, bounce of objects and get good enough of gathering and analyzing those are, and you just might be able to create a global partnership with snapping shrimp to improve maritime situation
EDL	00:03:55,030	00:03:59,300	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Awareness about what is in the water, where things are in the water and what they are
EDL	00:04:00,510	00:04:11,478	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	The next audio clip comes from an engineering research firm in new hampshire, working on a critical technology of interest to program manager steve, comedian of the agency, tactical technology
EDL	00:04:11,478	00:04:25,240	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Obvious, which you need to know before you listen to is that I had to slice and splace what was originally an eighty second clip into a much shorter version that you would be willing to listen to the progression of towns provides you as a hint about your hearing
EDL	00:04:25,900	00:04:26,830	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	It's a big journey
EDL	00:04:26,830	00:04:27,730	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	So hang in there. 
EDL	00:04:47,440	00:05:04,490	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	What you heard in the clip is an experimental, compact turban generator system with the microphone, approximately six feet from the test stand, you heard it increasing from a startup speed using an electric start to a speed of over sixty thousand revolutions permitted for RPM. 
EDL	00:05:04,490	00:05:07,020	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	That's an assumption rate of
EDL	00:05:07,020	00:05:18,255	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Are you sitting down a thousand revolutions per second and its ultimate rotation speed will be over twice that novel and advanced proportion systems, including ones for unmanned vehicles
EDL	00:05:18,255	00:05:26,490	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Instrumentally are under his research menu, this potential component, a hybrid electric turbo alternator about the size of a washing machines
EDL	00:05:26,490	00:05:33,730	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Chamber, is being designed by engineers at britain, energy inhabitant, new at the fantastic rotation speeds
EDL	00:05:33,730	00:05:35,378	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	It can achieve the turbulence
EDL	00:05:35,378	00:05:50,570	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Compressive developed enough pressure to support stable and extremely efficient computation using a variety of fuels, and then can start generating access electrical power four up to thirty five kilos of power at one hundred and thirty thousand
EDL	00:05:51,290	00:05:54,409	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	The technology is intended for multiple users
EDL	00:05:54,409	00:05:56,637	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Among them grounded aerial hybrid
EDL	00:05:56,637	00:06:10,520	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Electric vehicles were man's men and unmanned a, according to the dark team interested in this research, the technology could be enabled for small to medium hybrid electric aircraft platforms, rather than developing proportion itself
EDL	00:06:10,520	00:06:19,816	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Disturbance concept efficiently converts fuel compulsions into electricity to run the vehicles, electric models, which, in turn can power fans or propellers
EDL	00:06:19,816	00:06:22,040	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	The electricity can also provide sensors
EDL	00:06:22,040	00:06:39,484	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	A terrible alternative like this can shift the design paradigm for aerospace designers by loosening restrictions on engine policemen, the ability of the device to run on various fuels further, as I will close out this sounds of innovation episode with a trio of audio clips
EDL	00:06:39,484	00:06:54,820	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	They're from the so called foundery of a boston based biotechnology research performer, with, especially in requesting bacterial cells into new and useful forms, analysis to the way a traditional foundry cats and requests metal into useful shapes. 
EDL	00:07:14,340	00:07:15,840	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Here's the second clip. 
EDL	00:07:28,310	00:07:30,040	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Now, for the final clip of the trial. 
EDL	00:07:56,650	00:08:02,048	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	That first sound, the one with a throne to it, it comes interview to the gingle buyer works
EDL	00:08:02,048	00:08:05,773	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Researchers used to concentrated bacteria cells into a deco palace
EDL	00:08:05,773	00:08:28,195	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	These cell concentrates become the focus of other experiments and measurements, such as DNA analysis for determining which genes correctly sympathized, were assembled or tests to see if an introduced gene leads to an expected activity at a top speed insurer clip, the central future reached a spinning rate about four thousand two hundred revolutions, the true break inside the central future was well balanced
EDL	00:08:28,195	00:08:35,330	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	That's why the machines thrown, rather than make a wrecker the way of washing machine does when a unbalanced load of clothes enters the state
EDL	00:08:39,210	00:08:47,463	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	The second sound you heard comes from what dingo folks referred to as an integrated workshop is a highly automated robotic workstation
EDL	00:08:47,463	00:09:03,637	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	That, in this case, is preparing thousands of tiny whales in multiple ways that are shaped a bit like naturalized cupcake baking sheets, the machinery and close the robotic arm that retrieves multiple wail place from a holding and then shuttles them to other locations at these locations
EDL	00:09:03,637	00:09:09,698	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Other automated machinery adds this through that liquid containing cells, cultural media or text chemicals
EDL	00:09:09,698	00:09:15,083	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Other actions on the workstation include ceiling and unsealing, the world and barcode labelling them
EDL	00:09:15,083	00:09:21,032	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	So a computer contract, each whales contents conditions in the procedures it has undergone or will undergo
EDL	00:09:21,032	00:09:28,004	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	This kind of automation is what makes it possible to screen thousands and even millions of samples in a reasonable amount time
EDL	00:09:28,004	00:09:33,861	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	It's called HTSor high swimming, whose health, health telephone can cause
EDL	00:09:33,861	00:09:38,700	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Head of the foundry, explains the value of such systems for his HT. 
EDL	00:09:38,700	00:09:52,020	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	So our HTSteam, rather than setting up these places by hand, use this robotic workshop to set up many hundreds of places, as you see in this, this hotel here, all track by barcode
EDL	00:09:52,630	00:09:57,490	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	And that way, they can be fed to other instrumentation to run different kind of analytical tastes
EDL	00:09:58,190	00:10:14,040	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	And so the idea, the, by doing everything robotically tracked by our custom software, were able to know exactly what is in every plate, and very well that played and then drive that logistics to run really complex work flow
EDL	00:10:14,040	00:10:16,210	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Those are other other robot cliffords. 
EDL	00:10:17,200	00:10:22,427	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	The final song clip of the ginger buyer work series comes to another robotic workstation
EDL	00:10:22,427	00:10:24,518	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	This one is preparing one other name
EDL	00:10:24,518	00:10:32,021	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Ninety six will multiple places by adding cell infused goose rural solutions into the world that have been pre loaded culture medium
EDL	00:10:32,021	00:10:41,760	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	The results in ten thousand, three hundred and sixty eight wells with specific bacterial cells growing under specific medium conditions, will undergo specific measures
EDL	00:10:42,400	00:10:47,420	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	The darby connection here is that ginger buyer works is under contract in a few of the agencies efforts
EDL	00:10:47,420	00:10:49,420	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	One is the revictual program
EDL	00:10:49,420	00:10:56,873	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Its goal is to engineer bacteria that can temporarily alter the microbial ecosystem or microbial on a war fighter skiing
EDL	00:10:56,873	00:11:02,270	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Another relevant collaboration between the company is in the programming on the SDtwo
EDL	00:11:02,270	00:11:05,180	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Let's stands for synergistic discovery and design
EDL	00:11:05,700	00:11:11,782	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	It's all about leveraging large data sets from high school, put to develop data driven models
EDL	00:11:11,782	00:11:24,230	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	These empirical approaches can accelerate scientific discovery and provide guidance for developing technology, especially for domains such as migrants, for which a full theoretical understanding is not yet in hand
EDL	00:11:24,230	00:11:26,760	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Well, that's it for this episode of sounds of innovation
EDL	00:11:27,220	00:11:33,290	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	Thanks listeners for joining, thanks also to time, short, rich for his partnership in producing this program
EDL	00:11:33,920	00:11:43,326	| VfD E44 Sounds of Innovation 3 |	For more information about the programs associated with the sounds, you justify the program managers who run those programs, as well as other breakthrough technologies
