EDL	00:00:13,980	00:00:16,800	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	GPS in the palm of your hand autonomous
EDL	00:00:16,800	00:00:20,640	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	operation technology is a driver of our
EDL	00:00:20,640	00:00:23,760	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	times since its founding in 1958 in the
EDL	00:00:23,760	00:00:25,920	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	midst of the Cold War DARPA the Defense
EDL	00:00:25,920	00:00:28,470	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Advanced Research Projects Agency has
EDL	00:00:28,470	00:00:30,260	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	been a driver of technology
EDL	00:00:30,260	00:00:34,290	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	welcome to voices from DARPA a window
EDL	00:00:34,290	00:00:36,329	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	into DARPA score of program managers
EDL	00:00:36,329	00:00:41,010	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	their job to redefine what's possible my
EDL	00:00:41,010	00:00:46,020	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	name is Tyler McQuaid since 2013 I have been a program manager in DARPA's 
EDL	00:00:46,020	00:00:48,270	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Defense Sciences Office and I'm your
EDL	00:00:48,270	00:00:50,623	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	DARPA host Ivan Amato. 

EDL	00:00:50,623	00:00:52,260	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Tyler I'd like to
EDL	00:00:52,260	00:00:54,059	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	start out with just sort of learning a
EDL	00:00:54,059	00:00:55,469	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	little bit about you as a program
EDL	00:00:55,469	00:00:56,719	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	manager so maybe you could tell us
EDL	00:00:56,719	00:00:58,949	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	something about your background and how
EDL	00:00:58,949	00:01:00,989	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	that relates to the kinds of programs
EDL	00:01:00,989	00:01:04,920	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	you've been developing and pursuing Ivan
EDL	00:01:04,920	00:01:07,920	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I'm a molecular day I love molecules I
EDL	00:01:07,920	00:01:10,920	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	have since I was in high school and even
EDL	00:01:10,920	00:01:13,860	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	beyond high school so earlier you know
EDL	00:01:13,860	00:01:16,680	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I'm gonna sort of a nova junkie the
EDL	00:01:16,680	00:01:18,960	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	cosmos billions and billions of stars
EDL	00:01:18,960	00:01:20,700	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	well I was more interested in the
EDL	00:01:20,700	00:01:23,580	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	billions and billions of molecules I've
EDL	00:01:23,580	00:01:25,920	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	always wanted to be an explorer and by
EDL	00:01:25,920	00:01:28,530	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	the time I got to the age that we're you
EDL	00:01:28,530	00:01:30,720	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	know I might explore something all the
EDL	00:01:30,720	00:01:33,299	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	charted lands had been charted and there
EDL	00:01:33,299	00:01:36,180	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	were no more Uncharted lands so I looked
EDL	00:01:36,180	00:01:38,610	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	to kind of frontiers that that you
EDL	00:01:38,610	00:01:41,430	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	couldn't see and molecules fit that a
EDL	00:01:41,430	00:01:43,530	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	little more defined in physics because
EDL	00:01:43,530	00:01:45,000	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	you can put it in a bottle a lot of
EDL	00:01:45,000	00:01:46,820	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	times especially in the area that I'm
EDL	00:01:46,820	00:01:49,740	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	very comfortable in organic synthesis
EDL	00:01:49,740	00:01:52,590	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	you can make stuff and see it and you
EDL	00:01:52,590	00:01:54,930	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	can test the properties and you can play
EDL	00:01:54,930	00:01:57,329	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	with the combination of atoms that are
EDL	00:01:57,329	00:01:59,579	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	together and really it was sort of this
EDL	00:01:59,579	00:02:01,799	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	palette that I could play with and I
EDL	00:02:01,799	00:02:04,020	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	really liked that it was exploring the
EDL	00:02:04,020	00:02:04,600	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	world
EDL	00:02:04,600	00:02:07,300	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	in a totally different way always been
EDL	00:02:07,300	00:02:09,850	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	amazed at how you know just putting
EDL	00:02:09,850	00:02:12,010	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	together atoms and certain geometries
EDL	00:02:12,010	00:02:14,170	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	certain bonding patterns can come
EDL	00:02:14,170	00:02:16,450	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	together in two materials with all kinds
EDL	00:02:16,450	00:02:18,610	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	of different properties you know skin
EDL	00:02:18,610	00:02:20,830	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	and bones yes they're easy right I mean
EDL	00:02:20,830	00:02:23,530	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	you go from having something that can
EDL	00:02:23,530	00:02:27,160	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	form life to something that explodes to
EDL	00:02:27,160	00:02:29,350	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	something that makes beautiful colors to
EDL	00:02:29,350	00:02:31,540	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	something that makes your cookies smell
EDL	00:02:31,540	00:02:33,460	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	great and tastes great you know it's all
EDL	00:02:33,460	00:02:35,650	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	chemistry you're a molecules guy yeah
EDL	00:02:35,650	00:02:37,600	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	there actually are not that many
EDL	00:02:37,600	00:02:40,150	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	molecules people fear at DARPA which is
EDL	00:02:40,150	00:02:43,590	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	interesting so as a rep of this minority
EDL	00:02:43,590	00:02:46,120	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	how are you taking that interest in in
EDL	00:02:46,120	00:02:48,280	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	the form of programs in the defense
EDL	00:02:48,280	00:02:50,110	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	sciences office one of the things that's
EDL	00:02:50,110	00:02:51,880	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	going on right now one of the zeitgeist
EDL	00:02:51,880	00:02:56,370	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	is revolutionizing science how do we do
EDL	00:02:56,370	00:02:59,950	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	science but faster better and one of the
EDL	00:02:59,950	00:03:01,300	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	things that is interesting about
EDL	00:03:01,300	00:03:03,190	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	chemistry especially when we're talking
EDL	00:03:03,190	00:03:05,530	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	about the makers the people who make
EDL	00:03:05,530	00:03:07,420	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	materials make small molecules make
EDL	00:03:07,420	00:03:11,220	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	medicines it's a really slow process I
EDL	00:03:11,220	00:03:13,660	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	really like the idea of reinventing
EDL	00:03:13,660	00:03:15,400	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	science and in chemistry there's a lot
EDL	00:03:15,400	00:03:17,019	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	of opportunity to reinvent the science
EDL	00:03:17,019	00:03:18,640	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	solo yes when you say reinventing
EDL	00:03:18,640	00:03:20,650	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	science I mean do you mean the actual
EDL	00:03:20,650	00:03:22,120	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	process that we were asking questions
EDL	00:03:22,120	00:03:23,860	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	the way we're trying to answer those
EDL	00:03:23,860	00:03:25,870	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	questions and if so can you be a little
EDL	00:03:25,870	00:03:27,640	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	more detailed about what you have a
EDL	00:03:27,640	00:03:30,280	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	month chemistry is a tough subject we
EDL	00:03:30,280	00:03:32,110	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	have lots of parameters that we don't
EDL	00:03:32,110	00:03:33,910	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	often know how we're controlling them
EDL	00:03:33,910	00:03:35,950	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	but if we did all of the chemistry in a
EDL	00:03:35,950	00:03:37,660	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	much more controlled environment where
EDL	00:03:37,660	00:03:39,340	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	the environment was being constantly
EDL	00:03:39,340	00:03:41,080	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	monitored we might come up with much
EDL	00:03:41,080	00:03:43,660	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	much more reproducible chemistry which
EDL	00:03:43,660	00:03:46,570	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	will then mean it can be transportable
EDL	00:03:46,570	00:03:48,610	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	so in other words if I have a machine
EDL	00:03:48,610	00:03:50,500	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	that's doing the chemical reaction
EDL	00:03:50,500	00:03:53,590	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	recording how it's done then that code
EDL	00:03:53,590	00:03:56,470	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	that record can be sent from one lab to
EDL	00:03:56,470	00:03:59,230	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	another so you could accelerate it in
EDL	00:03:59,230	00:04:00,640	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	the same way that the internet allowed
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:02,769	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	you to accelerate how information was
EDL	00:04:02,769	00:04:04,360	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	transportable what if you could do that
EDL	00:04:04,360	00:04:07,150	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	with with molecules Tyler this might be
EDL	00:04:07,150	00:04:09,130	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	a good time to talk a little bit about
EDL	00:04:09,130	00:04:10,870	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	say two of the programs that you're
EDL	00:04:10,870	00:04:12,519	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	working on and what I have in mind is
EDL	00:04:12,519	00:04:14,420	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	the fold effects program
EDL	00:04:14,420	00:04:16,639	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	and the makeit program so why don't we
EDL	00:04:16,639	00:04:19,430	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	start with fold effects fold effects
EDL	00:04:19,430	00:04:22,100	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	that's a program that stands for folded
EDL	00:04:22,100	00:04:25,430	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	non natural polymers with biological
EDL	00:04:25,430	00:04:28,250	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	function in the fold effects program
EDL	00:04:28,250	00:04:31,850	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	we're making polymers that mimic natural
EDL	00:04:31,850	00:04:35,590	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	polymers so that we might make
EDL	00:04:35,590	00:04:38,419	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	biotherapeutics more robust so right now
EDL	00:04:38,419	00:04:41,060	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	if you get one of the more modern drugs
EDL	00:04:41,060	00:04:43,460	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	right now a good portion of them are
EDL	00:04:43,460	00:04:46,070	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	made from proteins think something like
EDL	00:04:46,070	00:04:50,510	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	high antibodies so for example Humera or
EDL	00:04:50,510	00:04:52,850	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	insulin those are examples of protein
EDL	00:04:52,850	00:04:54,919	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	biotherapeutics the problem is they are
EDL	00:04:54,919	00:04:58,070	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	not heat stable and if something isn't
EDL	00:04:58,070	00:04:59,690	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	heat stable it's not going to end up in
EDL	00:04:59,690	00:05:02,600	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	a medics bag so our soldiers at the very
EDL	00:05:02,600	00:05:04,100	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	place where they're going to be most
EDL	00:05:04,100	00:05:07,190	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	vulnerable don't have access to the most
EDL	00:05:07,190	00:05:08,870	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	advanced medicines because many of them
EDL	00:05:08,870	00:05:11,000	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	are just fragile and so we have to
EDL	00:05:11,000	00:05:12,830	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	transport them back to an environment
EDL	00:05:12,830	00:05:15,790	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	where you have refrigerators you have
EDL	00:05:15,790	00:05:18,350	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	handling equipment that can allow you to
EDL	00:05:18,350	00:05:21,440	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	control that that environment around the
EDL	00:05:21,440	00:05:23,600	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	medicine well what if you were to make a
EDL	00:05:23,600	00:05:24,680	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	non-natural
EDL	00:05:24,680	00:05:26,930	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	there are lots of natural fibers that we
EDL	00:05:26,930	00:05:28,940	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	used to use and we've replaced them with
EDL	00:05:28,940	00:05:30,860	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	non natural fibers because they're more
EDL	00:05:30,860	00:05:32,990	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	robust do you mean like silk to nylon
EDL	00:05:32,990	00:05:34,190	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	yeah exactly
EDL	00:05:34,190	00:05:36,140	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	so what if you were to take those same
EDL	00:05:36,140	00:05:37,610	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	sort of beneficial properties that you
EDL	00:05:37,610	00:05:39,080	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	get from plastics and you were merge
EDL	00:05:39,080	00:05:40,700	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	them with the beneficial properties of
EDL	00:05:40,700	00:05:42,530	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	the biological polymers like proteins
EDL	00:05:42,530	00:05:45,620	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	and DNA and so that's the fold effects
EDL	00:05:45,620	00:05:47,419	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	program but it's a platform it's about
EDL	00:05:47,419	00:05:49,250	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	how we make those and then how we
EDL	00:05:49,250	00:05:51,620	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	discover them so in a way if you think
EDL	00:05:51,620	00:05:54,919	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	about all of the possible molecules that
EDL	00:05:54,919	00:05:56,900	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	one could make the small ones you know
EDL	00:05:56,900	00:05:59,150	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	like like an aspirin or the larger ones
EDL	00:05:59,150	00:06:01,070	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	like these protein based medicines
EDL	00:06:01,070	00:06:02,930	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	you're talking about there really is
EDL	00:06:02,930	00:06:04,669	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	sort of an infinitude of possibilities
EDL	00:06:04,669	00:06:06,350	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	like an infinite space that you could
EDL	00:06:06,350	00:06:08,810	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	possibly search and explore what you're
EDL	00:06:08,810	00:06:10,039	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	saying here is you're trying to develop
EDL	00:06:10,039	00:06:12,770	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	some tools that will enable even just a
EDL	00:06:12,770	00:06:15,710	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	few people to go explore some of the
EDL	00:06:15,710	00:06:17,510	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	regions of this infinite space that just
EDL	00:06:17,510	00:06:19,250	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	have not been looked at before am I
EDL	00:06:19,250	00:06:21,500	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	getting my on track oh you're so on
EDL	00:06:21,500	00:06:23,479	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	track it gets back to my whole desire to
EDL	00:06:23,479	00:06:25,070	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	explore that I talked about you know
EDL	00:06:25,070	00:06:26,760	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	from my childhood it
EDL	00:06:26,760	00:06:29,280	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	is really about giving researchers a
EDL	00:06:29,280	00:06:32,010	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	capability to be able to explore these
EDL	00:06:32,010	00:06:33,960	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	these universes it's almost like a
EDL	00:06:33,960	00:06:36,210	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Hubble telescope for this particular
EDL	00:06:36,210	00:06:40,710	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	galaxy or universe of molecular space so
EDL	00:06:40,710	00:06:43,200	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	that was fold effects yeah I'm also
EDL	00:06:43,200	00:06:44,820	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	interested in the maked program can you
EDL	00:06:44,820	00:06:46,110	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	say a little bit about what you're doing
EDL	00:06:46,110	00:06:48,240	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	there Make-It is a platform technology
EDL	00:06:48,240	00:06:51,630	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	for making small molecules and in this
EDL	00:06:51,630	00:06:53,250	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	particular case what we're trying to do
EDL	00:06:53,250	00:06:56,190	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	is we're trying to democratize chemistry
EDL	00:06:56,190	00:06:59,520	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	so what if you could have a system that
EDL	00:06:59,520	00:07:01,860	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	a biologist or any scientist came up and
EDL	00:07:01,860	00:07:04,320	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	typed in the target and the Machine
EDL	00:07:04,320	00:07:06,660	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	figured out how to Make-It even if there
EDL	00:07:06,660	00:07:09,210	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	was no recipe available so that the
EDL	00:07:09,210	00:07:11,550	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	machine would figure out a possible set
EDL	00:07:11,550	00:07:14,790	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	of ways to make something and then would
EDL	00:07:14,790	00:07:16,650	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	go about testing each one of those ways
EDL	00:07:16,650	00:07:18,930	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	until it found a solution then it would
EDL	00:07:18,930	00:07:21,660	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	log that solution in a cloud or in its
EDL	00:07:21,660	00:07:22,740	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	databank
EDL	00:07:22,740	00:07:25,020	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	and now that molecule could be made any
EDL	00:07:25,020	00:07:27,780	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	time and in addition the system would
EDL	00:07:27,780	00:07:29,310	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	also figure out how to make more of it
EDL	00:07:29,310	00:07:31,560	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	so that if initially it would do really
EDL	00:07:31,560	00:07:33,390	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	small-scale synthesis that means
EDL	00:07:33,390	00:07:35,550	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	milligrams and then once it figured out
EDL	00:07:35,550	00:07:36,690	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	a solution it would then also
EDL	00:07:36,690	00:07:39,870	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	automatically scale it up can you offer
EDL	00:07:39,870	00:07:42,510	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	to us a concrete example maybe you could
EDL	00:07:42,510	00:07:45,180	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	think of a problem or a particular
EDL	00:07:45,180	00:07:47,250	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	receptor for example in a cell that you
EDL	00:07:47,250	00:07:49,950	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	might want as a target and then explain
EDL	00:07:49,950	00:07:53,900	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	how the Make-It framework would go about
EDL	00:07:53,900	00:07:56,640	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	interacting with that receptor and
EDL	00:07:56,640	00:07:58,110	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	perhaps solving a medical or other
EDL	00:07:58,110	00:08:01,620	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	biological problem yeah you know for
EDL	00:08:01,620	00:08:04,920	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	example one very popular target for the
EDL	00:08:04,920	00:08:08,190	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	heart disease areas pcsk9 and so there's
EDL	00:08:08,190	00:08:10,800	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	probably many papers that come out every
EDL	00:08:10,800	00:08:14,100	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	year that describe inhibitors that have
EDL	00:08:14,100	00:08:16,830	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	been discovered against that target the
EDL	00:08:16,830	00:08:19,200	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	structures are available let's say that
EDL	00:08:19,200	00:08:20,940	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I'm a researcher and I want to study
EDL	00:08:20,940	00:08:23,730	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	some aspect of a complex cellular system
EDL	00:08:23,730	00:08:27,270	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	and having access to the pcsk9 inhibitor
EDL	00:08:27,270	00:08:29,910	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	would be really useful but maybe I want
EDL	00:08:29,910	00:08:31,890	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	one that's selective in a certain way
EDL	00:08:31,890	00:08:33,780	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	that isn't commercially available but
EDL	00:08:33,780	00:08:36,990	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	somebody's reported it now I might
EDL	00:08:36,990	00:08:39,240	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	contact that researcher who's made it
EDL	00:08:39,240	00:08:41,039	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	before and maybe they ran out and it's
EDL	00:08:41,039	00:08:42,539	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	gonna take them three months to Make-It
EDL	00:08:42,539	00:08:45,150	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	but if I have access to a makeit device
EDL	00:08:45,150	00:08:48,120	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I can just go type in the structure and
EDL	00:08:48,120	00:08:51,510	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	have the material maybe the next day or
EDL	00:08:51,510	00:08:53,550	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	at the end of the week and in addition
EDL	00:08:53,550	00:08:55,380	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	to that I have it memorized
EDL	00:08:55,380	00:08:57,840	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	the machine has kept that in his memory
EDL	00:08:57,840	00:09:00,330	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	bank so if someone else in my universe
EDL	00:09:00,330	00:09:02,130	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	the environment for example wants to
EDL	00:09:02,130	00:09:04,140	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	make that they type it in and it'll be
EDL	00:09:04,140	00:09:06,420	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	out that day because the solution will
EDL	00:09:06,420	00:09:09,350	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	already be there it's a way of saying
EDL	00:09:09,350	00:09:12,900	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	chemistry has been documented since its
EDL	00:09:12,900	00:09:14,580	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	inception especially synthetic synthetic
EDL	00:09:14,580	00:09:17,180	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	chemistry through what are called
EDL	00:09:17,180	00:09:19,980	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	experimentals these are documents that
EDL	00:09:19,980	00:09:22,770	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	the researcher is using to try to
EDL	00:09:22,770	00:09:24,390	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	capture what they did in the laboratory
EDL	00:09:24,390	00:09:25,590	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	to make something they're writing it
EDL	00:09:25,590	00:09:27,960	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	down like a recipe so a lot of times
EDL	00:09:27,960	00:09:31,020	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	we'll leave out details that we think
EDL	00:09:31,020	00:09:34,320	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	are not necessary but are necessary and
EDL	00:09:34,320	00:09:36,120	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	sometimes we didn't even know they were
EDL	00:09:36,120	00:09:37,890	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	necessary so when another researcher
EDL	00:09:37,890	00:09:40,020	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	comes in and tries to read that cookbook
EDL	00:09:40,020	00:09:42,150	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	like experimental it might take them
EDL	00:09:42,150	00:09:44,340	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	months to reproduce it and they may
EDL	00:09:44,340	00:09:48,240	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	never why should we waste our human
EDL	00:09:48,240	00:09:50,880	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	effort by not making sure that we
EDL	00:09:50,880	00:09:53,430	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	document that outcome that experiment in
EDL	00:09:53,430	00:09:56,400	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	a way that can guarantee reproduction so
EDL	00:09:56,400	00:09:58,020	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	you're talking about capturing
EDL	00:09:58,020	00:10:01,440	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	procedural knowledge correct yes the
EDL	00:10:01,440	00:10:04,050	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	maked system is not just an artificial
EDL	00:10:04,050	00:10:07,230	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	intelligence system or a cloud system
EDL	00:10:07,230	00:10:10,200	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	that's archiving it's a machine that's
EDL	00:10:10,200	00:10:12,900	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	doing the chemistry so that the machine
EDL	00:10:12,900	00:10:15,390	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	will be reproducible you'll be able to
EDL	00:10:15,390	00:10:17,220	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	recreate that machine in any lab you
EDL	00:10:17,220	00:10:18,930	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	want as long as you replicate that
EDL	00:10:18,930	00:10:21,960	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	machine faithfully and it runs the
EDL	00:10:21,960	00:10:24,120	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	routines that you've recorded in one lab
EDL	00:10:24,120	00:10:26,970	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	versus another faithfully you're gonna
EDL	00:10:26,970	00:10:30,630	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	reproduce chemistry everywhere you want
EDL	00:10:30,630	00:10:32,490	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	to one of the things that I find
EDL	00:10:32,490	00:10:35,220	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	fascinating about DARPA is that it is
EDL	00:10:35,220	00:10:38,040	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	perhaps unique in its place in the
EDL	00:10:38,040	00:10:41,010	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	overall technology development ecosystem
EDL	00:10:41,010	00:10:44,070	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	and as a program manager and someone
EDL	00:10:44,070	00:10:46,650	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	who's been in academia and I think also
EDL	00:10:46,650	00:10:47,400	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	an industry
EDL	00:10:47,400	00:10:50,580	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	and now here at DARPA can you talk to us
EDL	00:10:50,580	00:10:53,550	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	a little bit about how DARPA might be
EDL	00:10:53,550	00:10:55,770	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	playing some interesting or perhaps even
EDL	00:10:55,770	00:10:57,750	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	unique roles in the overall technology
EDL	00:10:57,750	00:11:00,750	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	ecosystem yeah I think it's a very
EDL	00:11:00,750	00:11:05,310	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	exciting role DARPA is that one place
EDL	00:11:05,310	00:11:08,960	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	where we are thinking about innovation
EDL	00:11:08,960	00:11:12,870	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	unconstrained like where can we go now
EDL	00:11:12,870	00:11:15,180	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	in my mind the way the reason why we're
EDL	00:11:15,180	00:11:16,650	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	doing that is because it fits our
EDL	00:11:16,650	00:11:19,020	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	mission space if you want to create or
EDL	00:11:19,020	00:11:20,850	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	prevent surprise it's best to get to
EDL	00:11:20,850	00:11:24,360	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	that new universe of chemistry sooner
EDL	00:11:24,360	00:11:27,530	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	rather than later and so we take
EDL	00:11:27,530	00:11:29,460	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	innovations from all of the other
EDL	00:11:29,460	00:11:31,320	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	funding agencies in other words they're
EDL	00:11:31,320	00:11:33,690	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	seeding it and we look for when a wave
EDL	00:11:33,690	00:11:36,210	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	is beginning and we push it hard and let
EDL	00:11:36,210	00:11:40,800	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	it crust fast DARPA is critical because
EDL	00:11:40,800	00:11:45,060	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	we are are structuring what I consider
EDL	00:11:45,060	00:11:48,060	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	to be that crescendo investment as we
EDL	00:11:48,060	00:11:50,220	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	are trending towards something amazing
EDL	00:11:50,220	00:11:52,770	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	and you know the Internet is an example
EDL	00:11:52,770	00:11:55,680	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	and I'm really emulating that with maked

* IoM, 3D printing

EDL	00:11:55,680	00:11:57,660	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I want to create the Internet of
EDL	00:11:57,660	00:12:01,050	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Molecules how do you transfer molecules
EDL	00:12:01,050	00:12:03,240	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	from one place to another in the same
EDL	00:12:03,240	00:12:06,060	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	way as a 3d printing concept you have a
EDL	00:12:06,060	00:12:08,070	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	design you could put that design in the
EDL	00:12:08,070	00:12:10,050	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	cloud and then if you have a 3d printer
EDL	00:12:10,050	00:12:11,700	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	you could transfer that design from one
EDL	00:12:11,700	00:12:14,850	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	place to another so they're related and
EDL	00:12:14,850	00:12:17,640	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I'm you know constantly inspired by what
EDL	00:12:17,640	00:12:19,824	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	DARPA has done previously 

EDL	00:12:19,824	00:12:28,754	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	is there a question Tyler that you wished I had asked you during this discussion that I didn't and if so asked the question yourself and answereth 

EDL	00:12:28,754	00:12:32,318	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	what's my favorite aspect of chemistry? 
EDL	00:12:32,318	00:12:38,768	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	the answer for most chemists what's the answer for most chemists chemists Ivan do you know? 

EDL	00:12:38,768	00:12:42,000	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I love that that structure of a molecule relates to
EDL	00:12:42,000	00:12:45,630	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	its function I love that one yeah most of my friends maybe there's sort of
EDL	00:12:45,630	00:12:49,849	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Cro-Magnons(克罗马侬人) I guess everybody likes to explosions 

克罗马侬人 (Cro-Magnon Man)
克罗马侬人是智人中的一支，生存于旧石器时代晚期。原来是指发现于法国西南部克罗马侬石窟里的一系列化石，现在的则包含迁入欧洲以前的早期智慧人种在内。 1868年3月，地质学家路易·拉尔泰在法国多尔多涅省埃齐耶的克罗马侬石窟里发现了5具骨骼遗骸。其中的模式标本是一颗颅骨，被命名为“克罗马侬1号”。

EDL	00:12:49,849	00:12:53,399	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	but I actually like the smell of organic chemistry so 
EDL	00:12:53,399	00:12:58,590	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	pretty much almost all esters like you know when people go into like 31 flavors they're
EDL	00:12:58,590	00:13:01,074	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	thinking of maybe you know mint chocolate chip 
EDL	00:13:01,074	00:13:03,280	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I'm actually smelling all of the esters and
EDL	00:13:03,280	00:13:04,003	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	wondering hmm 
EDL	00:13:04,003	00:13:06,194	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I wonder if that's this ester or that sq 

EDL	00:13:06,194	00:13:11,950	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	and Tyler for those who don't know so an ester actually refers to a particular chemical motif if
EDL	00:13:11,950	00:13:13,750	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I recall from my own organic chemistry
EDL	00:13:13,750	00:13:15,460	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	part of it there's a carbon with a
EDL	00:13:15,460	00:13:17,830	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	oxygen double bonded a few other things
EDL	00:13:17,830	00:13:19,240	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	we don't know have to go into the
EDL	00:13:19,240	00:13:21,190	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	details except to say that it is a
EDL	00:13:21,190	00:13:23,560	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	particular kind of molecular motif that
EDL	00:13:23,560	00:13:25,360	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	can have variations yeah classic
EDL	00:13:25,360	00:13:27,910	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	compound so I I really like the classic
EDL	00:13:27,910	00:13:30,010	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	compounds that are associated with
EDL	00:13:30,010	00:13:32,770	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	flavorings and I don't mean just non
EDL	00:13:32,770	00:13:34,720	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	natural flavorings I mean natural and
EDL	00:13:34,720	00:13:38,170	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	not natural like a coconut it smells the
EDL	00:13:38,170	00:13:40,630	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	way it does because of chemistry and

Title: Office Deputy Director
Company: Defense Sciences Office

BIO

Dr. D. Tyler McQuade became deputy director of DARPA’s Defense Sciences Office (DSO) in January 2017. For more than three years prior to that appointment, Dr. McQuade was a DARPA program manager leading a number of programs in the molecular sciences including ACDC, Battlefield Medicine, Biofuels, Fold Fx, LoCo, and Make-It. While each of these programs has molecular features, most also nurture his interests in biology, complexity, applications of AI to the physical sciences, and metrology. Dr. McQuade has also developed small-scale efforts in materials and data sciences.

Prior to joining DARPA in August 2013, Dr. McQuade was a professor of chemistry. During his 15-year academic career, he published more than 80 manuscripts, patents and book chapters on topics ranging from catalysis to macromolecules to pharmaceutical agent synthesis. In collaboration with professors from Virginia Commonwealth University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dr. McQuade started the Medicines for All Initiative, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which reduced production costs of a variety of anti-viral compounds including the AIDS medicine nevirapine. Dr. McQuade received numerous awards during his academic career including the Beckman Young Investigator and MIT Technology Review Innovators Under 35. In addition, Dr. McQuade was a visiting group leader at the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces and a visiting professor in the Food and Nutrition Toxicology Department at the ETH-Zurich.

Dr. McQuade received a doctorate degree in chemistry from the University of Wisconsin and a Bachelor of Science in chemistry and Bachelor of Science in biology from the University of California, Irvine. He was a National Institutes of Health Post-Doctoral Fellow at MIT prior to starting his independent research career.
