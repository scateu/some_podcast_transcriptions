EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:27,552	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And you can tell also that is driven by a very DARPA s vision
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:29,344	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Of computers and human beings
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:30,112	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Working together

EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:37,280	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Can do on it
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:39,072	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	It's own so thanks wait for

EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:45,472	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	It would start out by talking about you wait a little bit about you
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:46,752	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Background
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:48,544	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	How you ended up
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:51,104	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Sure
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:53,408	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	So in a DARPA has his long
EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:54,688	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	String of research
EDL	00:01:54,688	00:01:56,224	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	In communicating with
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:01:58,272	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Computers in various forms
EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:03,648	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	I've been involved in a number of those programs over many years
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:07,232	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	From from days of being a graduate student through
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:08,768	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Answer my time at Lincoln
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:14,400	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And and what sort of natural progression I was working on a program as a
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:15,424	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	As a pi and then
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:19,008	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	You know I do the program manager really well and
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:20,288	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And you said hey you know you should
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:21,568	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Should think about coming to DARPA
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:24,128	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	This is an opportunity to do things that
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:25,920	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	You can't possibly do
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:26,688	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	In the job that you
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:27,200	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Currently at
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:31,040	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Before we dive into some of the DARPA programs you oversee
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:37,952	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	I'm hoping you can let us in on some of the overarching ideas you have about human Minds
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:38,976	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Computerminds
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:39,488	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The language
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:45,120	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Press in the context of these times of our time when so much of what we
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:46,144	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Do involves
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:47,424	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Interactive
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:50,752	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	You know the sort of the history of this is that
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:54,080	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	ARROW computers were good at various
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:59,200	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Kinds of things that humans weren't good at like doing mathematical calculations without errors
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:00,992	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Sina repeatedly and very quickly
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:04,576	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	But the fact is that we didn't quite know how to harness that
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:05,088	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Solve
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:07,648	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Problems that we really cared about so any
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:08,928	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Serious problem
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:10,976	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Like decision-making of any kind
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:14,304	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Global scale policy anything that you might think of
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:15,840	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Yunnan requiring humidex
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:16,608	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Batista do
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:19,424	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Yeah that wasn't something that we would engage
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:23,008	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Computers in right it's just now that we're thinking about having computers drive car
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:24,544	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Right
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:26,848	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And that's a very basic function that
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:28,384	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	We Trust
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:29,664	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Large portions of our popular
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:30,944	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Yuan to do
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:33,248	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And comes naturally to human beings with c
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:33,760	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Some practice
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:37,856	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	But computers are just getting to the point where they can sense the world
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:41,696	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Well enough that they can do that and they can make decisions that are
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:44,256	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Are commensurate with what human beings can do
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:46,304	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	On this very basic tasks
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:52,448	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And a number of us want computers to be smarter because we want them to be companions I can help
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:53,216	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Must do things right
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:55,008	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	You know we want them to
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:57,056	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Help us solve problems that are really really hard
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:04:00,384	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	How to make decisions that are much more complicated than
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:01,152	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Just driving a car for
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:02,944	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Right so let me just
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:04,480	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Stop Yuan on this idea
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:05,248	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Computer is making
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:05,760	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Decisions because
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:07,808	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	You know for the life of me I
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:08,576	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	I cannot really
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:11,904	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Always parse out how I make my own decisions
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:12,928	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	I presume that I'm
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:13,696	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Bringing in
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:17,791	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Different kinds of data different elements and then there's some kind of algorithm going out of my own head
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:19,327	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	By which I
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:23,679	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	I make a decision about where I'm going to go today or if I'm going to buy this item versus
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:24,191	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	That item
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:27,263	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	So can you talk to me a little bit about
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:29,055	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	What does it take to
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:33,663	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Put that mystery you know into a working in a working way into a computer
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:34,431	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The mystery of decision
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:36,735	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	It isn't necessarily the case that we wanted mimic
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:38,527	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Anyway
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:40,063	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Human beings aren't always
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:41,343	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Great at making decisions
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:47,487	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Yeah you know about the study of of children and whether or not they'll take a Snickers bar now versus
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:52,607	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Universes waiting for 30 minutes and then getting five Snickers bars and you know they always choose the
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:54,143	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Is the satisfaction now
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:05:01,055	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And so we have all sorts of biases in her own decision-making that makes us make decisions that are suboptimal for our own
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:01,567	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Outcomes
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:02,847	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Right
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:08,735	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And this happens at huge scales and happens when we make political decisions that happen to a make economic decisions
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,015	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And so on and so forth
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:14,879	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And what you hope for is the ability to make
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:17,183	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Better decisions given an outcome goal
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:17,951	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	What you have
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:22,559	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Iena based on better data and better understanding of
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:24,607	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The process is under the hood
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:25,631	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And that's why I think computers
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:29,471	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	All right well I for one would personally like to be in a position where
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:33,311	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Where I can make better decisions on my own personal life if we can do that also on
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:35,615	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	National and geopolitical scales
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:38,175	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	All the better so all the power to you wait I hope
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:42,271	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Going to do now is just
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:44,575	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Talk to you little bit about your portfolio of
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:50,975	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Program start with the memex program and tell us a little bit about what that is about and
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:52,767	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	What its status is now it's been used
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:56,095	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Yes at the premise behind the next program is
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:56,863	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	This is really very simple
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:59,935	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	It's the Thursday de out there on the internet
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:04,543	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	That we can't quite get a hold of or make sense of for investing
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:07,359	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	So are our
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:09,151	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Our program concept was
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:10,431	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	How do we
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:13,247	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Help people who are doing investigations online and
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:16,831	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And we started with human trafficking because human trafficking is something to wear
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:19,391	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The point of sale is almost always online at least
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:20,159	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	For sex trafficking
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:23,743	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	We started with that particular domain
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:25,279	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Because we we noticed that
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:26,303	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The date is online
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:28,607	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	You know people
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:29,887	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Buy and sell
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:35,263	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Human beings online in ways that are grotesque and and overt at the same time
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:42,431	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And yet because of the volume of the date of the South there because it's it's hiding in a huge sea
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:43,711	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Even more data
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:46,783	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	It's actually really hard for investigators to
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:48,063	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Explorer
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:50,623	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Effectively and it's not just the data that's in the kind of
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,927	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Most of us think of is the normal web
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:53,695	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Which is index by
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:55,231	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Binaural search engines baidu
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:59,071	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Another places that's right it's in places like the Deep Web and the dark web
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:03,935	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Places that commercial search indexes don't spend a lot of time dealing with
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:05,983	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And you know our only
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:09,823	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Real view into that data is through commercial circuit
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:13,663	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	We rely on them to index and make available to
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:14,431	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Search
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:15,967	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The content that's online
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:17,503	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And if it's not index
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:19,295	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Or available through Google
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:20,575	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Is very likely you're never going to see it
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:24,927	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And so portions of the darkweb where a lot of crime happens
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:30,559	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Portions of the Deep Web where lots of ads for Saxon for prostitution exist
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:33,375	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	A lot of that isn't fully indexed by our commercial
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:33,887	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Search engines
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:37,727	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And so the premise of the program was collect the right data
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:42,079	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And then automatically organize that data in such a way that we can
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:45,663	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Explore that data and most importantly generate leads into
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:47,967	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Detect instances of
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:48,735	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	About activity
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:53,855	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And so we have been working for the last almost three years now
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:08:00,255	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	To build a system that would help investigators one chase down leads that they have but to also identify
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:01,023	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Delete automatically
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:03,839	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Potentially
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:06,399	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Potentially ads that are associated
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:08,703	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	It was trafficking so that they can prioritize R&B
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,215	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Instigations
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:15,615	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And so the concept here is sort of back to this team of human machine interaction the concept here is
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:18,943	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	How do you help the investigator get to the data that
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:20,479	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Salient for their particular
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:22,271	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Investigation
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:25,599	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And then how do you help them analyze data that they can't possibly NY
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,111	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Lights on their own
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:29,439	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	You know one of the key findings in that program was that
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:35,583	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Pricing behaviors of organizations that are involved in trafficking look different than
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:37,375	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Pricing behaviors of
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:39,167	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	If you don't normal
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,959	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Independent contractor process
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:47,103	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And you can detect those time you can detect those patterns but you can't see that by reading an individual add online
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:50,431	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	You have to look collectively at a whole bunch of ads
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:54,271	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Author by the same person sometimes tens of thousands of them
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:58,623	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	In order to understand the statistical pattern of how they price
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:02,207	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Right do they price risky behaviors differently
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:04,255	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Then the average in that Marketplace
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:06,303	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	That's the kind of question that's
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:11,167	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Very very hard for an individual to answer without analytics that help them do that in Alice
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:15,519	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And so and Wade have has this tool memex
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:19,871	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Letter I guess the kind of deliverable that I imagine we all want which is sort of taking down
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:21,919	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Sex trafficking Rings or other criminal activity
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:23,199	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Yasso
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:27,551	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	You know since the beginning of this program we have been engaged with
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:33,695	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Law enforcement agencies across the country and really across the world we have users in the UK and Canada and Australia
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:36,511	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And other places not just the United States
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:37,791	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Who are
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:39,327	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Everyday working with these
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:43,679	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Tools to arrest people at this point we have hundreds of arrests that have been
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:45,471	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Credited to the use of the memex tool
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:48,287	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And a number of different convictions
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:49,055	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	That have happened out of that
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:56,223	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Well that sounds like at least a slightly improved world so that's great news what's a Segway
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:10:00,063	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	To another one of your programs the data-driven discovery of
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:06,975	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Models program so Wade what are you what are you trying to do with this sand and what's the status of this program
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:08,511	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Thought in this program is that
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:12,863	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	You know when we want to construct an empirical model of how the world works
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:15,935	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	We use data to do that nowadays are stated everywhere
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:17,471	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And so the
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:20,799	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Omak for us to construct models of how the world works
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:21,311	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Isn't the
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:26,943	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	You know isn't any longer the collection of the data itself necessarily but the actual
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:27,967	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Process of
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:31,551	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Constructing a model that process is something that's relegated to
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:34,111	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	People who are typically called data scientist
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:34,879	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Machine learning
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:36,927	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Are statisticians right
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:38,719	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	People with that kind of title
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,487	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Associated with them
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:43,839	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And though that the effort involved in constructing those models is
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:44,863	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Huge right it's
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:47,679	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Hundreds if not thousands of man years of effort
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:51,007	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Largely because the data is messy largely because
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:54,335	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	How they model that data statistically requires lots of x
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:55,615	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Expertise in the areas
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:56,383	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The statistics of
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:56,895	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Machine learning
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:59,711	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And so what we've basically said is hey let's
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:03,295	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Take that out of the hands of those kinds of experts in automated
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:08,415	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	But also I want to
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:10,463	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Listen to have a little bit more of a concrete set
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,999	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Have you been talkin and serve in general terms about
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,791	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Yo models
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:14,559	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And and
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:15,327	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	System
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:17,375	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	What might be some of the specific
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:18,143	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Say phenomena
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:18,655	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	What you're talking about
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:21,215	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Model development
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:24,799	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Just to give you a couple of problems that are concrete
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:25,823	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The people have been thinking about
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:30,943	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	One is you know how would you given different kinds of
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:32,223	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Genotypes
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:34,271	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Various forms of
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:35,039	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Wheat
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,831	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	How would you predict the yield
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:38,111	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Of those varieties
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:39,391	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Sweet in their different environment
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:46,815	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	That requires a model and if you could do that you could know what to plant any given year depending on what you
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:48,607	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Respect for the weather in
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:50,399	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The amount of rain
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:55,519	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And the particular soil location you could make decisions that were much smarter than we make
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:56,287	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Ignou
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:58,591	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And so one of the problems that were working on
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:01,407	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Is a question of how do we how do we
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:02,175	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Predict crappie
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:04,223	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Based on data
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:09,599	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And that data can come from genotype data can come from environmental observations of sensors
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:10,367	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	He liked
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:11,647	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Taking pictures of crop fields
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:14,975	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	I'm making come from you know your Farmers Almanac
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:15,487	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The tells you
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:18,047	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	3 months from now what the weather is likely to be
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:23,679	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	So those kinds of data can build a predictive model of What kinds
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:25,471	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Crop yields you can generate
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:27,519	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And if you can do that you can you know
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:29,055	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Highly affect the outcomes of Accra
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:31,871	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	That's just one concrete example
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:33,151	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	We probably can also link
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:34,175	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	This to
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:35,199	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Big mission of DARPA
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:38,271	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	In enhancing National Security when we
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:39,295	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Even when we're talkin about
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:41,599	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Food that relates to things like Foods
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:43,135	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Security so we can
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:44,671	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Really keep our Foods
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:45,695	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Supply
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:46,463	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Constantine
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:47,999	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	At the levels we need that
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:49,791	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Does that's right
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:53,887	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	That's right it did helps us to predict political instability
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:55,423	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Different states and countries that we care about
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:58,751	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	So those kinds of models
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:02,335	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Are are always important socio-political models are important
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:04,127	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Can you predict whether a riot is
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:04,639	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Going to work her
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:10,271	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Can you predict that unrest political unrest of a certain type is going to result
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:13,599	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	10 days from now in some kind of bad event
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:16,415	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Those are the kinds of things that you'd like to build models over
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:19,743	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	What is the challenge that I'm getting a kind of
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:21,023	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Computer with access
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:21,791	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	All kinds of data
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:23,839	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Generators
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:26,655	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Models I don't know where the human mind comes into this
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,935	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	But to generate those models
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:29,471	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	From the data and imperfect
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:34,847	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	So they're sort of two real problems that we have to contend with
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:36,383	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	So first of all we have
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:38,431	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Too much data have too many different kind
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:44,063	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And so the problem with that is that we don't know which combinations of the data are likely to
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:45,343	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Explain a particular outcome
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:46,623	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	We care about so if we
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:47,903	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Care about crop yields
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:51,743	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	We need to know the temperatures of veto of
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:55,839	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Days prior to a particular event or associated with crop yield outcomes 10 days later
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:58,143	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Right that's the kind of thing that
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:00,703	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	You don't require some subject matter expertise
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:02,239	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	In agriculture to be able to know
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:04,031	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Computers don't know that
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:05,311	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Symbiosis
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:06,335	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	That's right
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:07,103	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	That's right
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:09,919	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	So what computers can do is calculated
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:11,199	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Statistics bacon
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:13,247	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Estimate how well correlated
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:15,039	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Particular variable is worth
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:16,575	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Particular kind of data is
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:18,111	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Torpedo outcome we care about
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:19,647	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And so
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:23,231	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Computers can discover patterns that human beings have a hard time
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:26,303	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Figuring out on their own
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:29,887	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	But human beings are also very good at figuring out
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:31,423	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	That some of these patterns are
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:35,007	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Some of these patterns are what we call Chance correlation
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:40,639	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And so what we would like to do in order to build a really effective model is to find variables that
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:42,431	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Matter factors that affect
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:43,455	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The outcome of crappie
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:44,735	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Princeton
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:47,039	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	I'd like to be able to do that automatically
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:52,927	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	But because some subject matter expertise is involved we need the help of a human being to help
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:53,439	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Curate
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:54,463	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	This process
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:57,279	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And so in the d3m program
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:15:03,679	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The goal is to make and that's the data-driven Discovery Model
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:05,983	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The goal of that program is to
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:09,311	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Fundamentally change the category of Labor from
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:12,895	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Statistician in machine learning expert that constructs the model
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:14,431	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	To machine
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:15,711	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Plus subject matter
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:22,367	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And so the idea is that we have a machine that automatically tests a whole bunch of
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:24,415	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And it does so in an efficient way
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:29,535	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And you know general for most of these problems are infinitely many models that could be used
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:31,839	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Answer the question is how do you find the right one
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:35,679	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The machines are very good at doing that testing in an automated fashion
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:40,543	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And if they can work with you and beings to constrain the kinds of models that they
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,311	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Explorer
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:45,919	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	They can potentially find models very very quickly very effectively without the
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:46,687	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Need for
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:47,455	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Expert machine learning
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:48,991	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Personnel
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:50,015	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Or Davis
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:52,063	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Fascinating
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:55,135	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	So let's move to the third program
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:55,903	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Quantitative
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:57,183	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Crisis
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:15:57,695	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Response
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:15:59,487	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Again a little bit of it
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:00,767	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Description of a program
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:01,535	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And what kind of frog
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:05,887	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	So the goal in like you Ciara quantitative crisis response
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:06,655	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Program
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:08,191	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	West of figure out
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:09,983	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	How information affects p
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:12,543	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	+ 2
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:14,079	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Build a way to measure that
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:17,151	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	That's the fundamental goal in our program
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:24,319	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	So you know with social media and fake news and propaganda being distributed by organizations
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:24,831	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Like Isis
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:28,927	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Write our goal was to figure out how does that turn into a radicalization
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:32,511	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	How is it that videos online
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:35,839	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Convert people into Fighters
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:36,351	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	On the battle
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:39,679	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	So what we've been doing in that program is
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:41,471	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Building models again
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:44,031	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	How human beings respond properly
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:47,103	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And how effective
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:48,383	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Spitzer propaganda
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:49,151	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	AR
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:51,455	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	By looking at measurements of
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:52,735	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	How people react in place
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:58,367	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And so the fundamental goal there is to build what we call a measure of effective
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:03,999	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Which is really a way to measure concrete outcomes associated with
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:06,559	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Various bits of information that are put out their various bits
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:12,959	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	So you know the in the last couple of years what we've seen is that organizations like Isis can reach
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:15,263	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Millions of people through social media
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:22,175	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And they effectively recruit a small number of them but still you know when you can recruit million small
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:23,967	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	All percentages add up to a lot of Fighters
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:26,527	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Answer the question is how do they do that
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:32,927	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	I want one hand and how effective are we at stopping them or at you know are they at actually
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:33,695	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Achieving that outcome
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:37,791	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And so what we've been building is essentially a gauge is essentially a meter
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:38,815	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	That says
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:42,911	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Oh today that message that you put out has a higher degree of
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:44,959	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Potential for radicalizing people than the one that you
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:45,983	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Yesterday
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:49,311	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And why that matters is that it allows us
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:51,615	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	People who are interested in countering radicalization
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:52,895	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	2
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:55,967	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Estimate how well we're doing at preventing that radical
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:56,479	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Causation from
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:18:00,319	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Or Century building a meter that allows us to know whether or not
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:00,831	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	We're doing well
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:01,855	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Or poorly
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:04,159	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	A1 theme
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:07,999	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	I seem to apply maybe all of these programs
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:09,279	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Is
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:10,815	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	That idea of
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:12,351	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	You know how can
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:15,423	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Human beings and their machines and their come
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:19,519	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Computers and all of their online resources how can all of these things work together
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:21,823	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	It could have been a symbiotic way
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:23,871	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Play so that we drive
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:24,895	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Knowledge
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:26,687	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Wisdom from all of this interaction
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:28,479	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	It reminds me of
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:30,271	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Really kind of the early days here of DARPA
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,831	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	In particular I'm thinking of
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:34,111	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	But one of our more famous
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:34,879	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Dinnerly
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:39,487	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Program managers Joseph Carl robnett licklider most people know him as
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:39,999	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Jcr like
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:43,583	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	I'm who was even back in the 60s
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:44,607	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	With the program matter
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,911	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	I was articulating the
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:47,423	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	What's this idea
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:48,447	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Forever symbiosis
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:50,239	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Between the human beings and
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:55,615	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And machine. Just wondering how how does it feel to be a program manager you know kind of working in this long long
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:58,687	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Well First Watch Company
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:01,503	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	When you look at the history of program managers
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:03,807	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The DARPA and the various things that are pissed
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:05,855	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Produce over its lifespan
EDL	00:19:05,855	00:19:07,647	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	We are all humbled by the
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:09,695	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Great outcomes that those folks had in
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:10,463	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	In the program
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:13,279	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	That they were produced out of here
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:18,655	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	You know most of us just try to do our job but all of us are thinking bigger than the things that we could have done our
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:22,495	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And that's the thing that darpin genders and all of us
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:26,591	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	It's the opportunity to explore an area of research
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:28,895	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	It's much larger than anyone
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:30,431	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Research organization can do
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:34,015	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Before we close out of our conversation
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:35,551	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	I think this relates a little bit
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:36,063	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	What you just said
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:38,623	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	It's going to stand back from any particular
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:43,231	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	RAM and maybe share with us some of what you've observed
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:43,999	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Closest 24
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:44,767	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	14 as a program out of

EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:14,719	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	So where do you think DARPA fits into this
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:15,743	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Overall
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:17,279	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Innovation
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:24,703	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Well it's it's interesting right so there are a lot of obviously even within the US government or number of organization
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:25,215	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Oceans of Fun Bass
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:28,031	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Define applied research
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:29,055	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Define various
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:30,591	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Projects along
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:31,615	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	That continuum
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:35,967	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And I think DARPA has a very unique role it's it it's a role that
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:37,759	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Spans the gap
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:39,807	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Between basic research and applied science
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:45,183	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	I often times we are looking for the applications that seem impossible
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:46,719	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Whether it's you know
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:50,559	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Launching drones off of flying aircraft
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:51,327	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Or
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:56,703	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	You know detecting human trafficking online all of these things are things that
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:21:01,823	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Nowhere emerging capabilities three or four years ago but now have proven to be possible
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:06,431	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And so dark isn't a very unique place that allows us to
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:07,711	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Push the technology
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:10,783	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Beyond the theoretical stages
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:12,831	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	To the point where we can actually
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:16,159	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	See where the where the applications are going to be
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:16,928	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	So
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:17,696	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	We're not
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:20,512	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Builders of the ultimate technology right
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:25,632	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	At the end of the day we found the research and that research eventually becomes productizing other forms
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:31,520	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	If you look at the progression of Robotics and self-driving cars
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:35,872	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	All of those AI technology for curated out of DARPA programs early on
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:40,480	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And have subsequently you know a 10-year Horizon after that
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:42,016	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	You have become
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:43,552	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Productize mobile
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:47,648	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Industry has been able to take it up so we serve a very crucial role
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:50,208	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And the reason that we can serve that role is
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:51,488	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Twofold one
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:52,512	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The program manager
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:54,304	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	These folks
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:55,328	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Come with the ideas
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:57,888	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And they can see the horizon
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:22:04,288	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	They've been working in the research they understand the basic research is happening in that field and make a noise like a horizon view of lake
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:05,568	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Foods you you had
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:09,920	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Boots on the ground in particular of Technology
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:16,320	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	That's right and we don't stay long and part of the reason we can't stay long is that we're going to lose view of the Horizon if we do right wing
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:17,856	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	I need to be back in in the guts
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:18,368	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	To that research
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:23,232	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And so all of us are here for a temporary. Of time and I think that was a brilliant
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:25,792	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Design decision in terms of how we structure DARPA
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:28,608	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The other thing I would say is that the
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:33,472	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Funding amounts in the Catalyst the DARPA provides in terms of scope of programs
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:35,264	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Is at the right levels
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:37,056	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	To be able to do the kinds of projects
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:39,360	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	That we can do is technology demonstrators
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:40,128	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	What is early prototype
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:43,456	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Those are things that are really really hard to do without a
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:44,736	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	High level of envy
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:47,552	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Because they often involve
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:48,576	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Multiple disc
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:49,856	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Coupons for multiple fields
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:51,904	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Who are at the edge of something
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:55,744	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	But that's something requires them to all work together to build it
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:23:02,656	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And build early-stage prototypes of it and to fail multiple times potentially in the process
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:03,424	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Doing that
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:05,216	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Yeah you bring up for the failure in
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:06,240	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The tolerance for failure here
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:09,312	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	To me that's one of the most interesting things about DARPA
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:11,616	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Because they're they're not all that many other
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:13,664	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Stakeholders in the in the Innovation ecosystem
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:16,736	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	That can actually afford to do that if your company
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:18,528	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	You might be able to feel a little bit but
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:24,672	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	You've got to be able to deliver a technology you got to be able to deliver these to your to your stockholders eventually
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:26,208	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Where is here I guess
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:28,512	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Program managers like you can
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:31,328	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Probe technology possibilities
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:32,096	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And determined
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:33,888	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Is this something that
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:36,960	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	He's had a good likelihood of moving for another word you can take the risk
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:38,240	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Down
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:41,056	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	For others who then might take it to Ryan exactly
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:46,176	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	So I worked in startup World prior to it going to Lincoln and one of the things I can tell you there is that
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:48,992	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Yeah there's actually relatively little tolerance
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:49,760	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Risk
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:52,320	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The kinds of risks that you can tolerate
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:53,600	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Are not the same as
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:54,624	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The kinds of risks that we
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:55,904	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Tolerate here at DARPA
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:59,232	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The concrete idea that you have in a startup better be
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:02,304	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Better be actionable as a product in three to four years
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:03,072	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Otherwise
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:06,400	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	You know there's there's no sense in funding that
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:12,032	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	There's all sorts of business-related risk execution related risk for technology risk camping
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:14,848	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The DARPA we can take technology
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:16,128	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Science
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:18,688	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And I think that's actually the fundamental
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:20,480	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	To do what we do
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:25,600	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Like other program managers you are a technology developer
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:28,160	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Review for exercising your
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:30,464	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Science engineering and kind of Technology match
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:31,744	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	How to eat a match
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:36,352	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Nocti
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:40,704	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	So I'm just wondering if there is a a kind of fictional technology
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:41,472	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	That you might have been
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:43,264	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Thinking about food out since you were a kid
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:45,312	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	But you wish were real
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:47,360	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	But isn't
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:52,480	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Well so that's that's a fun one you know being a language person
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:54,528	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The thing that end in one that worked on
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:55,808	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Translation
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:57,088	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Many years
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:59,648	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	For years we've been
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:00,672	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Striving towards
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:02,720	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	This kind of Babelfish
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:03,744	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Kind of
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:10,656	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Capability do you know what I mean though I never read the books by
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:13,472	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Douglas Adams Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:19,360	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	You know it in the various Interstellar spaces right everybody speaks a different language
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:21,920	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	So the solution to this is the Babel Fish
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:26,528	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	It's the the fish that you put in your ear and then suddenly eat you can hear in your own language
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:30,624	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	You know the translation the perfect translation of
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:34,208	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Do all of these alien species University translate Universal trans
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:35,744	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Play it right is it the exact
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:36,256	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Tweet from Star Trek
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:39,072	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Well you know this
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:45,216	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	What's really fascinating is last couple years because of the work that's going on in deep neural networks and
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:47,264	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The cool work has been going on
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:49,824	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Bo Sinn DARPA funded research
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:51,104	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	End end
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:52,128	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And commercially funded work
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:54,176	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	We're really getting close to
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:57,760	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	So there was this paper last year by Google
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:26:01,600	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The described the use of multiple languages
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:05,440	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	How to do translation translating for multiple languages into a language
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:09,280	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	I am in training those translators from various different
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:10,048	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Forms
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:12,608	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And what they discovered is that these neural networks
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:14,144	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Learn kind of a universal
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:16,960	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Semantic representation of language
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:18,496	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	As part of
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:20,800	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	The process of training this emergent
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:22,336	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	It's an emergent property of
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:24,384	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	How these neural networks were built
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:31,040	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And so what it leads to in long-run is potentially actually having a universal trans
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:33,600	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And that is going to be a really
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:36,928	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	It just give it a shot so if we were to give listeners
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:38,464	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	What you mean by neural net
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:45,888	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Yeah so so we use the term neural network it actually has very little.
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:48,704	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Do with neurons as in the cells in your brain
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:51,008	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	But these are models of
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:52,288	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	How your neurons work
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:56,128	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Start a very primitive models of how your neurons in your brain work
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:27:00,480	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	That are composed together to form little small brain like you
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:06,368	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And what the Google guys did was they figured out how to build a neural network
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:07,648	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	That could take information
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:08,672	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Drupal multiple languages
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:10,464	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Ian
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:12,000	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Essentially regular eyes
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:13,792	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Into a form
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:16,352	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	That would allow it to translate in English
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:18,912	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	And that intermediate form
EDL	00:27:18,912	00:27:19,424	| Episode 09 The Datamancer |	Which is
