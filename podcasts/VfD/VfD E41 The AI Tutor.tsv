EDL	00:00:11,570	00:00:20,345	| media/VfD E41 |	Stealth technology, the Internet, GPS in the column of your hand autonomous operation. 
EDL	00:00:20,345	00:00:25,825	| media/VfD E41 |	Technology is a driver of our times since its founding in nineteen fifty eight, in the midst of the cold war, 
EDL	00:00:25,825	00:00:30,960	| media/VfD E41 |	DARPA, the defence advanced research projects agency has been a driver of technology.

EDL	00:00:31,420	00:00:38,750	| media/VfD E41 |	Welcome to Voice from DARPA, a window onto DARPA's core of program managers, their job, to redefine what is possible.
EDL	00:00:39,060	00:00:41,915	| media/VfD E41 |	My name is Ivan Amato. I'm your DARPA host. Today,  
EDL	00:00:41,915	00:00:48,878	| media/VfD E41 |	I am pleased to be talking with that to Dr. Bruce Draper, a program manager since 2019 in the agencie's information innovation office, 
EDL	00:00:48,878	00:00:54,339	| media/VfD E41 |	we are recording our conversation from our respective homes as we do our parts to slow the spread of Covid-19, 
EDL	00:00:54,339	00:00:59,458	| media/VfD E41 |	because we are not in, according to do, you might hear ambient sounds like traffic and birds. 
EDL	00:00:59,458	00:01:01,310	| media/VfD E41 |	Let me say a little bit about Bruce
EDL	00:01:01,310	00:01:10,203	| media/VfD E41 |	He joined the DARPA from Colorado State University, where he is unloned from the Department of Computer Science and much published research leader 
EDL	00:01:10,203	00:01:16,686	| media/VfD E41 |	who has been a principal or co-principle investigator, 20 R&D projects in a diversity of areas, 
EDL	00:01:16,686	00:01:19,855	| media/VfD E41 |	among these are biological inspired machine vision, 
EDL	00:01:19,855	00:01:23,041	| media/VfD E41 |	reinforcement learning, unmanned ground vehicles, 
EDL	00:01:23,041	00:01:29,326	| media/VfD E41 |	facial recognition and action recognition by computer systems and communicating through gesture.
EDL	00:01:29,326	00:01:33,066	| media/VfD E41 |	Throughout his education, it was computer science all the way.

EDL	00:01:33,066	00:01:40,040	| media/VfD E41 |	Blues earned his bachelor's degree from Yale university and his master degree in PhD from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
EDL	00:01:40,040	00:01:45,312	| media/VfD E41 |	He also has been a generous community builder in the artificial intelligence R&D community, 
EDL	00:01:45,312	00:01:50,127	| media/VfD E41 |	having held leadership positions in the planning and organization of many conferences.
EDL	00:01:50,127	00:01:56,870	| media/VfD E41 |	And now he is bringing all of that CS training, that is computer science training and confidence and credit to DARPA. 

EDL	00:01:56,870	00:01:59,006	| media/VfD E41 |	Bruce Draper, thanks for joining today. 
EDL	00:01:59,006	00:02:00,261	| media/VfD E41 |	It's good to be here. 

EDL	00:02:00,261	00:02:06,984	| media/VfD E41 |	It looks to me like you knew, even as a young man, which is to say when you are a undergraduate at Yale 
EDL	00:02:06,984	00:02:09,435	| media/VfD E41 |	that you and computer science were a match and 
EDL	00:02:09,435	00:02:15,869	| media/VfD E41 |	we are gonna see how that love of computer science is still part of who you are when we talk about your programs, 
EDL	00:02:15,869	00:02:21,909	| media/VfD E41 |	particularly in intersections with artificial intelligence and the relationship between computers and people.

EDL	00:02:21,909	00:02:24,869	| media/VfD E41 |	But I'm fascinated by this embrace of computer science
EDL	00:02:24,869	00:02:27,040	| media/VfD E41 |	I'd love to know the origins of that interests.
EDL	00:02:27,040	00:02:33,179	| media/VfD E41 |	When I went to college, I never touched the computer, because, well, it was 1980, and they weren't that common.
EDL	00:02:33,179	00:02:39,448	| media/VfD E41 |	My freshmen year I thought was going to be a philosophy major, and I found I was a bit of not bird's flash student because I loved logic, 
EDL	00:02:39,448	00:02:41,800	| media/VfD E41 |	and I wasn't that fund of ancient greek.
EDL	00:02:41,800	00:02:48,450	| media/VfD E41 |	I said about the same time I took a computer science course, and I certainly realized where applied logic was going, and how much fun it was
EDL	00:02:48,450	00:02:56,147	| media/VfD E41 |	Three of the new logic, billions of second plus Yale at that time was not had a large program in artificial intelligence, 
EDL	00:02:56,147	00:03:02,513	| media/VfD E41 |	and they are just immediately fit into everything I wanted to do in terms of of learning about reasoning in perception 
EDL	00:03:02,513	00:03:05,030	| media/VfD E41 |	and how people think and why we believe what we believe that. 

EDL	00:03:05,030	00:03:10,722	| media/VfD E41 |	You've got your first academic appointment as postdoc in 1993, and since 1996, 
EDL	00:03:10,722	00:03:16,677	| media/VfD E41 |	you have made Colorado State University of the computer science department of your professional home.
EDL	00:03:16,677	00:03:23,285	| media/VfD E41 |	So what was the sequence events that lower you from this long time academic life, and I still part of your life, 
EDL	00:03:23,285	00:03:28,490	| media/VfD E41 |	and you can go back to what loads you from there to DARPA and become a program manager?

EDL	00:03:28,970	00:03:35,126	| media/VfD E41 |	Well, as you can imagine, there's always multiple reasons why why we do things, and certainly one of them was sort of patriotism
EDL	00:03:35,126	00:03:42,401	| media/VfD E41 |	If you were a chance to give back to the country that given so much to me, but it was also sort of it was an intellectual moment as well
EDL	00:03:42,401	00:03:48,160	| media/VfD E41 |	I spent as much of my career working on what we called computer vision, trying to get computers to see.
EDL	00:03:48,160	00:03:53,880	| media/VfD E41 |	And in the last ten years or so, there had been real breakthroughs in that area, 
EDL	00:03:53,880	00:04:01,000	| media/VfD E41 |	which is why you now see things like autonomous vehicles and face recognition on facebook and all of these sorts of things.

EDL	00:04:01,000	00:04:08,600	| media/VfD E41 |	And so it certainly felt to me like, there is a C change, and that I spent a lot of my life time to figure out how to get computers to see
EDL	00:04:08,920	00:04:10,780	| media/VfD E41 |	And now the question was great,
EDL	00:04:10,780	00:04:11,660	| media/VfD E41 |	We can do that
EDL	00:04:11,660	00:04:19,192	| media/VfD E41 |	What should they look at, and how are we going to use this, and how are we going to integrate these intelligence systems and into artificial intelligence
EDL	00:04:19,192	00:04:23,489	| media/VfD E41 |	And that's a very hard thing to do from the perspective of the single laboratory, 
EDL	00:04:23,489	00:04:32,450	| media/VfD E41 |	but at a place like DARPA, you can create programs to help define the field and create intellectual communities of people that are trying to tackle brand new problems
EDL	00:04:32,450	00:04:36,640	| media/VfD E41 |	And that's an opportunity so you can do it DARPA, but you just can't do anywhere. 

EDL	00:04:36,640	00:04:43,842	| media/VfD E41 |	You're touching out one of the things that I find most fascinating institutionally about DARPA programmers do get in this position 
EDL	00:04:43,842	00:04:50,931	| media/VfD E41 |	where, where they can really be community builders that can really have a major role in the direction that an entire field takes. 
EDL	00:04:50,931	00:04:53,630	| media/VfD E41 |	I can see that you coming from the trenches in the sense
EDL	00:04:53,630	00:04:58,946	| media/VfD E41 |	And then looking at DARPA as a way of giving some direction to the feel that you had really become central to. 

EDL	00:04:58,946	00:05:00,000	| media/VfD E41 |	When I was a graduate student,
EDL	00:05:00,000	00:05:04,820	| media/VfD E41 |	I worked on the DARPA of a funded project early in the days of computer vision, 
EDL	00:05:04,820	00:05:08,920	| media/VfD E41 |	back when DARPA thought computers could see in nobody else thought they ever would.
EDL	00:05:08,920	00:05:15,661	| media/VfD E41 |	And I said, now that we sort of reached a level of success of just visions with a chance to go back to DARPA to say 
EDL	00:05:15,661	00:05:16,539	| media/VfD E41 |	What is the next step
EDL	00:05:16,539	00:05:21,630	| media/VfD E41 |	What is the next big thing we need to work on, and that was just too exciting possibility for me to pass up. 

EDL	00:05:21,630	00:05:28,670	| media/VfD E41 |	Okay, so let us move into your DARPA experience. You've been at the agency since 2018
EDL	00:05:28,670	00:05:34,888	| media/VfD E41 |	You inherited a few programs that were started by previous program managers, which is held things often worked at DARPA
EDL	00:05:34,888	00:05:42,358	| media/VfD E41 |	There are kind of a hand of bouton at times, but you also started some of your own, and we'll talk about all of these actually.
EDL	00:05:42,358	00:05:48,011	| media/VfD E41 |	Actually, the one I want to start with is known as GARD that spelled GARD. 
EDL	00:05:48,011	00:05:53,070	| media/VfD E41 |	That's the acronym for Guaranteeing AI Robustness Against Deception.

EDL	00:05:53,070	00:05:59,290	| media/VfD E41 |	And this falls within what at least for me has been a little known arena of AI, called adversarial AI
EDL	00:05:59,290	00:06:05,534	| media/VfD E41 |	The, you know, we already know that AI tools, such as facial recognition rely on algorithms 
EDL	00:06:05,534	00:06:08,625	| media/VfD E41 |	that data sets the people can pose and design and curate 
EDL	00:06:08,625	00:06:12,999	| media/VfD E41 |	which means that human biases and assumptions can get built into the systems, 
EDL	00:06:12,999	00:06:18,495	| media/VfD E41 |	but GARD starting with the assumption that adversaries will deliberately try to mess with AI system.

EDL	00:06:18,495	00:06:22,940	| media/VfD E41 |	So I want you to talk to me about these threats and what you hope to achieve with problem. 

EDL	00:06:22,940	00:06:30,395	| media/VfD E41 |	Well, I mentioned earlier than the last 10 years computer vision is suddenly becomes something that is robust, becomes something that is usable.
EDL	00:06:30,395	00:06:33,304	| media/VfD E41 |	And so we're starting to use it, in all kinds of systems
EDL	00:06:33,304	00:06:34,940	| media/VfD E41 |	Think about self-driving cars
EDL	00:06:34,940	00:06:36,050	| media/VfD E41 |	Think about the replications
EDL	00:06:36,050	00:06:39,720	| media/VfD E41 |	And if you're sitting in a self driving car, you really want to make sure that it works correctly 
EDL	00:06:39,720	00:06:46,921	| media/VfD E41 |	and buying largely well, unless there's somebody that some adversaries out there trying intentionally to break [..] 
EDL	00:06:46,921	00:06:53,346	| media/VfD E41 |	little less than ten years ago, there is a research who discovered that you could add a little bit of noise to an image, 
EDL	00:06:53,346	00:06:55,852	| media/VfD E41 |	and as a human being, you wouldn't notice it.
EDL	00:06:55,852	00:07:00,000	| media/VfD E41 |	But if they added the right kind of noise, they could break the computer vision system.
EDL	00:07:00,000	00:07:06,806	| media/VfD E41 |	AI system will think with the wrong logic, and people said, okay, that theoretically, you can do in the lab 
EDL	00:07:06,806	00:07:10,803	| media/VfD E41 |	you had to add, you know, exactly the right numbers to exactly the right tickets, 
EDL	00:07:10,803	00:07:14,423	| media/VfD E41 |	and then along comes on researchers who, but is sticker on a step, 
EDL	00:07:14,423	00:07:20,420	| media/VfD E41 |	but they put it in just the right spot, such that as you drove by it, the camera would look at it and go
EDL	00:07:20,420	00:07:21,570	| media/VfD E41 |	"that's not a stop sign"
EDL	00:07:22,070	00:07:27,465	| media/VfD E41 |	"that's a speed limit sign" and all of the certain things got scary, right, if you are the self driving car, 
EDL	00:07:27,465	00:07:29,470	| media/VfD E41 |	you want to recognize that stop sign.

EDL	00:07:29,820	00:07:37,337	| media/VfD E41 |	So we begin to realize that there were things that adversaries could do intentionally to try to thwart your AI system, 
EDL	00:07:37,337	00:07:42,390	| media/VfD E41 |	and as air systems become more and more part of of safety critical systems, 
EDL	00:07:42,390	00:07:47,697	| media/VfD E41 |	this was going to be a major issue, and hence the area of what's called adversaries AI was born
EDL	00:07:47,697	00:07:52,459	| media/VfD E41 |	How do you make an AI system that cannot be messed with, by somebody else. 

EDL	00:07:52,459	00:07:54,873	| media/VfD E41 |	And it's interesting causing the senses
EDL	00:07:54,873	00:07:58,521	| media/VfD E41 |	This is brand new, and it's AI and it's high-tech, but it's sort of
EDL	00:07:58,521	00:08:06,730	| media/VfD E41 |	It's an old story of, you used to be the in the military, you, you looked at your enemy super nautilus, and so your enemy developed camouflage(伪装)
EDL	00:08:07,220	00:08:10,420	| media/VfD E41 |	And then we did radars for people came up with stealth.
EDL	00:08:11,190	00:08:15,530	| media/VfD E41 |	Now we're using artificial intelligence programs to look at camera data
EDL	00:08:15,530	00:08:21,560	| media/VfD E41 |	Look at satellite data to look at all kinds of sensors that people will try to [suck for] it. 

EDL	00:08:21,980	00:08:27,230	| media/VfD E41 |	GARD is really looking at this, this sort of long lineage(血统) of deception
EDL	00:08:27,230	00:08:30,798	| media/VfD E41 |	But now in a artificial intelligence context, 
EDL	00:08:30,798	00:08:38,035	| media/VfD E41 |	so tell me a little bit about what kind of technological directions that you and your performers 
EDL	00:08:38,035	00:08:45,460	| media/VfD E41 |	that is to see the researchers who you are a well contract with under this program will take and trying to defend against such deceptions. 

EDL	00:08:45,860	00:08:47,600	| media/VfD E41 |	We're taking it a two pronon? attack
EDL	00:08:47,960	00:08:50,730	| media/VfD E41 |	We could call it practice, on one hand, and theory on the other
EDL	00:08:51,400	00:08:55,474	| media/VfD E41 |	So for the practice side, we are building in evaluation framework 
EDL	00:08:55,474	00:08:59,420	| media/VfD E41 |	that allows anyone to come up and say, here is my AI assistant
EDL	00:08:59,420	00:09:03,815	| media/VfD E41 |	I've come what defends for it, and we have the system that will automatically attack it 
EDL	00:09:03,815	00:09:06,900	| media/VfD E41 |	according to all of our known ways and tested, evaluated it, 
EDL	00:09:06,900	00:09:08,621	| media/VfD E41 |	and we are using this trying to get people 
EDL	00:09:08,621	00:09:15,346	| media/VfD E41 |	to come up with AI algorithms that are more robust that are not deceptable to being fooled fuckfuck accessible 
EDL	00:09:15,346	00:09:16,055	| media/VfD E41 |	at the same time
EDL	00:09:16,055	00:09:22,647	| media/VfD E41 |	Think about an adversary that you never know if they're gonna do, maybe they thought of a tricky habit

EDL	00:09:22,647	00:09:28,441	| media/VfD E41 |	So at the same time, I also tried very hard to push the theory behind it, come up with systems 
EDL	00:09:28,441	00:09:32,962	| media/VfD E41 |	that we can prove cannot be thwarted within certain reasonable buffs?
EDL	00:09:32,962	00:09:38,604	| media/VfD E41 |	And so we have a practice side of this program, which is time to create new learning algorithms 
EDL	00:09:38,604	00:09:43,727	| media/VfD E41 |	that will be less acceptable to attacks and the same time trying to come up with a theory 
EDL	00:09:43,727	00:09:47,970	| media/VfD E41 |	that will  tell us how successful we are at that, and what the limits of that are
EDL	00:09:47,970	00:09:53,238	| media/VfD E41 |	There may be certain things that some economists do ,it if they turn off your camera, you're not going to see you then

EDL	00:09:53,238	00:10:00,000	| media/VfD E41 |	So you are trying to change where the theoretical limits are, while the same time developing a fundamental new defence of our groups. 

EDL	00:10:00,000	00:10:05,503	| media/VfD E41 |	And what about on the level of the data sets for learning and for training AI. 
EDL	00:10:05,503	00:10:07,450	| media/VfD E41 |	Are there vulnerabilities there? 

EDL	00:10:07,450	00:10:08,570	| media/VfD E41 |	There are indeed.
EDL	00:10:08,570	00:10:10,880	| media/VfD E41 |	There is, there is a lot of different ways
EDL	00:10:10,880	00:10:15,570	| media/VfD E41 |	One of my detectives and one of them is what we call informally poisoning

POISONING

EDL	00:10:16,210	00:10:22,500	| media/VfD E41 |	That is to say someone can hand you a training set that has been that has been altered in such a way
EDL	00:10:22,500	00:10:27,003	| media/VfD E41 |	The system you learn based on that data will do the wrong thing
EDL	00:10:27,003	00:10:33,433	| media/VfD E41 |	And if they're clever, the system you learn will do the right thing most of the time, 
EDL	00:10:33,433	00:10:36,616	| media/VfD E41 |	but be fooled, on the one particular instance they care about. 
EDL	00:10:36,616	00:10:38,180	| media/VfD E41 |	And that's called data poisoning
EDL	00:10:38,180	00:10:41,521	| media/VfD E41 |	And that is absolutely one of the ways you can attack an AI system, 
EDL	00:10:41,521	00:10:43,930	| media/VfD E41 |	and it is one of the things you're tring to develop new defences for.

EDL	00:10:43,930	00:10:49,100	| media/VfD E41 |	This is sort of reminds me of every example of, you know, where the solution becomes the problem, right
EDL	00:10:49,100	00:10:55,301	| media/VfD E41 |	Because in a sense, we want AI to be a solution and helpful in a lot of ways, but because it has vulnerabilities, 
EDL	00:10:55,301	00:10:58,100	| media/VfD E41 |	it also does stand the chance of becoming a problem
EDL	00:10:58,100	00:11:04,296	| media/VfD E41 |	And of course, this is where I guess GARD comes in and trying to anticipate that vulnerability in potential problem 
EDL	00:11:04,296	00:11:06,660	| media/VfD E41 |	and figuring out and manage that in the future. 

EDL	00:11:07,130	00:11:13,900	| media/VfD E41 |	unfortunately, I have always the royal technology, right, we love it because it does something new for us. but there's always a downside there be going . 

EDL	00:11:14,750	00:11:17,150	| media/VfD E41 |	Okay, so we have a few more programs to get through
EDL	00:11:17,150	00:11:17,870	| media/VfD E41 |	lets move on

EDL	00:11:17,870	00:11:23,451	| media/VfD E41 |	One of them is related to this one, and is got a dozy of a name that leads, in this case, to two acronyms, 
EDL	00:11:23,451	00:11:28,853	| media/VfD E41 |	period by peerposition and is getting out sort of defense against various air
EDL	00:11:28,853	00:11:40,680	| media/VfD E41 |	In another way, I'm referring here to first the acronyms QED for RML, and that is sort of for qualifying and symbol diversity for robust machine learning

EDL	00:11:41,380	00:11:44,500	| media/VfD E41 |	So bruce makes sense of that name for me 
EDL	00:11:44,500	00:11:45,417	| media/VfD E41 |	And our listeners 
EDL	00:11:45,417	00:11:51,580	| media/VfD E41 |	and tell us how success with this program will defend against those who might weaponize AI. 
EDL	00:11:51,580	00:11:55,291	| media/VfD E41 |	So is the same general set up where you want to use an AI system
EDL	00:11:55,291	00:12:00,834	| media/VfD E41 |	Let's say, you want to use it to drive your autonomous vehicles it could be for many things, of course, 
EDL	00:12:00,834	00:12:07,025	| media/VfD E41 |	and what you want to do is make sure that an adversary can't defeat it. And we are already said that with GARD program, 
EDL	00:12:07,025	00:12:17,163	| media/VfD E41 |	which is really about this long term effort to create a new area, brand new approaches to defending these AI systems, but that's going to take a while
EDL	00:12:17,163	00:12:21,620	| media/VfD E41 |	And we have AI systems that we wanna be able to defend today.
EDL	00:12:21,620	00:12:24,670	| media/VfD E41 |	So, how do we do that right now?
EDL	00:12:24,670	00:12:30,097	| media/VfD E41 |	Our best defense of AI system is what we called ensemble, 
EDL	00:12:30,097	00:12:35,682	| media/VfD E41 |	and the idea behind ensemble that maybe if I have an eye system, maybe you can foot
Tue Jan 18 22:02:43 CST 2022 called it a day. MARKER
* UNDONE
EDL	00:12:35,682	00:12:45,700	| media/VfD E41 |	But what if I have ten AI systems or twenty AI systems, or one hundred AI systems, all trying to recognize that subsidy, can you hold all of them
EDL	00:12:45,700	00:12:50,110	| media/VfD E41 |	And the answer is, you might be able to follow them if there are two similar to each other
EDL	00:12:50,780	00:13:00,000	| media/VfD E41 |	But if I have ten or twenty, and I programs that are all you know, trained on different data, I'll try to do the same tasks, but doing it slightly differently
EDL	00:13:00,000	00:13:02,096	| media/VfD E41 |	That is hard to fool all of
EDL	00:13:02,096	00:13:21,380	| media/VfD E41 |	So the idea of the QED for our male program is trying to measure the diversity within your own symbol of classifiers and trying to train them such a way that, although you may fall, one of them, you want for all the classifiers all the time, and therefore we can still get the system as a whole work. 
EDL	00:13:21,380	00:13:37,438	| media/VfD E41 |	What fascinates me about the way you just said, that is its kind of the AI annual work to the idea that a diversity of people, diversity of mine said the diversity of makes you better and makes you more able to do things
EDL	00:13:37,438	00:13:39,750	| media/VfD E41 |	And so this is kind of an AI version of that. 
EDL	00:13:39,750	00:13:41,586	| media/VfD E41 |	And that's exactly what it is
EDL	00:13:41,586	00:13:44,570	| media/VfD E41 |	No AI is perfect, just like no person is perfect
EDL	00:13:44,950	00:13:47,500	| media/VfD E41 |	But you know, you get a lot of them together
EDL	00:13:47,500	00:13:48,710	| media/VfD E41 |	You hope to get a better seat. 
EDL	00:13:49,190	00:13:53,840	| media/VfD E41 |	Let's now move on to a couple of other programs that I think also are related in a way
EDL	00:13:53,840	00:13:55,460	| media/VfD E41 |	These are true that you inherited
EDL	00:13:55,460	00:13:59,226	| media/VfD E41 |	One is called communicating with computers recede up
EDL	00:13:59,226	00:14:10,140	| media/VfD E41 |	You see, and mother is learning with less labelling, which will talk about, and just a bit, the first one communicating with computer seems a bit like couples therapy for artificial intelligence and human intelligence
EDL	00:14:10,140	00:14:29,536	| media/VfD E41 |	Because if he had this, I think it, but you tell, tell me if I got this right is the challenge of enabling people to be human as the communicate with computers, which is to say that we should build language gestures, which is funny, because even though we're not together, we're talking on the phone, I actually am gesturing a very gesture in my own communication
EDL	00:14:29,536	00:14:34,210	| media/VfD E41 |	And also, we have words, we've gestures, facial expressions, and it seems like, what do you want hearing
EDL	00:14:34,210	00:14:40,140	| media/VfD E41 |	This program is for computers to get all that as we communicate with this system is that right
EDL	00:14:40,140	00:14:42,160	| media/VfD E41 |	And if so, how are you going about that
EDL	00:14:42,160	00:14:44,040	| media/VfD E41 |	And what is the status of the program? 
EDL	00:14:44,040	00:14:45,630	| media/VfD E41 |	This program is nearly due to my heart
EDL	00:14:45,630	00:14:49,340	| media/VfD E41 |	I was actually a researcher on that program before I came to DARPA
EDL	00:14:49,340	00:15:00,800	| media/VfD E41 |	And together the program, the idea of the communicating with computer program is that computers are becoming less of a simple tool and more perfect partner
EDL	00:15:00,800	00:15:06,004	| media/VfD E41 |	So you don't really worry about how you can unique with the hammer you can pick up and drive
EDL	00:15:06,004	00:15:08,606	| media/VfD E41 |	And then you know, I thought you're going to do
EDL	00:15:08,606	00:15:21,590	| media/VfD E41 |	But as we got these smaller eye systems, the smaller eye systems were going to, perhaps that we don't, you know, for example, they may have gotta, often study some topic on the internet and have collected a lot of information
EDL	00:15:21,590	00:15:27,877	| media/VfD E41 |	They may have to change the scale, and over, you know, hours and hours of video that you haven't seen from a variety of reasons
EDL	00:15:27,877	00:15:30,269	| media/VfD E41 |	They may have information you don't have
EDL	00:15:30,269	00:15:36,373	| media/VfD E41 |	And the question is, how are you going to get to that because you don't know what the computer loves
EDL	00:15:36,373	00:15:38,675	| media/VfD E41 |	We had to throw up with people all the time
EDL	00:15:38,675	00:15:43,170	| media/VfD E41 |	It's called the conversation, right, and this is what we want to be able to do
EDL	00:15:43,170	00:15:49,320	| media/VfD E41 |	We want to have an appeal to peer conversation with the computer, not just a symbol
EDL	00:15:49,320	00:15:50,840	| media/VfD E41 |	You know, it gives you many using you
EDL	00:15:50,840	00:15:52,020	| media/VfD E41 |	So like what I don't know what
EDL	00:15:52,740	00:15:57,130	| media/VfD E41 |	And it turns out that period of your communication use really hard
EDL	00:15:57,130	00:15:59,360	| media/VfD E41 |	People are amazingly complex
EDL	00:15:59,360	00:16:02,133	| media/VfD E41 |	And we do, we use jesus, we use facial expression
EDL	00:16:02,133	00:16:07,112	| media/VfD E41 |	We use procedure, right, purchase of the inflation of our voice, right
EDL	00:16:07,112	00:16:12,740	| media/VfD E41 |	We use all of these sources of information and without them, and communication is very hard
EDL	00:16:12,740	00:16:14,294	| media/VfD E41 |	They've got text, they go and eat
EDL	00:16:14,294	00:16:18,180	| media/VfD E41 |	Misunderstanding is you have over text because you don't have those things. 
EDL	00:16:18,180	00:16:25,050	| media/VfD E41 |	That channels of immigration, yeah, there are so many kind of flaming conversation is in the email on the web
EDL	00:16:25,050	00:16:33,580	| media/VfD E41 |	Taxi exchanges that if only we could see a brown, that's further a little bit or a little smile, perhaps we would have gotten more clearly
EDL	00:16:33,580	00:16:36,570	| media/VfD E41 |	What are conversing partner, we're trying to. 
EDL	00:16:36,920	00:16:39,970	| media/VfD E41 |	That she said it was so busy being sarcastic or funny is that. 
EDL	00:16:39,970	00:16:41,370	| media/VfD E41 |	Hello, everybody
EDL	00:16:41,370	00:16:43,050	| media/VfD E41 |	And so how would this actually happen
EDL	00:16:43,050	00:16:46,460	| media/VfD E41 |	It sounds to me like then a computer would have a camera and watch me
EDL	00:16:46,460	00:16:53,275	| media/VfD E41 |	And then there be in a some system that would see these various parts of my face in different ways, or what my hands are doing
EDL	00:16:53,275	00:16:53,475	| media/VfD E41 |	it
EDL	00:16:53,475	00:16:57,660	| media/VfD E41 |	We've then incorporate that into its interpretation of the communication. 
EDL	00:16:58,100	00:17:05,047	| media/VfD E41 |	Gets exactly right, so we to them that we've got a camera that can see the human and a microphone says, you can hear them
EDL	00:17:05,047	00:17:08,277	| media/VfD E41 |	And what are things we discovered is it has to be too way
EDL	00:17:08,277	00:17:15,438	| media/VfD E41 |	So we also put up the screen with an editor that is the computer, because it's not just enough of the computer to recognize your gestures
EDL	00:17:15,438	00:17:19,629	| media/VfD E41 |	You have to recognise the computer gestures between the computer has suggestion
EDL	00:17:19,629	00:17:22,074	| media/VfD E41 |	So what happens if you got camera in a microphone
EDL	00:17:22,074	00:17:23,684	| media/VfD E41 |	That's what you knew listening to you
EDL	00:17:23,684	00:17:29,156	| media/VfD E41 |	Meanwhile, you're also looking at the computer and listen to the computer so you can have a genuine two way conversation
EDL	00:17:29,156	00:17:33,180	| media/VfD E41 |	But the interesting thing is, in all these, advertisers have to have facial expression
EDL	00:17:33,530	00:17:34,780	| media/VfD E41 |	They have to just share
EDL	00:17:35,360	00:17:43,520	| media/VfD E41 |	They have to pass in a procedure in their voice, and all those things turned out that if you do them wrong, it's actually destructed
EDL	00:17:43,520	00:17:50,580	| media/VfD E41 |	But if you do them right, it adds a tremendous amount of conversations before I came to diagram as working on this project is performer
EDL	00:17:50,910	00:17:54,220	| media/VfD E41 |	We had to set up in the lab with a pile blocks in you in the computer
EDL	00:17:54,220	00:18:00,885	| media/VfD E41 |	We joined to build something, and we would bring students in, and we bring, and sometimes even like bicycle students
EDL	00:18:00,885	00:18:03,720	| media/VfD E41 |	And our problems, we couldn't get them to leave the lab
EDL	00:18:03,720	00:18:07,650	| media/VfD E41 |	They had so much fun talking to the computer and interacting with the computer. 
EDL	00:18:07,650	00:18:08,880	| media/VfD E41 |	That they just do not go home
EDL	00:18:09,280	00:18:16,800	| media/VfD E41 |	Now he would accumulate the furthest progress that a performer, one of the research, certainly program has gone the furthest, had gone. 
EDL	00:18:16,800	00:18:18,363	| media/VfD E41 |	How would you describe that
EDL	00:18:18,363	00:18:21,880	| media/VfD E41 |	I would alter your questions by the inside on the kitty too
EDL	00:18:22,520	00:18:31,220	| media/VfD E41 |	What if it is the system for, for building blocks where people woke up, and it's looking at your body, just shows it immediately knows for considerable things
EDL	00:18:31,220	00:18:34,130	| media/VfD E41 |	It knows when you are interacting with it when you talking to someone else in
EDL	00:18:35,120	00:18:36,170	| media/VfD E41 |	But where are you looking
EDL	00:18:36,750	00:18:47,060	| media/VfD E41 |	What do you say, you wear your standing and you can do physical tasks with that like the little things on the box to the other thing that we did is there is a system at the stevens institute
EDL	00:18:47,060	00:18:59,740	| media/VfD E41 |	This system does interactive jazz in provincial, so you, you have jazz musician who starts in improvising, and then the system picks up and picks over for a bit neat, starts in private
EDL	00:18:59,740	00:19:06,493	| media/VfD E41 |	And they asked that the league backing forth, creating in private, national jazz pieces, and it's been really impressive watching them do this
EDL	00:19:06,493	00:19:10,620	| media/VfD E41 |	I don't didn't concert, but not a number of venues, and it's been really impressed. 
EDL	00:19:10,620	00:19:18,379	| media/VfD E41 |	Okay, then bringing those sort of applications back to what I guess the mission of double it is a day in the front of that defensive
EDL	00:19:18,379	00:19:27,720	| media/VfD E41 |	Can you just sort of take me through a scenario, the communicate with a computer in as much more human human festival will help me in a better future situation. 
EDL	00:19:28,180	00:19:40,167	| media/VfD E41 |	Well, you know, I think one of the biggest areas here is, if you think about the intelligence clearly and military intelligence, military intelligence is based on lots and lots of tiny pieces of information
EDL	00:19:40,167	00:19:54,800	| media/VfD E41 |	And the promise is no one person cleaning to read the more until the idea is, you can put all the information to a program, and then have the commanders who are planning the mission, talk to that program to find out what, but it knows which relevant to the current task
EDL	00:19:54,800	00:20:02,240	| media/VfD E41 |	So it is really important for things like military planning, or you wanted to incorporate the a diversity of information sources. 
EDL	00:20:02,240	00:20:05,670	| media/VfD E41 |	Okay, and so I wanted to move to another one of your programs
EDL	00:20:05,670	00:20:14,498	| media/VfD E41 |	You've got quite a portfolio that I think is related to this, in the sense that is really at making computers better communicators, better learners
EDL	00:20:14,498	00:20:33,430	| media/VfD E41 |	In fact, that words in the title of this one, learning with less labelling and the way accelerate on the website is described, the program aims to make the process of training, machine learning models more efficient by reducing the amount of label the data required to build a model by six orders or more of magnitude
EDL	00:20:33,430	00:20:46,380	| media/VfD E41 |	Select a million for the more, and by reducing the amount of data needed to adapt models to new environment to tens to hundreds of labeled examples, I guess, is supposed of many, many more examples it takes and training
EDL	00:20:46,380	00:20:51,050	| media/VfD E41 |	I've said all the things, but tell me, what is the goal that programme and satisfied? 
EDL	00:20:51,050	00:20:54,451	| media/VfD E41 |	First of all, about the state of the art in the moment
EDL	00:20:54,451	00:21:10,650	| media/VfD E41 |	So the state of the air in the eyes, we have a really good systems, for example, that we have a lot due computer vision that can recognize objects, very useful skill, but the systems are typically trained on maybe one hundred million images, and is part of that training
EDL	00:21:10,650	00:21:17,647	| media/VfD E41 |	Someone had to identify what each one of those hundred million images was that we've been by a label by temperatures
EDL	00:21:17,647	00:21:20,403	| media/VfD E41 |	Go in and buy him and say, you know, this is a cat
EDL	00:21:20,403	00:21:24,172	| media/VfD E41 |	This is a, yeah, is it a lot of labour and that a lot of labour
EDL	00:21:24,172	00:21:35,326	| media/VfD E41 |	It turns out that the natural language processing, where we've been also europe, and because understanding in generating english with this also been tremendous brakes, who is recently the scales even bigger
EDL	00:21:35,326	00:21:37,826	| media/VfD E41 |	Basically, people are turning on the internet
EDL	00:21:37,826	00:21:46,357	| media/VfD E41 |	They're using billions of input samples, but it's really hard to get that much training data labeled for our data unlabeled disease
EDL	00:21:46,357	00:21:59,263	| media/VfD E41 |	But getting that let me labels is very, very expensive, very, very timely, and frankly, in a lot of circumstances, it's not feasible at in the military circumstance, you might have sensitive data
EDL	00:21:59,263	00:22:03,202	| media/VfD E41 |	You can show it people who get that many labourers, or you don't have the time
EDL	00:22:03,202	00:22:08,606	| media/VfD E41 |	Maybe it's not a sensitive, but you need to answer tomorrow, it's going to take your year to label
EDL	00:22:08,606	00:22:10,407	| media/VfD E41 |	So we have to get an assistance
EDL	00:22:10,407	00:22:22,854	| media/VfD E41 |	I can learn not solving on the basis of tens of millions of samples are billions of samples, but on a handful of samples, saying systems that can learn from a very small certainty that the goal, this program is
EDL	00:22:22,854	00:22:28,230	| media/VfD E41 |	He said, our goal is to reduce the amount of training by a factory of the new year. 
EDL	00:22:29,060	00:22:38,014	| media/VfD E41 |	In some ways, it sounds like you're trying to make computers aids as smartest children, where it doesn't take nearly that many examples
EDL	00:22:38,014	00:22:51,370	| media/VfD E41 |	You know, when you, once they get the idea that something some kind of creature out there is a creatures in using the system of dogs, and that's a dog once they get, apparently takes three or four examples, prevent to learn what scholarly. 
EDL	00:22:51,370	00:22:55,770	| media/VfD E41 |	Or or even less than that, children are amazing, and AI is not in a reluctant level
EDL	00:22:55,770	00:22:58,449	| media/VfD E41 |	Children and children learn just amazingly fast
EDL	00:22:58,449	00:23:00,198	| media/VfD E41 |	But we do want to get to go in
EDL	00:23:00,198	00:23:01,988	| media/VfD E41 |	My children were two and three
EDL	00:23:01,988	00:23:06,562	| media/VfD E41 |	There is this annoying stage, and they're constantly asking you what everything is
EDL	00:23:06,562	00:23:09,346	| media/VfD E41 |	What's this, what's this, but it is, think about it
EDL	00:23:09,346	00:23:19,357	| media/VfD E41 |	The number of times they asked for any single logic really smile, so they learned very, very quickly and as well in the resembles, and we would like to be able to to get there
EDL	00:23:19,357	00:23:21,547	| media/VfD E41 |	The obvious promise is no free lunch
EDL	00:23:21,547	00:23:31,524	| media/VfD E41 |	The system works really well, because it got all of these data and what we want to do is, is, say, okay, then we have to pull that information from somewhere else
EDL	00:23:31,524	00:23:41,670	| media/VfD E41 |	Some of the techniques to think of ecological transfer learning, which says, okay, I've never solved this problem, but I've learned the system to do something similar
EDL	00:23:42,100	00:24:11,100	| media/VfD E41 |	Can I pull that knowledge over, right, we have when we call sales, supervise learning where you make a task with your data that, you know, the answer for, like you've rotated some amount, and then the system has to learn how much you rotate it, because you have the answer for that, right, and so you can do themselves football systems and the really exciting, cutting edge are what we refer to as few shot learning systems, or even zero shot learning systems
EDL	00:24:11,100	00:24:18,910	| media/VfD E41 |	Or you learn on either you a small number of examples, or one example, or a few cases, even zero examples. 
EDL	00:24:19,250	00:24:21,370	| media/VfD E41 |	How can you learn on zero examples? 
EDL	00:24:21,370	00:24:31,580	| media/VfD E41 |	Glad you asked, so I am willing to bet that that you, in your listeners or responsibility to do not know what a crack it is. 
EDL	00:24:31,580	00:24:33,170	| media/VfD E41 |	Cool, I go to the. 
EDL	00:24:33,170	00:24:35,210	| media/VfD E41 |	But it is a great rebel world
EDL	00:24:35,210	00:24:38,067	| media/VfD E41 |	It is a great wild world to achieve enthusiasm
EDL	00:24:38,067	00:24:39,292	| media/VfD E41 |	But now here is a foot
EDL	00:24:39,292	00:24:45,390	| media/VfD E41 |	If I did, you want to pictures and say, find the quarter, you be able to consider what the quarter looks like
EDL	00:24:45,390	00:24:53,050	| media/VfD E41 |	But now let me tell you something, a quarter is a subspecies of zebra that only has straights on a half of its party
EDL	00:24:53,050	00:25:00,000	| media/VfD E41 |	That sentence alone with what you already know about, what zebra is look like is enough to recognize. 
EDL	00:25:00,000	00:25:03,200	| media/VfD E41 |	God, I love it, zero examples, but, but you give me the context
EDL	00:25:03,200	00:25:04,600	| media/VfD E41 |	You give me a definition
EDL	00:25:04,600	00:25:08,800	| media/VfD E41 |	I just wonder, because you brought a language acquisition of your own kids
EDL	00:25:08,800	00:25:25,700	| media/VfD E41 |	And I was delighted to witnessing two boys acquire language, and it is often by the question in what is this is that exactly part of your overall program, which is to say, they're teach computers to know when they should a human partner
EDL	00:25:25,700	00:25:26,880	| media/VfD E41 |	What something is that? 
EDL	00:25:26,880	00:25:33,700	| media/VfD E41 |	Yes, a financial effect, the buzz word for that is active learning, where you give the data system or open your own label data
EDL	00:25:33,700	00:25:36,090	| media/VfD E41 |	It continues to tell me what this one is. 
EDL	00:25:37,170	00:25:41,140	| media/VfD E41 |	So bruce, let's just talk about one more program
EDL	00:25:41,140	00:25:47,570	| media/VfD E41 |	And this one is one of your own design congratulatory, because it was just accepted
EDL	00:25:47,570	00:25:50,360	| media/VfD E41 |	Got a green light from a leadership at DARPAer
EDL	00:25:50,360	00:25:57,090	| media/VfD E41 |	This is perceptually enabled the task guidance, and because it is new, you can really talk about any results yet
EDL	00:25:57,090	00:25:59,740	| media/VfD E41 |	But just what, what's the basic idea of this program? 
EDL	00:26:00,330	00:26:11,370	| media/VfD E41 |	The basic idea this program is thought of thinking about assistance we have now, like syria or alexa, by the way, syria came out of the DARPA program fifteen years
EDL	00:26:12,320	00:26:13,291	| media/VfD E41 |	Seriously, right
EDL	00:26:13,291	00:26:14,652	| media/VfD E41 |	Where are you using it
EDL	00:26:14,652	00:26:19,900	| media/VfD E41 |	But it can be very frustrated, fearing the middle of building something and say, say, what should I
EDL	00:26:20,500	00:26:36,610	| media/VfD E41 |	Her answer is, the world is full of possibilities, because, of course, you have no idea what you do, and you can see what you do when you do that in context for that, we want to do is create the sort of assistance or agents AI systems that have their politics
EDL	00:26:36,940	00:27:00,030	| media/VfD E41 |	So in the future, threatening the military context, pretty much everybody's walking sense of pretty much everyone is gonna camera, pretty much everyone's gotta microphone on them, and more and more will be having augmented reality so that they will have screens that we know they can drive down further eyes and show them and talk to them to get this great possibility for air
EDL	00:27:00,030	00:27:09,730	| media/VfD E41 |	I've got all this input cameras until you see my reference here, you hear an augmented reality to display things for you and give you information
EDL	00:27:10,080	00:27:16,310	| media/VfD E41 |	What we need is in the middle is an assistant that would you start to do some tasks
EDL	00:27:16,700	00:27:27,360	| media/VfD E41 |	So maybe you're an airplane mechanic and your plane, and you're fixing the breaks on an airplane right as you start, that recognizes what you doing is read the manual
EDL	00:27:27,690	00:27:36,290	| media/VfD E41 |	It knows what you should do if you make a mistake, it warns you, if you forget what to do next, you can to say, hey, what are you, and it will tell you
EDL	00:27:36,290	00:27:44,180	| media/VfD E41 |	And in an emergency situation, or maybe you are not a mechanic, but you have to fix this break right then it goes
EDL	00:27:44,180	00:27:46,580	| media/VfD E41 |	Okay, you have done this before, and you walk you through it
EDL	00:27:46,580	00:27:59,090	| media/VfD E41 |	But doing that, I can help people do physical tasks, and, but in a way that makes them more efficient, have fewer mistakes and allows them to do a wider range of tasks than they currently can today
EDL	00:27:59,090	00:28:00,000	| media/VfD E41 |	Where am it? 
EDL	00:28:00,000	00:28:08,561	| media/VfD E41 |	Think it sounds like it builds on just started against a lot of low technique, lots of professionals to use, which is literally a checklist right again
EDL	00:28:08,561	00:28:11,630	| media/VfD E41 |	And another happens with some pilots around their planes
EDL	00:28:11,630	00:28:20,050	| media/VfD E41 |	You know, some doctors actually use checklists, and in some ways, it sounds like this is just taking this to a new and maybe more generalized label. 
EDL	00:28:20,610	00:28:24,309	| media/VfD E41 |	But I tried to double pull the lower of wind
EDL	00:28:24,309	00:28:34,827	| media/VfD E41 |	Checklists were introduced in the surgery would only happen in common practice in the late nineties, early two thousands, the mortality rate dropped by over forty five percent
EDL	00:28:34,827	00:28:48,750	| media/VfD E41 |	The chocolate stop people from, and now you go even one step further, right, and you have the system that watching you do things, and you can see when you make a stake, and you can warn you, and it can help you if you forget what to do
EDL	00:28:50,030	00:28:51,520	| media/VfD E41 |	It's sorry if they do it yourself
EDL	00:28:51,520	00:28:52,570	| media/VfD E41 |	Revolution on story. 
EDL	00:28:53,330	00:28:57,810	| media/VfD E41 |	Okay, we have just converted me to checklist, so I think I'm going to bring those into my life now
EDL	00:28:58,380	00:29:08,350	| media/VfD E41 |	So now, before we run at a time, I just wanted to give you an opportunity to stand back and share some bigger picture, views about computer science and air
EDL	00:29:08,350	00:29:09,760	| media/VfD E41 |	I mean, this is something amazing
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:15,060	| media/VfD E41 |	A doctor, so many program managers are working and really powerful technology can have double edges
EDL	00:29:15,060	00:29:15,290	| media/VfD E41 |	right
EDL	00:29:15,290	00:29:22,020	| media/VfD E41 |	So I am interested in what excites you about current trends and future possibilities in these areas
EDL	00:29:22,020	00:29:30,020	| media/VfD E41 |	And what sorts of unintended parallels consequences were you and sort of you are the things that you want to do, you don't disappoint. 
EDL	00:29:30,430	00:29:31,600	| media/VfD E41 |	But we started off the exciting set
EDL	00:29:31,600	00:29:42,243	| media/VfD E41 |	There is a lot of really exciting things going on, one of which is a notion that perception, whether it's sufficient speech, whatever it could be tackled, whatever
EDL	00:29:42,243	00:29:51,900	| media/VfD E41 |	But perception is coming together with intelligence, we have these AI programs that that are purely logical to do things like medical diagnosis
EDL	00:29:51,900	00:30:01,020	| media/VfD E41 |	Three years now, we've got it, our purposes I can see in here and putting those two things together, putting intelligence exception together
EDL	00:30:01,350	00:30:05,050	| media/VfD E41 |	I think it's going to create all kinds of really. 
EDL	00:30:05,050	00:30:06,338	| media/VfD E41 |	Exciting possibilities
EDL	00:30:06,338	00:30:07,811	| media/VfD E41 |	So just get concrete with me
EDL	00:30:07,811	00:30:10,021	| media/VfD E41 |	You know, it was wonderful examples there
EDL	00:30:10,021	00:30:13,520	| media/VfD E41 |	What, when you say it's going to be really exciting, what happens to your? 
EDL	00:30:13,520	00:30:15,128	| media/VfD E41 |	But one of them is a struggle
EDL	00:30:15,128	00:30:17,630	| media/VfD E41 |	I just described where something can be solved
EDL	00:30:17,630	00:30:21,561	| media/VfD E41 |	The second strategies, constantly looking over your children, helping you do things
EDL	00:30:21,561	00:30:23,170	| media/VfD E41 |	But I would like to go further
EDL	00:30:23,170	00:30:24,600	| media/VfD E41 |	I would love to have a child
EDL	00:30:24,600	00:30:29,091	| media/VfD E41 |	Imagine this is an eye program almost as a partner that with you all the time
EDL	00:30:29,091	00:30:38,100	| media/VfD E41 |	I really bad and remembering people's names when I meet them, and I would just love to walk into a, and I see that face that I know is so familiar
EDL	00:30:38,100	00:30:41,610	| media/VfD E41 |	And this little bugging my ear says, oh, that's jane
EDL	00:30:41,610	00:30:43,250	| media/VfD E41 |	You met her last year at TVP. 
EDL	00:30:43,565	00:30:48,707	| media/VfD E41 |	Yeah, no, I am really, really bad with the names, danny growth, but and so what
EDL	00:30:48,707	00:30:56,060	| media/VfD E41 |	What about the others like, you know that I looked at you in the question, which is you think that does essentially keep. 
EDL	00:30:56,060	00:31:06,900	| media/VfD E41 |	But night, well, one of the things that could, that, I think, considered a lot of people list is privacy as we have more and more systems, more and more sensors are just that, you know, a system looking over your shoulder
EDL	00:31:07,260	00:31:08,630	| media/VfD E41 |	You don't want that to be crazy
EDL	00:31:08,960	00:31:12,970	| media/VfD E41 |	Do we still have privacy and how to set work in this model
EDL	00:31:12,970	00:31:27,490	| media/VfD E41 |	And I think I am trying to push toward what I hope is the solution there, because right now, A, Itend to be these big systems trained on billions of examples that had been sucked up from all over the place
EDL	00:31:27,490	00:31:31,640	| media/VfD E41 |	But there are there many people that have access to the machinery, and they dated to make this
EDL	00:31:31,640	00:31:44,910	| media/VfD E41 |	All, I think that what happening is, as we get better at AI, as we learn on fuel samples, and as we all become towards changing platforms, it began to the opportunity for much more personalize
EDL	00:31:45,320	00:31:53,060	| media/VfD E41 |	So I got my assistant is helping me do my task, but that's all my data information back to me
EDL	00:31:53,060	00:31:58,870	| media/VfD E41 |	Nothing going off to a central weapon is a very good that, you know, this notion of a personalized day
EDL	00:31:58,870	00:32:05,580	| media/VfD E41 |	I, Ithink we, something that we can trust and enjoy working with much more than something that is his centralized. 
EDL	00:32:06,650	00:32:10,220	| media/VfD E41 |	In its first name, one other area of concern that comes to my mind
EDL	00:32:10,220	00:32:29,110	| media/VfD E41 |	You know what we've been hearing about it in the news, a little bit more in recent years is just how biases get built into the system is, partly as because of whatever datasets are used for learning and other examples, facial recognition programs that are more error program when it comes to faces of color than, say, occasion, faces that kind of by us being though
EDL	00:32:29,110	00:32:30,960	| media/VfD E41 |	What do you think about those kind of? 
EDL	00:32:30,960	00:32:35,979	| media/VfD E41 |	You know, the attitude issues, first and foremost, the real, I doubt a lot of work in face recognition
EDL	00:32:35,979	00:32:42,400	| media/VfD E41 |	If you don't train it very carefully, you do good boys, and there is all kinds of other examples, banking records, other things
EDL	00:32:42,400	00:32:45,290	| media/VfD E41 |	It's a very really human wonder, has to be dealt with
EDL	00:32:45,860	00:32:50,880	| media/VfD E41 |	That said, I had a colleague who really changed by thinking on it one day
EDL	00:32:50,880	00:33:03,520	| media/VfD E41 |	This is a colleague in the business school who was worried about bias, and he was looking at an air system that had been trained on historical records in the head, absorbed the biases of those records
EDL	00:33:03,520	00:33:11,410	| media/VfD E41 |	And he said, in other provinces to miss biased, li said, yes, he said, but the opportunity is the system can be fixed
EDL	00:33:12,420	00:33:17,090	| media/VfD E41 |	It's really hard to get biased out of social organizations
EDL	00:33:17,390	00:33:21,850	| media/VfD E41 |	It's easier, right as hard as it is, as much as important, promise it
EDL	00:33:21,850	00:33:26,030	| media/VfD E41 |	It's potentially easier to get it out of technical systems that out of social ones. 
EDL	00:33:26,030	00:33:34,656	| media/VfD E41 |	I presume, as we become more aware of these issues and what the technical bases are underlying them that we will actually get better at creating systems
EDL	00:33:34,656	00:33:35,890	| media/VfD E41 |	I don't have the bike. 
EDL	00:33:35,890	00:33:41,560	| media/VfD E41 |	Races to begin with, that's right, and it's actually wrapped a little bit back to the first program
EDL	00:33:41,560	00:33:51,503	| media/VfD E41 |	We talk about this guard, because one of the ways you can think of what an angel series doing when they full your system, is there taking advantage of the biases you didn't recognize
EDL	00:33:51,503	00:33:56,330	| media/VfD E41 |	And that if we buy systems that we can trust that are reliable, that are defensible. 
EDL	00:33:56,330	00:33:58,210	| media/VfD E41 |	They will also be less biased
EDL	00:33:58,640	00:34:01,441	| media/VfD E41 |	Okay, it seems like pending against the sessions
EDL	00:34:01,441	00:34:05,043	| media/VfD E41 |	We can play on ourselves, that alone adversaries perpetrating on us
EDL	00:34:05,043	00:34:05,944	| media/VfD E41 |	So says, needing, okay
EDL	00:34:05,944	00:34:13,330	| media/VfD E41 |	So one more question as young here and asked that, you know, what is the question that I thought you were expecting me to ask that I didn't answer about. 
EDL	00:34:13,760	00:34:25,220	| media/VfD E41 |	To me, I think one of the things that worries me is the rate of technological change is increasing, and it's fun for building better and better technologies that do greater and greater things for
EDL	00:34:25,990	00:34:32,050	| media/VfD E41 |	But the same level, it is hard as individuals to handle that kind of rate of change
EDL	00:34:32,050	00:34:44,830	| media/VfD E41 |	The older I get more worried about him, and it's really so that we have to find ways to help these machines help us, because the worlders is expanding rapidly at its fun
EDL	00:34:44,830	00:34:52,280	| media/VfD E41 |	And there's all kinds of opportunities there, but it's also hard as an individual to keep up with and figuring out how we all people who said. 
EDL	00:34:52,740	00:35:08,948	| media/VfD E41 |	If one of the great challenges that was a really fun conversation, bruce is one of thank you for taking me on the store with at least some of what is going to take, move forward with AI, you know, with our eyes wide open and your work and source of invasion is going to take to lean the balance to our day
EDL	00:35:08,948	00:35:12,570	| media/VfD E41 |	I feel safe and constructive versus paralysis and destructive
EDL	00:35:12,570	00:35:17,460	| media/VfD E41 |	So thanks for lending me and our listeners your time and expertise
EDL	00:35:17,880	00:35:21,540	| media/VfD E41 |	Glad to do it, and thanks listeners for sharing this time with us
EDL	00:35:21,840	00:35:30,550	| media/VfD E41 |	I hope you join this again for the next Voices from german, thanks also to bend selection for his partnership in producing this program
EDL	00:35:32,210	00:35:41,232	| media/VfD E41 |	For more information about blue stripper, the programs he runs in agency's information invasion office, and the other breaks with technologies DARPA is working on
