EDL	00:01:34,464	00:01:38,560	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Growing up in that led you in the kinds of engineering direction that you have take
EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:43,424	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Yeah sure so I grew up in a small town in West Virginia Weston West Virginia to be
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:44,704	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Exact
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:46,752	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	When I was in high school
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:48,032	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Had exhausted
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:49,824	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	At the math classes that were
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:56,224	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Available at my local high school so I ended up going part-time to West Virginia Wesleyan College and they said have kind of a class for men
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:56,992	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Any students from my high school
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:58,272	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Go do that especially

EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:02,112	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:05,696	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	For that always been good at math but I didn't ever really knew how to apply it
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:12,096	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I figured I would go into medicine or something of that nature and it's part of that special class they set up for us
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:13,120	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The first half hour
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:15,680	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Professor McBride would come in
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:17,728	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And he was an engineering physicist
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:21,312	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And he would come in and relate all of the calculus we were learning
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:22,336	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	To physics problem
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:24,384	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And I just found that fascinate
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:27,712	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That was a junior in high school and from that point forward
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:28,480	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I wanted to
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:35,648	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So I'd like to hear a little bit about the base of your career where you really worked a lot on memes and again that's dance for me

EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:42,304	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I know you did that even before going to asendia to talk a little bit about that whole love memes
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:48,960	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	In graduate school at the University of Michigan I work for Professor Ken wise who's one of the founders
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:50,240	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Love memes
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:51,776	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	There I worked on
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:54,080	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Analog interfaces for neural recording
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:57,920	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So I was developing integrated circuits to be able to
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:02:58,688	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Record
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:00,736	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Neural Action potentials from the brain
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:02,272	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	For doing things like

EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:10,976	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The things in the stimulation sense
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:11,744	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Like blindness or
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:13,024	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Hearing loss
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:21,728	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I didn't went to Sandia National Laboratories where I switch things a little bit of Michigan I was designing circuit interfaces for Mims
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:22,496	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:25,312	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	At Sandia I started actually designing the mems
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,080	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Components myself
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:28,640	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I let a team of people designing and
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:31,200	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Implementing those primarily
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:33,248	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We were working on small a
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:34,272	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Acoustic devices
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:36,320	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	You may not know that in your
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:42,464	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Phone and RF signal is immediately converted into an acoustic signal biography
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:48,864	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I mean radio frequency the radio frequency signal which has a really long wavelength is
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:54,240	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Converted into a acoustic signal which is a very small wavelength which allows you to
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:56,544	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Filter it in a small form factor before it's
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:58,080	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Creed turn back into an electric
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:02,176	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Comment so I was working on technologies that
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:04,992	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Do that function but more for Department of
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:06,016	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Defense Apple
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,296	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Locations rather than
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:08,064	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Cellular phones
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:10,624	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Also worked on other things that really at the interface
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:14,464	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Vibrational systems and acoustic systems analyst
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:18,303	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Brighten and what was the pathway from Sandia
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:19,327	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	To DARPA
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:24,191	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I was a performer doing a lot of the research on those small acoustic Wireless components
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:29,055	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Bill Chappell the current director of the Microsystems technology office
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:32,895	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Was my program manager and so when he was promoted to you
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:36,223	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Called me out of the blue one day I think that was in March of
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:38,271	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	2014 and said
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:39,807	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Hey Troy this is Bill Chappell
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:44,415	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	How would you like to come the DARPA to be a program manager I think you'd be great at it
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:45,951	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Heading to I shared an office
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:46,719	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	For somebody so that was
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:50,047	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Strange conversation
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:51,071	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Yeah that the
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:54,399	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That sounds like a great opportunity can I call you back in a few minutes
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:05:01,823	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And is that that's all it took for you just a few minutes and then you knew what your decision would be after that
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:04,639	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I mean anybody who gets an opportunity to come in
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:05,151	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The DARPA
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:06,175	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Fantastic
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:08,223	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Opportunity of course I had to come
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:10,783	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Interview and put together
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:14,367	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I tok that outline the programs I would start I had to come in
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:17,183	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Have you with the office director but how it all started was from a phone
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:25,119	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Speaking about those programs we're going to dive into talking about a number of those you have a very large portfolio larger than most
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:27,935	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Program manager that will only talk about a few but they're too
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:33,567	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Questions I want to ask you before we do that one has to do with your name Troy I call you Troy
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:38,431	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	But your official name is Roy and I'm just wondering if you could tell us
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:39,711	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The story of your name
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:42,271	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Nasso my official name is Roy Harold Olson
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:43,039	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The 3rd
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:45,087	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Turns out my dad really wanted me to
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:46,111	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	To be named after him he's
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:47,391	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Harold Olson
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:52,767	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	My mom wasn't the biggest fan of the name Roy so they made a deal
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:57,887	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I could be named Roy Harold Olson the third and everyone would call me Troy
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,423	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And apparently I
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:00,959	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Reinforce this
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:02,239	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	When I was a small child
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:08,895	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	As Legend has it I would sit in my high chair and if people called me Roy I would throw green beans at them
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:09,919	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Impound on the high chair
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:13,759	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Nothing like negative reinforcement
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:15,807	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	What's a move on to just some of your program
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:22,463	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Associate with one another we can talk about them together go by the short names of Icarus and Vapor
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:26,815	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Speaker stands for inbound controlled air releasable
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:28,607	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Unrecoverable systems
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:31,167	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And Vapor stands for Vanishing
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:32,703	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Programmable resources
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:34,751	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I know the vapor paint before Icarus
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:35,519	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So up
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:39,615	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Why don't you tell us a little bit about the vapor Icarus story I which is an ongoing one
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:40,127	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Yasso
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:44,735	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	In the Department of Defense a lot of times we have problems with electronic leave behind
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:49,343	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We don't want to leave things on the battlefield where other people might collect them
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,111	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:56,511	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We came up with the vapor program which is a Vanishing micro-electronics program it's designed to be able to
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:57,535	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	To make micro Electronics
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:07:00,095	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That have reliability and
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:00,863	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Performance
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:01,887	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Commiserate with
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:04,959	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Was commercial off-the-shelf electronic components that don't vanish
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:06,239	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	But that
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:09,311	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	When we want them to can rapidly
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:10,335	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Vanish
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:12,639	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	A&B invisible to the name
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:15,967	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Okay and you meet when you say vanish in the most people just think of
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:18,015	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	It's gone
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:24,415	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Talk to me a little bit about the kind of technical Pathways some of your performers which is to say the research groups who have been worth
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:28,511	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Working on this the kinds of Pathways they're taking to try to realize this idea vanish ability of
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:35,423	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Yes it is really two approaches that have been really prominent in the vapor program I one was developed by the pallet
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:36,703	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	All the research center Park
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:37,727	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And it is
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:42,079	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Vanishing glass substrate that basically turns into dust
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:43,103	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Like particles
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:47,967	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And that glass can be bonded to integrated circuits and other things and causing and tires
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:49,759	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	To vanish
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:53,087	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Mumbai dust like particles the particles are on
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:56,159	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Order size of 100 microns which is about the width
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:58,975	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So those ones
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:01,535	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Vanish to the naked eye but the material itself
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:03,839	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Physically
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,631	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Completely vanish
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:08,191	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We did develop a material that
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:09,983	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That does that there was work done there at
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:10,751	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	At the University of
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:12,031	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Illinois and Georgia
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:13,823	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Protec and Cornell
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:15,871	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Many of those materials
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:17,663	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Working a way where there
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:21,503	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Thermally unstable at room temperature they like to be a monomer or bepis
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:22,783	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Gas
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:26,879	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Actually make them at very cold temperatures they like - 50 degrees C
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:29,951	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Annie's Casey's Banshee materials are polymers
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:33,023	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I would like to make a really long polymer chain to get high middle
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:33,791	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Molecular weight
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:35,583	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Makes the polymer really tough
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:41,727	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And then we link it in a certain way at the very cold temperatures so that we will raise it up and temperature it remains
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:45,567	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Then in that material will embed
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:46,335	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Something that
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:52,479	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	It's called either a photo acid generator or a thermal acid generator and that works just like you might expect
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:54,015	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	It does when you put a trigger
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:56,319	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	When you expose it to a certain wavelength of light
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:57,599	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Tell photoacid generator
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:58,879	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Creates an acid
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:06,303	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	If you take the thermal as a generator and exceed a certain temperature it also creates an acid that acid can break
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:10,655	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	One of the bonds between the polymer chains
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:12,959	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And at that point
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:17,311	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Then it becomes thermally unstable at room temperature again and the rest of it
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,335	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Just vanishes
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,871	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And by vanishes it take
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:21,919	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Turns from a solid
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:23,199	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Directly into a gas
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:25,759	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Mentally disadvantaged right
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:26,527	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Before your eyes
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:28,319	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The first time you see it it's
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:29,087	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Truly amazed
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:35,231	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Is actually the second time you see it a truly amazing at everything is amazing and clever
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:37,279	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Chemistry to bring into the capability of
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:38,303	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Advanced Materials
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:42,911	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And this step the program was successful enough in your eyes that you created a follow-on program
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:44,703	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That's correct so
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:46,495	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We were brainstorming one day
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:48,543	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	What else Beyond microelectronic
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:49,823	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Could we do with these material
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:53,151	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We were thinking where else could we push this materials
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:54,943	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	What else would
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:10:01,087	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Lead the new fundamental Discovery and developments and could be also at the same time useful
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:04,159	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Department of Defense and we came up with the idea of Vanishing Edge
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:07,743	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	For being able to deliver things
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:12,095	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	In a very precise way into difficult-to-reach locations
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:14,399	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And then not having a leave behind
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:15,679	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That could either
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:17,471	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Destroy the environment
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:17,983	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Or
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:19,519	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Or
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:20,799	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Lead II detection
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:21,567	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Of the deliverer
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:23,359	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And so the Icarus
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:24,895	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Was born
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:28,735	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And that program is currently in Phase 1
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:29,503	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:31,039	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And is developing
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:32,063	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Vanishing
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:32,831	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Are delivery Platt
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:37,951	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Right and I didn't want to be exciting and potential
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:38,719	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Locations for lease
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,487	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Kinds of
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:40,511	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Vehicles would be
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:42,303	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	In sort of Public Health
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:44,863	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Disasters disease outbreaks
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:47,167	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Tell us a little bit about those kinds of humanitarian
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:48,191	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Applications of your
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:53,823	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Absolutely so one of the first things when we started brainstorming about the idea Matt Hepburn who's a program manager
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:56,639	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Started interacting with me introducing me to
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:59,199	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The idea of being able to deliver Medical
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:10:59,711	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Pool supplies used
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:01,247	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Exciting
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:05,599	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Thinking about things where there's been a humanitarian disaster
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:07,391	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And the runways are
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:08,415	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	How destroyed
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:10,463	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Roads are impassable
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:12,511	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	How can I get
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:14,303	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Really critical supplies
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:15,071	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Vaccines
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:17,375	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Blood medications
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:17,887	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Water
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:20,703	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Two locations that need it
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:22,751	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Work needs to be precisely delivered
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:25,823	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And do that in kind of in some cases a massive response
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:28,639	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Without having to worry about
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:30,687	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Going and collecting all of these
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:31,199	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Is air delivery
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:32,223	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	How do I get
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:38,367	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Not only the thing to biodegrade and disappear back into the environment but how do I make the cost low enough
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:40,671	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That you can basically have a glider
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:42,463	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	But you don't care if
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:42,975	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	If you ever go
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:46,559	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	This is an exciting time in the life cycle of
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:50,399	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The program right because I know that in the coming months you're going to move
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:51,167	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Outside
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:52,959	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The glimmer of the eye in front of a laboratory work
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:54,239	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Battered vehicle
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:58,847	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That's correct so we have two things that are going to be coming up that way
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:00,639	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Will conclude phase one of the program
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:02,943	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	A1 is a flight test
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:06,271	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Launching from 35000 Ft
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:11,647	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Showing a range of 150 km and Landing with 10 m of accuracy
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:14,975	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And doing that with a material surrogate
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:17,279	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So the glider is made out of a material that has
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:24,447	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	As exact as possible the same material properties as the vanishing material and the same
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:25,215	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Factoring process
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:26,239	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	These were trying to test out
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:28,287	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Can we actually meet
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:31,103	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	These flight profiles
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:33,663	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Using something within the constraints
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:35,711	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Some of the material properties in manufacturing
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:36,991	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Ava Vanishing with
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:42,111	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	At the same time we are also building a non flying
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:44,671	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Demonstration
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:46,207	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Of the vanishing
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:50,815	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Material for example we might build not instead of a full airplane
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:51,839	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Just the wing of an air
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:57,471	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Build that out of the vanishing material and show that we can actually construct a
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:13:00,543	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	A complex structure from the vanishing materials
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:04,639	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And then one year after those flight test we will do
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:07,455	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	A flight test of the actual Vanishing
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:07,967	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Air delivery
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:11,295	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Alright well I will be excited to
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:13,855	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Keep track of that and we'll applaud with you when we
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:16,415	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We see our first vehicle do a job and then
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:21,791	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I want to move to another program this one goes by the
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:23,327	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Name in
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:23,839	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	0 which
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:29,471	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Connection with the hour Evermore sensor Layton world and so tell us a little bit about end
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:33,823	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Yes on0 is a program that
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:34,591	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Designed
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:38,943	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	To basically take the internet of things and move it right
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:39,455	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	To the tactic
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:42,783	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So today when we think about the Internet of Things
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:45,343	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	It can't be what we will really want
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:49,183	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We can think about applying it to our refrigerator or
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:51,231	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Toaster maybe our car
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:53,791	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	But we're really limited the things that either can be
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:55,327	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Plugged into the wall
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:57,887	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Or that a human can take in

EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:02,239	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Go everyday or every couple days to recharge
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:04,031	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And that's because
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:09,151	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The Energy Efficiency of our Electronics operating off of small cheap batteries
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:10,175	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Today is not high enough
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:14,271	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	To sit there and monitor the environment all the
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:14,783	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	All the time
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:17,855	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Report back things that it's
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:22,207	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So what we're trying to do in in zero is take out of a new paradigm
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:23,999	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Where we actually look
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:29,631	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Very low power levels are near zero power to me means less than 10 nanowatts
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:31,679	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And I chose that value because that's
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:32,447	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The leakage of a
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:33,471	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Small coin cell battery
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:36,543	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	What we want to do is be able to sit there
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:38,591	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Continuously monitor the environment
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:40,639	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Looking for an event
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:42,431	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That weird

EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:53,183	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	When we see
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:57,023	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So you can imagine what kind of events could those be
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:59,583	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Those could be like
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:03,423	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Augmenting Bridges and infrastructure with these types of sensors
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:04,447	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Looking for

EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:14,431	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	You could imagine putting these throughout the environment we're thinking about augmenting vehicles to be able to look

EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:21,599	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	How you could imagine dispersing the environment and detecting things like

EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:29,279	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Or other things of that nature we were whole class of these types
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:30,815	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The censors looking for

EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:52,575	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	But consume basically stand by type
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:55,391	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Fascinating to think about
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:58,207	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The world becoming an innervated with all kinds
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:00,511	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Our bodies are
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:04,095	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I want to move on now to just one more
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:07,679	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Program this goes by the name amoeba that spelled a.m.
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:08,191	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	EBA
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:11,775	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And the one form of that is a mechanically
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:12,287	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Based
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:17,663	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Antenna and I'm particularly interested in this because I think it reveals sort of the way you
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:20,735	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Apply your engineers mine too
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:22,783	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	This invisible world of
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:24,575	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Of radio frequency signals
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:26,367	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That's all around us
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:27,647	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Talk to us a little bit about
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:29,695	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Okay sure so
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:34,303	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Amoeba kind of comes from my love of looking at problems and
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:40,447	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Thinking about the ways we solve them today and how those are insufficient and if we could just do it this other way
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:45,055	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	It would be so much better but we have some technology that standing in our way
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:50,175	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That's what we're trying to do is be able to communicate from really difficult in fire
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:54,015	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Do you like underground or underwater
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:56,575	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Pour over very long distances
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:57,855	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Without some type of
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:59,135	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Repeater network
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:02,463	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And finish your point out right through ground and through
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:03,231	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Water
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:05,023	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Radio signals do not
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:06,559	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Travel very well for those media
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:07,583	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I would say
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:10,143	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	High frequency radio signals don't travel very wealthy
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:11,423	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Apus media
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:12,703	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:14,751	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The key then it stopped right at low frequency
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:17,055	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And that presents
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:19,615	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	A very significant challenges that the wavelength
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:22,431	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	At low frequencies is extremely long
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:25,759	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And in fact that's the reason that they propagate well through
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:27,295	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Water and ground is because the
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,599	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Very long and
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:33,183	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That allows the signal because of the physics to be able
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:33,951	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Propagate
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:35,999	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Through those media over much larger dementia
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:39,583	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So the way we build antennas today
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:42,399	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We basically push current through wires
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:44,191	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Either kind of straight wires
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:45,215	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	How to build things like Alexa
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:46,751	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Dipole antenna is or
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:48,543	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Do coils and other things
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,311	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:51,103	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	It's very very difficult to
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:53,407	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The produce a significant amount
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:55,711	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Dove in our case magnetic field
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:59,551	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	When the antenna is very electrically small that means small was
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:01,855	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	To the wavelength using those techniques
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:03,903	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Fabulous at higher frequencies
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:06,207	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	But when you get the very low frequencies
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:08,767	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Where you want to make something then in our case
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:10,303	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Would be man-portable
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:10,815	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	It just
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:14,911	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Seems nearly impossible to make an antenna with any type of
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:15,423	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Efficiency
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:21,055	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	At those size scale with the military does have some antenna systems
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:22,335	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That can operate in these
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:25,151	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Low frequencies but they're in Normal
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:26,687	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Yes lyrics either
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:32,831	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The size of Hawaii Islands or counties or sometimes they Traverse States
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:36,159	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	How to communicate these bands in other cases you might
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:43,071	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	You really a very long wire that's a kilometer in length out of an airplane to communicated these free
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:44,095	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Frequencies button
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:47,423	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	In any case the dimensions are very very large
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:49,471	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So it's going to be
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:51,263	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Take a lot of interesting physics
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:52,799	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	To go from
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:54,591	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Something of that size
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:55,103	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Like to a man
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:56,383	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Technology that will
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:57,663	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The same
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:58,943	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	One-way flight
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:01,759	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That's correct and so our Insight was that
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:03,807	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	When we pushing those
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:06,367	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Current through those wires what we're doing is work
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:07,903	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Creating electric and magnetic
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:10,463	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And we're expending energy to create
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:13,791	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I'm in and of course we do that at specific rate
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:14,559	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	To determine the freak
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:21,727	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And what we did was we looked and said well what if we just started with something that actually had a high amount of stored magnetic
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:23,519	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Wakefield for example like a permanent magnet
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:25,311	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And instead of
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:27,103	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Then using our power
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:27,871	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	2
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:28,895	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Create that magnetic
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:31,711	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Mayfield we would take advantage of what Nature has given us
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:32,991	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Which is this
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:34,015	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Permanent magnet
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:36,319	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We've created it and and
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:38,367	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And machine data but it's a
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:39,391	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Natural
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:40,927	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Material phenomenon
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:43,999	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And instead we created the RF frequency by movie
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:46,815	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And then we also had the Insight that
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:50,655	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Moving things mechanically becomes very efficient
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:51,423	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The lowering
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:55,007	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	You go so while I mechanical base Nintendo made
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:56,799	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Be completely inappropriate
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:59,359	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Where your iPhone operates at gigahertz
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:00,127	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Hertz frequency
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:01,663	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	In fact
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:06,015	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	A very appropriate at a kilohertz type frequency to
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:07,295	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Take a magnet
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:08,319	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And spinach
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:10,367	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Or mechanically move it
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:11,903	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	To create an oscillating Magna
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:15,743	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Medic field course magnets aren't the only things that were looking at their other types of
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:17,279	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Materials that
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:18,047	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Store
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:20,351	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	All these types of permanent Fields Electric
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:21,631	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Store
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:24,191	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Electric dipoles and there are there types of
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:26,239	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Materials that are will be looking at in
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:27,007	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The program as well
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:29,567	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Another Insight that we had
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:33,919	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Was that if we just took one really big thing and tried to move it
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:38,527	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That the amount of stored mechanical energy there would be very high and that also would be
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:39,551	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We do a lot of inefficiency
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:44,415	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So one of the really key ideas of the amoeba program is can we break that
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:46,463	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Large thing up into a number of
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:48,255	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Small synchronize things
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:50,815	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That lowers the total stored energy
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:51,583	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And lowers
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:52,095	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The power can
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:53,887	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And the risk
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:55,935	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That we're trying to mitigate is
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:59,775	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Howell smaller pieces can we break it into butt
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:02,591	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Before the interactions between the pieces batik
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:03,615	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Kaley the magnetic intellect
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:04,895	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Interactions
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:05,663	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Queen
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:06,431	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Started
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:07,199	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Dominate
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:07,967	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The overall system
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:11,039	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	You can imagine two magnets that are closed
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:14,367	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Together have a lot of force between them they interact with one another
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:16,416	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The trying to manage and control those interact
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:18,464	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The risky part
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:19,744	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The program that
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:24,608	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Okay if you get utopian and you imagine this program being a
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:26,144	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	How successful do you want to be
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:29,984	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Give us a sense of what additional Communications capabilities
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:30,752	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	It would offer up
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:35,872	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Yeah so this is a low frequency transmitter so you're thinking about things like Voice and text
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:39,968	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So at these types of frequencies is not really possible to do things like
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:40,992	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Video
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:47,392	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	But it would give you a new capability safe from underground if you were a minor
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:49,440	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	To be able to
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:52,000	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Text or do voice to somebody above ground
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:54,560	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Something like a mining accident
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:57,632	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	How you can tell somebody where you are at and you would have that
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:21:58,144	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Type of communication
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:01,216	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Similarly from underwater Maybe
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:04,032	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	50 to 100 m under water
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:05,568	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	One could communicate
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:07,360	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Text from underwater to the surface
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:09,408	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Or to something even flying
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:11,712	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	What's today is
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:12,480	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Is it just not
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:16,064	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And there's one other applications
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:17,088	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	It's quite interesting to me and that's
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:20,672	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The way these low frequencies can travel through the atmos
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:22,208	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	You're an unusual way so that
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:23,744	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Potentially could
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:24,512	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Enable
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:26,560	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	A very long distance communication
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:27,584	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	In between two points
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:29,120	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That's correct so
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:32,192	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	At a slightly higher frequency say around ten kilohertz
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:35,776	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	There's a waveguide this form between the ion has
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:37,312	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Sphere in the surface of the Earth
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:40,640	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We often use that waveguide to bounce
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:41,920	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Signals off of
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:43,968	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	In What's called the high freq
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:44,736	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Booty band
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:47,040	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So things like ham radios
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:48,576	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Work based on that
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:51,136	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	But you have to know the
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:55,232	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Location of the receiver to know how to bounce it down to
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:58,048	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	For sale if you don't know that you'd much rather
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:23:00,096	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Feel that wave God
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:02,144	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	With the RF and that's what happens at say
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:02,656	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Lake Tenkiller
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:05,728	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Trying to build something that can actually
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:07,264	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Couple
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:08,288	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	2
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:12,384	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That waveguide and once you couple of that waveguide the propagation physics
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:16,224	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Or the loss of the RF as it travels over distance
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:18,784	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Is very favorable compared to
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:20,832	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Things that don't propagate
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:26,976	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And so that's what would enable you to reach these really long range communication
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:31,328	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Thinking things again like Voice and text over hundreds of kilometers
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:33,376	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	From something that you can really hold in the
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:34,656	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	In the palm of your hand
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:36,960	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Just not possible today using other
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:37,472	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Technology
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:42,080	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We've talked about four different programs and when I think about all the
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:43,872	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The different technical
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:44,640	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Components
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:46,432	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	It's rather amazing so
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:51,552	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	This makes me you don't realize that your engineer's mind really covers a lot of territory
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:56,416	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I think we once had a discussion where you telling me that in some ways you think the
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:58,720	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Cast of the engineer is quite a creative one
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:24:00,000	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I really kind of a
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:00,512	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Connection
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:02,048	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Math problem solving engine
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:05,376	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And the creativity that we might even see an artist
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:08,448	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I'm just wondering if you got some thoughts about that
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:09,728	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And how you might comparing
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:12,032	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Ways of
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:12,800	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Exercising our minds
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:18,688	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Yeah so that's actually an idea that I have borrowed from my thesis advisor can wise who
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:20,992	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	At the University of Michigan
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:23,808	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	On their North Campus they have centrally located
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:28,160	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Art music engineering and I believe architecture
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:30,208	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And his point was all day
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:32,512	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Basically stuck all of the creative fields
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:34,304	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Together this is
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:36,352	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Some people might not think that
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:40,960	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Music and Engineering would go together but he think that was his Insight that
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:44,544	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Becoming an engineer and being an engineer require quite a bit of creativity
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:50,944	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I think particularly if you want to make anything more than an incremental Improvement
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:53,248	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	To the way things are done today
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:25:00,160	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	It really requires the type of creativity to look at the way that they're done understand the limitations of the
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:01,952	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And then come up with some
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:03,488	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Completely new approach
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:07,840	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That would allow you to get Beyond those limitations and make
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:09,376	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	You're the 10x 100x
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:11,424	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Jumps in performance
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:14,496	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We're all seeking particularly here at DARPA
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:16,288	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Creativity
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:17,312	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Huge part of
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:23,200	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Being able to found new programs particularly in areas that are not obvious
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:26,016	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Apps that aren't leading like from one program to another
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:29,344	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	How do I get off this certain trajectory
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:31,904	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And get myself on a different trajectory which
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:32,416	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Is the one I want
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:34,976	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And I think it's really the creativity
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:36,000	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That allows you to make
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:37,280	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That kind of
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:39,840	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Before we close tribe
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:43,168	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Just wondering if there is a science fiction
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:43,936	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Technologies
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:47,520	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The technology that you might have learned about when you were kids you might have read a great science
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:49,056	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Fiction book you saw something in the movie You Came
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:51,104	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Up with the sides of yourself
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:53,920	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I bet does not exist now but that you really think or two
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:56,224	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Well absolutely
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:56,992	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I think
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:26:00,064	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Both come from Back to the Future
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:01,600	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So I am
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:04,416	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Actually optimistic that one day I might get a hover
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:04,928	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Car
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:09,280	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And I would love to be able to do time travel
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:12,352	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Self I'm not too optimistic about that one
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:13,120	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	But
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:13,888	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	You never know
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:17,728	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Well it's so if you could do time travel would you be more interested in going back
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:21,824	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Or forward I would definitely be more interested in going forward in time is
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:23,872	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I knew you were going to say that
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:30,272	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	This has been absolutely amazing we've gone from Vanishing materials and Vanishing vehicles to sensor
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:31,296	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Words that use almost
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:34,624	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	No energy at all but are paying attention to the environment
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:35,904	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Are we talked about
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:39,744	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Hover vehicle so at this is just been an amazing conversation
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:40,512	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Information
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:41,536	| Episode 11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And I want to thank you Troy for
