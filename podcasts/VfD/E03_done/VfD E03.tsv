EDL	00:00:13,312	00:00:18,432	| VfD E03 |	The Internet, GPS in the palm of your hand. Autonomous operation.
EDL	00:00:19,456	00:00:25,856	| VfD E03 |	Technology is a driver of our time since its founding in 1958 in the midst of the Cold War.
EDL	00:00:25,856	00:00:30,464	| VfD E03 |	DARPA, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has been a driver of Technology
EDL	00:00:31,232	00:00:33,792	| VfD E03 |	Welcome to Voices from DARPA
EDL	00:00:33,792	00:00:36,608	| VfD E03 |	A window at the DARPA's core of program managers
EDL	00:00:37,120	00:00:37,888	| VfD E03 |	Their job
EDL	00:00:38,400	00:00:40,448	| VfD E03 |	To redefine what is possible

EDL	00:00:41,216	00:00:46,848	| VfD E03 |	My name is Dan Green since 2013 I've been a program manager and DARPA's Microsystems technology office
EDL	00:00:47,360	00:00:49,152	| VfD E03 |	And I'm your DARPA host
EDL	00:00:49,152	00:00:49,920	| VfD E03 |	Ivan Amato

EDL	00:00:52,224	00:00:58,368	| VfD E03 |	Dan, tell me a little bit about your background and how it relates to what you hope to accomplish in your time here at DARPA
EDL	00:00:58,368	00:01:04,000	| VfD E03 |	I came here through a series of fortunate events I got into science from an early age I like physics
EDL	00:01:04,512	00:01:05,792	| VfD E03 |	I did physics in college
EDL	00:01:05,792	00:01:07,584	| VfD E03 |	I got into semiconductor physics
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:09,888	| VfD E03 |	So semiconductors are the
EDL	00:01:09,888	00:01:11,680	| VfD E03 |	Materials that underpin the electronic
EDL	00:01:12,448	00:01:14,496	| VfD E03 |	in all of our commercial Technologies today

EDL	00:01:15,008	00:01:15,776	| VfD E03 |	And
EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:17,824	| VfD E03 |	Really fell in love with that area
EDL	00:01:17,824	00:01:20,128	| VfD E03 |	At that point time which was in the in the 90s
EDL	00:01:20,640	00:01:22,944	| VfD E03 |	When I started getting into electronics and
EDL	00:01:22,944	00:01:27,808	| VfD E03 |	going out to grad school it was kind of a bad time to be doing electronics, because
EDL	00:01:27,808	00:01:29,344	| VfD E03 |	There is a lot of maturity
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:30,112	| VfD E03 |	And a lot of
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:33,952	| VfD E03 |	concern about where it was going to go from there because of
EDL	00:01:33,952	00:01:35,744	| VfD E03 |	established players like Intel or
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:40,352	| VfD E03 |	We're heading there hitting the stride and along came a new material system
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:41,632	| VfD E03 |	Called Gallium Nitride (GaN)
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:44,960	| VfD E03 |	Until I was part of this first wave of engineers that were brought up
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:50,592	| VfD E03 |	Looking at gallium nitride to understanding its properties as it applies to transistor technology
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:53,920	| VfD E03 |	Can you just spend a few seconds talking to us about
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:55,968	| VfD E03 |	What is interesting about different kinds of semiconductors
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:59,296	| VfD E03 |	So when you look at the history of semiconductors
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:01,088	| VfD E03 |	straight, the transistors came out
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:02,880	| VfD E03 |	from the labs of course
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:03,904	| VfD E03 |	after the 
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:05,952	| VfD E03 |	the second world war, so it's been around for a long time
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:08,000	| VfD E03 |	And the interesting pieces that
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:12,352	| VfD E03 |	As dominant as silicon is today that was not at all obvious
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:13,376	| VfD E03 |	When they started
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:14,656	| VfD E03 |	And in fact when you look at the
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:16,960	| VfD E03 |	The first transistors they were made of Germanium (锗)
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:18,987	| VfD E03 |	And they look like crazy little contraption(新奇装置) 
EDL	00:02:18,987	00:02:23,872	| VfD E03 |	correct the size of a palm, essentially they jabbed a couple of
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:28,480	| VfD E03 |	wires into this block of material and were able to extrapolate(外推) from that very
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:30,784	| VfD E03 |	very rudimentary(早期) experiment that
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:32,576	| VfD E03 |	Hey we're really onto something here
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:34,624	| VfD E03 |	It's obviously translated
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:36,416	| VfD E03 |	to many billions dollars of
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:38,464	| VfD E03 |	commercial activity now and
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:40,512	| VfD E03 |	The complexity of this we can do things today is
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:42,048	| VfD E03 |	astonishing
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:43,328	| VfD E03 |	Really the key was
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:47,168	| VfD E03 |	Going from Germanium to Silicon and a lot of the technical reasons that
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:48,192	| VfD E03 |	made silicon
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:49,216	| VfD E03 |	work
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:51,008	| VfD E03 |	Relate to the fact that it's just
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:54,336	| VfD E03 |	It warms combinations with other materials called oxide very easily
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:56,384	| VfD E03 |	And so having that oxide layer
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:58,944	| VfD E03 |	Really help control where the electrons flow
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:03,040	| VfD E03 |	The ability to manipulate the the material structure
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:04,576	| VfD E03 |	Is really what separated
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:05,600	| VfD E03 |	Silicon
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:06,880	| VfD E03 |	from the other competitors of that time.
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:09,646	| VfD E03 |	And the interesting peace that happened with the you know 
EDL	00:03:09,646	00:03:12,000	| VfD E03 |	the semiconductors zoo in the 80s and 90s
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:16,352	| VfD E03 |	was the dramatic expansion of the materials that were able to manipulate in that matter
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:18,144	| VfD E03 |	And so we went from
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:23,520	| VfD E03 |	things like Silicon to our notice compound semiconductors where we use combinations of element
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,568	| VfD E03 |	to create new material sets
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:28,128	| VfD E03 |	So the first material set that
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:30,944	| VfD E03 |	hit the mainstream is called gallium arsenide (砷化镓)
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:34,315	| VfD E03 |	Instead of being, regular crystal just made of silicon atoms, 
EDL	00:03:34,315	00:03:37,088	| VfD E03 |	it has an alternating pattern of gallium and arsenic

EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:41,696	| VfD E03 |	Right and my understanding is going from Silicon to a Compound Semiconductor
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:43,488	| VfD E03 |	like gallium arsenide
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:44,768	| VfD E03 |	was hard enough
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:49,376	| VfD E03 |	that it became a program at DARPA to try to
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:51,168	| VfD E03 |	mature that material make it useful. - Absolutely right 
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:54,752	| VfD E03 |	DARPA made an early investment to take
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:58,080	| VfD E03 |	What then was experimental technology of gallium arsenide
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:04:01,152	| VfD E03 |	That was useful for things like amplifiers and
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:02,432	| VfD E03 |	really scale it up
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:03,712	| VfD E03 |	to make it manufacturable
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:07,208	| VfD E03 |	Because they realize that it was going to enable us to do things 
EDL	00:04:07,208	00:04:08,527	| VfD E03 |	like arrays, phased-array 
EDL	00:04:08,527	00:04:10,880	| VfD E03 |	so what is a phased array phased arrays
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:11,648	| VfD E03 |	Is it is a
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:14,464	| VfD E03 |	A combination of amplifiers in a repeated pattern
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:17,791	| VfD E03 |	So that you can project electromagnetic waves
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:19,583	| VfD E03 |	So that means things like
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:22,143	| VfD E03 |	Radars that go on our
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:22,911	| VfD E03 |	planes and ships
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:26,751	| VfD E03 |	can leverage that capability to see what's around them and to communicate.

EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:30,079	| VfD E03 |	And what ended up happening was because of the
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:32,149	| VfD E03 |	the defense interest in maturing that technology 
EDL	00:04:32,149	00:04:34,943	| VfD E03 |	and the ability to bring it to a manufacturable state
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:38,015	| VfD E03 |	A lot of people realize that hey it would be useful for
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:39,039	| VfD E03 |	commercial sector as well.
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:43,903	| VfD E03 |	And so that same gallium arsenide technology that came out of the early DARPA
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:45,183	| VfD E03 |	So-called MIMIC program

Microwave and Millimeter Wave Integrated Circuit (MIMIC)

The Microwave and Millimeter Wave Integrated Circuit (MIMIC) program’s
objective was, according to a review by one of its program managers, “to
develop microwave/millimeter-wave subsystems for use in military weapon system
‘front ends’ that are affordable, available, and broadly applicable.” The
program catalyzed multi-faceted research in materials (gallium arsenide),
device design, integration, defect management, manufacturing, and other areas.
The work yielded a new infrastructure for MIMIC technology with specific
applications proliferating throughout the military and commercial sectors.

Phased-array radar systems were among the technology’s earliest uses for
defense, but as the technology progressed toward greater yields and cost
reductions, cell phone designers turned to MIMIC-based power amplifiers, which
placed far more communications reach in smaller packages than ever before. The
program provided foundations for follow-on technology development and has
served as a model for subsequent programs for pushing microwave,
millimeter-wave, submillimeter-wave and THz-frequency solid-state electronics
forward. In 1993, The Space Foundation, citing DARPA’s pivotal role, inducted
MIMIC Technology into its Hall of Fame.

EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:46,463	| VfD E03 |	In the 90s
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:49,279	| VfD E03 |	I was really what set off the cell phone release
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:51,071	| VfD E03 |	Because it enabled
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:52,607	| VfD E03 |	The amplifiers that let
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:55,167	| VfD E03 |	those small handsets that you carry around with you
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:55,935	| VfD E03 |	to talk to
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:57,215	| VfD E03 |	the cell phone towers.

** programs the you've been overseeing

EDL	00:04:57,983	00:05:02,335	| VfD E03 |	And that expansion of of the semiconductors zoo we we we started with germanium
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:05,151	| VfD E03 |	We talked about silicon we talked about gallium arsenide
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:09,450	| VfD E03 |	This might be a good time to, sort of, moving to some of the programs that you've been overseeing 
EDL	00:05:09,450	00:05:10,527	| VfD E03 |	absolutely
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:14,111	| VfD E03 |	gallium arsenide was was really exceptional because it showed
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:17,439	| VfD E03 |	How different material properties can be by moving away from to silicon
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:20,255	| VfD E03 |	But by no means did that exhaust the periodic table
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:22,047	| VfD E03 |	And so as people were looking around
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:23,327	| VfD E03 |	They realized
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,375	| VfD E03 |	that there's a lot of other options
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:27,935	| VfD E03 |	Late 90s and early 2000s
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:28,703	| VfD E03 |	This was
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:33,311	| VfD E03 |	An individual researcher actually develop the technology to grow high-quality
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:34,335	| VfD E03 |	Gallium nitride material

EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:37,663	| VfD E03 |	Gallium nitride materials is special because
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:41,759	| VfD E03 |	It. It offers a wider band gap. So that's a characteristic energy the material
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:43,551	| VfD E03 |	And it enabled
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:46,367	| VfD E03 |	devices to be made which could emit into the Blue
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:48,159	| VfD E03 |	part of the electromagnetic spectrum
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:49,183	| VfD E03 |	which was not available before.

EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:51,720	| VfD E03 |	That set off a whole wave in terms of lighting 
EDL	00:05:51,720	00:05:56,095	| VfD E03 |	and so we're saying that today with our pixelated stoplights and and the LEDs that we see now
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:56,607	| VfD E03 |	in the houses

EDL	00:05:57,119	00:06:00,191	| VfD E03 |	But the correlation that was it enable that material set
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:02,751	| VfD E03 |	to be more widely available
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:07,103	| VfD E03 |	And enable those of us in electronics domain to use it for other purposes
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:08,127	| VfD E03 |	like high power amplifier
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:10,175	| VfD E03 |	Enable us to to look at
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:12,991	| VfD E03 |	Things like more efficient cell phone towers
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:16,575	| VfD E03 |	But also higher power array for
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:19,135	| VfD E03 |	The Navy and the and the Army and airforce
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:22,207	| VfD E03 |	For the sensors and communications and the
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:23,999	| VfD E03 |	electronic warfare equipment that we use everyday.

EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:28,095	| VfD E03 |	Right and I know that one of your own passions has been to try to
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:34,495	| VfD E03 |	Look at the strengths of these different kinds of semiconductor materials in and then try to put them together to mix-and-match them
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:37,524	| VfD E03 |	Correct. that might not have been so easy to do before 
EDL	00:06:37,524	00:06:40,895	| VfD E03 |	partly because their crystal structures are a little different and they might
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:41,900	| VfD E03 |	not stick together well 
EDL	00:06:41,900	00:06:43,770	| VfD E03 |	so these are some of the challenges right that 
EDL	00:06:43,770	00:06:46,015	| VfD E03 |	you've been taking on as a program manager.

EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:47,807	| VfD E03 |	Part of the interesting piece
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:49,343	| VfD E03 |	with Gallium Nitride is
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:52,671	| VfD E03 |	not so much that it provides all these advantages but then it works at all
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:55,999	| VfD E03 |	It's a very different material set than historical semiconductors
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:59,583	| VfD E03 |	It has a mechanical element that's a part of
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:02,399	| VfD E03 |	The way that it operates more than just the way that it moves electronics around
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:04,447	| VfD E03 |	It has what's known as peers' electric
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:06,239	| VfD E03 |	And so it actually
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:08,287	| VfD E03 |	depends upon being compressed
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:09,567	| VfD E03 |	by the combination materials
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:11,359	| VfD E03 |	in a certain state
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:12,895	| VfD E03 |	to enable the electrons to exist
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:14,431	| VfD E03 |	where we can use them.
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:18,271	| VfD E03 |	So we can mix in a little aluminum for there are gallium and nitrogen
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:20,319	| VfD E03 |	to create a different alloy and we
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:23,135	| VfD E03 |	can grow those crystals right on top of each other
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:25,951	| VfD E03 |	So that they maintain their structure from layer to layer
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:28,781	| VfD E03 |	And a lot of the development that happened in the 
EDL	00:07:28,781	00:07:31,193	| VfD E03 |	early DARPA MIMIC project was enabling those techniques 
EDL	00:07:31,193	00:07:32,863	| VfD E03 |	where we can control that crystal
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:34,143	| VfD E03 |	layering at the atomic scale
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:36,447	| VfD E03 |	which enables us to create
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:39,007	| VfD E03 |	these types of very finely
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:41,055	| VfD E03 |	characterizes and structured devices
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:43,103	| VfD E03 |	over very large area.
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:44,895	| VfD E03 |	So we can create very complex circuits
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:47,199	| VfD E03 |	that are structured at that atomic scale.

EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:50,015	| VfD E03 |	So where all this goes from here
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:51,295	| VfD E03 |	Because it has this
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:55,903	| VfD E03 |	Funny characteristic of mechanical and electrical coupling that's different is that
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:59,231	| VfD E03 |	There's a whole swath of degrees of freedom that haven't really makes explore with GaN
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:03,071	| VfD E03 |	So I entered the field just as it was maturing
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:06,655	| VfD E03 |	And worked at a company to help bring one of the initial products
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:07,679	| VfD E03 |	to life in terms of
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:10,239	| VfD E03 |	high power amplifier for the cell phone community

EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:13,055	| VfD E03 |	But my time at DARPA has really been about
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:14,847	| VfD E03 |	Where do we go from here in terms of
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:16,127	| VfD E03 |	leveraging all these
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:18,943	| VfD E03 |	hidden attributes of gallium nitride that really haven't been
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:19,711	| VfD E03 |	brought to the barrier yet

EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:23,295	| VfD E03 |	So things like scaling the gate lines down to hit the links that we do
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:27,391	| VfD E03 |	And what that that enables us to do is push up higher and higher frequencies
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:30,207	| VfD E03 |	So how do we understand that? well

EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:30,719	| VfD E03 |	The
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:35,583	| VfD E03 |	The frequencies that we we commonly encounter for like our cell phone is around 2GHz
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:40,703	| VfD E03 |	And really because the scaling advantages and that we can do with gallium nitride
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:44,543	| VfD E03 |	The higher power density that we can't we can start to realize
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:46,847	| VfD E03 |	The ability to transmit power
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:48,127	| VfD E03 |	Up in the millimeter wave
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:49,151	| VfD E03 |	So that's up
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:49,919	| VfD E03 |	towards
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:51,455	| VfD E03 |	30 to 300 gigahertz
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:54,527	| VfD E03 |	It's the ability to dress that higher frequency range
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:57,497	| VfD E03 |	really opens up a whole part of the electromagnetic spectrum 
EDL	00:08:57,497	00:08:58,367	| VfD E03 |	that we haven't been able to access before.
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:00,927	| VfD E03 |	Why do you want to go there?

EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:03,999	| VfD E03 |	Because that will enable things like 5G
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:04,767	| VfD E03 |	in the commercial sector.

EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:07,071	| VfD E03 |	There's a lot of activity right now.
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:09,631	| VfD E03 |	That's going to help us all stream video from wherever we want.
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:14,239	| VfD E03 |	But it also enables us to do different things like look at different material properties
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:18,335	| VfD E03 |	As we interrogate what's going on with with different materials with
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:20,383	| VfD E03 |	its different part in electromagnetic spectrum 
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:23,455	| VfD E03 |	So we can actually literally see the world in a different way
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:24,735	| VfD E03 |	Because we're using light at different wavelengths
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:29,599	| VfD E03 |	the possibilities of what we can do there are just started to be explored
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:32,257	| VfD E03 |	And the capabilities that we're developing with gallium nitride 
EDL	00:09:32,257	00:09:34,207	| VfD E03 |	are a building block and a tool to help us to get there.

EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:39,071	| VfD E03 |	Dan, how would you imagine the technologies
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:41,631	| VfD E03 |	that you are nurturing you spoke speaking a lot about gallium nitride here.
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:44,191	| VfD E03 |	How would image that finding traction
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:48,031	| VfD E03 |	both in national security and civilian settings

EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:50,591	| VfD E03 |	So the
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:52,895	| VfD E03 |	technologies were developing with gallium nitride
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:54,943	| VfD E03 |	are going to be very are going to be very important
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:56,991	| VfD E03 |	for national security because
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:58,783	| VfD E03 |	It doesn't enable us to get into these new parts
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:00,319	| VfD E03 |	of the electromagnetic spectrum
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:01,343	| VfD E03 |	So that underpins
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:04,415	| VfD E03 |	all of our capabilities when it comes to things like
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,183	| VfD E03 |	communications
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:06,719	| VfD E03 |	or sensing

EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:09,279	| VfD E03 |	Coming from the civilian sector I didn't really understand until I worked
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:11,327	| VfD E03 |	with some of the military
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:12,607	| VfD E03 |	is that
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:14,143	| VfD E03 |	we think why do you need to sense things
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:15,167	| VfD E03 |	And
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:17,983	| VfD E03 |	And we know what's down the block when we're walking down the street
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:21,311	| VfD E03 |	But if you're in the Navy and you're on the ship in the middle of Pacific
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:24,127	| VfD E03 |	You're in a very very dark place
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:25,919	| VfD E03 |	And you don't know what's around you in the world
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:27,199	| VfD E03 |	sensing becomes very important
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:29,759	| VfD E03 |	Because you're you're really out in the middle of nowhere

EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:32,319	| VfD E03 |	And that's part of the
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:34,623	| VfD E03 |	The piece that's missing I think when we think about this in
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:35,647	| VfD E03 |	context of our everyday lifes
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:38,719	| VfD E03 |	That the military is doing things that are very different
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,487	| VfD E03 |	from what we do in the commercial sector.
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:43,587	| VfD E03 |	What we're doing with gallium nitride is enabling the technologies 
EDL	00:10:43,587	00:10:45,375	| VfD E03 |	that will help them with those particular missions
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:49,215	| VfD E03 |	And what will happen at the end of the day is that once we have them
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:49,983	| VfD E03 |	People are creative
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:52,287	| VfD E03 |	And they will find ways to use those pieces
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:54,847	| VfD E03 |	There are more relevant to what we doing
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:55,359	| VfD E03 |	in our everyday lifes.

** Q
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:11:00,223	| VfD E03 |	So what might be some of the larger societal technological in
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:02,271	| VfD E03 |	security context in which your
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:04,063	| VfD E03 |	program in interest reside?

** A

EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:06,367	| VfD E03 |	It's a very interesting time right now in electronics
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,391	| VfD E03 |	And because
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:11,231	| VfD E03 |	historically the US has had such a dominant position in the development of these technologies
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:14,559	| VfD E03 |	From the initial development of transistor Bell labs
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:15,839	| VfD E03 |	through the
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:17,631	| VfD E03 |	the mass roll out of
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:19,423	| VfD E03 |	PCs from Intel.
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:23,263	| VfD E03 |	And what we've seen is just in the last decade or so
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:25,567	| VfD E03 |	Is the globalization of that technology has
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,079	| VfD E03 |	spread around the world.
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:31,711	| VfD E03 |	one of the byproducts of the early going where DARPA funded a lot of these gallium arsenide technologies
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:32,735	| VfD E03 |	that rolled into our defense
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:34,527	| VfD E03 |	defense communications
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:35,807	| VfD E03 |	and sensing technologies
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:38,367	| VfD E03 |	Was that we had a very comfortable
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:40,159	| VfD E03 |	place in the world where we
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:41,951	| VfD E03 |	could make all those components at home
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:43,487	| VfD E03 |	and use them
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:45,279	| VfD E03 |	in very controlled manners for our purposes.

EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:48,607	| VfD E03 |	And with this globalization that's taking place
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:50,399	| VfD E03 |	because of the advent of cell phones
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:51,679	| VfD E03 |	and mass consumer electronics

EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:53,983	| VfD E03 |	We're seeing now that
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:56,543	| VfD E03 |	All these electronic pieces in these different developments
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,335	| VfD E03 |	Are happening all over the world.
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:00,383	| VfD E03 |	And so it really challenges us.
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,151	| VfD E03 |	in the way that we
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:03,199	| VfD E03 |	consumer electronics
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:04,991	| VfD E03 |	and the Department of Defense.
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:07,039	| VfD E03 |	Because now we
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:09,087	| VfD E03 |	we don't necessarily have all of those
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:11,391	| VfD E03 |	best components at home because there's a lot of
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:12,671	| VfD E03 |	activity all over the world.

EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,463	| VfD E03 |	Until there is
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:17,023	| VfD E03 |	there's challenges both understand what pieces
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:18,815	| VfD E03 |	we should develop
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:19,583	| VfD E03 |	And
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:21,375	| VfD E03 |	can continue to own at home
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:24,959	| VfD E03 |	And what pieces we should leverage in that global marketplace.
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:27,263	| VfD E03 |	And how to put the the best of those products together,
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:29,311	| VfD E03 |	so that we can commering competitive.
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:33,663	| VfD E03 |	What you're talkin about here in some ways is the sort of the
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:34,431	| VfD E03 |	technology
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:36,991	| VfD E03 |	ecosystem the engineering ecosystem
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:39,039	| VfD E03 |	innovation ecosystem and makes me think about

EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:42,111	| VfD E03 |	where DARPA fits into these very ecosystem
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:45,183	| VfD E03 |	So DARPA really is fantastic and that
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:47,231	| VfD E03 |	It has the ability to go in and make
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:48,767	| VfD E03 |	significant investment
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:50,303	| VfD E03 |	to advanced technologies
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:51,327	| VfD E03 |	Critical
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:52,607	| VfD E03 |	and can really be a difference-maker

EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:55,423	| VfD E03 |	For instance, in gallium nitride
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:55,935	| VfD E03 |	I mentioned
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:59,263	| VfD E03 |	The new imports of GaN as it came along
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:02,591	| VfD E03 |	to advancing what we can do in the RF Spectrum
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:05,663	| VfD E03 |	And really that technology was
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:06,687	| VfD E03 |	resound in the world

EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:07,711	| VfD E03 |	Because of the LED market place.
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:10,015	| VfD E03 |	But DARPA came along and
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:11,295	| VfD E03 |	made a significant investment
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:13,343	| VfD E03 |	in wide bandgap of semiconductors of which gallium nitride has won
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:15,903	| VfD E03 |	To push the material that
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:17,439	| VfD E03 |	That's base
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:18,975	| VfD E03 |	For the electronics domain
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:22,047	| VfD E03 |	And because of that early investment DARPA
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:24,095	| VfD E03 |	has created capabilities
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:26,655	| VfD E03 |	that are being rolled out now to the services and in
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,679	| VfD E03 |	the form of new
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:29,993	| VfD E03 |	radars that are going to the navy and communication systems 
EDL	00:13:29,993	00:13:31,775	| VfD E03 |	that are going around the services
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:32,799	| VfD E03 |	And
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:35,103	| VfD E03 |	It's also dominant
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:37,151	| VfD E03 |	provided the backbone for
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:39,199	| VfD E03 |	industry players that are serving commercial market as well

* Si-Fi
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:42,527	| VfD E03 |	Dan, can you describe one
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:46,623	| VfD E03 |	science fiction technology either that you read about in the past
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:48,728	| VfD E03 |	you come up on your own you woken up in the middle of the night 
EDL	00:13:48,728	00:13:50,463	| VfD E03 |	with this dream of a technology
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:53,791	| VfD E03 |	that it doesn't exist now but that you really wish
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:54,815	| VfD E03 |	could exist?

EDL	00:13:56,863	00:14:00,703	| VfD E03 |	This is what we do here cuz I spend time dreaming about different technology so
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:03,249	| VfD E03 |	It's such a fascinating time 
EDL	00:14:03,249	00:14:05,823	| VfD E03 |	because a lot of these things that we formally just dreamed about are
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:07,615	| VfD E03 |	coming to life around us.

EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:11,711	| VfD E03 |	The one Comic Book I did read when I was a kid was Iron Man, and so
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:14,015	| VfD E03 |	We now have all these Iron Man movies but
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:15,746	| VfD E03 |	What's fascinating is walking around the building 
EDL	00:14:15,746	00:14:18,879	| VfD E03 |	and seeing how parts of those technologies are trying to make it look
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:21,695	| VfD E03 |	less and less crazy. You started to see
EDL	00:14:22,349	00:14:23,743	| VfD E03 |	people are actually working on exosuits
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:25,535	| VfD E03 |	people who are working on
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:27,839	| VfD E03 |	how we connect the body to electronics,
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:31,423	| VfD E03 |	how we actually interface with electronics.
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:35,660	| VfD E03 |	So you're talking here about complex and potentially powerful technologies 
EDL	00:14:35,660	00:14:37,311	| VfD E03 |	which means they could lead
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:38,847	| VfD E03 |	To both good and
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:40,383	| VfD E03 |	perhaps troublesome results.

EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:43,967	| VfD E03 |	How do you think about the potential consequences of the technology
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:44,991	| VfD E03 |	You're helping to develop?
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:49,087	| VfD E03 |	So I think that's an
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:51,647	| VfD E03 |	interesting question that we do struggle with a lot.
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:54,719	| VfD E03 |	As we continue to expand our capability to
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:55,743	| VfD E03 |	compute
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:57,023	| VfD E03 |	and
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:57,535	| VfD E03 |	project
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:59,583	| VfD E03 |	into the electromagnetic spectrum.

EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:02,399	| VfD E03 |	Really raises the ability for us to
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:03,167	| VfD E03 |	to be always on
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:04,579	| VfD E03 |	and always connected. 
EDL	00:15:04,579	00:15:06,495	| VfD E03 |	And it not only did that
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:07,775	| VfD E03 |	erase all the issues that
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:08,543	| VfD E03 |	received today in terms of
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:09,591	| VfD E03 |	having your cell phone on all the time and
EDL	00:15:10,359	00:15:12,383	| VfD E03 |	being that sense always on
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:14,175	| VfD E03 |	But also this
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:15,711	| VfD E03 |	always aware
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:16,991	| VfD E03 |	So that there's no way to hide things
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:19,551	| VfD E03 |	and so, it becomes a very open and transparent
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:22,367	| VfD E03 |	place to be which has pluses and minuses
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:23,903	| VfD E03 |	in terms of how we operate
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:24,927	| VfD E03 |	as a democracy in the world.

EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:27,487	| VfD E03 |	So I think there's a lot of
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:30,559	| VfD E03 |	implications of technology that are yet to be grappled with.
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:32,607	| VfD E03 |	But it's also
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:35,679	| VfD E03 |	a law of physics that technology will advance.
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:39,007	| VfD E03 |	We will continue to explore the world so
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:42,335	| VfD E03 |	It doesn't help us to not try to advance
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:43,615	| VfD E03 |	And see what's what's possible
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:46,175	| VfD E03 |	The whole point of DARPA is to prevent surprise
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:49,759	| VfD E03 |	And really part of our job here is to go out to figure out what's possible 
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:51,295	| VfD E03 |	so we can start that process
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:52,831	| VfD E03 |	of understanding it early
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:57,695	| VfD E03 |	Well Dan, I really enjoyed our conversation here today
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:15:58,207	| VfD E03 |	Thank you, Ivan.

EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:03,071	| VfD E03 |	Thanks for listening and tune in next time to hear another Voice from DARPA

Episode 3: The Semiconductor Whisperer
2016-11-1 | 0:16:18 | Voices from DARPA |

In this third episode of DARPA’s podcast series, Voices from DARPA, join
program manager Dan Green, as he discusses the Agency’s innovation-catalyzing
roles in the Age of Semiconductors. For Green, silicon, the celebrity high-tech
material of our times, is only one species in what he views as a semiconductor
zoo. For his part, Green, who works in the Agency’s Microsystems Technology
Office, has been overseeing DARPA’s efforts to usher the compound
semiconductor, gallium nitride (or GaN), beyond its already transformative role
in the world of LED lighting into a range of electronic and radiofrequency
applications important for national security contexts--among them electronic
warfare, radar, and communications--and eventually into an empowering variety
of applications in the civilian world.
