EDL	00:01:27,296	00:01:29,856	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So thanks Jonathan for joining me in the studio today
EDL	00:01:29,856	00:01:31,136	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	It's awesome to be here
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:37,024	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Before we actually dive into some of the really good stuff about how you got to DARPA and how you think
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:40,352	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	About technology a program that you recently got going
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:41,120	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Few other things
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:43,680	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	I've got to ask you something that
EDL	00:01:43,680	00:01:44,448	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	What I learned
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:45,472	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	About you and your family
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:47,520	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	DARPA
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:50,848	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And I'm referring here to the naming
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:51,360	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	I love you words
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:59,296	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Tell us a little better so my wife is also a scientist so we had a rather long and lengthy discussion about name
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:00,832	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Algorithms and how you
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:02,624	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Depending on the gender of a child you make
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:04,928	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	What are consonants you might want to talk valve
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:07,232	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And then we also being scientist
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:08,512	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Started to think about names
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:10,304	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	The scientist
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:12,608	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Maybe match some of those criteria soap
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:18,752	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	We named our children Tesla in Ferriday and we thought very hard about that because it's pretty nerdy
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:22,848	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And we want to be able to also call them Tess and Farah
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:24,384	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Should they want to tone it down a little
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:31,552	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And just how have your daughters responded to having such unusual names like they've loved it I mean we made a point
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:37,952	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	End up going to the Royal Society in London with Faraday where they have much of Faraday's Regional Lab
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:40,000	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Put Menthol in a really nice small
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:41,792	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Not very busy Museum
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:43,328	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	It's been a lot of fun
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:46,656	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So I don't get an opportunity there to tell the curator
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:53,056	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Is very positive LOL sometimes
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:55,360	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Tesla that we do get asked about the rock band
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:58,944	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And occasionally about there's I don't know you may have heard there's a car company
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:03,552	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Important part of that story of courses who was Nikola Tesla's
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:04,064	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Hero
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:06,112	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And Michael Faraday
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:08,416	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Beautiful connection
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:12,000	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So I have to say that's quirky but I say that with great affection
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:15,584	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	It's a it's a sure sign of your motion to science
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:17,888	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So what's actually not talk about
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:20,448	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Your background I mentioned the degrees that you had gotten
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:24,544	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Would like to hear about that those interested in how you ended up at
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:25,056	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Actually

EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:42,976	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Father with with some great insights and no personal computers we need these in our house
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:44,000	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:50,144	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	I don't know if you work all these old magazines like bite magazine you would type in
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:51,680	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Programs in which type in
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:52,192	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Computer games
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:55,776	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And I said that I said Dad I want to make my own computer
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:57,056	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And he said
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:03:58,336	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Here's the manual sun
EDL	00:03:58,336	00:03:59,616	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Plugs it in front of me
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:01,152	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And next thing you know ice
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:02,432	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Programming
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:04,224	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	I started to fall in love with computers
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:06,784	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Later once I got to
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:12,672	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Undergraduate I'm sitting there I was fortunate to overlap with my sister at the same University
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:15,744	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	She was studying cognitive science this is amazing
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:16,768	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	How people think
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:19,071	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	How they behave what are the motivations for
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:20,863	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	That's fascinating that's what I want to study
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:25,215	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And she looked at me and in a way that holding older sister can instead
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:25,727	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Jonathan
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:27,519	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	You don't do computer science
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:29,567	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	You're crazy so I did both
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:30,847	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And that's been my career
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:32,895	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	DARPA
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:34,943	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Did you know about it and seek it out
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:35,967	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	DARPA
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:37,503	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Such an amazing place
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:40,319	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	That it's hard when you're in a
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:44,415	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Field doing research and development and leading other people and doing it
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:48,767	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Do not know about DARPA to not know about the amazing things that DARPA has done
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:52,095	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So for me it was it was very natural to say
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:54,143	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Well I can imagine at some point
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:58,239	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Appropriately in my career I would love to serve at DARPA
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:04:59,775	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Expendables
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:01,823	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	For five years of my life you're helping
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:04,639	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Arriving at DARPA there's a sense of
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:05,663	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Incredible empowerment
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:09,503	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	That with the wherewithal that you got
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:12,319	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	To really make some extraordinary things happen not just
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:18,975	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Oh I'm going to run a program but no I'm going to write a seminal book with the best people in the world I am going to
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:20,767	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Changeable discipline
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:22,047	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	It's an amazing feeling
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:24,863	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And when you do all of that and you tie it back
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:25,631	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	2 National
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:26,655	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Security +
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:28,447	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Feeling like you're serving your country at
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:28,959	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	It's a great feeling
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:31,263	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Yeah when one of the things I find
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:32,799	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	A most fascinating
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:33,823	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	About DARPA
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:35,871	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Is the sort of melting
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:39,199	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Of disciplinary boundaries which is not so easy to do with many other in
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,991	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Institutions you go to a university in
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:43,807	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Typical you're still in the biology Department of Chemistry Department
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:48,159	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Here goes kind of boundary is almost irrelevant because it's much more of a
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:48,671	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Project
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:49,951	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Directed
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:53,279	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Approach you could you sure
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:58,911	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Oh yeah I mean that part of the superpowers you got us a DARPA program manager is you can you can
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:01,215	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Remembering my sister grabbing my ear
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:02,239	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	You should
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:08,639	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Think about this other if you can grab people by the ear and go I've watched this field for in my my case 25
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:09,407	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Sears
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:15,039	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And it's absolutely ridiculous that these people aren't working together or there's a huge opportunity
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:15,807	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	If I can bring these p
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:17,855	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	In the right way
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:19,903	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And that's what we try to do
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:21,695	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	All right so let's talk about
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:23,999	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	How your own mindset is changing now that you
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:25,023	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Shakira DARPA
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:27,583	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And we'll move from that come into the program
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:29,887	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	To rub up the momentum
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:32,191	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So you made it your mission here
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:32,703	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Focus on
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:33,983	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Hard drive
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:36,799	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	One of them being a modeling of large-scale human behavior
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:38,079	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Lightweight computer
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:41,407	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	I would like you to first talk to me about your
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:42,687	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Views about Aaron
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:43,455	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Christian connect
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:46,271	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Global Information environment
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:49,087	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And how that's guiding what
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,623	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	You hope to achieve here in your tie
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:57,791	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	I get so excited when I think about the fact that people are interacting
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:00,095	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Ever increasingly
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:01,375	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Computer-mediated fashion
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:04,959	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Now I have this opportunity
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:09,567	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Through these kind of computer-mediated interactions to study human behavior
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:10,847	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	At a scale
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:11,871	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	It's never been
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:12,639	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Done before
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:13,663	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And what's exciting
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:19,039	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	People are starting to think about that world so you'll see some behavioral scientist using Mechanical Turk
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:19,807	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	For example
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:23,903	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Actually most people would not know what mechanical means
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:26,207	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So Amazon Mechanical Turk is a
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:28,255	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Crowdsourced
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:32,095	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Platform so I could say go to Amazon Mechanical Turk and I would like
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:33,375	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Toupee
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:35,167	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	200 people
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:36,959	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	To do some simple experiment which is
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:37,983	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Just to say you know
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:40,543	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Click on this card box when you see it
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:42,079	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Type of experiment or
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:45,151	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Collaborate on a project and let me watch how you doing
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:45,919	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:48,223	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	In the social sciences there's been a huge uptick
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:50,527	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	In people using this particular platform
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:51,551	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	It's just one
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:53,599	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Think about the fact that
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:54,623	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	When you call Uber
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:56,927	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	That it has date on the drivers
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:58,719	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Have data on the people that are getting picked up
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:07:59,999	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Think about Facebook
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:04,351	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Think about the fact that they have millions and millions and millions of users
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,375	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Around the world
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:08,191	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Taking two interesting studies of the differences between cultures
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:09,983	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	That we could never conceive of
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:11,519	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	At that scale.
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:15,103	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	It's an incredibly exciting time for the behavioral social
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:19,199	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Right and just one more Moment On The Mechanical Turk
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:20,735	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	What's fascinating about you for the name of that
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,015	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	What is it associate
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:23,295	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	A famous
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:24,063	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Example of an
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:24,831	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Otamatone
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:25,599	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	On the mechanical
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,367	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Turk with the Kinect
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:30,463	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	I think Amazon's original Vision was
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:32,767	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	A Mechanical Turk where
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:35,583	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	It's not with a human inside
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:40,191	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Tennis with a chess-playing automaton at that
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:46,591	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Center of all kinds of discussions when it first came out in the University was revealed to have a few minutes so what is the
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:47,871	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Is that there are
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:49,919	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	New ever-increasing opportunities
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:53,759	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	For interacting with humans in a way that would let us understand
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:55,807	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Not just how they're going to act
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:59,391	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	A particular instance but what are the the kind of causal underpinning
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:00,671	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Of those behave
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:03,231	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Why do people act in a certain way insert
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:03,743	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Situations
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:05,279	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Interesting soap
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:08,351	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	I think that's a good segue into a discussion
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:09,119	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	About
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:10,655	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	The program that you have begun
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:13,215	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	It's called the computational
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:16,799	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Simulation of online social behavior program
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:18,591	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	No in a short format
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:20,383	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	As social Sim
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:21,663	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	You've described
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:24,479	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	This goal as developing Innovative Technologies
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:25,759	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	4 High Fidelity
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:27,295	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Computational simulation
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:29,087	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Of online social
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:30,879	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	I'd like you to flush that out
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:33,439	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	What are the things to point out
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,207	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	When I
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:38,815	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And rattling off these opportunities about understanding human behavior is understanding human behavior is
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:39,839	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Hard and I
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:41,375	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Far from solved problem
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:42,911	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:47,007	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	We often joke we wish we had the easy problems like the physicists do
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:49,055	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Humans are tough
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:55,967	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So this program is a fundamental research program it's not saying we're going to successfully model human behavior
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:56,479	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	It says
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:10:00,319	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	We're going to try to start to to chew the elephant
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:05,695	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	We're going to get our very very tiny teaspoon and start to nibble at this giant problem of
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:08,255	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	What can we understand about Behavior
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:11,583	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	The goal of this program is to really start to tackle
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:14,911	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	The issue of creating valid
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:17,215	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Simulations are valid models
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:19,263	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And there's a lot of folks
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:22,079	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	In the modeling world who will build beautiful models
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:23,871	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:27,967	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Not do such a great job of proving that they are correct
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:35,647	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Then there's people who will go out and do behavioral experiments but then don't bother to codified that and then some sort of Pop
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,415	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Habitational represent
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:41,791	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	How do you think about bringing all of that together in a way where you can say yes
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:43,327	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	We built this model we built this
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,863	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Habitational simulation
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:45,887	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And we know
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:48,447	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	For some circumstances
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:51,775	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	It's it works with some level of actors we know one
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:54,079	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	We have things that are right and when we have things that are wrong
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:56,639	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Right and you're bringing it again
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:57,919	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	This massive ability
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:10:59,455	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	To scale up
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:00,991	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	I should say the scale up in a massive
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:05,087	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Because you will be tapping in and it sort of Mama's crowdsourcing weigh in
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:07,647	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	By reaching out to the social
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:08,927	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Media channel
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:10,719	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Absolutely so
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:12,255	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	One of the things that's
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:15,839	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Different today is this notion of scale that we
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:16,863	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Have all of these
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:17,631	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Computer-mediated
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:18,143	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Medication
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:19,679	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:21,215	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	If we can do
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:22,751	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	All of the appropriate
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:24,543	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Privacy and ethical consideration
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:27,359	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Which is things like informed consent
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:29,151	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	You must ask someone
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:31,199	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	You're going to use their data
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:34,271	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Can we then look at this data in aggregate
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:36,319	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	We're not talking about individuals
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:36,831	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Here were talking about
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:39,903	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	@scale millions of people
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:40,927	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Decide
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:42,463	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	We're going to spread
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:43,999	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	A piece of information on
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:47,839	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So we're going from online social behavior
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:49,375	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Potentially a very big
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:52,191	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Phase 2 of relatively simple Behavior which is
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:53,727	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	The spread
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,007	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	That information
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:56,287	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So why would you
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,335	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Tell me you just saw a great movie
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:00,127	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	What motivates
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:03,455	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	How does that happen and can we look at the
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:04,991	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Various factors
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:06,015	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Surrounding that as a function
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:07,295	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Which environment are we
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,599	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Is it something that you would tweet about it
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:11,135	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Something you might post on Facebook
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:14,207	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Can we do that as a function of
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:16,255	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Information itself
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:18,815	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	What kinds of information are more likely to
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:22,911	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And can we do that as a function of the properties of the population
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:30,079	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	This is a population that really is very connected and likes to spread information this is a population that's more disconnected and does
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:33,663	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	How do all those factors interact
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:34,687	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And how can we
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:35,455	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Study though
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:37,759	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And say what we actually know and how well we know it
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:41,855	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	If you were trying to make this a little bit more concrete for listeners
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:43,647	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	What kinds of questions
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:44,415	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	How do you think
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:47,231	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Do you know you will be asking
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:48,511	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	King of the researcher
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:49,279	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	She will be working
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:50,559	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	I'm with you on this social Sim
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:51,327	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Program
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:54,655	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	That's a are either relevant to National
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:56,703	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Security or other
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:57,727	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Societally important
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:13:01,311	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Yeah so I think one of the things in this program we're really focused
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:02,335	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	On is
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:05,151	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Societal benefit as it relates to National
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:06,943	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Security so what's what's a great example of this
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:09,503	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	US military has a mission
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:11,551	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Humanitarian assistance and disaster
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:17,183	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So when there's a tsunami or flood or a typhoon and
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:19,487	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Foreign country we may be asked to go help
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:22,815	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And one of the things we have to combat in those situations
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:23,583	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	This is
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:25,119	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	The spread of rumors for exam
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:26,399	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:31,775	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	There's a recent story about a rumor spreading that the bottled water that the US
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:33,055	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Military was bringing
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:36,895	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Was containing line controlled substances and they were going to
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:38,431	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Use it to control the population
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:40,223	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Patently false
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:43,039	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	But it led to a lot of people getting very sick
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:43,807	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Because they weren't
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:44,575	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Drinking Safe Water
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:51,743	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So there's a very concrete example if we could understand why that particular message got traction why it spread the way it is
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:54,559	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	We could maybe help a little bit better and such situations
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:57,119	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Now I guess moving in an in an ashen
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:14:00,959	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	No security directions there's a phrase I've read maybe on your program page
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:02,239	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	That really catches
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:02,751	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Mayan
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:05,567	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And it's resolving conflicts
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:06,335	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Out
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:06,847	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Force
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:08,127	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Which sounds like a
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:09,663	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Terrific ideal
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:12,479	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Talk to me a little bit about that and the relationship
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:13,503	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	To the kind of working
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:15,295	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Yeah that the
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:16,575	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	US military
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:18,111	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Is very very good
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:19,135	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	At
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:21,439	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	The kinetic
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:23,487	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Parts of operation
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:26,303	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	In fact arguably without peer in many ways
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:28,095	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And I just want to point out for listener
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:33,983	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	A bikenetic that means things that are moving and you can think of it as metal moving through air
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:34,495	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Among other things
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:40,127	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	The military also tries to think about operations other than War
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:41,407	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:43,967	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	When we get into these humanitarian assistance
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:46,271	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Situations or we are trying to
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:48,063	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Advise
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:48,575	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Local Force
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:50,879	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	About what's going on
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:53,439	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	There's a lot of opportunity for us to make
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,207	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Huge difference
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:55,231	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Without
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:58,303	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Metal moving through air to use your phrase
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:01,119	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	That seems like a very very Noble goal
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:06,239	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	To me I want that I get very passionate about anytime you can save lives without
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:07,263	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Having two
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:09,055	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Be aggressive I think that's important
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:10,335	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	This
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:12,639	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Makes me understand a little bit more
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:14,175	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	About you and your passion for wanted
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:14,687	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Come here
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:17,503	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And having you have some sense that it
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:19,039	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Is possible for you too
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:21,343	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Move the the actual sort of
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:27,231	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Practice of warfare away from a kinetic and and bloody one into something that we're we're again,
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:27,743	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	What's the result
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:29,279	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Forsen
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:30,559	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And what comes with it
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:34,655	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	It's hard to not come into work in the morning and be passionate about
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:36,191	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	That kind of
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:42,591	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	That kind of statement okay course nothing is easy so the kinds of research that you were doing and which you were you're scaling
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:44,127	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Hang up your looking at a massive amount
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:46,175	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Social behavior
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:48,735	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	By way of social media so this is where people
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:50,527	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Are revealing things about the moon
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:53,087	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Their ethics issues including privacy
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:58,463	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So how are you thinking about those issues as you move forward in your program
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:15:59,999	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	There
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:03,071	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Front and center at a level that I don't know that it's been pushed
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:05,119	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So far in front and I'll tell you why
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:06,399	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	When you
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:07,935	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Study the behavioral sciences
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:11,007	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And you go through here's how to do human behavior experiment
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:14,079	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	I keep thinking about Bill Murray in Ghostbusters
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:16,639	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Where he's doing the the shock test
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:19,455	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	With the to see if people have ESP or not
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:22,271	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	He's breaking every ethical rule there is
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:24,319	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	That was very humorous but
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:27,647	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	When you do behavioral experiments you you have to get
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:34,047	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Informed consent and that means you have to have someone opt into doing this you have to show that there's minimal rescue
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:35,327	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	You have to go through
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:37,119	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	As a behavioral scientist I'm like
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:37,887	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Okay
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:39,679	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Now if you turn to the computer scientist
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:40,191	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Westworld
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:42,495	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	They don't but there's just data
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:47,359	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Thursday. They're like a whip there's data that's about human beings or coming from
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:51,199	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And therefore privacy protections are
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:51,711	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Paramount
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:55,807	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	A fun fact I don't know if you know this but if
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:17:00,671	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	You look at what is in this end-user license agreements that you click through without reading
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:03,999	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	There are things in there that give companies
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:07,583	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	This notion of informed consent to mess with your date I never read
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:12,447	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	That's where we need to provide some leadership we need to say yes if
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:15,775	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	We're interested in people's data and we want to understand Behavior
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:17,055	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And we want to do the science
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:18,335	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Of of behavior
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:20,127	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	We have to respect that from you
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:23,455	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So we've already run privacy and ethics Workshop
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:25,503	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	We have
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:27,551	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	External privacy Consultants that we work with
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:30,111	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Other programs that are for that are focused on
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:31,391	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Making sure we address privacy
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:35,487	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	It's interesting to DARPA is known for
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:41,375	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Breakthroughs in technology but it almost sounds to me like you might be moving toward some new territory even when it comes to
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:44,447	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Consenting and these kinds of privacy and ethics issue
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:47,263	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Absolutely I do know art director has said
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:52,639	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	It's not just our responsibility to prevent or anticipate strategic surprise
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:53,919	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	From a technology standpoint
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:58,015	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	But also from how we actually conduct the research and development that gets us.
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:03,647	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	I want to just talk a little bit more about social semi but I'd like you to do
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:05,695	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Jonathan is is give us a service status
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:09,023	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Where is this program at in its life cycle
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:10,303	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And I'm going to
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:11,583	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Askew
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:12,607	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	To get utopian
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:13,631	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Imagine
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:14,399	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	The best success
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:16,447	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So you can imagine what the program but so
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:17,471	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	First to satisfy
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:20,031	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	We have completed
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:22,847	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Source selection which is to say we received a number of
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:24,383	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Pretty amazing proposals
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:26,431	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So now we go into the process of
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:27,455	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Forgetting those folks
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:28,223	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Under contract
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:30,271	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And getting the program
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:31,295	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Off the ground
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:34,623	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And then as it gets off the ground and over the next couple of years
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:37,951	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	You're as we call our R&D Partners performers
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:38,463	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	DARPA
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:45,375	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	What is your what do you hope in several years when you bring the performers together and then you're you're having a
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:47,423	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	In a moment of Celebration that the
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:49,471	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Program is completed what do you help with
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:51,007	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Be the payoff the deliverable
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:57,663	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	A fuel changer is a changing the way this kind of research and development is done I don't think we are going to end up with
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:19:03,295	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Here is a correct model of how information spread I think what we're going to end up with
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:05,087	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Is a research community that
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:08,927	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Much More rigorously Much More scientifically
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:09,951	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Conduct
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:12,511	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	The process of building these kinds of mod
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:15,839	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And everybody moves forward from that point out
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:17,119	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	To the huge
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:21,727	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Massive possibly unbounded space of understanding human behavior
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:25,567	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Right and one of the things that's really fascinating about human behavior and I think how your
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:27,615	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Treatment program in thinking about it
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:29,663	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Is that social structures are
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:33,759	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Hierarchical wewe U&I Jonathan right now we are having a conversation this
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:34,271	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	What's a social structure
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:40,415	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	To Ben our audio engineer is with us so there's three people in our social structure in the studio
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:46,815	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	But go up from there at Unity so because we didn't go to neighborhoods we go to cities we go
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:51,935	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	All the way up to a global Community right so
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:54,751	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So there are
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:20:01,151	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	You are in one neighborhood you're also in a town it's not necessarily all hierarchical cuz you also maybe in the group of
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:07,039	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Fathers you may be in the group of Americans you may be in the group of people that live on streets called
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:07,807	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Edison Street
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:10,111	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And when you think about those different
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:11,391	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Categorization
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:14,207	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	What can you learn
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:17,023	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Apart from in the social behavior of each of those
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:22,399	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And that's one of the interesting challenges worth for trying to think about in the program is out of those different
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:27,263	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Let's call them resolutions are scales at which we can consider Behavior overlap and interact
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:30,079	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So how does your
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:31,615	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Identity as
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:35,711	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Bother overlap with your identity as an American
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:36,735	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Overlap with

EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:31,008	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Very excited about the societal benefits
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:33,056	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	I got excited about
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:38,688	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Making sure people get vaccinated appropriately making sure people get appropriate Healthcare
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:42,272	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	That during crises that were able to guide people in an appropriate way
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:46,624	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	I feel very strongly that those are the really beneficial aspects
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:48,160	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	But there's a darker
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:49,184	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Side to it as well
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:54,816	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Which is I want to be prepared if other nations governments
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:55,328	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Groups
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:56,864	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Decide to

EDL	00:21:58,912	00:21:59,424	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So correct
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:01,216	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And what do we do about that
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:05,312	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	I like to think about an income of 3 boxes
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:08,384	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	There's what is the US government going to do
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:10,944	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	We have a lot of laws regulate
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:13,760	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Patients that are very specific about how we communicate
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:17,600	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Boats with our population in foreign populations the same as these kinds of privacy in ethics
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:20,672	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	We also have
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:21,440	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	American corporation
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:23,488	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	That may have different rules
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:26,304	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	They may have got you to click on that end user license agreement
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:27,328	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And then we have
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:28,608	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Other folks in the world
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:34,496	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	That have very different perspectives on how you might use these kinds of models of social behavior so
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:36,544	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Perhaps there's an oppressive regime
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:39,872	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Perhaps there's a terrorist organization
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:41,408	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	That I want understand
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:45,504	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	How they're pushing out their messages and how they're creating influence in a way that
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:47,552	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	I don't think any of us wants
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:50,624	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Right now another thing then came in another conversation that you and I
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:55,488	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	The pad in which you kind of revealed to me that not only are you thinking about
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:56,512	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Really large
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:58,048	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Scales but you're also
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:58,816	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Thinking in
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:00,352	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	In terms of the smaller
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:01,376	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Are scales let's say in
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:02,400	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	In family units
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:06,496	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And the way our relationships information
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:07,520	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Technologies
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:09,568	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Changing the way we relate to
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:12,896	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Each other and to our machine so I'm referring to
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:17,248	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	The issue of politeness that you're and you have a little bit of a sample
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:20,064	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Right in your household tell me a little bit of the story what's your
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:22,880	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Observing about how
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:23,392	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Children
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:24,928	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Relate to machines now
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:26,976	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	This actually motivated some
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:28,000	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Some work that were funding
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:31,072	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	With my children we have
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:32,864	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Alexa and Amazon Echo in our
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:34,656	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	They liked it
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:36,192	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	4 jokes
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:38,752	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	I also like to ask fun questions like
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:41,824	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Alexa what's the smallest thing in it in the universe
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:43,104	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Alexa
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:45,920	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Which is pretty cool
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:48,736	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Don't say Alexa play music
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:50,272	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And then they'll say Dad
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:51,040	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Get me some juice
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:53,088	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	MSA
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:53,856	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Wait a second
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:57,696	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	That's not quite how you should speak to your father shouldn't you say
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:58,208	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Please
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:04,096	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And that led me to think quite a bit about etiquette and there's actually sociological models of etiquette
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:07,936	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	That describe where and how we use
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:09,216	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Phrases like please and thank you
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:14,336	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And to me this is a very natural place to go when you think about
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:16,384	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Depression spreading why does affirmations
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:17,920	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	How did those please
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:18,432	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Thank you
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:20,224	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Help or hinder
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:22,528	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	The information may may spread
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:24,064	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Are you
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:27,648	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Asking your daughters to be polite with Alexa
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:32,768	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	No I haven't but it raises a whole nother conversation about how we interact with
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:33,792	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Machines
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:37,376	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And do we see machines in the future as
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:38,656	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Partners
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:39,936	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Teammates
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:41,472	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Where do we see them at school
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:44,288	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And if we ever want to move beyond that
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:45,824	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	New Submachine says tools
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:48,384	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	We have to think about some of these sociological
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:49,920	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Principles of how we interact
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:53,504	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Okay so that actually gets to
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:54,272	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Another question
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:56,576	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	A big one that I wanted
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:57,344	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	To ask of you
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:57,856	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So you're talking about
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:25:02,208	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	How machines kind of our evolving along with us and
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:02,976	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	When I think about
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:04,768	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Robots
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:06,560	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And artificial intelligence annies
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:07,328	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Kinds of convergence
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:11,168	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Coming together yeah there are discussions out there about what happens
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:12,960	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	If we
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:14,496	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Develop artificial intelligence
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:16,800	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Tools we develop robots where are we
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:19,616	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Almost want to say or we do want to say
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:21,664	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	These are new types of
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:23,200	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Being
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:25,760	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Ethics comes in here in a huge way
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:29,344	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	If this is the case and it was never going to be thinking about machines
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:30,624	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Do we have to
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:32,672	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Think about what their rights are
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:36,768	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	I know you think about this a lot and I want you to
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:39,072	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Tell me and our listeners how you are thinking about
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:43,424	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Sure so let me just back up from the notion of Consciousness first
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:44,704	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And let's talk about emerging
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:50,080	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Emergence is a kind of fun word because if you start thinking about a society Society
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:53,408	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Is something that comes out of a bunch of individual
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:25:56,480	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Pretty interesting that something that
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:58,784	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Is it planned for can can appear almost
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:00,832	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	What does a surprise that we have this
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:05,440	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Organized Society in the physics world or the chemistry world I should say the properties of water
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:06,208	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Emerge
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:10,816	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Out of hydrogen and oxygen both of them gases in
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:12,096	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Normal conditions
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:16,192	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Neither of those has properties of water but when then combined in a chemical reaction
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:17,728	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	The Forum water then you have the emergency
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:19,264	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	I just want to
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:26,176	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Connect what you're saying emergence in social structures actually has a kind of correlating absolutely and if you go to termite
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:28,992	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Mounds and you go to ant colonies you see this
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:29,504	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Yeast
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:32,320	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	CDs amazing emergency
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:32,832	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Properties
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:35,904	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	It leads us to ask questions about
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:36,672	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Artificial intelligence
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:39,488	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	And it leads us down a path
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:40,512	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	2
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:43,072	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Looking where there have been emergent
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:46,912	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Interaction so if you follow the notion of flash crashes
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:47,424	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	On Wall Street
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:49,984	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	You have automated trading system
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:52,032	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Operating an a
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:53,056	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Regulated environment
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:54,592	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Competitively
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:55,616	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	End
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:58,432	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Occasionally they interact in a way that's
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:27:00,736	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So we have to ask yourself
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:01,760	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	If we're being honest
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:04,064	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	Way to say we can't always anticipate all of these
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:08,928	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	So with all of the discussion today that you hear about safe AI
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:11,232	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	DARPA I think needs to be thinking
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:12,768	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	10 years old
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:14,048	| Episode 10 The Social Simulator |	50 years out
