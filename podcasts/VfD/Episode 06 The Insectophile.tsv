EDL	00:00:55,296	00:00:59,392	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And he brings into DARPA particular love for the entomological kind Among Us
EDL	00:00:59,904	00:01:01,184	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Insects that is
EDL	00:01:01,184	00:01:04,256	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And he is betting that a combination of insects and genetics

EDL	00:01:05,024	00:01:08,608	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Can open new Pathways to protecting the crops we depend on

EDL	00:01:11,936	00:01:16,800	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	These are things like droughts and storms unintentional introduction of invasive species

EDL	00:01:18,336	00:01:20,640	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Release of plant harming biological warfare agent
EDL	00:01:21,920	00:01:23,968	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	He just rolled out his first project
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:24,992	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	I called insect allies
EDL	00:01:25,504	00:01:28,064	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Which is challenging the research Community to develop
EDL	00:01:28,064	00:01:29,856	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Plant protective viruses that insects
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:32,416	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Working at allies with us
EDL	00:01:32,416	00:01:37,792	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Can deliver efficiently to threaten plants and bestow protection on them in a single season time frame
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:39,072	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That can Stave off the
EDL	00:01:39,840	00:01:40,864	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	The thanks Blake
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:42,400	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	We're coming to the studio and spending some time with
EDL	00:01:42,912	00:01:44,192	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That's great to be here thanks for having me
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:50,592	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Before we talk about the insect allies program let's talk about you your background
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:51,360	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And the
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:52,384	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	What brings you to
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:58,016	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	I came to DARPA because I saw a fantastic opportunity for my research
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:01:58,528	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Community
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:00,576	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	The DARPA mission is
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:02,112	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Unlike things
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:04,672	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That I have done in the past
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:06,464	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Because the DARPA mission is to look at
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:08,256	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	High-risk high-reward
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:10,560	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Projects that could benefit
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:12,608	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Humanity in
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:15,168	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Acer that 2250 year time frame
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:18,496	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And it also gives an opportunity to do D risk
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:20,032	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Some
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:21,312	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Programs and some projects
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:23,872	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	So that they can act
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:24,896	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Play come to widen and
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:25,920	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Sia
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:26,944	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	See you soon
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:30,016	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	So when the opportunity to come DARPA
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:31,040	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Presented itself
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:31,552	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	I thought it was just
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:33,088	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Awesome chants
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:35,904	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Do some really great science and
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:38,976	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	I was encouraged because I was asked to think about things that
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:41,536	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Traditionally weren't funded very well
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:46,400	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That I think the women just suck you for a second cuz you said went when the opportunity presented itself
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:48,448	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Of course it didn't present itself somehow that
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:49,472	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That happened
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:54,592	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	I knew somebody or you you heard about an opportunity in opening so how how did you
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:03:00,992	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Actually yes sure so I was at a meeting and I had moved into an administrative role at the universe
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:02,784	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	First day of Texas at Tyler until we have an event
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:08,160	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Every year we come to DC and we get to meet program managers and I actually talked
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:09,440	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Call Jeff Lang Who is the
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:11,232	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Director of biologic
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:12,000	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Call Technologies
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:12,768	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Set the time
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:16,096	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And I wasn't sure that darker really had any interest in agriculture
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:17,376	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	So
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:18,656	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	But he was such an interest
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:20,192	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	The person I wanted meet talk to
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:24,032	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	So I talked to him after he gave his presentation
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:26,336	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	I said I don't know if we have any overlap and what were interest
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:31,200	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And but I would love to work with you at some point you said well actually
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:33,248	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	We're looking to get into
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:34,528	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	You know
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:37,344	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And that sort of started this journey of
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:40,416	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Seeing if I fit with the kind of mindset that
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:41,440	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	We have a DARPA
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:42,464	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Which is
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:45,792	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	You know these kind of difficult technologies that need to be developed
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:47,584	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	How that could benefit Humana
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:48,608	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And so it was
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:53,728	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	It was good for Tyler you were a professor biology but you also need another hat on
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:55,776	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Which was the assistant vice president for research
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:57,568	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Technology transfer
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:58,336	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Right so
EDL	00:03:58,336	00:04:00,896	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	So those are the two things that that also go on a DARPA
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:02,176	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	There are similarities there's
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:03,968	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	You know the people that you work with
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:05,760	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And you're directing a team to try to
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:08,064	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Achieve an objective
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:11,648	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And so we're definitely doing that and working in agriculture
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:12,672	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	It has a
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:13,184	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	The professor
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:18,047	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	You spend a lot of time where you go out and you think about the technologies that are out there in the
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:21,631	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	You know genetic-based molecular base things that are happening
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:23,679	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	But you'll have to marry that with
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:25,215	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	The reality of situation
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:28,799	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That's when you go to Central America and you walk in a potato field
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:31,103	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	How you start to realize that
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:32,383	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Technology is great
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:35,199	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	But how do you get that technology to the field
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:35,967	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That's actually get it too
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:36,735	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	To the finish line
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:41,599	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	So we'll talk about that with the insect allies program in just a month but there's one more thing I have to ask
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:42,367	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That's because
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:47,487	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	When you read your bio on on the dark web site Mill
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:51,839	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	The last line is very intriguing it says that you were
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:54,655	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	On the Discovery
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:57,471	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Channel reality TV show called tethered in
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:05:00,031	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	2014 so I just I just have to hear this
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:02,591	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	How did that happen what did you do with and
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:04,383	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	We were insects
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:07,967	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	To start off I am interested in Science Education
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:11,295	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And so I like the idea of putting a positive spin
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:15,391	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	In science not just the Bowtie wearing
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:16,927	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Geeky professor
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:18,719	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	You know type person as the
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:21,023	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Scientist but instead somebody that
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:24,351	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	No kids could aspire to be a
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:25,887	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Good strong normal
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:28,703	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Person and so there is an opportunity that came up to be
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:32,287	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Yeah on a reality show and the idea was that
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:35,359	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	When you're in a survival situation
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:38,687	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	People that are alone don't do as well as people that are
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:40,735	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Paired with somebody else or in a group
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:46,879	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And so this took it to the next level where I was literally tethered with a 6-foot
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:49,439	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	I cord to another human being
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:52,255	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And being that it's reality television
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:54,815	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	The promise was that I was the scientist
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:57,375	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And I was actually paired with a shaman
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:06:00,191	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And so we had very different ideas about how the world works
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:03,775	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That's all through the episode we had to learn to
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:06,079	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	I work together and get together on something
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:09,663	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	We actually became very good friends we survived
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:11,199	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Don't want to give the ending away
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:14,527	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Have I'm sitting here today so I must have worked out okay everyday
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:18,367	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	But I'll tell you that that experience was 100% real
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:23,999	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	They don't give you food they don't give you water so we had to boil all of our water where to find the food that
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:25,023	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Could sustain us
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:28,607	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And we didn't do really well I was in Alaska
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:31,935	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	At the end of the summer so there just wasn't a lot of food around
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:33,471	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:35,775	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	We ended up
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:38,847	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	At one point that logical aspect of this we ended up
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:42,943	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Finding a dead moose in the middle of a sandbar on a river
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:44,479	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:46,271	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	I decided that
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:49,855	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	I had to have that credibility as an entomologist so
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:52,927	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	We scooped them out of their cut them off and we ate
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:56,767	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Carcass maggots out of out of a moose
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:07:01,119	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Well okay that's actually might be a nice segue then to talk about
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:06,239	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Are your new program insect allies those maggots where your allies out there helped you survive
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:10,591	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Talk about the program here at DARPA what it is what's the program all about and what
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:14,687	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	So my broad interests
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:15,711	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	AR
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:17,503	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Sustaining agricultural
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:18,527	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Capabilities
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:20,063	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	So as we move forward
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:24,927	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	In the future when we're going to grow our population to 10 billion people in the neck
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:25,695	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Twenty two
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:26,207	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	50 years
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:29,279	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	How are we going to sustain the food so
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:33,887	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	7.3 billion now so were talking about in that period of time and I
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:35,167	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Free ride
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:42,079	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And our traditional agricultural approach is great and does does a really good job of
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:44,127	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Sustaining food supply right now but
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:46,687	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Forward-thinking what are we going to do
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:50,783	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And a future to innovate and and make things better
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:55,647	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And so insect allies really comes out of that born out of that wear
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:59,999	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	We want to utilize insects to deliver genes in plants
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:01,791	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That could benefit
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:03,327	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	The plant previously
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:05,631	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Capabilities were only in tissue culture
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:11,007	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And that meant that you had to grow up those plants after genetic modification
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:14,591	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And then you only find out if the genes do what you wanted to do
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:16,639	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	After you've gone through this sort of long pants
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:17,919	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Process
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:23,807	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	In a world where drought and threats from insects and pathogens are always around
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:27,135	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	How can we actually protect our plants in the fields where they are
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:31,999	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And so this mature plant transformation idea came about and then
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:33,791	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	At that presents a second problem
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:38,399	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	How do you actually get the genes into the plants where you want them delivered
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:41,215	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And so that's where the insect allies come about
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:42,239	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Insects
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:45,311	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Insect vectors in particular are very good at
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:46,591	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Moving
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:47,871	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	These pieces of
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:50,175	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Genetic material into plants
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:51,967	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Very efficiently and effectively
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:55,039	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Why couldn't we use that natural scenario
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:58,367	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	To actually move these genes in the plants
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:08:59,647	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Positive character
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:02,719	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	So that's what we want to do we want to use insects
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:05,791	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	To deliver genes in the plants that will benefit
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:07,839	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Right now
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:09,119	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	What are our up
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:09,631	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Options in case
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:12,447	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Crops are threatened somehow
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:12,959	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	By a pathogen
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:14,495	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Or some other threat
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:15,519	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	What would we do when an app
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:18,335	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Well currently what we do is we try to
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,615	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Contain the outbreak
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:23,967	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And so what that usually means that we have to destroy the crops that are in fact
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:25,503	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:27,039	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	You know if you
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:30,623	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Don't think too much about the situation that's just you burn some
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:34,463	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Unicorn fields or Rogue some trees in an orchard
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:38,047	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	But the reality is if you
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:40,351	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Ruin that seed source for the next year
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:41,887	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	You also impact the next year's for
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:42,911	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And the next year
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:47,775	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And so it's not a small problem to have one of these in basic problems come
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:50,335	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And then go into a slash-and-burn mode
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:51,615	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	What to eat to get rid of the disease
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:55,967	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	So if we could actually recover those crops very quickly
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:57,503	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And we could stop those eminent threats
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:00,063	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Then we wouldn't lose production
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:02,623	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	I mean you almost sounds like a little bit
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:05,183	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Like a medical model I mean if I go into 2
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:06,719	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Doctor's office
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,743	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That's because I'm not feeling well
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:08,511	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Well I might have
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:10,303	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	I might get some antibiotics and
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:12,607	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	In a week I'm feeling better I mean in some ways
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:13,119	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	It sounds a little bit
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:15,423	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Like that because your time frame here
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:17,471	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Saw the threat to
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:18,239	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	How to make OVA plant
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:21,311	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	You know better within very short time is that
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:25,407	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	All right. That's exactly right and you know it a good example of
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:27,711	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That's where this technology could really benefit would be
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:29,247	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	In a
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:30,015	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Tree
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:31,295	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Orchard type situation
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:34,111	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Mission in Florida right now they're dealing with Citrus Greening
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:37,439	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	This is a bacterial pathogen that is transmitted by an insect and
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:40,511	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Causes trees to decline rather quickly
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:44,863	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And the answer is you need to remove the trees and if you find out brakes
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:46,655	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	The disease you need to get rid of the
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:49,727	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And so entry crops
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:51,263	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Do you actually lose those trees
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:52,543	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	4
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:54,079	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Several years
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,615	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Because trees take awhile to
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:11:00,991	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	So those threats are are very bad so if you could actually
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:03,039	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Turn on genes that allow them to
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:03,551	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Survive
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:04,575	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	How that would be
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:09,183	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Okay because we are here at DARPA defense Advanced research
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:13,279	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	You're generally is a 1/3 of a national
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:14,559	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Security angle on
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:15,327	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Our project
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:15,839	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	EXO
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:18,655	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	What is that angle here for in technology
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:20,959	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Well there is really too far
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:23,775	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	So the first idea is that we want to protect our domestic
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:30,431	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	So if there was a threat that came in Weatherby environmental something like drought or
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:31,967	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Flooding
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:34,015	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Or if it was past that was
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:35,807	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Released
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:37,087	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Accidentally or
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,391	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Or on purpose
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:43,743	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Would want to be able to handle that challenge so that we don't destroy our food so
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:47,327	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Because there's a lot of evidence that shows that
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:49,631	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Unstable Foods
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:50,399	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Supply
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:51,679	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Leads to unstable
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:53,471	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And we definitely don't want that
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:55,263	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That kind of leads to the second part
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:57,311	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Which is international
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:58,335	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Food safety
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:59,103	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	In
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:00,639	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Unstable regions in the world
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:02,687	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Food stability water stability
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:04,479	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Are things that lead to
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:05,247	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Even less stable
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:08,831	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	So if we can have a hand at the beginning of that problem
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:11,647	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And provide sustainable food
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:13,183	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	2
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:14,207	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	These population
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:15,487	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	I think that that
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:16,511	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That definitely is a Nash
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:18,047	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Security concern and
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:18,815	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Not something that
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:20,351	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	We have the ability to
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:20,863	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Address now
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:23,167	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Okay let's dive in just
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:24,191	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	For a little while
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:24,959	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	On
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:25,727	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Biotechnology
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:27,263	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	You're pushing me to several
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:28,287	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Components
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:31,103	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	2/8 week but we've got the insect allies
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:33,407	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	But they're they're going to be the ones that are going to deliver
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:34,943	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Innocence the
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,479	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	The threat reducing
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:36,991	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Agent
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:39,295	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	A virus that you're going to
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:39,807	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Baby talk
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:41,087	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	What about it
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:42,623	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	The end result
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:46,207	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Components of insect allies
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:49,791	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	How you're going to maybe move that the state-of-the-art
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:55,679	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That's what's broken up into really three areas the virus so taking a virus at in
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:58,751	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Why do people think of viruses only in a bad context
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:00,287	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	But in reality viruses
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:03,615	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Can be benign they might move genetic
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:04,895	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Material around and
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:06,175	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Yunnan dangerous
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:09,503	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Swayze and so what we want to do is run identify viruses that
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:11,807	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	I have very limited negative
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:13,343	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Facts on on any host
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:14,367	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And then
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,391	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Remove any
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:16,159	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Possibility of naked
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:19,231	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And use those hazard
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:20,767	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Shuttles to get genetic
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:21,535	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Material
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:22,303	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Placed into the
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:26,143	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And so we're going to use insects which are
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:27,167	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Very good
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:29,215	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Movers of viruses
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:32,031	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	If you select the right virus and you select the right insect
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:35,615	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	I can be a very specific relationship so
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:39,711	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	I will have the opportunity to safeguard when you say specific
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:41,247	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	If if there's a certain
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:42,527	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Implant that is threatened
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:43,295	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	It will
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:45,343	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Go to those plants specifically antifreeze
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:47,135	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	10:20 of the species around hopf
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:48,415	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	They would ignore
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:53,791	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	There are generalists that will feed from a lot of different house plants those aren't the insects that we would select in this
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:56,607	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Are we want to select insects that
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:58,655	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Have a very specific relationship with
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:00,703	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Maybe a single species
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:01,983	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	So
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:04,799	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	If used in this way they're not going to go feed on everything that's out there
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:06,335	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	So it's a very specific
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:11,199	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Okay maybe to make this concrete can you imagine a unit potential Center
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:14,783	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	A specific crop that has a specific threat
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:16,063	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Onnit
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:16,575	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:19,135	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Then what kind of virus you might
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:21,695	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Devise to treat it how you would get that into an incel
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:23,743	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Mitigate
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:26,815	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	All I can think of a lot of ideas
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:33,215	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That well but I think what we want to do is ask our our performer Community want to go out and ask the research
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:33,983	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Community
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:40,383	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	What are these major threats what specific relationships do they see that can be utilized in this way at 2
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:44,991	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	This is very open program and we're going to ask the research community academic
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:48,063	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	To come to us and tell us
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:50,623	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	What problems need to be addressed and what are the players
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:53,183	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Okay so rather than specifying a
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:54,975	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	This point you want to keep this open and
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:57,279	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Isn't that what you maximize art of the creative
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:58,303	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Full potential of your
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:14:59,071	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Performer Bass
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:14:59,839	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Face the research base
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:06,239	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Right eye I know so many people out there and Academia other that have great ideas I want to give them a chance to come
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:07,263	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Come in and tell us what they need
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:10,847	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Need to address that way we can speak a little bit generally though about some of the molecular
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:12,383	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Or tools cuz I think probably what
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:13,151	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	One of the things
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:14,687	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Gives you such strength in moving
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:16,223	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Forward with what really isn't ambitious
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:16,991	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	His program
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:20,319	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Is because we really been seeing some new remarkable
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:21,343	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	What kinds of molecular
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:24,159	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Atul maybe can just talk about one or two of those
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:25,695	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	But our listeners a sense
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:33,887	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Sure they revolution in molecular biology has been based around the 2012 finding
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:35,423	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Crisper cast 9
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:37,727	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	A new utilization of that tool
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:39,775	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And just briefly an odor that's a mouthful
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:42,079	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	One sentence or two of that what that
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:42,847	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Should have done
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:48,991	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	So crisper cast 9 is a molecular tool that allows you to edit the Genome of a host and it doesn't have it
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:50,527	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Specific way
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:51,551	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	So that
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:53,087	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Cuts in the genome
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:55,135	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Are based on a
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:55,903	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Couple of letters
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:58,207	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That's very specific where it will go so
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:16:01,023	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Traditionally when you've done genetic modification you end up
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:03,327	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	How to putting it into the genome
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:04,351	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And hoping that it goes to the
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:04,863	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Right place
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:10,239	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	These new tools allow us to be very specific and and where it's play so it doesn't interrupt
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:10,751	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Change that
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:12,799	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	There are needed
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:15,871	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Okay and so so that means that that there's all kinds of threats after
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:18,943	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	If we know something about the genetic basis of those
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:21,503	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Then we can use a tool like crispr cast 9
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,807	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Going very specifically
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:25,343	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And maybe do a kind of genetic fix
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:28,671	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And that can happen in in in a single season
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:29,439	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And thereby
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:31,999	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	A new way of
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:33,791	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Food supply
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:37,375	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Write a lot of these Gene cassettes that we would use to solve
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:38,911	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	These problems are
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:39,935	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Already being looked
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:44,543	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And a good example would be flood resistant rice
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:45,311	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That's
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:52,479	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That's out there a suite of genes is known Rida sweet of genes that would allow it to
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:54,527	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Surviving difficult
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:57,599	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Situations there's the same type of Technology that's being found
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:58,623	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	For high salinity
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:00,927	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Drought resistant drought
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:01,439	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Tolerance
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:07,327	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And so if we could actually figure out a way to put those jeans into the crops that were interested in
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:09,375	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Then we could get through those bats
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:09,887	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Situations
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:13,983	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Alright so this this sounds like a great idea we're going you know our population key
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:16,031	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	It's going up maybe we're going to reach 10 billion
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:16,543	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	We're going to want
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:19,359	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Abundant and safe food supplies
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:21,151	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Thing to do
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:26,783	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	But this is just only one way you are interested in the human insect relationship
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:31,135	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	But you have some other ideas I think about how well our partnership with insects might
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:32,415	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Expand me if you can
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:38,047	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Yeah so I've also been interested in alternative protein sources
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:40,351	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And so I have a
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:41,887	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Program
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:43,935	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	India sbir program
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:47,519	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And that svr that.
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:49,311	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	We're actually looking at
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:52,127	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Delivering high protein sources
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:53,407	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	From insects
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:54,175	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	But also
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:58,271	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Using technology to improve our ability to do that so
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:18:00,319	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	One side of it might be too
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:04,671	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Used technology to manage Pest and pathogen
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:07,487	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Problems in insect Colony rearing
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:12,607	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	So could we shutdown viral infections in these colonies that usually cause inside
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:13,887	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Claps
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:20,799	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	So we talkin about the the bee collapse issue for Mor ryde and there's a whole host of
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:23,871	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Viruses that cause that same problem in other insects
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:24,639	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Species and so
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:25,919	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	In
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:29,247	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Crickets for example which are probably one of the most popular
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,271	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Edible insects
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:33,599	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Producers out there
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:39,231	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	There's a similar virus that causes collapsed their colonies so if you were one of the companies that was doing this
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:44,607	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	An invasion of the virus might cause a complete collapse of all of your
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,143	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Livestock
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:49,471	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Small light socket
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:56,639	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That's so and then we can go the other direction and actually utilize these insects to also deliver
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:57,407	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Anita
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:19:01,503	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Nutrients like vitamin A vitamin C vitamin D
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:03,039	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	A whole host of
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:06,879	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Five different ideas are there there's really no lack and ideas of what it could
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:07,647	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	The prettiest butt
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:09,695	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	We could actually develop insects
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:11,743	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Edible insects into a
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:14,815	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Realm where not only can they feed an Asian but
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:15,839	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	They can also deliver
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:17,631	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Additional
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:18,143	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Resources
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:21,983	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Now have you already practice what you seem to be preaching here which
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:23,263	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	To say that insects might be
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:24,287	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Comfort of the pantry
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:27,871	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	So have you eaten absolutely
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:33,759	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And you know it's it's funny I realized that people have an aversion to this there's a new version of this in my own family
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:36,319	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That's why I understand it very well
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:38,111	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	However 80% of the world
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:40,671	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Eats insects as a stable protein source
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:41,183	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And so
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:45,791	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	You know the Western World were kind of an oddity where we don't utilize the
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:46,303	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	This sad
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:47,583	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Opportunity so
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:48,863	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Again
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:50,911	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	You know there's great sources of protein right now
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:53,983	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That everybody enjoys if you like steak
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:54,751	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Like if you like chicken
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:55,775	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And if you like all these others
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:20:00,127	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Thanks but again we get to a point where our population continues to rise
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:04,223	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	We're going to need to have alternative sources so we're really thinking into the future
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:06,783	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Remembering it
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:08,319	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	The early out of the conversation you did mention
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:11,135	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	I thought you found those when they were with maggots
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:13,183	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Are maggots is in the moose
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:17,535	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	So among the various insects that you Pride somehow I imagine you try crickets
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:23,935	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Where where do they stand with maggots great where they not as good as something else you know honestly the mag
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:28,287	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	I guess were relatively tasteless but I cooked them with a little bit of
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:28,799	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Different
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:30,591	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Locally sourced
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:32,127	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Alaskan Fireweed
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:36,735	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	So they were delicious they it actually took on the flavor of what you cook them with
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:42,623	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Blake is there a question that I should have asked you that I didn't or just
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:44,415	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That are you wish I hadn't if so
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:45,951	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	You can even mascot
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:49,279	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	We should have asked me
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:51,071	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Why I'm interested in insects
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:52,095	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And all of that question
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:55,679	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And the answer is I haven't always been
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:21:00,543	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	I didn't grow up as a child wanting to be an entomologist I didn't have inside
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:01,055	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Collections
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:04,127	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Brother I was interested in the world in general
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:04,639	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	How things were
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:09,247	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And so that Drew me to biology when I was a college student and
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:15,903	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Through my college classes I was at the University of Northern Iowa I randomly took an entomology class
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:21,792	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And it opened up this idea that we could ask these biological questions
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:23,072	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And we could use insect
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:24,096	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	To answer that
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:27,680	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And they're living organisms they are abundant
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:29,472	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And I also realize that
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:32,288	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Going into my career in as an academic
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:34,336	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That we're always going to need to eat
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:37,152	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And so funding for agriculture is
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:38,176	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	There's always going to be around
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:43,040	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And so it was a good way to actually marry some of the ideas but I had
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:45,088	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Asking questions about the world
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:49,440	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And then also working in field that super important because
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:51,232	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Food security is going to be a
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:53,280	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	A big problem going forward
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:56,608	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	So I ended up as an entomologist out of
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:59,424	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Hey this is a great way to ask questions that I want to answer
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:02,752	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	It's the one of the things that fascinates me
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:04,800	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	This year at DARPA and having a
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:05,568	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Virginity to
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:07,104	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Get to know a lot of
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:09,408	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Different Technologies in the making potential
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:13,248	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	These are technologies that have the potential
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:15,296	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	How to do a lot of good but they're there also
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:17,088	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	I'll bring in capability
EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:18,368	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Is that could be used for nefarious
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:22,208	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	So the case you're of developing new kinds of
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:23,744	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Ways of getting getting genetic
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:24,512	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Material into live
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:25,024	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Who sings this
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:26,304	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Plants
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:28,096	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That sounds like a great thing when it comes to
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:30,144	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	To crop protection but it also sounds to me like
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:31,936	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Like it could open doors to new kinds of
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:32,704	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	What's a biologic
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:34,496	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	What are your thoughts
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:39,616	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Well I think that there are potential negatives that could
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:40,640	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Come out of
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:41,920	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Technology being developed
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:44,480	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Yes but I think the overwhelming
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:47,040	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Thought is that
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:47,552	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	This is a
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:54,208	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	There's much easier ways to cause a large agricultural damage and regions
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:57,024	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That certainly wouldn't have to
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:58,048	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Tackle this
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:59,072	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Level of service
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:01,888	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	And so
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:04,192	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That there's there's definitely much more Bennett
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:04,704	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Let them rest
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:07,776	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Right I mean to sexually could have go down deep into the
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:09,312	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Killer machine
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:12,640	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	It is probably a lot harder than what
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:17,504	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Just going in and spraying chemicals or something from chemicals or identifying viruses or pests
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:20,576	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	But you know aren't in the region that you could bring in and release
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:23,648	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	It's a really that's what we want to guard against
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:28,000	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	There is the potential that technology like this can be used for nefarious
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,024	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Purposes
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:30,560	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	You know that
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:31,328	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Positive
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:34,144	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	That can come out of this in the world changing
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:36,192	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	Abilities that we're going to gain is fizzing
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:40,032	| Episode 06 The Insectophile |	I just want to thank you for like for this great conversation wanted to watch
