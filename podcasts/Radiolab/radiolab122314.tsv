EDL	00:00:36,608	00:00:37,376	| radiolab122314 |	Fun things
EDL	00:00:37,888	00:00:39,424	| radiolab122314 |	It seemed priceless
EDL	00:00:39,424	00:00:41,728	| radiolab122314 |	Priceless priceless
EDL	00:00:45,312	00:00:47,360	| radiolab122314 |	Okay so start bring on the pressure
EDL	00:00:48,128	00:00:49,408	| radiolab122314 |	To tell it to
EDL	00:00:49,408	00:00:52,992	| radiolab122314 |	Sorry we can start the show with a story from our producer Molly Webster
EDL	00:00:53,760	00:00:56,576	| radiolab122314 |	So we might actually want to rename Ali Wong sister
EDL	00:00:56,576	00:01:00,928	| radiolab122314 |	Because she said she recently got herself into some serious numero sizing
EDL	00:01:00,928	00:01:04,768	| radiolab122314 |	Actually didn't start as a wonky thing it starts at 2 with some medical journal
EDL	00:01:05,280	00:01:08,864	| radiolab122314 |	So that was that was interesting because it was some of the most
EDL	00:01:10,144	00:01:13,728	| radiolab122314 |	Poetic writing I've seen out of doctors
EDL	00:01:13,728	00:01:14,240	| radiolab122314 |	Ever
EDL	00:01:14,752	00:01:21,152	| radiolab122314 |	One Journal article said like what would one more month mean to a 37 year old mother who has
EDL	00:01:21,152	00:01:22,176	| radiolab122314 |	For children
EDL	00:01:22,176	00:01:28,320	| radiolab122314 |	Or what would one more month mean if you are a 67 year-old who's about to go traveling around the world
EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:32,160	| radiolab122314 |	People were just kind of like drifting these questions out there
EDL	00:01:32,672	00:01:35,744	| radiolab122314 |	All these questions seem to circle around
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:39,328	| radiolab122314 |	The seemingly simple story of the pricing of a drug
EDL	00:01:39,328	00:01:40,096	| radiolab122314 |	Cancer
EDL	00:01:40,096	00:01:41,376	| radiolab122314 |	And the story
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:45,216	| radiolab122314 |	If you really want to tell it from the beginning it begins with this guy named Leonard
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:51,616	| radiolab122314 |	Leonard saltz I'm a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center witches here New York
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:54,944	| radiolab122314 |	It's one of the largest cancer centers in the country we have
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:56,480	| radiolab122314 |	17 doctors here who
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:57,248	| radiolab122314 |	Curry College
EDL	00:01:57,248	00:01:58,784	| radiolab122314 |	Just for colon cancer
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:01:59,808	| radiolab122314 |	Very large number
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:01,344	| radiolab122314 |	It's a huge Hospital
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:04,416	| radiolab122314 |	And one of the things Leonard's been noticing in the last
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:05,440	| radiolab122314 |	Decade
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:11,584	| radiolab122314 |	Is cancer drug prices have just gone through the roof I mean we have drugs out there that are many hundreds of dollars
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:14,912	| radiolab122314 |	Really yeah just wait
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:16,704	| radiolab122314 |	Let's see where's the start it starts
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:18,752	| radiolab122314 |	It's June in 2012
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:22,080	| radiolab122314 |	Leonard saltz is at a conference and at this conference is
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:23,616	| radiolab122314 |	Is a pharmaceutical company called Santa Fe
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:25,408	| radiolab122314 |	And they
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:27,456	| radiolab122314 |	Give a presentation about a new drug that they
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:31,040	| radiolab122314 |	A drug called zaltrap and zell trap
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:32,576	| radiolab122314 |	Is a drug that
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:35,392	| radiolab122314 |	Without getting into the science too much
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:36,416	| radiolab122314 |	Target
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:38,208	| radiolab122314 |	The blood supply to the tumor
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:40,512	| radiolab122314 |	Cut off the blood supply which means a tumor
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:42,304	| radiolab122314 |	That's that's the
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:43,072	| radiolab122314 |	Scientific iPod
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:47,424	| radiolab122314 |	The new drug is presented and they like present the data and they showed
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:49,216	| radiolab122314 |	That the
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:50,496	| radiolab122314 |	Survival difference
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:52,544	| radiolab122314 |	Between the people who got soundtrack in the people
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:54,336	| radiolab122314 |	Was 1.4 month
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:55,360	| radiolab122314 |	42 days
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:57,408	| radiolab122314 |	In other words if you take this drug
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:58,176	| radiolab122314 |	You could get
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:02:59,456	| radiolab122314 |	42 more days of life
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:00,224	| radiolab122314 |	On average
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:05,856	| radiolab122314 |	Which means you could get three more days you could get no days you could get 42 or you could live another 3 years
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:07,904	| radiolab122314 |	242 days
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:14,048	| radiolab122314 |	Don't please I could show you some graphs have been put up at meetings that show
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:16,096	| radiolab122314 |	Survival curves
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:18,144	| radiolab122314 |	Calculate it out
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:19,936	| radiolab122314 |	To two decimal places in terms of months
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:21,728	| radiolab122314 |	I'm look at the
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:23,776	| radiolab122314 |	100 of a month
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:26,080	| radiolab122314 |	A hundred a month that's a little over 7 hours
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:27,360	| radiolab122314 |	Free
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:30,176	| radiolab122314 |	Amusing acted why would you why would you
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:31,200	| radiolab122314 |	It's pseudo precision
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:31,712	| radiolab122314 |	Pseudobursa
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:34,528	| radiolab122314 |	Anyways after the conference
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:38,880	| radiolab122314 |	The FDA approves the drug and basically once the FDA approves a drug
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:44,256	| radiolab122314 |	Public insurance has to take it and then the private insurance companies just follow suit
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,024	| radiolab122314 |	Which means
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:46,560	| radiolab122314 |	You get prescribed the drug and people pay
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:48,352	| radiolab122314 |	What is the drug cost
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:49,888	| radiolab122314 |	That's the thing it cause
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:52,960	| radiolab122314 |	Roughly 3004
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:53,984	| radiolab122314 |	Three-month course
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:56,032	| radiolab122314 |	Soap
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:58,848	| radiolab122314 |	Stew Leonard's like wow that is expensive
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:04,224	| radiolab122314 |	And there was already another drug on the market did the same thing and it cost half as much
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:09,088	| radiolab122314 |	To put that in context this is just one drug that's $11,000 a month
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:15,488	| radiolab122314 |	A normal cancer patient might take dozens of drugs there are anti-nausea medicines that are sometimes used to that
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:21,119	| radiolab122314 |	Getting in the range of 90 to $100 a tablet you take a tablet once a day for 3 days
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:27,519	| radiolab122314 |	One needs growth factors to help support the white blood cell count which is sometimes need and chemo those can be five
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:33,919	| radiolab122314 |	$1,000 every two to three weeks if you need antibiotics to treat infections those aren't cheap and and then you need a pharmacist
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:40,319	| radiolab122314 |	Prepare their labor-intensive need tubing and equipment and needles to give it and he trained nurses to administer if you need to talk
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:46,719	| radiolab122314 |	To take care of the patient and don't forget there's a cost for a CAT scan or MRI and and then of course someone's got to pay for the realest
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:47,487	| radiolab122314 |	State the heat in the lights
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:50,559	| radiolab122314 |	None of those prices are figured into it
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:53,375	| radiolab122314 |	I'm just giving you
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:53,887	| radiolab122314 |	The
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:55,423	| radiolab122314 |	Cost of the truck
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:58,495	| radiolab122314 |	So Leonard calls up one of his colleagues
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:00,031	| radiolab122314 |	My name is Peter ba
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:05,919	| radiolab122314 |	I'm a physician at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Peter the number cruncher of the group he does the statistical analysis
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:07,967	| radiolab122314 |	I don't know what the cost of care
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:10,015	| radiolab122314 |	And then grabbed him and ran him through
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:14,879	| radiolab122314 |	And we walked through the out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare beneficiaries
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:16,415	| radiolab122314 |	Medicare beneficiaries
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:17,951	| radiolab122314 |	If they don't have additional insurance
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:24,607	| radiolab122314 |	20 cents of every dollar they pay out-of-pocket have hit him because he realize for Medicare patients
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:27,679	| radiolab122314 |	They be paying something like $2,000
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:29,215	| radiolab122314 |	Out-of-pocket every month
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:32,799	| radiolab122314 |	For justice truck 2200 if I remember the number correctly
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:34,079	| radiolab122314 |	For a lot of Medicare patients
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,359	| radiolab122314 |	All of their money
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:37,407	| radiolab122314 |	Nevermind other drugs
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:38,687	| radiolab122314 |	That
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,991	| radiolab122314 |	When I thought we should go public with it
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:44,319	| radiolab122314 |	Memorial Sloan-Kettering they decide to boycott
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:44,831	| radiolab122314 |	This truck
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:48,927	| radiolab122314 |	Now
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:50,207	| radiolab122314 |	Is that
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:52,767	| radiolab122314 |	I mean I'm just stopping you because
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:58,911	| radiolab122314 |	When you guys made that decision was that that feels like a big deal it did feel like a big deal and it felt like a big enough deal that
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:00,447	| radiolab122314 |	We decided to write
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:01,983	| radiolab122314 |	The op-ed piece in the New York Times
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:08,383	| radiolab122314 |	They write an op-ed in the times that basically says look this is crazy $11,000 a month for a drug that made
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:11,199	| radiolab122314 |	Baby gives you 42 more days of life is that worth it
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:15,039	| radiolab122314 |	Little less than a month after the op-ed piece came out
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:18,623	| radiolab122314 |	The company that makes eltropy went to individual doctor's office
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:20,927	| radiolab122314 |	Sent representatives and said
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:23,487	| radiolab122314 |	We are offering a 50% discount
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:24,767	| radiolab122314 |	Because
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:26,047	| radiolab122314 |	Price in half just like that
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:29,631	| radiolab122314 |	Yep Nationwide or like just in this area
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:31,167	| radiolab122314 |	It was sort of in
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:39,615	| radiolab122314 |	We reached out to Santa Fe to talk about the prices out rap and they decline to comment
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:43,199	| radiolab122314 |	In a statement that they released when this holes out that thing happened
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:44,479	| radiolab122314 |	They said that
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:46,527	| radiolab122314 |	They incur so many costs
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:49,855	| radiolab122314 |	For researching and developing and bringing a drug to Market
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:51,647	| radiolab122314 |	But that is what the pricing is
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:54,719	| radiolab122314 |	Leonard doesn't disagree we need these companies
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:56,511	| radiolab122314 |	They're the ones developing the truck
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:07:00,863	| radiolab122314 |	Which aren't easy to develop I mean Leonard gave us just one example
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:02,143	| radiolab122314 |	If we talk about colon care
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:05,215	| radiolab122314 |	He says four years there was only one drug on the market
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:06,239	| radiolab122314 |	Called 5-fu
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:09,823	| radiolab122314 |	5-fu was patented in August of 1957
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:11,615	| radiolab122314 |	It was from 1957
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:14,175	| radiolab122314 |	Until 1996
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:16,479	| radiolab122314 |	That a second drug came along
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:18,783	| radiolab122314 |	That's how long it takes to develop a good
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:22,879	| radiolab122314 |	Drug or that interim that were over 70 drugs that were tried and failed
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:27,999	| radiolab122314 |	Didn't like I don't get enough credit cuz that just astounded me it's very very hard
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:33,375	| radiolab122314 |	And that according to Leonard is one of the reasons why prices are just going to keep going up
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:33,887	| radiolab122314 |	But
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:35,935	| radiolab122314 |	Sooner or later this system
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:37,471	| radiolab122314 |	Is going to fall apart
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:39,007	| radiolab122314 |	And it would point
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:40,799	| radiolab122314 |	The society say
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:43,871	| radiolab122314 |	There isn't an infinite number of dollars
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:45,919	| radiolab122314 |	We can commit to our Healthcare System
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:50,015	| radiolab122314 |	It's funny because I have an interesting reaction to the word Society
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:53,087	| radiolab122314 |	Salveson I thought likewise
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:57,439	| radiolab122314 |	Not not like a dino crazy death panel white but
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:58,463	| radiolab122314 |	I thought y
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:02,559	| radiolab122314 |	Why is society involved in my conversation
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:04,351	| radiolab122314 |	With my doctor about
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:06,655	| radiolab122314 |	If I want to take this drug that may give me
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:08,447	| radiolab122314 |	Another month and a half of life
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:09,983	| radiolab122314 |	Why is society involved
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:11,263	| radiolab122314 |	Cuz you're not paying
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:12,799	| radiolab122314 |	Unless
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:14,335	| radiolab122314 |	You have
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:17,663	| radiolab122314 |	Hidden resources I'm aware of probably couldn't afford
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:19,967	| radiolab122314 |	10 to $15,000 a month
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:22,271	| radiolab122314 |	Someone else
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:25,343	| radiolab122314 |	Obviously he says it's your insurance
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:29,695	| radiolab122314 |	Say you're part of a policy that has 1000 members
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:32,255	| radiolab122314 |	Let's say that the premium
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:32,767	| radiolab122314 |	For that
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:34,303	| radiolab122314 |	Is
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:34,815	| radiolab122314 |	$100
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:37,119	| radiolab122314 |	So we had $100
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:38,399	| radiolab122314 |	Thousand people
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,935	| radiolab122314 |	We got to come down and out
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:42,495	| radiolab122314 |	Okay can we now have $100,000
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:45,311	| radiolab122314 |	To take care of that thousand people
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:49,407	| radiolab122314 |	Whatever Matt time if now one person
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:52,223	| radiolab122314 |	Comes up with a healthcare cost let's say it's for a month
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:54,015	| radiolab122314 |	That is
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:57,087	| radiolab122314 |	$100,000 in that month
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:58,367	| radiolab122314 |	Everybody else is in trouble
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:03,231	| radiolab122314 |	So
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:04,767	| radiolab122314 |	They write this op-ed
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:07,327	| radiolab122314 |	Saying my prices are too high in the drugs are not
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:10,399	| radiolab122314 |	Decorate and sort of the next like notable wave is
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:13,215	| radiolab122314 |	There was this there's this journal called
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:18,079	| radiolab122314 |	Blood which is really big to anybody that works in a community that Hamlet called blood
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:21,151	| radiolab122314 |	How did we not know about this we make the blood show
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:27,551	| radiolab122314 |	Just kept it in here Journal called blood which is basically like
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:31,647	| radiolab122314 |	The journal for anybody that works in a field that has to do with blood
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:34,463	| radiolab122314 |	What happens is like
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:36,767	| radiolab122314 |	100 doctors get together and they
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:38,559	| radiolab122314 |	Cosine and editorial
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:40,095	| radiolab122314 |	Which basically says
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:43,935	| radiolab122314 |	I totally agree with everything you guys are saying but we haven't even bigger issue
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:47,519	| radiolab122314 |	You know was out rap you're talkin about an expensive drug
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:48,799	| radiolab122314 |	Maybe doesn't really do that much
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:51,871	| radiolab122314 |	It's kind of easy even though I had never been done before
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:53,151	| radiolab122314 |	To say we're not going to use this
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:54,687	| radiolab122314 |	What all of these
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:56,991	| radiolab122314 |	Doctors in the blood editorial or saying
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:58,783	| radiolab122314 |	What do you do when you have a really
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:09:59,551	| radiolab122314 |	Expensive drug
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:01,599	| radiolab122314 |	It's really really good
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:03,647	| radiolab122314 |	I could drag you actually want
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:10,559	| radiolab122314 |	It is that like a like a one day in the future we will face is going to question now today
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:19,263	| radiolab122314 |	The most important new medicine approved this year everyone I talked to pointed me to this new drug sovaldi
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:25,407	| radiolab122314 |	Known as the sovaldi
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:27,455	| radiolab122314 |	Sovaldi came on the market last
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:30,271	| radiolab122314 |	December 5th December 2013
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:31,295	| radiolab122314 |	That's correct
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:34,879	| radiolab122314 |	This is Bruce small I'm the editor of Commonwealth magazine
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:37,439	| radiolab122314 |	He's written about sovaldi and here's the basic story right
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:40,511	| radiolab122314 |	It is a drug that treats
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:41,791	| radiolab122314 |	Hepatitis
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:45,375	| radiolab122314 |	Which is caused by a virus and the disease itself
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:47,167	| radiolab122314 |	Goes to work on your liver
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:48,703	| radiolab122314 |	It inflames it
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:53,567	| radiolab122314 |	It's cars that can cause liver cancer cirrhosis that can be fatal
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:58,431	| radiolab122314 |	And for the longest time the treatments that they had just really weren't that great or they just had
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:10:59,711	| radiolab122314 |	Ratchet side of
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:01,759	| radiolab122314 |	But along comes to Vault
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:04,831	| radiolab122314 |	And it's one pill 12 weeks
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:08,159	| radiolab122314 |	To take it with some other antiviral meds it is a super simple treatment option
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:10,975	| radiolab122314 |	And the side effects are very minimal
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:12,767	| radiolab122314 |	Like this it was like kind of
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:13,791	| radiolab122314 |	Like the savior
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:16,351	| radiolab122314 |	And so a lot of doctors start
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:18,399	| radiolab122314 |	Describe it in the first half
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,423	| radiolab122314 |	2004
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:19,935	| radiolab122314 |	14
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:21,215	| radiolab122314 |	70000
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:23,007	| radiolab122314 |	The country in the United
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:27,359	| radiolab122314 |	And it had a 95%
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:28,127	| radiolab122314 |	Rate of
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:28,895	| radiolab122314 |	Sure
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:29,919	| radiolab122314 |	In other words
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:31,455	| radiolab122314 |	Cow
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:32,735	| radiolab122314 |	That's very big
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:36,575	| radiolab122314 |	In fitting with our story this drug
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:38,367	| radiolab122314 |	Cost $1,000
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:38,879	| radiolab122314 |	The pill
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:44,511	| radiolab122314 |	For like one one pill that I take one a day
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:55,007	| radiolab122314 |	Which as you can imagine and angered a lot of people with hep C in total it costs
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:56,287	| radiolab122314 |	$84,000
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:59,103	| radiolab122314 |	And if you think about the fact that in
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:04,991	| radiolab122314 |	2014 we know at least 70000 people got this drug you're starting to talk about
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:08,831	| radiolab122314 |	Serious money I just want to say that I
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:14,463	| radiolab122314 |	I just X doubt 70000 * 84000
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:16,511	| radiolab122314 |	And I got something with seven zeros in it
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:19,583	| radiolab122314 |	588 and then there's seven zeros which is like
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:21,887	| radiolab122314 |	Abbott 5 billion dollars
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:22,399	| radiolab122314 |	Yes
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:27,263	| radiolab122314 |	The big question is how States will pay
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:30,591	| radiolab122314 |	For what could be upwards of until we have a situation where
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:36,991	| radiolab122314 |	States are basically having to ration is currently are requiring
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:38,527	| radiolab122314 |	Some liver damage
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:43,135	| radiolab122314 |	Before you can take the drug similar restrictions are happening in other states
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:49,279	| radiolab122314 |	Florida happening in Oregon Illinois
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:52,863	| radiolab122314 |	And then there's Arizona out of the entire state
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:55,935	| radiolab122314 |	Public insurance only approves 180 people for treat
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:59,519	| radiolab122314 |	Adjust 180 just 180
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:03,615	| radiolab122314 |	Now when I talk to a representative of the company that makes the drug
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:05,663	| radiolab122314 |	Greg Alton jacket vice president for
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:07,711	| radiolab122314 |	Corporate and medical Affairs for Gilead Sciences
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:09,247	| radiolab122314 |	He says you got to keep in mind
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:15,647	| radiolab122314 |	This is not a chronic care situation this is a sure actually curing a person of a disease we're talkin
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,415	| radiolab122314 |	In about
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:17,695	| radiolab122314 |	12 weeks of therapy
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:19,999	| radiolab122314 |	Period that's it and you're done and you cared so
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:21,023	| radiolab122314 |	So he says
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:25,119	| radiolab122314 |	This is a one-time deal was like one time $84,000
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:28,959	| radiolab122314 |	And then you're done think about all the years you live without having an illness
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:33,311	| radiolab122314 |	Then you'll see 20 year. The savings that will accrue to the system
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:35,871	| radiolab122314 |	By having a patient cured of hepatitis C
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:38,175	| radiolab122314 |	He also said it's important to understand
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:41,503	| radiolab122314 |	That every hepatitis C suffer is not going to hit
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:42,271	| radiolab122314 |	System
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:44,319	| radiolab122314 |	At the same time so all of the
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:45,599	| radiolab122314 |	Cost
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:46,879	| radiolab122314 |	Is spread out right
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:50,463	| radiolab122314 |	Wichita totally true but I think there's like the bigger picture here
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:55,071	| radiolab122314 |	I Am Bruce pointed out to it's sort of like a precursor of what could
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:56,095	| radiolab122314 |	Come because
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:57,887	| radiolab122314 |	These companies
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:14:00,447	| radiolab122314 |	Are developing drugs all the time what if
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:04,031	| radiolab122314 |	If you could get a drug but it was very expensive to treat diabetes
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:07,871	| radiolab122314 |	And then you're talking tens of millions of
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:10,431	| radiolab122314 |	Enormous segment of the population
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:14,527	| radiolab122314 |	Even if just a fraction of them want a drug that's $1,000 per day
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:18,623	| radiolab122314 |	It's practically our entire us budget what do you do in that case
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:20,415	| radiolab122314 |	A drug comes along like that
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:21,951	| radiolab122314 |	And throws everything out of whack
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:28,607	| radiolab122314 |	This is the part where I really sort of got hooked in where it's like
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:31,423	| radiolab122314 |	How do you answer this question is it that
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:34,239	| radiolab122314 |	You know at a certain point you just draw a line and you say
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:35,775	| radiolab122314 |	Beyond this point
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:37,567	| radiolab122314 |	We're not paying
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:39,359	| radiolab122314 |	But beyond what
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:41,407	| radiolab122314 |	Exactly I think that's the hard part
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:45,759	| radiolab122314 |	How good does a treatment have to be
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:52,159	| radiolab122314 |	For you to say this is worth the price that it's been said I don't think we have rejected out of hand foot I got into this
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:57,279	| radiolab122314 |	In the case of soundtrack they said alright 42 days that much money we're not going to do it
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:15:00,095	| radiolab122314 |	But would it have been different if it was 50 days
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:01,631	| radiolab122314 |	100
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:07,263	| radiolab122314 |	Is that enough I'm sure you want to be talking in years but I guess the question is like what would be a mall is there a magic line for you
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:12,639	| radiolab122314 |	If I
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:13,151	| radiolab122314 |	This is it
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:16,479	| radiolab122314 |	I can't personally determinate for everybody
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:18,783	| radiolab122314 |	I wouldn't presume to try
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:19,551	| radiolab122314 |	But
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:21,855	| radiolab122314 |	Ultimately as a society
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:24,159	| radiolab122314 |	Going to have to reach
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:26,207	| radiolab122314 |	An understanding of what that cut point is
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:28,255	| radiolab122314 |	Because we can't afford not to
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:35,167	| radiolab122314 |	And the question is sort of bubbles out of this conversation is what is one more year or one more month or what
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:36,703	| radiolab122314 |	One more day of life worse
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:40,031	| radiolab122314 |	Are we going to pay $1,000 for an extra day of life
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:44,895	| radiolab122314 |	But what about $100,000 reduction of life people like to say yeah so what's the value of a human life
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:48,223	| radiolab122314 |	The answer is boy that's a complicated question
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:49,503	| radiolab122314 |	They're really important one
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:51,039	| radiolab122314 |	Because
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:52,575	| radiolab122314 |	Nobody thinks it's infinitely
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:56,927	| radiolab122314 |	He said that
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:58,463	| radiolab122314 |	And I was like okay
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:15:59,999	| radiolab122314 |	Sub-Zero and it's not instant
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:03,327	| radiolab122314 |	Is there an answer like in the middle and so
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:05,887	| radiolab122314 |	I started looking around
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:09,215	| radiolab122314 |	I guess I was wondering if anyone actually thought about this
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:12,799	| radiolab122314 |	Since I started looking around what I realized was at the World Health Organization
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:14,335	| radiolab122314 |	Actually
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:21,503	| radiolab122314 |	I mean I guess they almost have a number but it's a number per country they have the recommendation that that country spend
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:26,367	| radiolab122314 |	Can I get gobbledygook eat but just bear with me the country spend one two three times
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:27,391	| radiolab122314 |	The GDP
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:29,183	| radiolab122314 |	Per capita which is like
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:30,975	| radiolab122314 |	The gross domestic product per individual
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:32,255	| radiolab122314 |	Go to take the entire
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:39,423	| radiolab122314 |	Fat ball of money that is in a country and divided / individual / the individuals and then you spend one two three
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:40,191	| radiolab122314 |	Times that on
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:41,727	| radiolab122314 |	When were Goodyear
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:43,007	| radiolab122314 |	Movies that be for us
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:47,359	| radiolab122314 |	Search for the us if that's about fifty to a hundred fifty thousand
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:48,639	| radiolab122314 |	Interesting
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:50,687	| radiolab122314 |	Is that does that have any any teeth
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:57,087	| radiolab122314 |	That recommendation really doesn't have any teeth but it has teeth in the sense that
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:58,879	| radiolab122314 |	Doctors in the US
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:02,719	| radiolab122314 |	Going to start using this who number to evaluate
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:03,999	| radiolab122314 |	Medical Treatments
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:04,511	| radiolab122314 |	For Cardiology
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:09,631	| radiolab122314 |	They said they were going to do this in a paper and it was kind of very quiet very subtle
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:11,423	| radiolab122314 |	But in other countries
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:12,959	| radiolab122314 |	This conversation
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:16,287	| radiolab122314 |	Is very loud actually it happens at the government level
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:18,591	| radiolab122314 |	They're also passing out surveys with her asking
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:21,663	| radiolab122314 |	Citizens what is your limit on how much
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:24,735	| radiolab122314 |	You want to spend on one more good year of life
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:26,015	| radiolab122314 |	And they did not hear
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:28,063	| radiolab122314 |	Far as I know no
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:30,367	| radiolab122314 |	Because
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:38,047	| radiolab122314 |	Because the last time we tried to talk about cost in medicine it ended up in the hole death
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:40,095	| radiolab122314 |	Death panels or so-called death panels thing
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:50,079	| radiolab122314 |	I don't know I just wondered right into the mess of it hey Times Square if I actually tried to go out
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:52,639	| radiolab122314 |	A very basic way
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:54,943	| radiolab122314 |	How would people respond
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:18:00,063	| radiolab122314 |	Excuse me can I ask you a question what is a year of life worth
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:07,999	| radiolab122314 |	But a question it was really surprised at how
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:10,047	| radiolab122314 |	Seriously people took the question
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:12,863	| radiolab122314 |	What is a year of life worth
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:14,399	| radiolab122314 |	That was the first thing I noticed
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:15,423	| radiolab122314 |	Then the next thing was
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:22,335	| radiolab122314 |	No one to answer the question until I had answered like a million questions of there
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:28,735	| radiolab122314 |	Where do I get that year do I get it at the beginning and middle or the end how would I spend that you have life
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:35,135	| radiolab122314 |	Goodyear's life depends is like a pie in the sky kind of answer they wanted to know would they be emotionally happy
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:41,535	| radiolab122314 |	Loan with friends or family where did they get the money they borrow the money they have to pay the money back where they dying was it in
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:47,935	| radiolab122314 |	Emergency or other people also trying to get money at the same time because then there'd be like a rush on the money in America
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:48,447	| radiolab122314 |	So interesting
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:50,751	| radiolab122314 |	Did you actually ever end up getting
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:52,031	| radiolab122314 |	Numbers
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:54,591	| radiolab122314 |	I did get numbers but they were
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:57,151	| radiolab122314 |	10 - $15,000
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:19:03,295	| radiolab122314 |	Stop 13th $7 all over the place
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:06,879	| radiolab122314 |	$44,000
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:11,231	| radiolab122314 |	Interesting one woman said 10 million million dollars for a year
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:17,631	| radiolab122314 |	Irresponsible you asking me about my personal choice not about a public
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:20,959	| radiolab122314 |	Why do you have any way of parsing office
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:21,471	| radiolab122314 |	No
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:26,591	| radiolab122314 |	I really honestly don't like I think my biggest takeaway was like no one punched me
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:27,871	| radiolab122314 |	Switch
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:31,199	| radiolab122314 |	Which makes me feel as if people are ready
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:32,479	| radiolab122314 |	Not ready but willing
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:36,063	| radiolab122314 |	But I also realize that
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:37,343	| radiolab122314 |	I kept talking about things and
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:38,879	| radiolab122314 |	I just want to
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:40,159	| radiolab122314 |	To be in the room with page
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:44,255	| radiolab122314 |	Play Patience in the room with me because it was like we're all having this conversation that
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:46,815	| radiolab122314 |	Eventually we'll all be patients I guess but
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:48,351	| radiolab122314 |	We're also
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:51,167	| radiolab122314 |	Having this conversation around
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:56,287	| radiolab122314 |	Like a group of people that weren't ever present like they're not a conferences or not in
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:57,311	| radiolab122314 |	Research articles
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:20:00,127	| radiolab122314 |	And so that was when I started talking to Paige
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:02,431	| radiolab122314 |	Wow
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:03,967	| radiolab122314 |	I guess what is 42 days
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:08,831	| radiolab122314 |	What is 42 days mean in the sense of
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:11,903	| radiolab122314 |	Is that something that you pay 50
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:12,927	| radiolab122314 |	$1,000
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:13,951	| radiolab122314 |	If you were
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:15,999	| radiolab122314 |	I mean of course you would
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:22,911	| radiolab122314 |	It's like I haven't even asked the question but I don't know I know I think it's a good question I think
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:25,471	| radiolab122314 |	Ethically it would be to the good of patients
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:27,263	| radiolab122314 |	And doctors
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:30,079	| radiolab122314 |	To have this conversation this is Susan
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:32,383	| radiolab122314 |	Susan gubar Rider of
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:34,431	| radiolab122314 |	The living with cancer blog
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:37,247	| radiolab122314 |	Did the New York Times back in 2008 Susan went to the doctor
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:44,671	| radiolab122314 |	She hasn't been feeling well for a while they thought it was some sort of foul issue but then the doctor walked into the room and said she had
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:46,207	| radiolab122314 |	Advanced stage ovarian cancer
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:50,047	| radiolab122314 |	Most ovarian cancers are diagnosed at ale
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:51,327	| radiolab122314 |	Stage and
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:53,631	| radiolab122314 |	It's it's basically
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:54,911	| radiolab122314 |	Incurable
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:58,239	| radiolab122314 |	It can be handled it can be managed at
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:20:59,775	| radiolab122314 |	Can be kept at Bay and
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:03,103	| radiolab122314 |	Longer periods of time now we hope
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:06,175	| radiolab122314 |	But you're given a diagnosis of 3 to 5 years
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:07,967	| radiolab122314 |	That is
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:12,063	| radiolab122314 |	You go from having unlimited time in your mind to
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:13,599	| radiolab122314 |	Three to five years in like a docker
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:17,440	| radiolab122314 |	Yeah it's it's it's a big shock
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:18,976	| radiolab122314 |	You said Ventura Zone
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:23,328	| radiolab122314 |	Well you're not quite aware of what
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:23,840	| radiolab122314 |	You doing
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:28,960	| radiolab122314 |	That day the day she was diagnosed she was told
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:31,776	| radiolab122314 |	Pack a bag get in the car and drive to Indianapolis
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:32,800	| radiolab122314 |	You need surgery now
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:39,712	| radiolab122314 |	So I went to the next day to Indianapolis and the day after that I had to do bulking surgery which takes out the
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:41,248	| radiolab122314 |	The ovaries and the
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:45,856	| radiolab122314 |	Uterus in the Fallopian tubes in the spleen and sometimes the cervix
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:49,952	| radiolab122314 |	Sometimes the appendix in holy times the bowel and are you serious
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:52,512	| radiolab122314 |	Yeah it's called the mother of all surgery
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:54,304	| radiolab122314 |	And then just like that
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:56,352	| radiolab122314 |	Shooting multiple rounds
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:58,912	| radiolab122314 |	Chemo chemicals that are used
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:00,960	| radiolab122314 |	They destroy all quick-growing cell
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:04,288	| radiolab122314 |	So for example you have no hair
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:06,848	| radiolab122314 |	No eyebrows no eyelashes that you know
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:10,688	| radiolab122314 |	You also can I got terrible sores in my mouth
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:16,064	| radiolab122314 |	I have no idea why but I know this happens to other people but yeah the other thing is this extreme
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:16,576	| radiolab122314 |	Fatigue
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:20,160	| radiolab122314 |	And Susan who writes for a living couldn't even read
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:23,488	| radiolab122314 |	I would look at a page and think that I turned a page
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:28,608	| radiolab122314 |	Chemotherapy it really is toxic
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:29,376	| radiolab122314 |	To the spirit
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:31,680	| radiolab122314 |	To the heart to the mind
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:35,264	| radiolab122314 |	Just the normal aspects of Life feel polluted
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:41,408	| radiolab122314 |	Have you ever had to think about
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:41,920	| radiolab122314 |	Cost
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:43,968	| radiolab122314 |	I was never
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:46,016	| radiolab122314 |	Formed of the cost of
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:47,040	| radiolab122314 |	Any drug
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:48,064	| radiolab122314 |	Or any
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:48,832	| radiolab122314 |	Procedure I was
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:53,440	| radiolab122314 |	Which really makes me think about how Mass
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:56,512	| radiolab122314 |	These costs are would you
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:23:00,864	| radiolab122314 |	Want to be thinking about cost while you're going through it or is it better to just
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:03,168	| radiolab122314 |	Stay here your treatment options
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:05,216	| radiolab122314 |	Visa statistical outcomes
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:05,984	| radiolab122314 |	Like
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:06,752	| radiolab122314 |	Pick one
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:08,544	| radiolab122314 |	And then we'll deal with it on the other
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:10,592	| radiolab122314 |	I think there's an
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:11,872	| radiolab122314 |	Kind of
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:16,736	| radiolab122314 |	Unspoken agreement among everyone that the insurance company or Medicare is going to pay
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:20,576	| radiolab122314 |	And if it's the government that means our grandchildren
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:21,856	| radiolab122314 |	Are going to end up paying
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:23,392	| radiolab122314 |	For all of this
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:27,744	| radiolab122314 |	Money so yes I guess to answer your question I think it would be healthier to know what
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:30,048	| radiolab122314 |	Distance Quest on the other hand I have to say is
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:30,560	| radiolab122314 |	Patient
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:34,656	| radiolab122314 |	I was so traumatized I'm not sure I could have taken that information in
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:38,752	| radiolab122314 |	I was thinking about your what what is worth
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:39,520	| radiolab122314 |	What's it worth
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:43,104	| radiolab122314 |	A title and I was thinking that
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:46,176	| radiolab122314 |	The American individualistic
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:46,944	| radiolab122314 |	Optimistic
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:50,016	| radiolab122314 |	Response would be well whatever it takes
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:52,320	| radiolab122314 |	Whatever it takes
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:54,112	| radiolab122314 |	Life is worth it whatever it takes
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:56,416	| radiolab122314 |	But whatever it takes
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:23:58,976	| radiolab122314 |	Will not cure my cancer
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:02,560	| radiolab122314 |	So I think this question changes
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:04,352	| radiolab122314 |	When you have incurable
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:08,448	| radiolab122314 |	It becomes a different question which is one is enough
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:09,472	| radiolab122314 |	Enough
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:16,128	| radiolab122314 |	She said that when is enough enough
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:19,456	| radiolab122314 |	I was just I don't know that we are ready to say there's one magic
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:26,368	| radiolab122314 |	Thrown back to this conversation that I had with Leonard saltz where he was saying that we have to look at everything in terms
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:27,392	| radiolab122314 |	Of value
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:31,488	| radiolab122314 |	You need to think deeply about the kind of life you want to live
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:32,768	| radiolab122314 |	It's not just about
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:34,816	| radiolab122314 |	How many days
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:36,096	| radiolab122314 |	It's about what kind of
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:37,632	| radiolab122314 |	Daiso if you told me
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:40,192	| radiolab122314 |	But there was something that gave 72
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:43,520	| radiolab122314 |	Day survival benefit but it makes people feel nauseous for most of the time
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:48,384	| radiolab122314 |	Is that worth it when were trying to draw this line as a society
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:50,432	| radiolab122314 |	Before we figure out what we're willing to
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:51,200	| radiolab122314 |	Pee-Wee have
EDL	00:24:51,200	00:24:52,224	| radiolab122314 |	Think about what
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:53,760	| radiolab122314 |	We are
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:54,784	| radiolab122314 |	Paying for
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:57,600	| radiolab122314 |	Yeah I don't think we know what we're Susan
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:02,208	| radiolab122314 |	He has six years ago she decided that she was going to get chemotherapy be
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:02,720	| radiolab122314 |	Because
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:05,024	| radiolab122314 |	In part it would be more time with her daughter
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:06,304	| radiolab122314 |	Yeah
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:07,072	| radiolab122314 |	And suddenly
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:08,608	| radiolab122314 |	It's worth it
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:09,888	| radiolab122314 |	Yeah
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:12,704	| radiolab122314 |	But I think we changed by the treatment to
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:15,264	| radiolab122314 |	For now Susan's cancer is
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:17,312	| radiolab122314 |	Basically under control
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:20,384	| radiolab122314 |	Because she's on this new drug
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:22,944	| radiolab122314 |	422 years and now months
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:29,344	| radiolab122314 |	And I am counting has been alive without a recurrence without the key
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:30,112	| radiolab122314 |	Cancer growing
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:33,184	| radiolab122314 |	By taking these pills everyday
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:39,584	| radiolab122314 |	I take them at home they're not infused in the hospital through my veins
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:40,352	| radiolab122314 |	They're just pills
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:43,424	| radiolab122314 |	And it's made last
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:44,448	| radiolab122314 |	Few years
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:45,472	| radiolab122314 |	Remarkably
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:47,776	| radiolab122314 |	Normal light
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:49,824	| radiolab122314 |	The new Norm
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:54,176	| radiolab122314 |	But when these drugs stop working in
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:56,480	| radiolab122314 |	I've been told they will stop
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:56,992	| radiolab122314 |	Working
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:00,576	| radiolab122314 |	I'm not sure I would want to go back to chemotherapy
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:06,976	| radiolab122314 |	But I suspect I don't know until I get there

EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:33,248	| radiolab122314 |	For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:38,880	| radiolab122314 |	Aunts and uncles teachers we're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments child brilliant
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:43,488	| radiolab122314 |	Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:46,816	| radiolab122314 |	It just means you lean back and say whoa
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:47,584	| radiolab122314 |	How do they do that
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:49,632	| radiolab122314 |	Maybe it was the moment that I
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:53,216	| radiolab122314 |	A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:55,776	| radiolab122314 |	Or maybe the kid was a piano
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:28:00,384	| radiolab122314 |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:04,736	| radiolab122314 |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:06,272	| radiolab122314 |	We're interested in the
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:08,576	| radiolab122314 |	Epic moments where

EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:47,616	| radiolab122314 |	So
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:49,664	| radiolab122314 |	It turns out that there are 12 dead
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:56,064	| radiolab122314 |	And typically what happens in Yemen is that as soon as someone is killed their very very very shortly thereafter
EDL	00:32:56,832	00:32:58,368	| radiolab122314 |	What happens here is something different
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:03,232	| radiolab122314 |	The people in the Convoy
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:04,512	| radiolab122314 |	Take the bodies
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:05,536	| radiolab122314 |	Of the Dead
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:07,584	| radiolab122314 |	And they take them back to read the
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:10,400	| radiolab122314 |	This big town near where the Drone strike occurred
EDL	00:33:10,400	00:33:11,936	| radiolab122314 |	There's a video I have
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:15,264	| radiolab122314 |	It's what you're hearing Ricci cement take these 12 dead bodies
EDL	00:33:16,288	00:33:18,848	| radiolab122314 |	And a line them up in the street on this
EDL	00:33:18,848	00:33:22,176	| radiolab122314 |	Bright blue tarp and they sort of a wrap them in these cheap blank
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:27,808	| radiolab122314 |	And so there's this huge crowd that just gathers around 2
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:30,112	| radiolab122314 |	Stare at these dead bodies who are laid out in the
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:36,512	| radiolab122314 |	And at a certain point this very tiny very very leathery old yemeni who sort of
EDL	00:33:36,512	00:33:38,048	| radiolab122314 |	Holding onto the back of a
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:41,376	| radiolab122314 |	Pick up with one arm stands over the Dead
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:45,472	| radiolab122314 |	Sort of swing over the bodies and just lecturing the crowd on what happened he's
EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:48,800	| radiolab122314 |	Screaming at them and so
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:51,616	| radiolab122314 |	You can hear his voice
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:53,408	| radiolab122314 |	Talk to Bill horse
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:33:59,296	| radiolab122314 |	Any screening in American drone killed these it was a massacre
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:02,112	| radiolab122314 |	People are on their way to a wedding
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:03,392	| radiolab122314 |	Why did this happen
EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:09,536	| radiolab122314 |	Why were they kill
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:18,240	| radiolab122314 |	Why did they target this
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:19,008	| radiolab122314 |	This Convoy
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:21,056	| radiolab122314 |	Well according to the US
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:22,848	| radiolab122314 |	Did received Intel that
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:25,152	| radiolab122314 |	On that day in this Convoy
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:26,688	| radiolab122314 |	Al Qaeda operative
EDL	00:34:27,200	00:34:31,040	| radiolab122314 |	Name Sookie or badani apparently have been plenty of attacks
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:31,552	| radiolab122314 |	Mexican to us
EDL	00:34:32,064	00:34:33,600	| radiolab122314 |	That's why they took the shot
EDL	00:34:33,600	00:34:35,648	| radiolab122314 |	And in fact they say that he was wounded in this
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:37,696	| radiolab122314 |	In this wedding Convoy
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:38,464	| radiolab122314 |	Strike
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:40,256	| radiolab122314 |	And do we have any reason
EDL	00:34:40,256	00:34:41,024	| radiolab122314 |	2
EDL	00:34:41,792	00:34:42,304	| radiolab122314 |	Believe that
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:44,864	| radiolab122314 |	I have no reason to believe it
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:46,912	| radiolab122314 |	Greg spent weeks in Yemen.
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:50,752	| radiolab122314 |	Two survivors of the Drone strike talk to people who are there no one knows the
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:51,520	| radiolab122314 |	The sky
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:55,360	| radiolab122314 |	Brakes at the guy isn't really a member of either the tribes that were involved in the wedding
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:56,640	| radiolab122314 |	And so to him
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:58,944	| radiolab122314 |	It makes no sense that he would be there
EDL	00:34:58,944	00:34:59,968	| radiolab122314 |	To him this was
EDL	00:35:00,480	00:35:01,248	| radiolab122314 |	Terrible mistake
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:06,880	| radiolab122314 |	But what really got me interested in Craig's reporting
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:11,744	| radiolab122314 |	Which can be done buzzfeed.com highly recommended question of like
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:12,512	| radiolab122314 |	What
EDL	00:35:12,512	00:35:14,304	| radiolab122314 |	The US did next
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:16,096	| radiolab122314 |	The question is like
EDL	00:35:16,608	00:35:20,448	| radiolab122314 |	What do you do in this case how do you repair something like this
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:23,776	| radiolab122314 |	We have two totally different cultures with two different traditions
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:25,312	| radiolab122314 |	How do you find a way
EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:28,128	| radiolab122314 |	To try to make this right
EDL	00:35:31,968	00:35:32,992	| radiolab122314 |	I mean historically
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:35,040	| radiolab122314 |	Do soldiers have an obligation to repair
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:37,856	| radiolab122314 |	No
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:38,624	| radiolab122314 |	There's no obligation
EDL	00:35:39,136	00:35:41,696	| radiolab122314 |	But what happened is we've actually
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:43,744	| radiolab122314 |	He created an obligation for ourselves
EDL	00:35:43,744	00:35:50,144	| radiolab122314 |	Americans have yeah yeah this has a really long history of History that's illegal

EDL	00:38:40,640	00:38:42,176	| radiolab122314 |	Because the thing that person got
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:43,200	| radiolab122314 |	In World War 1
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:45,760	| radiolab122314 |	And that is
EDL	00:38:46,272	00:38:47,040	| radiolab122314 |	That
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:49,088	| radiolab122314 |	There's a combat exclusion
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:53,184	| radiolab122314 |	Kids just walked in that's Gregory Johnson and what he means is that this law
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:55,488	| radiolab122314 |	Basically what it said is that will pay your claims
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:58,560	| radiolab122314 |	If it didn't happen on the field of battle and it wasn't a combat
EDL	00:38:58,560	00:38:59,072	| radiolab122314 |	Situation
EDL	00:38:59,584	00:39:00,608	| radiolab122314 |	What's combat
EDL	00:39:00,608	00:39:02,144	| radiolab122314 |	And it was on the field of battle than
EDL	00:39:02,656	00:39:03,168	| radiolab122314 |	Tough luck
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:07,520	| radiolab122314 |	Just War so if u.s. soldiers were driving to a fight
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:09,312	| radiolab122314 |	And they
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:10,592	| radiolab122314 |	Ran their car into
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:11,360	| radiolab122314 |	To somebody
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:13,408	| radiolab122314 |	And they damage that car killed that person
EDL	00:39:13,920	00:39:15,712	| radiolab122314 |	Those people would not be able
EDL	00:39:15,712	00:39:18,272	| radiolab122314 |	How to get compensation whereas if the u.s. soldiers
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:19,296	| radiolab122314 |	Driving to a bar
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:21,600	| radiolab122314 |	And got in an accident they would be able
EDL	00:39:23,392	00:39:24,160	| radiolab122314 |	But
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:24,928	| radiolab122314 |	Covenants
EDL	00:39:25,696	00:39:28,000	| radiolab122314 |	Once we get into these counterinsurgency wars
EDL	00:39:28,000	00:39:29,536	| radiolab122314 |	Civilians are suddenly
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:30,816	| radiolab122314 |	In the middle of The Fray
EDL	00:39:30,816	00:39:37,216	| radiolab122314 |	Chargers have been made that troops killed as many as 567 South Vietnamese civilians
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:43,616	| radiolab122314 |	This is the story of Modern Warfare
EDL	00:39:43,616	00:39:50,016	| radiolab122314 |	President
EDL	00:39:50,016	00:39:54,624	| radiolab122314 |	Mothers and children by the time you get to Afghanistan and Iraq
EDL	00:39:54,624	00:39:56,928	| radiolab122314 |	So there's no difference really between Battlefield
EDL	00:39:56,928	00:39:57,952	| radiolab122314 |	My people live
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:40:01,792	| radiolab122314 |	And so the line between what's combat-related what's not combat-related
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:03,328	| radiolab122314 |	It starts to get
EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:04,608	| radiolab122314 |	Blurry
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:10,752	| radiolab122314 |	And so in 2003 and Iraq what happened was there were actually people lining up
EDL	00:40:10,752	00:40:11,520	| radiolab122314 |	You know there were
EDL	00:40:12,032	00:40:16,896	| radiolab122314 |	Civilian military operation centers people started lining up outside of the saying
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:19,200	| radiolab122314 |	My family has been harmed I want help
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:21,760	| radiolab122314 |	How many people do you remember if I had to guess who is
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:24,832	| radiolab122314 |	Maybe around 80 people are so
EDL	00:40:24,832	00:40:26,112	| radiolab122314 |	That's a ton of people
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:26,880	| radiolab122314 |	Yeah
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:29,952	| radiolab122314 |	That's John Tracy he was a military lawyer in Iraq in two
EDL	00:40:29,952	00:40:30,720	| radiolab122314 |	3
EDL	00:40:30,720	00:40:31,744	| radiolab122314 |	And for him
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:35,584	| radiolab122314 |	Molly Keenan and managing director of Center for civilians in conflict
EDL	00:40:35,584	00:40:37,632	| radiolab122314 |	So when they came with a complaint with
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:43,776	| radiolab122314 |	So what is it like you ran over my chicken or you knocked out my window much more serious
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:44,288	| radiolab122314 |	Cluster bomb
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:47,104	| radiolab122314 |	During the shock and awe campaign
EDL	00:40:47,616	00:40:48,640	| radiolab122314 |	One of the
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:49,664	| radiolab122314 |	Types of bombs
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:50,944	| radiolab122314 |	That we were using
EDL	00:40:50,944	00:40:53,760	| radiolab122314 |	Are the Air Force was using what would they call cluster munition
EDL	00:40:53,760	00:40:56,832	| radiolab122314 |	HP chances Air Force plane to fly over these targets and drop
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:40:59,136	| radiolab122314 |	Hundreds and hundreds of these tiny little bombs
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:41:03,232	| radiolab122314 |	Smaller than a Coke can and a lot of them with land in maybe a parking lot
EDL	00:41:03,232	00:41:09,376	| radiolab122314 |	Field and it wouldn't explode so on a number of occasions you'd have mostly was kids right because the kids would
EDL	00:41:09,888	00:41:10,400	| radiolab122314 |	See it
EDL	00:41:10,912	00:41:11,680	| radiolab122314 |	And
EDL	00:41:11,680	00:41:13,984	| radiolab122314 |	They didn't know any better it would just run over and kick it
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:15,776	| radiolab122314 |	That's when it would
EDL	00:41:16,288	00:41:16,800	| radiolab122314 |	Explode
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:18,592	| radiolab122314 |	Right
EDL	00:41:19,104	00:41:20,384	| radiolab122314 |	I had a lot of those
EDL	00:41:20,896	00:41:22,688	| radiolab122314 |	Cost of a dozen and so
EDL	00:41:22,688	00:41:23,712	| radiolab122314 |	That was a
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:25,504	| radiolab122314 |	That was a difficult one because well
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:27,808	| radiolab122314 |	It's combat
EDL	00:41:27,808	00:41:29,344	| radiolab122314 |	Because they are forced dropped
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:30,112	| radiolab122314 |	Because they were
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:31,904	| radiolab122314 |	Mommy
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:32,928	| radiolab122314 |	The city right
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:35,744	| radiolab122314 |	But at the same time days weeks
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:39,072	| radiolab122314 |	Even months have gone by in this thing is just sitting in the ground
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:41,888	| radiolab122314 |	Couldn't we say it's not combat
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:45,472	| radiolab122314 |	It was a real question that John had to ask his boss and then his boss
EDL	00:41:45,984	00:41:49,824	| radiolab122314 |	His boss babe I actually sent the question up to the Army claim service
EDL	00:41:49,824	00:41:51,360	| radiolab122314 |	And they said no it's combat
EDL	00:41:51,872	00:41:53,407	| radiolab122314 |	Meaning they're not going to pay
EDL	00:41:53,407	00:41:56,223	| radiolab122314 |	Basically like we are in an in an armed conflict
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:41:59,807	| radiolab122314 |	And this was an unfortunate incident but an incident that happened
EDL	00:42:00,319	00:42:02,879	| radiolab122314 |	During a lawful combat operation and therefore
EDL	00:42:03,647	00:42:04,159	| radiolab122314 |	We're sorry
EDL	00:42:05,183	00:42:07,487	| radiolab122314 |	And that's basically it so I said no to a lot of pee
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:12,863	| radiolab122314 |	Until like in World War 1 with General Pershing Military Officers they started lobbying their bosses
EDL	00:42:13,375	00:42:15,167	| radiolab122314 |	Expanded system so they can
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:16,447	| radiolab122314 |	Start making more payments
EDL	00:42:16,447	00:42:17,983	| radiolab122314 |	Eventually the military.
EDL	00:42:17,983	00:42:19,007	| radiolab122314 |	Bandit
EDL	00:42:19,007	00:42:21,567	| radiolab122314 |	I talked to one of the military's top lawyers
EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:23,615	| radiolab122314 |	Brigadier General Richard Cedros
EDL	00:42:23,615	00:42:24,639	| radiolab122314 |	I go by Rich
EDL	00:42:24,639	00:42:27,455	| radiolab122314 |	I'm the legal counsel to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:30,271	| radiolab122314 |	And you told me that around 2006
EDL	00:42:30,271	00:42:31,039	| radiolab122314 |	Peanut
EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:32,319	| radiolab122314 |	These kind of condolence payments
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:34,367	| radiolab122314 |	Actually became sort of a
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:37,695	| radiolab122314 |	Key part of military strategy absolutely even had its own acronym
EDL	00:42:37,695	00:42:38,463	| radiolab122314 |	Malls
EDL	00:42:38,463	00:42:40,767	| radiolab122314 |	MAA WS6
EDL	00:42:40,767	00:42:43,071	| radiolab122314 |	Money as a weapons system which
EDL	00:42:43,071	00:42:43,839	| radiolab122314 |	You know I
EDL	00:42:44,863	00:42:45,375	| radiolab122314 |	I'm not sure that
EDL	00:42:45,887	00:42:52,287	| radiolab122314 |	Title resonates with everybody but in inches
EDL	00:42:52,287	00:42:53,567	| radiolab122314 |	Can be used
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:54,335	| radiolab122314 |	2
EDL	00:42:54,335	00:42:57,919	| radiolab122314 |	To win hearts and Minds that help bring the population over
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:42:59,455	| radiolab122314 |	And it just got me wondering
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:00,735	| radiolab122314 |	How much money
EDL	00:43:00,735	00:43:01,247	| radiolab122314 |	Makes
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:02,271	| radiolab122314 |	A good weapon
EDL	00:43:02,783	00:43:09,183	| radiolab122314 |	Well I haven't liked the US military hasn't given me access to a database or anything like that but it's through foia is and and and and
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:10,207	| radiolab122314 |	Interviews I've seen difference
EDL	00:43:10,719	00:43:14,303	| radiolab122314 |	Numbers Melissa's didn't 2060 ACLU file the foyer
EDL	00:43:15,071	00:43:17,631	| radiolab122314 |	And eventually got their hands on hundreds of claims files
EDL	00:43:18,655	00:43:20,447	| radiolab122314 |	In those files what you see are bunch of different numbers
EDL	00:43:21,215	00:43:22,495	| radiolab122314 |	One that comes up
EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:23,263	| radiolab122314 |	Begin Again
EDL	00:43:23,263	00:43:25,567	| radiolab122314 |	$2,500 2500 bailar
EDL	00:43:26,079	00:43:31,711	| radiolab122314 |	Now it's someone like John could have paid more but that meant they have to run the claim up the chain of command exactly
EDL	00:43:31,711	00:43:33,759	| radiolab122314 |	It was almost like there were these ceilings
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:35,551	| radiolab122314 |	2500 for a life
EDL	00:43:36,319	00:43:42,719	| radiolab122314 |	1504 property damage and then eventually the property damage amount got raised to 2500
EDL	00:43:42,719	00:43:43,487	| radiolab122314 |	Well
EDL	00:43:43,487	00:43:43,999	| radiolab122314 |	And
EDL	00:43:45,023	00:43:46,047	| radiolab122314 |	That didn't make any sense
EDL	00:43:46,559	00:43:48,095	| radiolab122314 |	But somebody could get so much
EDL	00:43:48,095	00:43:49,631	| radiolab122314 |	For a Toyota Corolla but
EDL	00:43:49,631	00:43:51,935	| radiolab122314 |	You weren't you were just make it the same amount
EDL	00:43:52,447	00:43:53,471	| radiolab122314 |	File for a lost life
EDL	00:43:53,471	00:43:59,871	| radiolab122314 |	Like I can't get over I mean 2500 seems like just such a nominal amount in the practicality of that money
EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:02,687	| radiolab122314 |	If like if you were to kill someone who is the
EDL	00:44:02,687	00:44:03,967	| radiolab122314 |	The Breadwinner of a family
EDL	00:44:04,735	00:44:08,063	| radiolab122314 |	That $2,500 would not be able to support this family in any way
EDL	00:44:09,087	00:44:14,463	| radiolab122314 |	Right but we're not actually trying to pay full compensation right like we're not trying to say
EDL	00:44:14,463	00:44:15,743	| radiolab122314 |	We think if this
EDL	00:44:15,743	00:44:17,023	| radiolab122314 |	20 year old man had lived
EDL	00:44:17,023	00:44:20,863	| radiolab122314 |	To be the average age in Afghanistan that he knows that it would have been
EDL	00:44:21,631	00:44:24,191	| radiolab122314 |	$60,843
EDL	00:44:24,191	00:44:26,751	| radiolab122314 |	Right like that's not the thing you ever
EDL	00:44:26,751	00:44:28,031	| radiolab122314 |	You know we had
EDL	00:44:28,543	00:44:30,079	| radiolab122314 |	People who were killed here
EDL	00:44:30,079	00:44:33,919	| radiolab122314 |	Federal government is one step closer to cutting it
EDL	00:44:33,919	00:44:34,431	| radiolab122314 |	First check
EDL	00:44:34,943	00:44:36,223	| radiolab122314 |	2 families of those
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:38,783	| radiolab122314 |	Killed and injured on September 11
EDL	00:44:38,783	00:44:40,319	| radiolab122314 |	And those people have been comp
EDL	00:44:41,087	00:44:44,671	| radiolab122314 |	The levels of compensation to the New York victims
EDL	00:44:44,671	00:44:45,439	| radiolab122314 |	Is it is
EDL	00:44:45,439	00:44:45,951	| radiolab122314 |	Pretty
EDL	00:44:46,975	00:44:48,511	| radiolab122314 |	The range of payments for death
EDL	00:44:48,511	00:44:49,279	| radiolab122314 |	Playing
EDL	00:44:49,279	00:44:51,071	| radiolab122314 |	Range anywhere from 200
EDL	00:44:51,071	00:44:52,095	| radiolab122314 |	$50,000
EDL	00:44:52,607	00:44:53,631	| radiolab122314 |	To just under 7 million
EDL	00:44:54,655	00:44:55,679	| radiolab122314 |	You noticed that
EDL	00:44:56,703	00:44:57,471	| radiolab122314 |	Baidu
EDL	00:44:59,519	00:45:00,031	| radiolab122314 |	Baidu
EDL	00:45:00,799	00:45:03,359	| radiolab122314 |	But it is to a large degree comparing apples and or
EDL	00:45:03,871	00:45:06,431	| radiolab122314 |	That's generous again because you're talkin about 8
EDL	00:45:06,431	00:45:07,455	| radiolab122314 |	Illegal
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:09,247	| radiolab122314 |	System where country is
EDL	00:45:09,247	00:45:10,015	| radiolab122314 |	Paying
EDL	00:45:10,015	00:45:11,551	| radiolab122314 |	Their own victims
EDL	00:45:11,551	00:45:12,319	| radiolab122314 |	Purses
EDL	00:45:12,319	00:45:16,927	| radiolab122314 |	Condolences in a in an area where there's no legal obligation to make those
EDL	00:45:17,439	00:45:18,207	| radiolab122314 |	What's in the first place
EDL	00:45:18,207	00:45:20,255	| radiolab122314 |	So that's a very different type of
EDL	00:45:20,767	00:45:22,047	| radiolab122314 |	Monetary payments
EDL	00:45:22,047	00:45:24,607	| radiolab122314 |	Yes or no essentially it's a
EDL	00:45:25,119	00:45:26,143	| radiolab122314 |	Person's life
EDL	00:45:26,143	00:45:27,679	| radiolab122314 |	And yeah I mean
EDL	00:45:28,191	00:45:29,983	| radiolab122314 |	I need is an argument to be made that
EDL	00:45:30,495	00:45:33,567	| radiolab122314 |	Is empathy in the number that you come up with
EDL	00:45:33,567	00:45:34,591	| radiolab122314 |	Any amount that you
EDL	00:45:34,591	00:45:35,359	| radiolab122314 |	Pay for someone's
EDL	00:45:35,871	00:45:37,663	| radiolab122314 |	I totally get what you're saying
EDL	00:45:37,663	00:45:38,943	| radiolab122314 |	The $2,500
EDL	00:45:39,455	00:45:45,855	| radiolab122314 |	I think it's any amount of money if I told you 10 would you feel better about it I mean a little bit better I think so Tim what is it
EDL	00:45:45,855	00:45:46,623	| radiolab122314 |	Get you though
EDL	00:45:46,623	00:45:50,207	| radiolab122314 |	Indian $10,000 doesn't buy anything more back than what
EDL	00:45:50,207	00:45:53,023	| radiolab122314 |	You lie I don't know what time doesn't get you exactly in Afghanistan but my
EDL	00:45:53,535	00:45:57,119	| radiolab122314 |	Assumption is that it gets you a lot more than 2500
EDL	00:45:57,119	00:45:58,655	| radiolab122314 |	But does that really help you
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:45:59,935	| radiolab122314 |	Is that really what you want
EDL	00:45:59,935	00:46:02,239	| radiolab122314 |	Where's the money unimportant you really
EDL	00:46:02,239	00:46:03,263	| radiolab122314 |	Sounds like the money is really
EDL	00:46:03,775	00:46:07,103	| radiolab122314 |	I'm not a victim so I don't know that I can answer that to me
EDL	00:46:07,615	00:46:14,015	| radiolab122314 |	At this point my oldest story about how before she got in this line of work I had several friends who were
EDL	00:46:14,015	00:46:19,135	| radiolab122314 |	One of his friends was a man named Chris hondros
EDL	00:46:19,135	00:46:21,951	| radiolab122314 |	Back in 2011 Christmas on assignment Olivia
EDL	00:46:21,951	00:46:23,231	| radiolab122314 |	Movie with the rebel group
EDL	00:46:23,231	00:46:24,511	| radiolab122314 |	When they were fired upon
EDL	00:46:25,279	00:46:26,047	| radiolab122314 |	Chris was killed
EDL	00:46:26,047	00:46:26,559	| radiolab122314 |	Yeah
EDL	00:46:27,583	00:46:28,607	| radiolab122314 |	Am I
EDL	00:46:28,607	00:46:29,887	| radiolab122314 |	When she found out that happen
EDL	00:46:29,887	00:46:32,191	| radiolab122314 |	I wanted someone explain to me why that happened
EDL	00:46:33,727	00:46:34,239	| radiolab122314 |	I mean
EDL	00:46:38,335	00:46:39,871	| radiolab122314 |	I just want to know
EDL	00:46:39,871	00:46:40,383	| radiolab122314 |	Lane
EDL	00:46:41,151	00:46:42,431	| radiolab122314 |	I didn't even like
EDL	00:46:42,431	00:46:44,991	| radiolab122314 |	The newest family was going to get any money I need that
EDL	00:46:44,991	00:46:48,319	| radiolab122314 |	These guys were shuttle rocket propelled grenade at him working to care
EDL	00:46:48,319	00:46:49,855	| radiolab122314 |	No one was going to explain
EDL	00:46:49,855	00:46:50,879	| radiolab122314 |	I wanted that
EDL	00:46:52,159	00:46:53,951	| radiolab122314 |	And the money then becomes
EDL	00:46:54,463	00:46:55,487	| radiolab122314 |	An occasion
EDL	00:46:55,487	00:46:56,511	| radiolab122314 |	Please say sike
EDL	00:46:56,511	00:46:58,815	| radiolab122314 |	Not just I'm sorry but here's what happened
EDL	00:46:58,815	00:47:00,351	| radiolab122314 |	Is the Hughes what happened part
EDL	00:47:00,863	00:47:02,399	| radiolab122314 |	I think it's the token
EDL	00:47:02,399	00:47:04,703	| radiolab122314 |	It's given with the apology and with the exponent
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:07,519	| radiolab122314 |	But it's the apology and explanation
EDL	00:47:08,543	00:47:10,591	| radiolab122314 |	Yeah that's why we call it a mints
EDL	00:47:10,591	00:47:11,359	| radiolab122314 |	Making amends
EDL	00:47:21,855	00:47:25,951	| radiolab122314 |	One of the things that is true of money damages
EDL	00:47:25,951	00:47:27,231	| radiolab122314 |	Generally is there
EDL	00:47:27,231	00:47:28,511	| radiolab122314 |	There are desperate effort
EDL	00:47:29,023	00:47:35,167	| radiolab122314 |	To find some common language between the the party paying
EDL	00:47:35,167	00:47:36,703	| radiolab122314 |	And the and the victim
EDL	00:47:36,703	00:47:43,103	| radiolab122314 |	Some Esperanto for communicating the meaning of what's happened in a language movie
EDL	00:47:43,103	00:47:49,503	| radiolab122314 |	Other side nose matters message on witblits it because we we see it everywhere we look we see
EDL	00:47:49,503	00:47:55,903	| radiolab122314 |	Apologies apologies at all but we see the the almighty dollar which is both distress
EDL	00:47:55,903	00:47:59,231	| radiolab122314 |	Sing and also we knew we know it's meaningful
EDL	00:47:59,231	00:48:00,511	| radiolab122314 |	But the problem is
EDL	00:48:00,511	00:48:04,863	| radiolab122314 |	In order for that Esperanza to work it has to stay the same meaning to both sides
EDL	00:48:05,631	00:48:07,167	| radiolab122314 |	Which Wich on Tracy
EDL	00:48:07,679	00:48:09,471	| radiolab122314 |	What's it really about the money at all
EDL	00:48:09,471	00:48:11,519	| radiolab122314 |	Not just about the money
EDL	00:48:11,519	00:48:14,335	| radiolab122314 |	It was as much about the envelope that the money was in
EDL	00:48:14,847	00:48:16,895	| radiolab122314 |	Or that there was a real person there two handed
EDL	00:48:16,895	00:48:19,455	| radiolab122314 |	I wasn't the one who raided their house I wasn't
EDL	00:48:19,455	00:48:19,967	| radiolab122314 |	The one who
EDL	00:48:20,479	00:48:21,759	| radiolab122314 |	Killed their daughter
EDL	00:48:21,759	00:48:22,527	| radiolab122314 |	But
EDL	00:48:22,527	00:48:23,295	| radiolab122314 |	Most of them
EDL	00:48:24,063	00:48:26,623	| radiolab122314 |	Babe you know just wanted to look at somebody who's in the universe
EDL	00:48:28,159	00:48:29,695	| radiolab122314 |	You really messed with my life
EDL	00:48:30,975	00:48:32,255	| radiolab122314 |	That opportunity
EDL	00:48:33,023	00:48:36,095	| radiolab122314 |	Is exactly what Abdullah LTC
EDL	00:48:36,095	00:48:36,863	| radiolab122314 |	Alessia Cara
EDL	00:48:37,375	00:48:38,911	| radiolab122314 |	Will never get
EDL	00:48:41,471	00:48:46,847	| radiolab122314 |	His son was killed by a drone he never saw operated by a man who never meet on behalf of a country that still doesn't admit
EDL	00:48:46,847	00:48:47,615	| radiolab122314 |	It was a mistake
EDL	00:48:48,127	00:48:50,431	| radiolab122314 |	Into the money he got
EDL	00:48:54,015	00:48:57,599	| radiolab122314 |	Which Indian he says was the equivalent of 30000 US dollars
EDL	00:48:57,599	00:48:59,391	| radiolab122314 |	Way more than anyone got in Iraq
EDL	00:48:59,391	00:48:59,903	| radiolab122314 |	Afghanistan
EDL	00:49:00,671	00:49:01,439	| radiolab122314 |	Still
EDL	00:49:01,439	00:49:02,207	| radiolab122314 |	All I can do
EDL	00:49:02,719	00:49:03,999	| radiolab122314 |	Without anything else to go on
EDL	00:49:04,511	00:49:08,607	| radiolab122314 |	It's just compare amount
EDL	00:49:14,751	00:49:16,799	| radiolab122314 |	He can accept that only if
EDL	00:49:18,591	00:49:19,359	| radiolab122314 |	If
EDL	00:49:19,359	00:49:20,639	| radiolab122314 |	He gets to know the
EDL	00:49:20,639	00:49:21,407	| radiolab122314 |	Like the payment
EDL	00:49:21,919	00:49:23,455	| radiolab122314 |	Equal to CC
EDL	00:49:24,991	00:49:28,063	| radiolab122314 |	To like in America how long you can persuade someone who
EDL	00:49:28,063	00:49:33,183	| radiolab122314 |	Who lost his son from the payment was the payment was equal

EDL	00:51:19,679	00:51:20,703	| radiolab122314 |	We
EDL	00:51:20,703	00:51:23,007	| radiolab122314 |	Think of ecosystems as just kind of
EDL	00:51:23,007	00:51:25,823	| radiolab122314 |	Sitting there actually they're doing things
EDL	00:51:26,335	00:51:29,151	| radiolab122314 |	They weren't doing them for us we would have to pay
EDL	00:51:29,919	00:51:31,455	| radiolab122314 |	To do them artificially
EDL	00:51:31,455	00:51:34,271	| radiolab122314 |	For example cotton farms in South Texas
EDL	00:51:34,783	00:51:37,599	| radiolab122314 |	So that you know the farmers are doing their thing like this guy
EDL	00:51:38,111	00:51:41,951	| radiolab122314 |	James Parker
EDL	00:51:41,951	00:51:48,351	| radiolab122314 |	I don't usually five to six seven hundred acres of cotton Soul say mm Bale
EDL	00:51:48,351	00:51:50,143	| radiolab122314 |	I spent a lot of time on a tractor in

EDL	00:51:54,751	00:51:55,775	| radiolab122314 |	They have
EDL	00:51:55,775	00:51:56,799	| radiolab122314 |	All this extra help
EDL	00:51:57,823	00:51:58,591	| radiolab122314 |	In the air
EDL	00:51:58,591	00:51:59,871	| radiolab122314 |	Yes
EDL	00:51:59,871	00:52:02,431	| radiolab122314 |	How many bats are out there you really don't know
EDL	00:52:02,943	00:52:03,711	| radiolab122314 |	Flying all around
EDL	00:52:04,479	00:52:05,759	| radiolab122314 |	The bats eat
EDL	00:52:06,783	00:52:08,831	| radiolab122314 |	The equivalent of 2/3 of their own weight
EDL	00:52:09,343	00:52:10,367	| radiolab122314 |	In insects
EDL	00:52:10,367	00:52:11,391	| radiolab122314 |	Every night
EDL	00:52:11,391	00:52:12,159	| radiolab122314 |	Wow
EDL	00:52:12,159	00:52:13,695	| radiolab122314 |	They eat all night long
EDL	00:52:13,695	00:52:14,719	| radiolab122314 |	All kind of bugs
EDL	00:52:14,719	00:52:15,743	| radiolab122314 |	A whole bunch of pets
EDL	00:52:16,255	00:52:18,815	| radiolab122314 |	That would otherwise be eating the car
EDL	00:52:18,815	00:52:25,215	| radiolab122314 |	Now a few years ago guy named John Westfall get a calculation
EDL	00:52:25,215	00:52:31,615	| radiolab122314 |	Came out to my farm and did this study he had some college girls at work for him and those girls were out there all
EDL	00:52:31,615	00:52:36,479	| radiolab122314 |	All hours of the night listening to what the bats were saying and each year the farmers
EDL	00:52:36,479	00:52:38,015	| radiolab122314 |	Collectively they make
EDL	00:52:38,015	00:52:39,807	| radiolab122314 |	About 45 million dollars off of
EDL	00:52:39,807	00:52:40,575	| radiolab122314 |	The farm
EDL	00:52:40,575	00:52:43,391	| radiolab122314 |	Question was how much of this is because of the bat
EDL	00:52:43,391	00:52:49,279	| radiolab122314 |	You know bats are natural pesticide spray
EDL	00:52:49,279	00:52:50,047	| radiolab122314 |	Figured out
EDL	00:52:50,047	00:52:53,631	| radiolab122314 |	Out of 45 million dollars it was around $700,000
EDL	00:52:54,143	00:52:54,911	| radiolab122314 |	That
EDL	00:52:54,911	00:52:56,447	| radiolab122314 |	You could describe to the bats
EDL	00:52:56,447	00:52:57,727	| radiolab122314 |	It's just beautiful
EDL	00:52:57,727	00:52:59,775	| radiolab122314 |	I mean it does make me sick
EDL	00:53:00,543	00:53:01,567	| radiolab122314 |	If you're those farmers
EDL	00:53:02,591	00:53:04,127	| radiolab122314 |	You should be compensating the bats
EDL	00:53:05,919	00:53:07,455	| radiolab122314 |	Yeah well yeah
EDL	00:53:07,455	00:53:10,015	| radiolab122314 |	It does give you a glimpse
EDL	00:53:11,039	00:53:15,391	| radiolab122314 |	The kind of scale of value economic value
EDL	00:53:15,391	00:53:18,975	| radiolab122314 |	That nature has that we generally just totally ignore but
EDL	00:53:18,975	00:53:21,279	| radiolab122314 |	We talked to a guy who didn't ignore
EDL	00:53:21,279	00:53:25,631	| radiolab122314 |	My name is Robert costanzo in fact he took this way of thinking to the app
EDL	00:53:25,631	00:53:27,167	| radiolab122314 |	Absolute limit
EDL	00:53:27,167	00:53:28,447	| radiolab122314 |	So the question was
EDL	00:53:28,447	00:53:31,775	| radiolab122314 |	What's the value of all of these ecosystem Services globally
EDL	00:53:31,775	00:53:38,175	| radiolab122314 |	All the services on Earth has bugs eating leaves worms turning the soil is chewing tree stump
EDL	00:53:38,175	00:53:40,223	| radiolab122314 |	Taking cities during storms everything
EDL	00:53:40,223	00:53:45,343	| radiolab122314 |	We tried to synthesize all of the studies that had been done around the country in the world
EDL	00:53:45,343	00:53:46,367	| radiolab122314 |	Like that bad study
EDL	00:53:46,367	00:53:47,391	| radiolab122314 |	Except I didn't just look at it
EDL	00:53:47,391	00:53:49,439	| radiolab122314 |	Cotton Farms they looked at tropical forest
EDL	00:53:49,439	00:53:49,951	| radiolab122314 |	Rivers and lakes
EDL	00:53:50,463	00:53:51,231	| radiolab122314 |	Corriere

EDL	00:53:56,607	00:53:58,399	| radiolab122314 |	Excel spreadsheet
EDL	00:53:58,399	00:54:00,959	| radiolab122314 |	It's it's kind of a Excel spreadsheet
EDL	00:54:00,959	00:54:04,799	| radiolab122314 |	From hell can get tricky so Costanza and his colleagues took all these different
EDL	00:54:05,311	00:54:08,639	| radiolab122314 |	Some of them together did a whole bunch of math and
EDL	00:54:09,663	00:54:10,687	| radiolab122314 |	Came up with a number
EDL	00:54:11,199	00:54:12,479	| radiolab122314 |	Which in today's dollars
EDL	00:54:12,479	00:54:14,783	| radiolab122314 |	Is 142.7
EDL	00:54:14,783	00:54:15,807	| radiolab122314 |	A trillion dollars
EDL	00:54:16,831	00:54:17,343	| radiolab122314 |	Pergear
EDL	00:54:18,111	00:54:18,879	| radiolab122314 |	Car services
EDL	00:54:19,391	00:54:21,183	| radiolab122314 |	That's more than
EDL	00:54:21,183	00:54:22,463	| radiolab122314 |	All of the
EDL	00:54:22,463	00:54:23,999	| radiolab122314 |	Gross national product
EDL	00:54:23,999	00:54:24,511	| radiolab122314 |	Of the world
EDL	00:54:25,023	00:54:26,303	| radiolab122314 |	That's how viable
EDL	00:54:26,303	00:54:27,839	| radiolab122314 |	The services of nature are
EDL	00:54:30,143	00:54:32,959	| radiolab122314 |	Masc guy get the I get the way this will work with a bat
EDL	00:54:32,959	00:54:35,263	| radiolab122314 |	Play bats eating the box but like how do you do it
EDL	00:54:36,287	00:54:36,799	| radiolab122314 |	With like
EDL	00:54:37,823	00:54:38,847	| radiolab122314 |	Would like a like a
EDL	00:54:39,615	00:54:42,175	| radiolab122314 |	Field or something like you just walk through and I guess that's
EDL	00:54:42,175	00:54:42,687	| radiolab122314 |	20 bucks
EDL	00:54:43,967	00:54:45,759	| radiolab122314 |	How do you figure out what the services are
EDL	00:54:45,759	00:54:47,807	| radiolab122314 |	Well are they they came up with a list
EDL	00:54:48,575	00:54:49,343	| radiolab122314 |	So
EDL	00:54:50,111	00:54:51,903	| radiolab122314 |	The list kind of depends
EDL	00:54:52,671	00:54:54,719	| radiolab122314 |	On the ecosystem you're talkin about
EDL	00:54:54,719	00:54:57,279	| radiolab122314 |	Does different ecosystems provide different services
EDL	00:54:57,279	00:54:58,815	| radiolab122314 |	For example
EDL	00:54:58,815	00:54:59,583	| radiolab122314 |	A
EDL	00:54:59,583	00:55:00,095	| radiolab122314 |	A salt marsh
EDL	00:55:02,143	00:55:03,423	| radiolab122314 |	And we are in the Waterfront
EDL	00:55:03,935	00:55:04,703	| radiolab122314 |	You're in the water
EDL	00:55:05,215	00:55:08,543	| radiolab122314 |	What is it with Sweets Salt marshes it like a Florida wetlands
EDL	00:55:08,543	00:55:11,103	| radiolab122314 |	I don't know what a salt marsh
EDL	00:55:11,103	00:55:13,663	| radiolab122314 |	Salt marshes are wetlands that are on the
EDL	00:55:13,663	00:55:18,271	| radiolab122314 |	Coast Guard water here we're quickly approaching high tide
EDL	00:55:18,271	00:55:21,599	| radiolab122314 |	We sent one of our producers simonelli to a nearby salt marsh
EDL	00:55:21,599	00:55:26,207	| radiolab122314 |	Parsley to Hazen your boots are much more water
EDL	00:55:26,207	00:55:27,231	| radiolab122314 |	Talk to this guy
EDL	00:55:27,231	00:55:30,303	| radiolab122314 |	My name is Adam Whelchel and I'm the director science
EDL	00:55:30,303	00:55:36,703	| radiolab122314 |	For The Nature Conservancy here in Connecticut and Adam gave Simon Atlantic inventory
EDL	00:55:36,703	00:55:37,727	| radiolab122314 |	/
EDL	00:55:37,727	00:55:39,007	| radiolab122314 |	Coastal salt marshes
EDL	00:55:39,519	00:55:41,055	| radiolab122314 |	The stream of goods and services
EDL	00:55:41,055	00:55:42,079	| radiolab122314 |	Invited over time
EDL	00:55:42,079	00:55:44,383	| radiolab122314 |	One of the things that does is
EDL	00:55:44,383	00:55:46,687	| radiolab122314 |	It takes water that's coming in
EDL	00:55:46,687	00:55:50,015	| radiolab122314 |	From Inland and it's Laden with all sorts of pollutant salsa
EDL	00:55:50,015	00:55:52,831	| radiolab122314 |	Start the bad stuff the salt marsh was trapped at water so the
EDL	00:55:52,831	00:55:55,647	| radiolab122314 |	Settle in and very often the Marsh Grass
EDL	00:55:56,159	00:55:57,951	| radiolab122314 |	Will suck up that water
EDL	00:55:57,951	00:55:59,231	| radiolab122314 |	Do the roots and
EDL	00:55:59,743	00:56:00,767	| radiolab122314 |	Clean it up
EDL	00:56:01,279	00:56:02,303	| radiolab122314 |	So you could ask Gary
EDL	00:56:02,815	00:56:03,839	| radiolab122314 |	How much would you have to
EDL	00:56:03,839	00:56:04,351	| radiolab122314 |	Suspend
EDL	00:56:04,863	00:56:05,887	| radiolab122314 |	To keep your water
EDL	00:56:06,399	00:56:07,423	| radiolab122314 |	That clean
EDL	00:56:07,423	00:56:08,959	| radiolab122314 |	There is one other study guide
EDL	00:56:09,471	00:56:12,543	| radiolab122314 |	Adam Whelchel said that scientists New England already figured that out
EDL	00:56:12,543	00:56:18,943	| radiolab122314 |	For flood control water supply protection pollution controls roughly about $31
EDL	00:56:18,943	00:56:19,967	| radiolab122314 |	Cars in $0.22
EDL	00:56:20,479	00:56:26,879	| radiolab122314 |	Per hectare per year then you got to add the value of all the plants that feed the fish that end up on our dinner play 338.
EDL	00:56:26,879	00:56:31,999	| radiolab122314 |	Been there the birdwatchers that by latte support the local economy
EDL	00:56:31,999	00:56:37,375	| radiolab122314 |	$90 per hectare and then there's habitat provisioning the list goes on and on and on
EDL	00:56:37,887	00:56:39,935	| radiolab122314 |	You get kind of obsessed with that you start like
EDL	00:56:40,447	00:56:43,007	| radiolab122314 |	You start becoming an accountant and writing down numbers
EDL	00:56:43,775	00:56:44,543	| radiolab122314 |	Seriously
EDL	00:56:44,543	00:56:47,103	| radiolab122314 |	And it gets you too
EDL	00:56:47,103	00:56:49,151	| radiolab122314 |	Think about nature
EDL	00:56:49,151	00:56:50,175	| radiolab122314 |	In a different way
EDL	00:56:50,175	00:56:51,455	| radiolab122314 |	Then you had before
EDL	00:56:51,455	00:56:52,991	| radiolab122314 |	Galling
EDL	00:56:52,991	00:56:56,063	| radiolab122314 |	Element over this aspect like when I first came across
EDL	00:56:56,063	00:56:59,135	| radiolab122314 |	This pointer producer Tim Howard jump into the interview in
EDL	00:56:59,135	00:57:00,159	| radiolab122314 |	You'll also hear Opera
EDL	00:57:00,159	00:57:00,927	| radiolab122314 |	Pretty sister on wheeler in
EDL	00:57:01,695	00:57:03,999	| radiolab122314 |	I do feel like in an example like the Salt March
EDL	00:57:04,511	00:57:07,071	| radiolab122314 |	Which cleans water that's all reliant on
EDL	00:57:07,071	00:57:10,399	| radiolab122314 |	People being there that need water so if you didn't have people there
EDL	00:57:10,399	00:57:16,543	| radiolab122314 |	Does that saltmarsh cica have any value but Tim haven't you ever had a conversation with somebody who just doesn't get
EDL	00:57:17,567	00:57:18,847	| radiolab122314 |	Like if you make the aesthetic art
EDL	00:57:19,359	00:57:20,383	| radiolab122314 |	Which is that nature
EDL	00:57:20,895	00:57:23,199	| radiolab122314 |	Should be should be preserved for its own sake
EDL	00:57:23,711	00:57:27,295	| radiolab122314 |	There's a whole category of humanity just doesn't respond to that argument
EDL	00:57:27,295	00:57:28,831	| radiolab122314 |	Is this becomes a way to
EDL	00:57:29,855	00:57:35,231	| radiolab122314 |	Talk across the aisle but it does still feel like Adam Oates something of infinite value
EDL	00:57:35,231	00:57:36,255	| radiolab122314 |	2 something of
EDL	00:57:36,767	00:57:43,167	| radiolab122314 |	Appeal evaluation really beat infinite value I mean would like a mother's love you don't take your mother's love is priceless I mean you know
EDL	00:57:43,167	00:57:43,935	| radiolab122314 |	Okay
EDL	00:57:43,935	00:57:44,959	| radiolab122314 |	II
EDL	00:57:44,959	00:57:47,007	| radiolab122314 |	Totally accept that there is
EDL	00:57:47,519	00:57:50,591	| radiolab122314 |	The Serta Priceless aspect of nature
EDL	00:57:50,591	00:57:52,383	| radiolab122314 |	But if you are
EDL	00:57:52,895	00:57:54,943	| radiolab122314 |	In the government in a very poor country
EDL	00:57:55,455	00:57:56,991	| radiolab122314 |	You have some tough choices to make
EDL	00:57:57,503	00:58:01,087	| radiolab122314 |	If somebody comes to you and says okay you got these lovely mangrove

EDL	00:58:02,623	00:58:03,903	| radiolab122314 |	That the desert of
EDL	00:58:03,903	00:58:06,207	| radiolab122314 |	Setting with mangoes are is the perfect place
EDL	00:58:06,975	00:58:08,767	| radiolab122314 |	For shrimp aquaculture
EDL	00:58:08,767	00:58:11,583	| radiolab122314 |	Biggest shrimp Farms need lots of seawater so it makes sense to
EDL	00:58:11,583	00:58:14,399	| radiolab122314 |	But then we're going to put in these Farms are going to go shrimp
EDL	00:58:14,399	00:58:17,983	| radiolab122314 |	You are going to get millions and millions of dollars in tax revenue
EDL	00:58:17,983	00:58:22,079	| radiolab122314 |	If you're thinking about the welfare of all the people in your country
EDL	00:58:23,103	00:58:24,127	| radiolab122314 |	Many of them are starving
EDL	00:58:24,639	00:58:27,455	| radiolab122314 |	That might be a really powerful argument
EDL	00:58:27,455	00:58:29,503	| radiolab122314 |	Not into that kind of a discussion
EDL	00:58:30,015	00:58:31,295	| radiolab122314 |	You can bring in
EDL	00:58:31,807	00:58:33,599	| radiolab122314 |	The fact that these men grows
EDL	00:58:34,111	00:58:35,135	| radiolab122314 |	Are sitting there
EDL	00:58:35,135	00:58:38,463	| radiolab122314 |	Very quietly doing all sorts of incredibly valuable thing
EDL	00:58:38,975	00:58:41,279	| radiolab122314 |	In fact they've done these kind of calculation
EDL	00:58:41,279	00:58:42,559	| radiolab122314 |	And in some cases
EDL	00:58:43,071	00:58:45,631	| radiolab122314 |	The services that mangroves provide
EDL	00:58:45,631	00:58:46,399	| radiolab122314 |	AR

EDL	00:58:47,423	00:58:49,215	| radiolab122314 |	More valuable than what you could get out
EDL	00:58:49,215	00:58:51,007	| radiolab122314 |	With shrimp so it's stupid
EDL	00:58:51,007	00:58:52,287	| radiolab122314 |	It's just stupid
EDL	00:58:52,287	00:58:53,823	| radiolab122314 |	In a bit very basic sense
EDL	00:58:54,591	00:58:57,663	| radiolab122314 |	To wantonly replace lots of mangroves
EDL	00:58:57,663	00:58:58,687	| radiolab122314 |	With shrimp aquaculture
EDL	00:58:59,199	00:59:03,551	| radiolab122314 |	Is that a hypothetical situation know that's your ass
EDL	00:59:03,551	00:59:08,671	| radiolab122314 |	This is Glenn Marie Lang she's an environmental economist for the World Bank and she says very often
EDL	00:59:09,183	00:59:15,583	| radiolab122314 |	She finds herself in exactly this kind of conversation. You know I work for the world bank's or prime
EDL	00:59:15,583	00:59:17,887	| radiolab122314 |	Primary clients are our governments
EDL	00:59:17,887	00:59:21,727	| radiolab122314 |	Philippines Vietnam when you're talkin to a minister of finance and saying
EDL	00:59:21,727	00:59:25,823	| radiolab122314 |	You know what I know jobs are jobs but you need those Marsha
EDL	00:59:25,823	00:59:30,687	| radiolab122314 |	They have value don't say well yeah that's true but that means I'm going to have to reduce
EDL	00:59:30,687	00:59:33,503	| radiolab122314 |	The money that I put into the education budget
EDL	00:59:33,503	00:59:36,831	| radiolab122314 |	So you got to really make a strong argument about the benefits
EDL	00:59:37,343	00:59:40,159	| radiolab122314 |	That's really where the rubber hits the road
EDL	00:59:40,159	00:59:40,927	| radiolab122314 |	Well
EDL	00:59:40,927	00:59:44,255	| radiolab122314 |	I mean that's here's the counter-argument it comes from Doug McCauley and
EDL	00:59:44,255	00:59:45,279	| radiolab122314 |	The college's at Universal
EDL	00:59:45,279	00:59:46,047	| radiolab122314 |	City California
EDL	00:59:46,047	00:59:48,863	| radiolab122314 |	Santa Barbara the real danger is that we actually succeed that we
EDL	00:59:49,375	00:59:53,215	| radiolab122314 |	We convince people that nature is Viola cuz it makes money and then where
EDL	00:59:53,727	00:59:56,543	| radiolab122314 |	We're really in trouble in the minions is for a doesn't make us money
EDL	00:59:56,543	00:59:58,591	| radiolab122314 |	What do you do in a situation he says we're
EDL	00:59:58,591	01:00:00,639	| radiolab122314 |	Say a bunch of rivers are running dry
EDL	01:00:00,639	01:00:01,407	| radiolab122314 |	I am there
EDL	01:00:01,407	01:00:05,247	| radiolab122314 |	Quote depreciating in value you know by the same logic that you trained to think with
EDL	01:00:05,247	01:00:11,647	| radiolab122314 |	We should go out and liquidate these natural assets that makes me feel really uncomfortable he says it's just kind of a weird way to think
EDL	01:00:11,647	01:00:13,951	| radiolab122314 |	Nature proposal hearing
EDL	01:00:13,951	01:00:15,487	| radiolab122314 |	City California to make

EDL	01:00:17,023	01:00:17,791	| radiolab122314 |	And
EDL	01:00:17,791	01:00:19,839	| radiolab122314 |	Economist how to look at this legislation and said
EDL	01:00:20,351	01:00:21,119	| radiolab122314 |	This is
EDL	01:00:21,119	01:00:22,399	| radiolab122314 |	Expected to generate
EDL	01:00:22,399	01:00:24,703	| radiolab122314 |	163 million dollars annually
EDL	01:00:25,215	01:00:25,983	| radiolab122314 |	State of California
EDL	01:00:26,751	01:00:27,519	| radiolab122314 |	Well
EDL	01:00:27,519	01:00:28,799	| radiolab122314 |	It's good to know that
EDL	01:00:28,799	01:00:33,151	| radiolab122314 |	I appreciate having that information in front of me however when I'm making a
EDL	01:00:33,151	01:00:35,455	| radiolab122314 |	A decision on this legislation and I would say
EDL	01:00:35,967	01:00:37,503	| radiolab122314 |	It wouldn't many legislators
EDL	01:00:37,503	01:00:40,319	| radiolab122314 |	Voters average citizens are considering issues at hand
EDL	01:00:40,831	01:00:43,647	| radiolab122314 |	They're not thinking about whether they're going to make hundreds
EDL	01:00:43,647	01:00:44,671	| radiolab122314 |	60 million dollars
EDL	01:00:44,671	01:00:46,975	| radiolab122314 |	The state that thinking about a different set of values
EDL	01:00:46,975	01:00:50,303	| radiolab122314 |	On the other hand I want to say and this is based on my
EDL	01:00:50,303	01:00:52,351	| radiolab122314 |	Experience working in developing country
EDL	01:00:53,119	01:00:54,399	| radiolab122314 |	When you don't
EDL	01:00:54,399	01:00:56,959	| radiolab122314 |	Put a value on these services
EDL	01:00:56,959	01:00:59,263	| radiolab122314 |	Basically they don't get counted
EDL	01:00:59,263	01:01:02,079	| radiolab122314 |	They get implicitly assigned a value of 0
EDL	01:01:02,079	01:01:02,847	| radiolab122314 |	Queenie Glenn Murray
EDL	01:01:03,871	01:01:05,919	| radiolab122314 |	And as we were debating this going back and forth and back
EDL	01:01:06,943	01:01:08,479	| radiolab122314 |	We bumped into a story
EDL	01:01:09,247	01:01:12,575	| radiolab122314 |	About what happens when all of these value of nature ideas are
EDL	01:01:12,575	01:01:14,367	| radiolab122314 |	Are let loose into a world
EDL	01:01:14,367	01:01:15,135	| radiolab122314 |	Fruits
EDL	01:01:15,135	01:01:15,903	| radiolab122314 |	And trees
EDL	01:01:15,903	01:01:16,671	| radiolab122314 |	Human uncertainty
EDL	01:01:18,719	01:01:19,743	| radiolab122314 |	The parable of the bees
EDL	01:01:20,255	01:01:24,607	| radiolab122314 |	We heard this first from writer JB MacKinnon who says the Story begins
EDL	01:01:24,607	01:01:27,167	| radiolab122314 |	And now County in central China
EDL	01:01:27,167	01:01:29,215	| radiolab122314 |	Rural area fairly remote
EDL	01:01:29,215	01:01:31,519	| radiolab122314 |	Lush Green Mountains filled with apple orchards
EDL	01:01:32,031	01:01:34,335	| radiolab122314 |	And apple orchard in was
EDL	01:01:34,335	01:01:35,359	| radiolab122314 |	What is the main business
EDL	01:01:35,359	01:01:37,663	| radiolab122314 |	I'm going to JB in in the 1990s
EDL	01:01:37,663	01:01:40,991	| radiolab122314 |	The wild bees male County slowly started to
EDL	01:01:40,991	01:01:41,759	| radiolab122314 |	To disappear
EDL	01:01:43,551	01:01:44,575	| radiolab122314 |	There's a few different
EDL	01:01:44,575	01:01:46,111	| radiolab122314 |	Reasons given for that
EDL	01:01:46,111	01:01:48,671	| radiolab122314 |	It could have been the destruction of the habitat
EDL	01:01:48,671	01:01:49,951	| radiolab122314 |	The bees nest in
EDL	01:01:49,951	01:01:54,047	| radiolab122314 |	The heavy honey harvesting that wasn't leaving enough food for the bees but the
EDL	01:01:54,047	01:01:55,071	| radiolab122314 |	The prevailing Theory
EDL	01:01:55,071	01:01:56,095	| radiolab122314 |	He's actually a nikkah nama
EDL	01:01:56,607	01:01:59,679	| radiolab122314 |	Because Emma 1990s of China was shifting to a market-based
EDL	01:02:00,447	01:02:03,007	| radiolab122314 |	Apple producers are under pressure to produce
EDL	01:02:03,007	01:02:04,031	| radiolab122314 |	More apples
EDL	01:02:04,031	01:02:06,079	| radiolab122314 |	So they started spraying pesticide
EDL	01:02:06,591	01:02:08,639	| radiolab122314 |	Probably it was a constellation of
EDL	01:02:08,639	01:02:10,175	| radiolab122314 |	All of those things in a few others
EDL	01:02:10,687	01:02:11,967	| radiolab122314 |	End result is
EDL	01:02:11,967	01:02:13,759	| radiolab122314 |	Baby stopped buzzing in mouth County
EDL	01:02:13,759	01:02:15,039	| radiolab122314 |	Which if you are
EDL	01:02:15,039	01:02:15,807	| radiolab122314 |	Apple farmer
EDL	01:02:16,319	01:02:17,599	| radiolab122314 |	That's a disaster
EDL	01:02:17,599	01:02:20,159	| radiolab122314 |	Bees travel from flower to flower
EDL	01:02:20,159	01:02:22,463	| radiolab122314 |	Search of nectar they are over there
EDL	01:02:22,463	01:02:23,231	| radiolab122314 |	Dusted with
EDL	01:02:23,231	01:02:24,255	| radiolab122314 |	Pollen which is
EDL	01:02:24,255	01:02:26,047	| radiolab122314 |	The means by which flowers
EDL	01:02:26,047	01:02:27,839	| radiolab122314 |	Engage in sexual intercourse
EDL	01:02:27,839	01:02:30,911	| radiolab122314 |	So if you don't have the bees making the birds and the bees
EDL	01:02:30,911	01:02:31,935	| radiolab122314 |	On the blossoms
EDL	01:02:31,935	01:02:32,959	| radiolab122314 |	Then
EDL	01:02:32,959	01:02:35,007	| radiolab122314 |	Then you don't get fertile flowers
EDL	01:02:35,519	01:02:41,663	| radiolab122314 |	To turn into turn into fruit and obviously if you're a fruit farmer and you have no fruit to sell you have no income
EDL	01:02:43,967	01:02:50,111	| radiolab122314 |	So what are you do you're not performing you don't have these then you need to find some other way to pollinate the flowers
EDL	01:02:51,391	01:02:52,671	| radiolab122314 |	And I guess they concluded
EDL	01:02:52,671	01:02:54,719	| radiolab122314 |	What will have to add ourselves
EDL	01:02:54,719	01:02:59,327	| radiolab122314 |	Bai hat in Mandarin Chinese with Asian Gong Show
EDL	01:02:59,327	01:03:02,655	| radiolab122314 |	And so would be that means Emmanuel coronation

EDL	01:03:11,359	01:03:13,919	| radiolab122314 |	Lcounty so he flies to Chengdu and he in a friend Hopper
EDL	01:03:13,919	01:03:20,319	| radiolab122314 |	In the car and we drive for like five or six hours until we reach a disability International
EDL	01:03:20,319	01:03:21,343	| radiolab122314 |	Tiny little village
EDL	01:03:21,343	01:03:23,135	| radiolab122314 |	Few houses
EDL	01:03:23,135	01:03:25,183	| radiolab122314 |	And then we took your smaller

EDL	01:03:26,719	01:03:27,743	| radiolab122314 |	The field
EDL	01:03:27,743	01:03:30,303	| radiolab122314 |	And we have to be so old that they wear
EDL	01:03:30,303	01:03:31,583	| radiolab122314 |	Lots of farmers
EDL	01:03:31,583	01:03:34,399	| radiolab122314 |	In the trees like on the apple trees
EDL	01:03:34,399	01:03:36,447	| radiolab122314 |	Rattling up and down these muffins

EDL	01:03:41,055	01:03:46,943	| radiolab122314 |	Harold and his friend took pictures and if you look at those pictures you'll see the farmers holding little brats

EDL	01:03:53,599	01:03:56,671	| radiolab122314 |	I made have a little bottle filled with pollen and then what they do

EDL	01:04:37,631	01:04:39,423	| radiolab122314 |	The message that it seemed to send was that
EDL	01:04:39,935	01:04:45,311	| radiolab122314 |	This is what happens if you if you lose biodiversity you end up standing in the trees
EDL	01:04:45,823	01:04:48,383	| radiolab122314 |	Doing the job that the bees used to do on the win
EDL	01:04:48,383	01:04:49,151	| radiolab122314 |	For free
EDL	01:04:49,151	01:04:49,919	| radiolab122314 |	For free
EDL	01:04:50,431	01:04:52,223	| radiolab122314 |	Those people are just like
EDL	01:04:52,223	01:04:54,783	| radiolab122314 |	Human beast in this guy
EDL	01:04:56,831	01:04:57,599	| radiolab122314 |	Yeah
EDL	01:04:57,599	01:05:01,439	| radiolab122314 |	Human Beast four years ago he travel to mail County to do
EDL	01:05:01,439	01:05:04,511	| radiolab122314 |	Economic analysis of just how much the loss of the bees
EDL	01:05:05,023	01:05:06,559	| radiolab122314 |	Is hurting the farmers amount County
EDL	01:05:07,327	01:05:09,119	| radiolab122314 |	But what he discovered weird
EDL	01:05:09,887	01:05:13,727	| radiolab122314 |	Was it the trees were producing more apples than ever
EDL	01:05:13,727	01:05:14,495	| radiolab122314 |	What production
EDL	01:05:15,007	01:05:16,543	| radiolab122314 |	This can be confirmed
EDL	01:05:17,055	01:05:19,103	| radiolab122314 |	Zelmore production
EDL	01:05:19,103	01:05:23,711	| radiolab122314 |	For hand pollination apple tree bee pollination for tree
EDL	01:05:23,711	01:05:24,991	| radiolab122314 |	Humans are more efficient
EDL	01:05:26,015	01:05:29,599	| radiolab122314 |	Really people were doing it better than the beasts I've been doing it
EDL	01:05:29,599	01:05:31,647	| radiolab122314 |	A lot better reproduction went up
EDL	01:05:32,159	01:05:38,559	| radiolab122314 |	30% that's what the farmers told you disenchant just kind of amazing
EDL	01:05:38,559	01:05:39,071	| radiolab122314 |	Amber amazing
EDL	01:05:39,583	01:05:42,655	| radiolab122314 |	Because I think hand pollination can pollinate
EDL	01:05:42,655	01:05:45,983	| radiolab122314 |	Maserati every flower
EDL	01:05:45,983	01:05:47,775	| radiolab122314 |	And bees don't pollinate a flower
EDL	01:05:47,775	01:05:49,311	| radiolab122314 |	These are a little bit
EDL	01:05:49,823	01:05:56,223	| radiolab122314 |	Yeah they're a little bit uneven when it comes to
EDL	01:05:56,223	01:05:57,503	| radiolab122314 |	I don't like it if it's damp
EDL	01:05:57,503	01:06:02,111	| radiolab122314 |	They don't like it if it's windy in all those cases bees often decide to stay indoors and just take
EDL	01:06:03,391	01:06:07,487	| radiolab122314 |	You send people out there and tell him to pollinate every damn block
EDL	01:06:07,487	01:06:11,583	| radiolab122314 |	And they're going to do it and there is the additional benefit of
EDL	01:06:11,583	01:06:12,863	| radiolab122314 |	The people that you paid
EDL	01:06:12,863	01:06:14,911	| radiolab122314 |	They go to the bar they buy groceries babe
EDL	01:06:14,911	01:06:15,679	| radiolab122314 |	Spend those earnings
EDL	01:06:16,191	01:06:18,239	| radiolab122314 |	In their local communities in a way that
EDL	01:06:18,239	01:06:19,007	| radiolab122314 |	Obviously
EDL	01:06:19,007	01:06:20,031	| radiolab122314 |	Bees never did
EDL	01:06:20,031	01:06:22,847	| radiolab122314 |	To hear you had this whole story that was supposed to be about
EDL	01:06:22,847	01:06:27,967	| radiolab122314 |	How important the bees are in the parable of biodiversity through that may be the lessons just the opposite
EDL	01:06:28,479	01:06:29,503	| radiolab122314 |	They're actually
EDL	01:06:29,503	01:06:30,783	| radiolab122314 |	We don't need bees
EDL	01:06:30,783	01:06:32,319	| radiolab122314 |	And maybe we never did
EDL	01:06:32,319	01:06:35,135	| radiolab122314 |	If we only measure things economically then we might conclude that
EDL	01:06:35,647	01:06:40,767	| radiolab122314 |	That some species are some ecological processes just aren't necessary in certain places
EDL	01:06:41,279	01:06:43,071	| radiolab122314 |	I or that we might
EDL	01:06:43,071	01:06:44,351	| radiolab122314 |	Even do better
EDL	01:06:44,351	01:06:46,655	| radiolab122314 |	To to take care of those
EDL	01:06:46,655	01:06:48,703	| radiolab122314 |	Processes ourselves right
EDL	01:06:48,703	01:06:49,215	| radiolab122314 |	So
EDL	01:06:49,983	01:06:52,031	| radiolab122314 |	Let me find My Notes app
EDL	01:06:52,031	01:06:54,335	| radiolab122314 |	Which is exactly but there's one more chapter
EDL	01:06:54,335	01:07:00,735	| radiolab122314 |	The story Harold the boat told us when he visited then Chen
EDL	01:07:00,735	01:07:02,015	| radiolab122314 |	Is there a 68
EDL	01:07:02,015	01:07:04,831	| radiolab122314 |	And he said in his opinion
EDL	01:07:06,367	01:07:08,415	| radiolab122314 |	Henry Nation
EDL	01:07:08,415	01:07:11,487	| radiolab122314 |	Night disappear in a few years
EDL	01:07:11,487	01:07:16,351	| radiolab122314 |	Apparently as China's economy has continued to grow workers have started demanding better pay
EDL	01:07:16,351	01:07:18,655	| radiolab122314 |	New wages are getting so high
EDL	01:07:18,655	01:07:23,775	| radiolab122314 |	Father welcomes that the farmers have to employ to help them basically it's not efficient
EDL	01:07:23,775	01:07:24,799	| radiolab122314 |	Economically
EDL	01:07:24,799	01:07:28,127	| radiolab122314 |	To do the information anymore
EDL	01:07:28,127	01:07:28,895	| radiolab122314 |	Now they're like
EDL	01:07:28,895	01:07:29,919	| radiolab122314 |	They thinking
EDL	01:07:29,919	01:07:31,967	| radiolab122314 |	Need a piece back right yeah
EDL	01:07:31,967	01:07:38,367	| radiolab122314 |	Problem is there are no Bees in those Villages anymore beekeepers in other parts of China
EDL	01:07:38,367	01:07:39,391	| radiolab122314 |	Not going to bring their bees
EDL	01:07:39,903	01:07:41,439	| radiolab122314 |	This area cuz they worry about the pesticide
EDL	01:07:41,951	01:07:42,463	| radiolab122314 |	At the pharmacy
EDL	01:07:42,975	01:07:45,279	| radiolab122314 |	That's what when wild bees might come back
EDL	01:07:45,279	01:07:48,095	| radiolab122314 |	Weather for this week
EDL	01:07:48,095	01:07:49,375	| radiolab122314 |	It's very hard to make a prediction
EDL	01:07:49,887	01:07:51,167	| radiolab122314 |	If you have the Farmer they like
EDL	01:07:52,703	01:07:54,239	| radiolab122314 |	What would you do I don't know
EDL	01:07:57,311	01:07:58,847	| radiolab122314 |	History of that
EDL	01:07:58,847	01:07:59,871	| radiolab122314 |	Story thieves me
EDL	01:07:59,871	01:08:02,687	| radiolab122314 |	It leaves me thinking that you can Amish is just not a good way
EDL	01:08:03,199	01:08:04,479	| radiolab122314 |	Putting an r value
EDL	01:08:04,991	01:08:05,759	| radiolab122314 |	Even though
EDL	01:08:05,759	01:08:06,527	| radiolab122314 |	Even up
EDL	01:08:06,527	01:08:07,295	| radiolab122314 |	Syson
EDL	01:08:07,295	01:08:09,087	| radiolab122314 |	Thoughtful value on a b
EDL	01:08:09,087	01:08:09,855	| radiolab122314 |	On the pound
EDL	01:08:10,879	01:08:13,183	| radiolab122314 |	It you do it and you think you're smart
EDL	01:08:13,183	01:08:16,511	| radiolab122314 |	But then the value changes the bees go from being worth a lot
EDL	01:08:16,511	01:08:18,815	| radiolab122314 |	To being worth nothing to be worth everything
EDL	01:08:18,815	01:08:23,679	| radiolab122314 |	What was in a few years this this is what markets do they swing back forth
EDL	01:08:23,679	01:08:24,959	| radiolab122314 |	And we pretend that we can play
EDL	01:08:25,983	01:08:26,751	| radiolab122314 |	But we never can
EDL	01:08:27,263	01:08:33,663	| radiolab122314 |	So you can't put the volume cuz you can always going to be wrong or right
EDL	01:08:33,663	01:08:34,687	| radiolab122314 |	Weather Cypress
EDL	01:08:34,687	01:08:37,503	| radiolab122314 |	Nowhere in the story did someone walk into the middle of
EDL	01:08:37,503	01:08:38,015	| radiolab122314 |	The proceedings
EDL	01:08:38,527	01:08:41,343	| radiolab122314 |	You know what these do have value here's the number
EDL	01:08:41,343	01:08:47,743	| radiolab122314 |	Text Carl we were talking to him told us you know they've been estimates that the value of pollination
EDL	01:08:47,743	01:08:48,767	| radiolab122314 |	When it comes from wild bees
EDL	01:08:49,279	01:08:51,327	| radiolab122314 |	Is 190 billion dollars
EDL	01:08:51,327	01:08:54,655	| radiolab122314 |	So that's globally right but still there was nobody in the room
EDL	01:08:54,655	01:08:57,983	| radiolab122314 |	Giving that kind of number to the bees were inherently valued at
EDL	01:08:57,983	01:09:04,383	| radiolab122314 |	Zero remember Beazer value to 0 only until humans get valued more than bees go down if he's going to have a lot of
EDL	01:09:04,383	01:09:07,199	| radiolab122314 |	Numbers in your head what I like about this idea is it
EDL	01:09:07,199	01:09:09,503	| radiolab122314 |	When you put a number on a bee or a bat
EDL	01:09:09,503	01:09:10,271	| radiolab122314 |	Are Marsh
EDL	01:09:10,271	01:09:11,807	| radiolab122314 |	It's like an attempt
EDL	01:09:11,807	01:09:12,831	| radiolab122314 |	2force
EDL	01:09:12,831	01:09:14,367	| radiolab122314 |	What kind of long-term thinking
EDL	01:09:14,367	01:09:17,183	| radiolab122314 |	You can just say don't do that mean something that like a conservation to say don't
EDL	01:09:18,207	01:09:19,487	| radiolab122314 |	But if you say don't do that
EDL	01:09:19,999	01:09:22,047	| radiolab122314 |	Here's the Valium so lost
EDL	01:09:22,047	01:09:24,607	| radiolab122314 |	Yeah here's the lost one that actually gives the whole
EDL	01:09:24,607	01:09:26,399	| radiolab122314 |	Precautionary don't sing some teeth
EDL	01:09:26,911	01:09:28,191	| radiolab122314 |	Except for this
EDL	01:09:28,191	01:09:29,983	| radiolab122314 |	That if you go
EDL	01:09:29,983	01:09:30,495	| radiolab122314 |	Businesses
EDL	01:09:32,287	01:09:33,311	| radiolab122314 |	And you're wrong
EDL	01:09:33,311	01:09:37,919	| radiolab122314 |	There are irreversibilities that's how environmental economist Glenn Marie Lange
EDL	01:09:38,431	01:09:43,807	| radiolab122314 |	This is one of the differences between natural ecosystems and what we produce
EDL	01:09:43,807	01:09:48,159	| radiolab122314 |	You smash your car hey someone can build a new one if you lose the bees
EDL	01:09:48,927	01:09:50,207	| radiolab122314 |	Many instances
EDL	01:09:50,207	01:09:51,487	| radiolab122314 |	You cannot bring them back
EDL	01:09:51,999	01:09:53,791	| radiolab122314 |	So the question we got to is
EDL	01:09:54,559	01:09:57,119	| radiolab122314 |	Is there another way to think about the value of nature
EDL	01:09:57,119	01:09:58,655	| radiolab122314 |	Show me the way that's not economic
EDL	01:09:59,167	01:10:01,983	| radiolab122314 |	And therefore short-sighted know about us but also
EDL	01:10:01,983	01:10:03,519	| radiolab122314 |	Not simply about
EDL	01:10:03,519	01:10:05,567	| radiolab122314 |	The Aesthetics in the beauty cuz I can be sore
EDL	01:10:06,335	01:10:07,615	| radiolab122314 |	Is there another way
EDL	01:10:07,615	01:10:09,663	| radiolab122314 |	The best I was able to do
EDL	01:10:09,663	01:10:10,687	| radiolab122314 |	Thinking about that
EDL	01:10:10,687	01:10:11,711	| radiolab122314 |	Writer JB MacKinnon
EDL	01:10:12,223	01:10:12,991	| radiolab122314 |	Was
EDL	01:10:12,991	01:10:14,271	| radiolab122314 |	When it struck me that
EDL	01:10:14,783	01:10:15,807	| radiolab122314 |	That in a way
EDL	01:10:16,319	01:10:17,343	| radiolab122314 |	All of this
EDL	01:10:17,343	01:10:20,671	| radiolab122314 |	Diversity that's out there all this biological diversity all these
EDL	01:10:20,671	01:10:22,463	| radiolab122314 |	Wonderful and amazing
EDL	01:10:22,463	01:10:25,791	| radiolab122314 |	And alien things that other species can do
EDL	01:10:25,791	01:10:28,607	| radiolab122314 |	Is like an extension of our own brains
EDL	01:10:29,375	01:10:32,703	| radiolab122314 |	There's so much imagination out there that we simply
EDL	01:10:32,703	01:10:33,983	| radiolab122314 |	Could not come up with
EDL	01:10:34,495	01:10:35,263	| radiolab122314 |	On our own
EDL	01:10:36,031	01:10:36,799	| radiolab122314 |	That
EDL	01:10:36,799	01:10:38,079	| radiolab122314 |	We can think of it as
EDL	01:10:38,591	01:10:40,127	| radiolab122314 |	As a pool
EDL	01:10:40,127	01:10:41,407	| radiolab122314 |	Of imagination
EDL	01:10:41,407	01:10:43,199	| radiolab122314 |	And creativity from which we
EDL	01:10:43,711	01:10:45,247	| radiolab122314 |	As humans are able to draw
EDL	01:10:45,759	01:10:48,575	| radiolab122314 |	And that when we draw down on that
EDL	01:10:48,575	01:10:50,111	| radiolab122314 |	On that pool of
EDL	01:10:50,111	01:10:51,647	| radiolab122314 |	Creativity and Imagination
EDL	01:10:52,159	01:10:52,927	| radiolab122314 |	We
EDL	01:10:52,927	01:10:54,719	| radiolab122314 |	We deeply impoverished ourselves
EDL	01:10:54,719	01:10:56,255	| radiolab122314 |	New innocence we are
EDL	01:10:56,255	01:10:57,535	| radiolab122314 |	We are doing harm
EDL	01:10:58,047	01:11:00,095	| radiolab122314 |	To our own ability to think
EDL	01:11:01,119	01:11:02,399	| radiolab122314 |	I didn't do and dream
EDL	01:11:18,271	01:11:24,671	| radiolab122314 |	JB MacKinnon book is called The Once and Future World he's written many but this one is my favorite thanks to Carl Zimmer
EDL	01:11:24,671	01:11:26,719	| radiolab122314 |	Reporting in the New York Times
EDL	01:11:26,719	01:11:28,511	| radiolab122314 |	On this topic is really what got us
EDL	01:11:28,511	01:11:29,023	| radiolab122314 |	Launch today
EDL	01:11:29,791	01:11:34,911	| radiolab122314 |	And what got us through this whole thing is Simon Adler whose production assistance was invaluable that was him
EDL	01:11:34,911	01:11:41,311	| radiolab122314 |	Freezing his ass off in the marsh I talked so long
EDL	01:11:41,311	01:11:43,103	| radiolab122314 |	How to spell awfully
