EDL	00:00:30,464	00:00:31,232	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So this was back
EDL	00:00:32,256	00:00:38,656	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	1999
EDL	00:00:38,656	00:00:43,520	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Us and other I think NATO allies were involved in a bombing campaign
EDL	00:00:44,032	00:00:50,432	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	In Serbia last gasps of war in the Forum

EDL	00:00:54,528	00:00:57,344	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	NATO was trying to protect them bombing Serbia
EDL	00:00:57,344	00:00:59,648	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Which is creating a huge Exodus refugee
EDL	00:01:00,672	00:01:01,952	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Now Sherry
EDL	00:01:01,952	00:01:03,488	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	At the time was not yet
EDL	00:01:03,488	00:01:04,512	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Fully a reporter
EDL	00:01:04,512	00:01:05,024	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	She was
EDL	00:01:05,536	00:01:06,816	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Fresh out of med school
EDL	00:01:06,816	00:01:09,120	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Volunteering at a human rights organization
EDL	00:01:09,120	00:01:09,888	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Working on a book
EDL	00:01:10,400	00:01:12,192	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	About a war Hospital in Bosnia
EDL	00:01:12,192	00:01:13,728	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And said she knew the landscape
EDL	00:01:14,240	00:01:17,568	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	She was able to convince this organization to let her go to Macedonia
EDL	00:01:18,336	00:01:19,360	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The document what was happening
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:21,920	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The document potential War crime
EDL	00:01:22,432	00:01:26,784	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So I remember I went to the border of Kosovo Macedonia and
EDL	00:01:27,808	00:01:28,832	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	100000
EDL	00:01:28,832	00:01:30,368	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Refugees had shown up
EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:34,464	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They were
EDL	00:01:34,464	00:01:37,024	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Trying to cross the border into Macedonia
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:39,328	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	But the Macedonian government had
EDL	00:01:39,328	00:01:42,144	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Closed its border with Kosovo so people who were
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:43,424	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Fling got trap
EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:44,704	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They got stuck in this
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:47,520	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Muddy no man's land between the two borders
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:52,128	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Said police in riot gear were basically in lining the Macedonian side
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:53,920	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	She had all of these people
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:56,736	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Crammed into this muddy Channel
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:57,504	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:59,296	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The Macedonian Red Cross
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:01,088	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And this one charity
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:03,392	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Had gotten permission to
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:03,904	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Set up
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:06,720	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Mix of medical station
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:08,000	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	In that border area
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:10,304	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Between
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:11,584	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	These two countries
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:13,888	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	This is sort of grumpy Brown Medical.
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:15,936	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Now Sherry was there
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:17,216	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	To conduct interview
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:19,008	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Nothing to do with medicine
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:19,776	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I was there
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:23,104	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	To collect information but when I got there
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:27,200	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I literally remember walking up to this border
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:31,808	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And a doctor who I had interviewed previously this really tall
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:34,368	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Albanian Kosovo Albanian doctor looked out
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:37,440	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And he told the Macedonian Border guard
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:41,024	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Let her in we need her she's a doctor
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:44,096	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Describe being pulled into the 10
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:47,168	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	What's what you just said
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:48,704	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Finish med school
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:51,776	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Suddenly she says she was tossed in with all these War doctors
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:52,800	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And here's the key
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:54,848	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Eventually she gets posted
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:58,688	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	At the door of the tent and what I ended up doing or what
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:00,480	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They put me in charge of was
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:01,504	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Triage
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:04,832	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	No
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:07,904	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It's a it's a French word
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,184	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Nice accent
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:12,768	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I-88 means to sort or to sort for koala
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:17,888	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Originally it was a reference to sorting coffee beans actually sweating different kinds of coffee
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:24,800	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	But a few hundred years ago the word started being applied to people to actually sorting different kinds of casualties
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:25,312	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Battlefield
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:28,128	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I'm not suddenly what's her job
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:31,200	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Literally I stood outside of this
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:33,504	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Makeshift
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:34,528	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Medical station
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:39,136	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And every minute every couple minutes there would be another
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:39,904	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Patient brought
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:41,952	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	To the door of our Medical
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:48,352	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And so my job was to stand outside that door and decide who gets in and who
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:48,864	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Who doesn't
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:51,680	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	How did you do that how did you make that choice
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:56,544	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I don't remember having guidelines I remember just having to wing it
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,336	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	She said she just went on Insta
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:03:59,872	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And so
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:06,272	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The people who seem like they might be having a heart attack or seizure those were the ones who went into that
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:12,416	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	At 10th but you know people with physical disabilities know people who have chronic conditions psychiatric issue
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:17,536	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Everybody else I had to direct
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:18,303	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	To this
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:19,327	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Other tents
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:20,095	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:21,887	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Someone
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:24,191	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Ended up calling it the 10th of the Damned
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:29,311	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I remember but peeling for help
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:31,615	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	From the Macedonian Health Ministry sing
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:34,431	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	No take these people into Macedonia they're not a threat
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:37,247	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Open your border take them in they need
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:38,015	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Care
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:38,783	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:40,063	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The health Ministry
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:42,879	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Refusing and so they stayed in this tent day after
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:43,391	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Today
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:46,975	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Sometimes for 4
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:47,743	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	5
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:48,767	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	6 days
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:51,071	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And several the people in
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:51,839	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	This tent
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:53,375	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They died
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:57,727	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Cherry says this experience
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:04:58,751	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Haunted
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:00,287	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And years later
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:05,663	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	When she was a full-blown reporter and traveling all around the world looking at triage in different scenarios
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:08,991	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	She would return to this memory again and again in wonder
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:10,527	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	How
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:11,807	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Do people
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:14,623	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	In that situation make that decision how should they
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:20,511	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Today a collaboration with the New York Giants wear
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:26,911	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Going to follow reporter Sheri Fink the ins-and-outs of triage in three different situations three
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:32,799	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Different places in the world that she tries to understand what it means to play God
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:37,663	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I'm jamming Rod I am Robert krulwich this is Radiolab
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:38,175	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Stay with us
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:02,751	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Always in case of water
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:09,663	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Bailey when you were going to start with Coast level when did you as a writer be
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:12,735	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Well this
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:13,247	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	This
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:15,295	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	This Obsession of
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:17,087	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	About triage
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:19,391	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Came about when I was working on my
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:21,183	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Last book
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:23,743	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Five days at Memorial which was about
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:26,815	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Triage in the emergency in Hurricane Katrina
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:33,215	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	This is the scenario that people in New Orleans have been fearing for a long time
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:38,079	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	A category 5 hurricane headed right toward the city
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:44,991	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I've heard the story of Katrina told and retold certainly it's hard not to think about now with what's happening
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:45,503	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Baton Rouge
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:46,783	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	But in this story
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:48,831	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The hurricane is really just
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:52,159	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Really really focusing on one
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:55,487	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	This Hospital Memorial Medical
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:57,279	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Call Center built in 1920s
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:06:59,327	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	In one of the lowest parts
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:01,887	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Types of that city which is really like a bull
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:04,447	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Is a sturdy brick building a stories tall
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:06,239	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Stretching over two city blocks
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:11,359	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Served in every storm until that point it was really seen it somewhere safe
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:23,647	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And this Hospital became for Sherry a kind of portal into these questions about triage
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:26,975	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	She ended up spending six and a half years
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:33,375	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Interviewing doctors at the hospital patients nurses family members government officials ethicist Hospital
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:39,007	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	You know she conducted over 500 interviews to reconstruct moment for moment
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:41,311	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	What happened at the hospital during Hurricane
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:50,271	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Get ready this the most intense part of the storm is getting ready to come across
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:52,319	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Day 1 Monday August 29th
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:53,087	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	2005
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:54,879	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Around 6 a.m.
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:56,927	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Katrina hit
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:05,119	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I've never seen anything in my life like this and
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:09,727	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They get through the storm okay
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:15,359	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	City power's gone but they've got their backup power
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:21,759	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	But this hospital it has a boner ability a lot of American hospitals have which is that they had moved the generator
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:24,575	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	To the second floor so that they would be higher up
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:27,903	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Is playing but electricity is all about
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:28,671	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Circuits
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:32,255	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And they had elements of that backup power system that were below
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:36,351	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Flood level things like switches and other electrical material
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:38,655	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	But they got through the first day okay
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:40,703	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And it seemed to that point that the worst was over
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:42,239	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And then
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:48,639	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	When do the sun rise
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:55,039	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Water surrounds this Hospital
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:09:01,439	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	But it feels New Orleans and as the Water started to rise around the hospital that is the moment
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:03,743	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	That the people in charge new
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:05,279	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They were in big big trouble
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:09,375	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They knew
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,911	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	What their vulnerability was
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:12,447	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	How many patients are in the hospital is it
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:13,727	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	There were
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:15,263	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	250 patients
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:19,359	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They're about 2000 people because you had so many
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:23,967	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Wow staff and then all the visitors who had come with the staff members and with
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:24,479	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The patients
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:27,807	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Sherry says mid-morning on that second day
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:29,087	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Tuesday August 30th
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:31,647	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Just as the waters are starting to rise
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:38,047	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	A group of doctors got together and they did come up with a system which evolved a little bit over the crisis
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:39,327	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	But stay
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:40,351	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Decided
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:41,119	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	First
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:42,399	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Get the babies out
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:43,423	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Get the critic
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:44,447	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Who care Patients Out
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:45,215	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Chandni
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:46,495	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Knew that they had
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:48,031	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	To high water truck
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:53,663	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	From the National Guard in the water wasn't so so high yet at that point it was only part way up
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:55,455	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The sloping emergency room rap
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:58,271	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And they decided to put patients who could walk on those
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:09:59,295	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:03,647	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Helicopter start to arrive
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:06,719	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Medical staff start to bundle tiny babies in incubators
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:08,255	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	ICU patients in wheelchairs
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:09,791	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Onto the elevator
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:10,815	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And up to the helipad
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:16,959	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	How many patients can a single helicopter take in like the ones that were Landing how many can they do one or two
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:18,751	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Slow going
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:21,055	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Yeah it was late evening
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:26,687	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Before they got all the Intensive Care Unit Patients Out the babies and the babies
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:29,759	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	All in all that second day they evacuated about 60 people
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:30,783	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	60
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:31,551	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Critical path
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:35,647	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Although we should also say that
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:38,719	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	If a patient has signed a DNR do not resuscitate
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:40,511	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Are the doctors decided those patient
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:41,791	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Should not go for
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:43,327	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And they were held back
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:46,399	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Explain their thinking on that
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:50,495	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	OKC Darkness Falls Hyundai
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:51,263	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	2
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:52,799	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The doctors and nurses are exhausted
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:56,639	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They've been working really really hard carrying patients in the heat
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:57,919	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Many of them lay down on
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:59,199	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Cotton bacon bits
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:05,599	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	To rest for the night and then
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:11,999	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Before the sun rises 2 hours before about 2 a.m.
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:15,327	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The buzz of the generators suddenly just
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:17,887	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Stopped
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:19,423	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Quiet
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:21,727	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The water had reached
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:23,007	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	There's electrical switches in the base
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:25,055	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Doctor doctor cook
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:30,943	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Yuan cook long-time ICU doctor he was lying not far from where those generators were
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:32,735	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	He said to me it was
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,015	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Quote the sickest
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:34,783	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Sound of a
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:35,551	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	His life
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:36,063	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Sound apps
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:37,855	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:41,951	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	That is when it became an absolute emergency in this house
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:45,279	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Pitch blackness
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:49,631	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Some of the medical equipment they have backup batteries they started beeping
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:52,191	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	To warn that the electrical power heads
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:57,567	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Stop you still had nine patients who relied on ventilators to breathe
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:12:02,431	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It became a hive of activity at got to get everyone out everybody was
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:04,223	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Running around with flashlights
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:06,527	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Beams in the blackness
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:10,111	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Trying desperately to move those patients
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:16,511	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Down the stairs now there's no elevators that's the other big thing fortunately somebody found a hole in them
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:21,631	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Machine room wall on the second floor that led directly to a parking garage
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:28,031	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And so they figured out the path patients through this roughly 3 by 3 foot hold on to the
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:30,591	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The back of a pickup truck drive them up
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:36,991	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	To the 8th story of that parking garage and then carry them up three rickety lights of
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:37,759	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Steps to the
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:39,295	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Formerly unused helipad
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:42,623	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:44,415	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Five of the nine
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:46,463	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Patients on ventilators died
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:47,743	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Just right then
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:50,047	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Just like I said I've been trying to
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:54,655	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I want to make
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:13:01,311	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	This is tape of an interview that Sherry did back in 2018 she was doing research
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:02,335	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Story
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:04,639	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	My name is Gina
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:14,623	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Gina was a nursing director working on the 7th floor of the hospital that day she text me to tending to those now
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:16,927	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	9 patients that didn't make the first helicopter run
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:19,743	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And she described to Sherry that right
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:22,559	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	After the power went out and after the ventilator shutdown
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:24,351	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	One of her patients Flatline
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:25,119	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And um
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:26,655	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The guy in back
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:28,703	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	We had fun out of oxygen
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:31,519	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	That's what you've been told
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:35,871	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And so we brought him down
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:37,919	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Stairs
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:40,223	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	2 second floor
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:45,855	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They brought him down in the dark and then got in line to wait for their turn to go through the hole in the wall
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:46,623	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	To the heliport
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:49,951	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And she says that since his ventilator wasn't working any
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:53,279	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The whole time they were standing there they had the hands
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:54,303	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Squeezes ventilator
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:55,839	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Keybar
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:57,119	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Tony to his lungs
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:59,167	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	You know he kept twitching in
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:13:59,935	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Oxygen
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:02,239	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Television line
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:04,543	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And it was my turn at the window
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:09,407	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	One of the Physicians came over
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,967	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	You do know that he needs oxygen
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:13,759	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Yes sir
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:16,831	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They don't have any eyes
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:19,135	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	We can't get any
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:27,071	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And at that point
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:32,959	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Are you do this
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:34,751	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Why did you just let him go
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:38,847	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	He was right
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,663	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Me to do it with neurologic
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:46,015	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Going to make it without it
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:48,319	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Massages
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:49,855	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Argument
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:52,159	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Shopkins hair
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:54,719	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I waited
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:09,823	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Had to take him out
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:11,871	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Of the Boiler Room
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:15,455	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Odin
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:17,759	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Log was full
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:20,575	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The chaplain came over to
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:26,463	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Took the body into the chapel
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:32,863	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And he just how bad

EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:40,287	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	A few minutes
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:45,407	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Try to compose
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:50,783	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I doubt people
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:51,807	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Say people

EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:54,623	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Just not enough
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:58,719	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Everything you've done is just not enough

EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:13,311	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:14,847	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	That's when
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:15,871	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	There
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:18,175	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Expecting all the helicopters come back
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:21,247	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They wait
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:22,527	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And they wait
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:23,039	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Anyway
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:26,623	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And an occasional helicopter comes
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:28,159	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	But this
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:31,999	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Concerted rescue efforts that had taken place the evening before
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:33,279	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Has stopped
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:35,327	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Now
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:36,607	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	We know now looking back
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:42,495	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Did on that Wednesday the helicopters were doing their own triage
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:48,639	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Rescuing people from looking at people on rooftops waving rags
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:53,759	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The people inside the hospital
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:57,343	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Most of them had no idea
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:58,367	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	All the new
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:16:58,879	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Was
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:01,183	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	We're in this horrific situation
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:03,231	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Where are the helicopters
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:06,303	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	At this point they're still nearly 200 patients at the
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:07,583	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:09,375	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Some of the staff
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:12,447	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Panics because it takes them so long to move the patients
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:13,215	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	2
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:16,543	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The top of the parking garage just below that helipad
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:19,359	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So she says on that third day at about 7 in the morning
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:21,151	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Bunch of doctors in hospital administrator
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:22,431	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Maybe a dozen
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:23,455	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Dozen and a half
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:26,271	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They got together and they decided that they needed a system
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:29,855	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The way of organizing their patients so that when those helicopter
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:30,879	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Started to show up again
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:33,183	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They wouldn't waste any time at all.
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:35,743	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I know exactly who to evacuate in what order
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:36,255	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Another words
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:37,791	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Who are we going to get out
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:44,703	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	That was the question and that's the moment where they come up with the ones
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:45,727	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Twos and threes
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,543	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	This is
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,055	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Triage
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:53,663	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	There are a limited number of resources in this case helicopters in a few boats
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:56,479	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And we have to decide which people get access
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:57,503	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Castillo's resources
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:02,879	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	There are a couple of ways to look at this
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:05,439	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Siri says if you go back to the very beginning of triage
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:07,999	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The first conception of it 1790
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:09,791	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Napoleon's Chief surgeon
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:11,839	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Baron Larry I think
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:12,607	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Give me the rule
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:13,887	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	On the battlefield
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:17,215	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	That you take the people were in the acute need first
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:19,263	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So the tickets are going to be treated first
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:20,287	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And with the most resource
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:26,175	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And this is the way it works in most emergency rooms there's a long waiting line
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:27,199	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Hotspot
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:30,015	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	If you got a heart attack you get right to the front of the line
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:34,623	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Another way to look at it is the utilitarian concept
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:37,951	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It's got its start with some philosophers in the 18th and 19th centuries
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:39,487	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The core of this idea seems simple
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:41,279	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Try to do the greatest good
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:43,839	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	You want to maximize some sort of
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:45,631	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Good outcome amongst
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,143	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The population
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:49,471	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So rather than think about what one individual needs you think
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:51,263	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	How can I save the most
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:53,823	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Number of lives are the most number of years
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:56,383	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I'm going to Max my years of life we might
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:19:01,247	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Want to pick people who are have a better chance of surviving or younger people
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:03,551	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And this method of triage
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:06,623	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Swear you often see in a war zone where I say there's a bombing
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:07,391	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And you have
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:10,207	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	More injured victims than there are ambulances hermetics
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:12,767	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So 1
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:14,047	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	3
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:19,167	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Imagine a library in a hospital waiting area
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:22,495	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Cherry says in this case with the doctors did they ask the staff
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:24,287	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	To get everyone out of their rooms
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:26,079	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Bring them down to that second floor Lobby
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:29,407	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And then some doctors including one whose name
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:32,735	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Might be relevant for later dr. Ana Polo
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:35,295	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	She and another doctor
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:36,831	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They stationed themselves
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:43,231	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	On the landing where the patients were brought down to on that second floor and as the nurses would bring them
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:45,279	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They would look
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:46,815	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Quickly at the patient's chart look at
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:48,607	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Patient and decide on a number
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:50,911	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And the nurses would take magic marker and a piece
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:53,471	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Paper and write either one two or three on that paper
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:54,751	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And then she says
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:56,031	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They would take that number
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:57,311	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Onto the patient's gown
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:19:58,591	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So the ones
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:01,407	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Where you're relatively healthy patients
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:05,247	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Patient maybe who had an appendicitis and their appendix out there
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:06,783	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Looking good they could even be discharged
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:10,623	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The ones would be rescued by boat presumably among the first
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:14,207	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The twos were you're more typical Hospital patient
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:17,535	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Patient maybe who had a heart attack who wasn't
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:19,583	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Fully recovered who
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:20,351	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Would need
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:21,375	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Ongoing care
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:24,447	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They would go by helicopter presumably second
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:25,727	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And industries were those
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:29,311	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Super sick patients or anyone with a do not resuscitate order
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:31,359	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Those patients are golang
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:33,663	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	One of the doctors when I said
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:34,943	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Why did you choose
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:36,479	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The sickest patients to go last
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:39,039	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	One of them said while I figured
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:41,343	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Anyone with a do not resuscitate order
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:43,135	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Would have a
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:47,743	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Terminal or irreversible condition which by the way isn't always the case
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:50,303	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And he said I thought that that patient would have
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:52,607	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Quote the least to lose
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:57,215	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So it sounds like in some way they went to more of a utilitarian wave
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:58,495	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Yeah
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:21:00,543	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And you could see everything that follows
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:02,591	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Flowing from
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:05,919	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Utilitarian decision and actually made it a few different
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:08,735	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Prioritize the healthiest people first
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:10,527	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And the sickest people laugh
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:13,599	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	He's choices ultimately did become
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:16,159	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Very consequential
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:18,464	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	10 case all three groups
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:20,000	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Are placed in different parts of the hospital
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:22,304	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And the threes were kept in the lobby
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:23,840	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The second floor Lobby
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:24,864	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	To jest
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:25,888	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Wait
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:42,784	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So as the day goes on the area started to get really full
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:43,808	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Patient next
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:45,344	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The patient on these cots
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:49,696	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	She says you had about 18 people lined up side-by-side and Caesar
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:52,512	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	People with heart conditions symptoms of pneumonia
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:54,048	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Stroke there were nurses
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:56,864	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It just
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:21:59,424	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	But it was so so hot
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:00,704	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Some people gas
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:03,264	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The temperature inside the building must have been on
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:05,824	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I don't know if there's any way for me to do
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:06,592	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Describe to you
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:09,408	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	How intense the heat was
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:12,992	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	This is doctor anapo in an interview with 60 minutes
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:13,760	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Choose one of the doctors who
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:15,808	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It was relentless
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:17,856	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It was suffocating
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:20,416	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It made it extremely difficult to breathe
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:22,208	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And with the heat
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:24,000	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The terrible smell
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:30,400	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Started to smell really bad and the bathroom
EDL	00:22:30,400	00:22:35,776	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Sewage was sort of backing up in the toilet and they just say it's the word everywhere
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:37,568	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	On the ground everywhere
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:43,200	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Personally I didn't want to eat or drink anything cuz I didn't want to have to use the bathroom
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:47,552	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	As the day went on some people started really feeling abandoned
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:53,952	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Why are they here why aren't they helping us
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:23:00,352	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	On the 7th floor
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:03,168	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Weather was this radio that was playing in the quarter
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:03,680	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	8 minutes
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:09,824	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Iww local talk stations and the radio was
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:16,224	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	One of the only ways they were getting information from the outside
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:22,624	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The rage is growing among some of the nurses have carts that they would roll around and they have the little radio
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:29,024	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	On the cart and they'd be listening jungle human instincts are beginning to creep in and
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:34,912	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Nevertales on the radio that were alarming the stash merchandise
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:41,824	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	These people should be shocked that turned out not to be true like
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:43,360	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Had declared martial law
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:46,432	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	There was literally a deputy sheriff
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:51,808	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Who got on there and told people that

EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:16,896	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Morales really really low because
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:18,432	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	All these patients are still there Bass
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:22,016	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Patients were so hot you know they were just kind of drift off to

EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:26,112	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And make them take sips of water
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:26,880	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Subservient
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:29,696	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Whatever we had you know

EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:47,872	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So there's this level of
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:48,640	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Of panic
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:56,320	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	There is also the situation of the pets
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:57,600	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:24:59,136	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	This may make no sense
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:00,160	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Too much people but
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:02,208	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They would offer staff members
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:04,256	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They could bring their pets
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:05,792	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	If they were coming in to work
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:09,376	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Storm and they turned medical records over into a kennel
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:09,888	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:11,680	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	People start to worry about their
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:14,752	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Apparently on that Wednesday one of the larger.

EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:17,568	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Started having seizures from the Heat
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:18,336	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:19,360	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Some of the staff
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:20,640	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Chose to have
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:22,176	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Doctors euthanized
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:26,272	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And then just
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:27,808	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Try to imagine if you can
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:29,856	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Looters are running free
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:37,536	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Hot people are dying your hair gunshots in the neighborhood you're afraid
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:41,632	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I don't know if there's real violence breaking out in
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:43,168	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	City
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:48,032	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Stop floating in the water there how many rescue resources are going to come tonight time
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:51,616	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And your colleague walks up to you and says
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:52,640	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Do you know
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:55,200	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	For euthanizing
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:56,992	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Pets to put them out of their misery
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:00,064	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	What about the suffering patient
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:02,624	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Shouldn't we put some of them
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:04,416	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Out of their misery
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:11,072	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And I interviewed all these people and trying to figure out like where did this idea
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:13,376	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Come from and tracing it back and there were all these
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:15,936	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Little informal conversations
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:18,752	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:22,336	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	This starts just going around the hospital
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:24,128	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The sort of idea
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:27,200	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Of putting patients out of their misery
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:28,480	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I don't know who told me that
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:30,528	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	But that's what I heard
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:32,832	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And you know in those
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:34,368	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Circumstances
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:34,880	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	What are you doing
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:38,720	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	If you're at War and you have someone
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:40,256	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It's not going to be picked
EDL	00:26:42,304	00:26:43,072	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Safety
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:44,352	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Live leading the deaf
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:46,656	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	What are you doing
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:58,176	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Cherry says that as this idea spread around the hospital
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:26:59,456	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	People fell into different camps
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:01,760	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Some people thought this was
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:03,296	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The most Humane thing they
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:03,808	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Do
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:06,112	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It would be criminal to let people
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:06,624	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Will suffer more
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:08,672	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Other people when they heard about it
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:09,952	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	We're outraged
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:14,048	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	For example dr. Bryant King who's colleague doctor
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:14,560	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Fournier
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:16,352	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	She walks up to him and
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:17,632	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Says there's this
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:24,032	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Discussion going on and you know what do you think and he says
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:24,544	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Idea
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:25,824	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	This is Doc

EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:51,680	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Say they saw this as well
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:54,496	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	He said he saw one of the doctors we talked about earlier

EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:06,272	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	While holding a handful of syringe
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:10,624	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Anna standing over there with handful of syringes talking to a patient
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:11,392	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:12,416	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Herbivores
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:14,208	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	That I heard her say were

EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:25,984	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Nobody nobody walks around with a handful of syringes and goes and gets the same thing these patient that this is not how we do it
EDL	00:28:26,496	00:28:32,896	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Jump forward 4 be after this whole ordeal was over and the rescue teams in the
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:34,176	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Mortuary teams arrived
EDL	00:28:34,176	00:28:35,968	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Many bodies were found in this house
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:36,480	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Hospital
EDL	00:28:37,248	00:28:39,296	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	About 45 bodies found
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:41,600	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And so there was an investigation launched
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:43,392	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They found these bodies
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:45,440	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They tested these bodies for drugs
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:50,560	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And what they found was that nearly two dozen patients had received
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:53,888	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Either morphine or versed
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:54,912	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	A powerful sedative
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:57,216	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Or combination of the two
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:29:01,568	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	In a very short time. On that Thursday September 1st 2005
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:04,128	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It was
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:05,408	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I think 21 in the end
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:06,944	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	But
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:07,968	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It's complicated
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:08,736	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	In medicine
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:10,784	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	What is Comfort Inn what is murder
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:13,088	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Depends to a large degree
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:14,624	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	On the intentions of the doctor
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:18,976	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It's called the principle of the double effect is sometimes credited to St Thomas

EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:20,256	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:22,304	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It's this idea that
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:23,328	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	An act
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:26,400	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It's that that can cause harm but if your intention is to do good
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:28,192	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Ethical

EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:16,064	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	We mentioned him earlier when we were talking about the other generators
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:18,112	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	He's a doctor who do you love
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:18,624	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	End-of-life
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:20,160	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	He was very open with her
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:21,184	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	About the decision
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:24,256	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	He had gone upstairs visited mrs. progess
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:25,024	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Canterbury
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:25,536	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	2
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:29,632	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	See how she was doing and he was just thinking to himself
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:33,728	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	She's so so sick she's got Advanced cancer
EDL	00:30:34,240	00:30:38,080	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I can't imagine she would have more than maybe a week to live at the best
EDL	00:30:38,080	00:30:39,104	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Circumstances
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:43,456	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	She is weighted down with fluid which can happen for the end of life
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:44,736	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So she weighs a lot
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:47,040	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	She's on the 8th floor
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:47,552	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So we'd have to
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:52,672	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Carry her downstairs and plus there's four nurses up here taking care of her
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:57,280	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Could we use them somewhere else so he literally turned to one of the nurses and said
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:30:59,328	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Can you give her enough morphine till she goes
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:03,936	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And that nurse charting
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:05,728	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Huge
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:06,752	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Increasing
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:07,520	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Morphine
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:08,544	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	For her and she died
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:10,592	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:11,360	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	That was
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:16,736	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Thought so he made this decision until this day or at least the last time we spoke he felt he did the right thing
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:21,344	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	He said to me he thought it was desperate he saw only two choices Quicken their deaths
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:22,368	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Or abandon them
EDL	00:31:22,880	00:31:25,952	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I mean if that was the real situation there's some at the sea
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:28,512	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	This would say either of those choices would be
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:30,560	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	No not justified but excusable
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:32,608	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	But one of the arguments you could make
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:34,656	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Is that when you give up on one person
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:35,424	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Then becomes
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:37,472	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	A little bit easier to give up on the next
EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:38,752	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And then the next
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:40,544	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	First and then suddenly you're on the slippery slope
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:42,848	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Ensure he did tell us about this one
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:44,640	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	His case was very haunting
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:47,456	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Emmett Everett 61 year old
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:48,480	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Doting grandfather
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:50,272	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Very very heavy
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:53,856	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	He weighed 380 lb and he was up on the 7th floor of the hospital
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:55,648	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	He was conscious alert
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:57,184	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Set himself breakfast
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:31:59,232	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Baptist nurses are we ready to rock and roll
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:01,536	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	He said to one nurse
EDL	00:32:01,536	00:32:02,816	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Poop never forgot it
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:07,168	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Cindy don't let them leave me behind don't let them leave me behind
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:09,728	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	He had had a spinal cord
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:10,752	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Stroke he couldn't walk
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:14,848	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	He was on the 7th floor of the hospital with no working elevators
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:18,432	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And the staff told me they couldn't imagine how they would
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:19,712	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	To carry him down
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:20,480	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Those flights
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:23,552	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Upstairs let alone with a helicopter take a man of his size
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:29,184	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And he was one of the patients who was found with this drug combination in his body
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:30,208	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	David Bowie died
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:31,488	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	He.
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:32,768	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Found his body was found
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:37,120	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And by the way the other tragedy was just as those injections took
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:39,168	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The place was when the helicopter
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:40,192	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Finally we're folks
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:40,704	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Gaston the song
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:50,944	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Did a judge or jury find anyone guilty of manslaughter or murder or
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:51,712	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Second degree murder
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:52,992	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	No nobody
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:59,904	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And again just to remind you how quickly
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:02,720	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	A hospital can go from a normal American
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:05,024	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Well-regarded functioning Hospital
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:06,816	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	To a place where this was even
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:07,840	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Considered
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:08,608	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Cast
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:09,632	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Was so short
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:13,216	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Monday morning the storm hits Tuesday Morning the water rises
EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:15,520	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Early Wednesday morning all power goes out
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:16,800	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And this is Thursday
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:20,128	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Kind of chilling to think
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:40,096	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	God of all of that begin with a triage decision about which patients
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:40,864	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Should go first
EDL	00:33:42,144	00:33:43,680	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I'm trying to put myself in the position of the
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:45,472	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	People at that hospital
EDL	00:33:45,472	00:33:46,496	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I'm thinking to myself
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:49,056	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	How do you guys have like a checklist
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:53,664	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Make a checklist on a wall that says here's how you do this so that I can just check the boxes
EDL	00:33:54,176	00:33:57,760	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I wouldn't be able to take my way through that so that's where I go next
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:33:58,784	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I wonder
EDL	00:33:58,784	00:34:03,648	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Wasn't this story you've just told us bleeds us anywhere the first place it would lead me
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:04,416	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Would be to ask
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:06,720	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Is there a system that people could set up
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:12,352	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	People are reasonable and who have the expectation of something like this is going to happen again
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:13,632	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Somehow somewhere
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:15,424	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Maybe in my town my hospital my
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:17,472	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So what could we do
EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:19,264	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	To make this now
EDL	00:34:20,544	00:34:26,688	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Well it's interesting you ask because of course after Katrina there have been efforts since then to come up with a protocol
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:31,296	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Going to share the experience and Katrina was basically a wake-up call for
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:32,320	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Doctors in
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:33,088	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Hospitals
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:34,368	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	State governments to think about
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:38,208	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Triage like how should we ration medical resource
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:40,768	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Something bad happens again
EDL	00:34:41,536	00:34:43,328	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Which patients we prioritize
EDL	00:34:43,328	00:34:45,376	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	First which patients don't we prioritize
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:46,144	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	How do we do this
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:46,656	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:50,496	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	One of the interesting things was that the state of Maryland decided
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:55,616	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	We're going to throw this open to our population and have what they called deliberative democracy
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:59,200	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So pull people together in a room from all walks of life
EDL	00:34:59,200	00:35:00,992	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And have them grapple with
EDL	00:35:01,760	00:35:02,528	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And
EDL	00:35:02,528	00:35:05,600	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I was there oh you went to the very first one
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:08,160	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Did I mention like a town hall meeting was it like that
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:09,184	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Or no
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:16,096	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Yeah, just imagine the church basement
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:22,496	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Intercity Baltimore or a conference room in Bobby Howard County
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:23,264	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Saturday
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:26,592	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	What we think is a really really important conversation
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:28,384	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Refreshments
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:29,920	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	At about 12:15
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:32,480	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Will take a break for you all to get lunch bring it back to you
EDL	00:35:32,480	00:35:38,880	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	People have been recruited to be a part of this and when I say people it's just regular folks
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:45,280	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So that researchers let's call them that they get people together and
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:46,304	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Good morning
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:53,984	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Set the sort of scenario is laid out
EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:56,544	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Skin and we're going to be talking about today is
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:59,360	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	How we make decisions about
EDL	00:35:59,360	00:36:01,152	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Who gets life-saving resource
EDL	00:36:01,920	00:36:06,016	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	In a situation when you literally cannot take care of everyone
EDL	00:36:06,784	00:36:13,184	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Today the scenario will talk about is pandemic influenza tell people okay imagine a flu is sweeping
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:14,464	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	In the country
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:16,000	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Millions of people are sick
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:20,096	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Coughing some are dying the only way the folks are going to get better they say
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:24,192	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Is it they have a ventilator to help them breathe but the problem is
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:28,288	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	There just aren't enough.
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:34,688	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	This is a terrible situation were talking about so here you have too many patients too few resources
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:35,456	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	How do we choose
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:37,504	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Who gets those ventilators
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:39,552	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Might be the right
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:44,160	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The researchers then essentially layout three different kinds of options
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:45,440	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Number one
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:52,352	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Try to save the most lives or years of Life by picking people the best chance of surviving the pandemic
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:54,400	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And later see young people or healthier people
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:58,240	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Number to bacon people who will be the most helpful during the pandemic
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:37:01,056	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So First Responders Health Care Providers vaccine work
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:06,176	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Four number three
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:08,992	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Something like first-come first-serve or a lottery
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:13,600	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	See people that make sense
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:14,624	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Okay
EDL	00:37:15,136	00:37:18,208	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And then they say we're here to answer your questions Talk Amongst yourself
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:22,816	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	You know
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:35,872	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Where it was or what
EDL	00:37:35,872	00:37:40,992	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	What my immediate reaction to the lottery was
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:42,016	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It's a leveler
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:48,416	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It's all the same I think it is typically least responsible way to go
EDL	00:37:48,416	00:37:54,816	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Ultimately it's fair if somebody's going to live but the very sick is that should that go into the decision
EDL	00:37:54,816	00:38:01,216	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	If we set of guidelines then yes if every kind of doctor you know what I mean going to be essential
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:07,616	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Now the good news is a ventilator and a four-year-old wouldn't I just think that would be this.
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:10,432	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	People are willing to engage in this question
EDL	00:38:10,432	00:38:16,832	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And this was right at the time you guys remember all the Death panel discussion
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:21,952	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Sarah Palin
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:27,840	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	In black and white started at that time
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:29,888	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And the word emphasize
EDL	00:38:29,888	00:38:36,288	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	But as you can also hear
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:42,688	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	You get it first because you'd and I got there half a second and I are there wasn't a lot
EDL	00:38:42,688	00:38:43,456	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Lot of agreement
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:49,856	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I respect your opinion but I'm just dealing with
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:54,208	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I suppose there's no room for emotion
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:39:00,352	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Dubai person-to-person is exception to the rule that's emotion coffee
EDL	00:39:00,864	00:39:04,960	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Anything that's going on and that's why we have those setup
EDL	00:39:06,752	00:39:07,520	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It's one of the
EDL	00:39:07,520	00:39:11,104	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The big findings was that there are certain ways in which we will not make these
EDL	00:39:11,616	00:39:16,224	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	There were things that the researchers wanted to be off the table like not even
EDL	00:39:16,224	00:39:17,248	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Come into the
EDL	00:39:17,248	00:39:18,016	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Discussion
EDL	00:39:18,016	00:39:24,416	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	We're not going to make decisions based on gender race socioeconomic status like people's jobs and ink
EDL	00:39:24,416	00:39:26,720	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Comes and citizenship status
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:32,864	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	You know whether they had a criminal history or were they upstanding members of society
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:33,888	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Just want to say upfront that's not
EDL	00:39:34,400	00:39:35,424	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	That's not up for grabs
EDL	00:39:35,424	00:39:37,728	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	But those things kept popping up
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:44,128	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	You wouldn't have it like a young pastor and you might have a reprehensible
EDL	00:39:44,128	00:39:47,456	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Alcoholic criminal type person
EDL	00:39:47,456	00:39:51,296	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And he might have more years to live
EDL	00:39:51,296	00:39:55,392	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Pastor are going to be more beneficial
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:40:01,536	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Societies in the ears of a criminal reprehensible alcoholic
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:03,328	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Well you are
EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:09,728	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Australian territories
EDL	00:40:09,728	00:40:10,496	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	That is it
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:16,640	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Dad is a personalized there were people who thought that undocumented immigrants shouldn't get ventilators
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:23,552	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Alcoholic smokers the world will be a better place
EDL	00:40:23,552	00:40:26,624	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Do you deserve to survive
EDL	00:40:26,624	00:40:29,440	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Can I say to you but should I try and save you
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:32,000	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	What's interesting is that
EDL	00:40:32,512	00:40:37,632	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	People really comfortable making utilitarian choices like saying yeah that person should get the ventilator because
EDL	00:40:38,144	00:40:39,936	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They're going to benefit the greater good in some way
EDL	00:40:40,704	00:40:46,848	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	But if that ever got formulated in a slightly different way which is to say that person should get the ventilator because they deserve
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:50,944	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Bit more than another their life has more value
EDL	00:40:50,944	00:40:51,968	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Another person
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:52,992	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Well then people like
EDL	00:40:52,992	00:40:53,504	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	We're not cool
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:58,624	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And yet you would hear people say it that way again and again and then immediately be repulsed
EDL	00:40:58,624	00:41:00,160	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	When they heard someone else
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:00,672	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Say that way
EDL	00:41:02,208	00:41:07,072	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I don't think you can determine who's done what in their life and how that valuable I might think
EDL	00:41:07,072	00:41:11,168	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	My hairdresser is more important
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:15,776	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	All right I want to look for during my pants at my situation
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:22,176	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And this was particularly acute when participants were asked the second
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:24,992	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Controversial topics really hard question
EDL	00:41:24,992	00:41:28,832	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Would it be acceptable to you do you think it's acceptable to ever
EDL	00:41:28,832	00:41:31,648	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Remove a ventilator from one patient
EDL	00:41:31,648	00:41:33,184	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	To give it to somebody else
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:36,256	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	This one I definitely don't have a clear answer myself
EDL	00:41:36,768	00:41:37,536	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Some people
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:38,304	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Fayetteville
EDL	00:41:38,304	00:41:42,656	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Of course. Doesn't seem like someone is going to make it through the treatments
EDL	00:41:43,168	00:41:44,704	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Then we need to
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:49,056	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Kevin cut their treatment short in Kansai ventilator on a someone else but
EDL	00:41:49,056	00:41:55,455	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	You're going to murder my father they were other people who said no
EDL	00:41:55,455	00:42:00,319	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	You are going to be
EDL	00:42:00,319	00:42:06,463	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I've never going to sign up for that
EDL	00:42:07,743	00:42:08,511	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So
EDL	00:42:08,511	00:42:09,023	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Complicate
EDL	00:42:11,071	00:42:14,655	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Did they come to a conclusion
EDL	00:42:14,655	00:42:15,679	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Hear a conclusion
EDL	00:42:15,679	00:42:16,959	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I listen to this
EDL	00:42:17,727	00:42:19,007	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Here's what I heard I heard
EDL	00:42:19,775	00:42:21,567	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Thoughtful people
EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:23,615	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Struggling with a problem that is so
EDL	00:42:24,127	00:42:25,663	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Hard to struggle with
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:30,271	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	At what the end up doing is going I don't know how I don't want to do this
EDL	00:42:30,271	00:42:33,855	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I pay no attention to your guidelines cuz I can't deal with what I loved about it
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:36,159	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The number one response was
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:37,183	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Try to get out of this
EDL	00:42:37,183	00:42:38,463	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Situation and
EDL	00:42:38,463	00:42:41,023	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Find ways to avoid having to ration
EDL	00:42:41,023	00:42:44,351	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	That's the most important part of this
EDL	00:42:44,863	00:42:46,911	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	What is it the researchers are going to take away from all this
EDL	00:42:47,423	00:42:50,495	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Well a couple of things that they got out of it
EDL	00:42:50,495	00:42:51,519	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Number one
EDL	00:42:51,519	00:42:53,567	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Remember we talked about the different ways of
EDL	00:42:54,079	00:43:00,479	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Deciding that they put out for people to discuss well it turns out they wanted to combine some of those
EDL	00:43:00,479	00:43:03,551	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Different perspectives and they carry a lot of people
EDL	00:43:03,551	00:43:06,367	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Thought sure let's start out utilitarian let's try and
EDL	00:43:06,367	00:43:09,695	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Save the most Lies by picking the people who are most likely to survive
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:11,999	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	If they're likely to survive and they need it
EDL	00:43:11,999	00:43:15,839	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	But chances are they're going to be a lot of people who fit in that category
EDL	00:43:15,839	00:43:22,239	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So if everybody is just about the same as we can't we don't have like great science that allows us to know which patient
EDL	00:43:22,239	00:43:24,287	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It is going to survive and which ones not going to
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:26,335	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The 4th at 2nd tier
EDL	00:43:26,335	00:43:30,431	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Let's do it randomly let's just being really really fair and give everyone an equal chance
EDL	00:43:30,431	00:43:32,479	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So it's like you introduce a little bit of faith.
EDL	00:43:32,479	00:43:32,991	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Keep things on
EDL	00:43:33,503	00:43:37,599	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Exactly and that in the research you said you know what this is a good idea let's see if we could
EDL	00:43:37,599	00:43:39,903	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Maybe put this concept into the protocol
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:45,535	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Am I right in thinking that these guidelines whatever they end up being are designed to avoid that sort of like
EDL	00:43:46,047	00:43:47,071	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Sorting based on
EDL	00:43:47,071	00:43:48,351	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Who deserves a new does
EDL	00:43:48,863	00:43:50,143	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Yeah I mean
EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:51,423	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	There's some fairness
EDL	00:43:51,423	00:43:52,447	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And having
EDL	00:43:52,447	00:43:53,215	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Guidelines
EDL	00:43:53,215	00:43:56,799	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Especially guidelines that were developed with the input of lots of people
EDL	00:43:57,311	00:43:58,847	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So even if
EDL	00:43:58,847	00:43:59,615	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	We don't like
EDL	00:44:00,127	00:44:00,639	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The choices
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:02,431	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	That are made and we
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:05,247	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Don't end up getting the ventilator where our loved one doesn't
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:10,367	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Overall if you know that there's a protocol out there and this is the rule
EDL	00:44:10,367	00:44:12,159	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Here's why we had to adopt this rule
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:14,975	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It's being applied to everybody and you're not
EDL	00:44:14,975	00:44:16,767	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Canby advantage or disadvantage
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:19,071	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Over money or over of these
EDL	00:44:19,583	00:44:20,351	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Other sayings
EDL	00:44:20,863	00:44:22,399	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It sort of helps you accepted
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:25,471	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	My in theory that sounds
EDL	00:44:25,471	00:44:26,239	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Plausible
EDL	00:44:27,007	00:44:28,799	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	But when you put Theory to practice
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:29,823	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	That's what you can do
EDL	00:44:29,823	00:44:30,591	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Right after the break
EDL	00:44:31,359	00:44:32,127	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Things get

EDL	00:45:46,879	00:45:48,671	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I kid you know did something
EDL	00:45:48,671	00:45:50,719	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It just means you lean back and say
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:51,743	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Well
EDL	00:45:53,279	00:45:57,375	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:45:58,143	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Back to you
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:46:04,799	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin
EDL	00:46:05,567	00:46:06,847	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Or maybe the kids in math

EDL	00:46:58,559	00:47:00,351	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Of the issues we've been talking about
EDL	00:47:00,351	00:47:01,887	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And you realize that when you get
EDL	00:47:02,399	00:47:02,911	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Close
EDL	00:47:03,679	00:47:04,959	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Pictures about 2
EDL	00:47:05,727	00:47:06,751	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Sometimes what
EDL	00:47:06,751	00:47:08,543	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	What's a success what's a failure
EDL	00:47:09,055	00:47:09,823	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Hard to measure
EDL	00:47:10,591	00:47:16,991	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Test
EDL	00:47:16,991	00:47:21,087	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I remember being in Haiti after the Haiti earthquake
EDL	00:47:21,599	00:47:27,999	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Back in 2010
EDL	00:47:27,999	00:47:31,839	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I was embedded with a group of us disaster responders
EDL	00:47:31,839	00:47:38,239	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The International Medical and surgical Response Team insert
EDL	00:47:38,239	00:47:40,543	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	10th hospital and AT-AT
EDL	00:47:40,543	00:47:43,871	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Point maybe about a week and a half after the earthquake there were
EDL	00:47:44,383	00:47:46,943	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So so many casualties
EDL	00:47:46,943	00:47:48,735	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Thousand people could be dead
EDL	00:47:48,735	00:47:55,135	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	A patient kind of lined up in a row
EDL	00:47:55,135	00:48:01,535	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Festering wounds open fractures and they didn't have enough resources and they were running out of
EDL	00:48:01,535	00:48:02,815	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Oxygen tanks
EDL	00:48:02,815	00:48:08,191	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And then they were also trying to use these oxygen concentrators with pull oxygen from the environment
EDL	00:48:08,703	00:48:13,055	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	But they rely on Power and they was running out of diesel for the generators
EDL	00:48:13,055	00:48:19,455	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Logistics where the critical level with our diesel Supply and oxygen for the
EDL	00:48:19,455	00:48:25,855	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So I'm freaking today I mean I am freaking pray for us and Logistics today
EDL	00:48:25,855	00:48:30,975	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	This was a hospital that had
EDL	00:48:30,975	00:48:36,607	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Set up to do surgery they needed oxygen they didn't have enough so the question became
EDL	00:48:36,607	00:48:38,655	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Who were they going to give it to and who were they not
EDL	00:48:39,679	00:48:46,079	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	At one point when I see you
EDL	00:48:46,079	00:48:49,407	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	We walked into this tent
EDL	00:48:49,407	00:48:51,199	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And we met this woman
EDL	00:48:51,199	00:48:57,599	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	She had braided hair a white nightgown on and this too
EDL	00:48:57,599	00:49:03,999	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Running into her nose
EDL	00:49:03,999	00:49:10,399	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	How old are you
EDL	00:49:10,399	00:49:16,543	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	What's the same age how are you feeling today
EDL	00:49:23,199	00:49:29,599	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Good of a bad if I say in speaking to her I found out that she was from Port-au-Prince the
EDL	00:49:29,599	00:49:31,647	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And that during the earthquake
EDL	00:49:31,647	00:49:33,183	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Her house had collapsed
EDL	00:49:33,695	00:49:35,743	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Everyone inside it she said
EDL	00:49:36,255	00:49:38,303	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Which is most of her extended family
EDL	00:49:38,303	00:49:39,583	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The guide
EDL	00:49:39,583	00:49:45,983	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Live in yesterday between Ocala
EDL	00:49:45,983	00:49:52,383	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So sorry she told me that amazingly she had survived
EDL	00:49:52,383	00:49:53,663	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Italian-American
EDL	00:49:53,663	00:50:00,063	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	She wasn't at home when the earthquake hit she checked into this Hospital
EDL	00:50:00,063	00:50:03,903	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Very shortly before the earthquake happened because she had had chronic
EDL	00:50:03,903	00:50:05,439	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Lung problems so
EDL	00:50:05,439	00:50:07,231	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	She was there to get treatment
EDL	00:50:07,231	00:50:13,631	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And after the earthquake She was transferred to this American Hospital. How do you feel about the treatment that you got here
EDL	00:50:13,631	00:50:20,031	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Way better than
EDL	00:50:20,031	00:50:26,175	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Anywhere that she's been.
EDL	00:50:32,831	00:50:39,231	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I'm in charge of all the thing that's going on
EDL	00:50:39,231	00:50:45,631	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I'm happy to see a smile on your face
EDL	00:50:45,631	00:50:52,031	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I started to speak with the staff about her even taking care of her
EDL	00:50:52,031	00:50:55,871	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	When I found out that Natalie had just
EDL	00:50:55,871	00:50:58,175	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Who won the hearts of the surgical staff there
EDL	00:50:58,687	00:51:05,087	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	People loved her she was so thankful but she has a chronic illness which is severe heart failure
EDL	00:51:05,087	00:51:09,695	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Hypertension in pregnancy relief
EDL	00:51:12,255	00:51:14,303	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They told me they had plans to
EDL	00:51:14,303	00:51:15,071	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Take her off
EDL	00:51:15,583	00:51:16,351	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Oxygen
EDL	00:51:16,863	00:51:19,423	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They were going to turn down the oxygen slowly
EDL	00:51:19,423	00:51:20,191	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	To try to make it
EDL	00:51:20,191	00:51:21,215	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	More comfortable
EDL	00:51:21,215	00:51:22,495	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And then they were going to send her off
EDL	00:51:23,519	00:51:27,615	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Patient facility that didn't have oxygen but where she would
EDL	00:51:27,615	00:51:28,895	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Presumably die
EDL	00:51:28,895	00:51:29,663	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And
EDL	00:51:29,663	00:51:32,223	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	If your thinking in terms of cold hard
EDL	00:51:32,223	00:51:33,503	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Triage Theory
EDL	00:51:33,503	00:51:39,647	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	You know this makes sense because they were trying to save oxygen she has a chronic problem that probably won't get better so that's
EDL	00:51:40,159	00:51:40,927	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The theory of it
EDL	00:51:41,439	00:51:42,975	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	But the practice of it
EDL	00:51:42,975	00:51:44,255	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Was quite different
EDL	00:51:44,255	00:51:48,095	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	She absolutely no idea that they were about to do this
EDL	00:51:48,095	00:51:49,119	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	She
EDL	00:51:49,119	00:51:55,519	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Had all this hope for her funeral
EDL	00:51:55,519	00:52:01,919	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Have an opportunity to earn a living
EDL	00:52:01,919	00:52:08,319	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Once you do the hospital is there any way possible that the people would give her like somewhere to stay.
EDL	00:52:08,319	00:52:14,719	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I mean I'm a journalist and I don't know the answer to that but
EDL	00:52:14,719	00:52:21,119	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I don't know what to say it's such a hard situation right now and I remember the nurse who was
EDL	00:52:21,119	00:52:22,143	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Doing the triage
EDL	00:52:22,143	00:52:23,167	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Should made that
EDL	00:52:23,167	00:52:29,567	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Decision to cut off her oxygen on the team
EDL	00:52:29,567	00:52:31,359	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I've never met her
EDL	00:52:31,359	00:52:32,639	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I never met the patient
EDL	00:52:34,175	00:52:38,271	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	But that's the role that a net we're running out of oxygen
EDL	00:52:38,271	00:52:44,415	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The country itself doesn't have oxygen so I have to make the decision no she can't have KNOX
EDL	00:52:45,695	00:52:47,743	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I have to look at the greater
EDL	00:52:47,743	00:52:49,535	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Good that we can provide
EDL	00:52:50,047	00:52:51,839	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	With the limited resources we have
EDL	00:52:53,631	00:52:54,911	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And so
EDL	00:52:55,935	00:52:59,519	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Then I followed that woman
EDL	00:53:00,031	00:53:01,055	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I wanted to see
EDL	00:53:01,567	00:53:07,967	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Just on a human level as well as on the abstract level
EDL	00:53:07,967	00:53:14,367	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The Transporters came a few hours later
EDL	00:53:14,367	00:53:15,135	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	That service
EDL	00:53:15,135	00:53:21,535	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Amazing and they came to pick her up
EDL	00:53:21,535	00:53:22,815	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	She was on oxygen
EDL	00:53:22,815	00:53:23,583	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Okay we're going to
EDL	00:53:23,583	00:53:25,631	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Are there portable oxygen tanks
EDL	00:53:26,143	00:53:31,263	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And the representative from the hospital said oh no
EDL	00:53:32,287	00:53:38,687	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	She doesn't get oxygen so they yanked the oxygen
EDL	00:53:38,687	00:53:43,295	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Toronto structure
EDL	00:53:43,295	00:53:46,111	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Lifted her up
EDL	00:53:46,111	00:53:52,511	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Stuck on the back of this Humvee ambulance
EDL	00:53:52,511	00:53:56,863	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Cargo Humvee
EDL	00:53:56,863	00:54:03,007	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I rode with her
EDL	00:54:04,799	00:54:06,335	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	She started getting short of breath
EDL	00:54:12,991	00:54:19,391	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	American oxygen
EDL	00:54:19,391	00:54:25,791	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Put his asthma inhaler in her mouth and she kept hitting it over and over again she thought it was oxygen
EDL	00:54:25,791	00:54:27,583	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Twitterrific
EDL	00:54:27,583	00:54:29,375	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	To watch her start to suffer
EDL	00:54:29,887	00:54:30,911	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I felt complicit
EDL	00:54:31,679	00:54:35,007	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I was doing a story and I knew very well
EDL	00:54:35,775	00:54:36,287	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	That
EDL	00:54:36,799	00:54:38,591	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	They had chosen for her to
EDL	00:54:39,615	00:54:41,151	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	To die and
EDL	00:54:41,663	00:54:43,711	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Just watching didn't feel
EDL	00:54:44,223	00:54:45,503	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It didn't feel right
EDL	00:54:47,039	00:54:53,439	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And so sorry
EDL	00:54:53,439	00:54:59,583	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Stopped at this hospital and I nodded over toward her and some of the medical staff when
EDL	00:54:59,583	00:55:05,983	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	To look at her
EDL	00:55:05,983	00:55:12,383	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	She was really struggling to breathe but then
EDL	00:55:12,383	00:55:15,199	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I saw one of my medical school professors
EDL	00:55:15,199	00:55:17,247	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Emergency doctor in
EDL	00:55:17,247	00:55:20,575	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I told him about her
EDL	00:55:25,439	00:55:27,743	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Cooking Mama
EDL	00:55:31,071	00:55:31,583	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And
EDL	00:55:33,119	00:55:39,519	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Supervise
EDL	00:55:39,519	00:55:45,919	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Tricks to get fluid off of lung and he found one
EDL	00:55:45,919	00:55:52,319	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Think of oxygen that had a teeny bit life in it
EDL	00:55:52,319	00:55:58,463	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Okay
EDL	00:56:04,351	00:56:10,495	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	He was able to extend her life
EDL	00:56:21,759	00:56:23,807	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Ultimately I actually
EDL	00:56:24,575	00:56:27,903	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Felt responsibility for her that outlasted
EDL	00:56:27,903	00:56:32,255	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	The story that I did and so after that came out I
EDL	00:56:32,767	00:56:34,815	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I did attempt to help her
EDL	00:56:35,583	00:56:36,607	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Really yeah
EDL	00:56:37,631	00:56:38,143	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Well
EDL	00:56:38,655	00:56:40,447	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I found a
EDL	00:56:40,447	00:56:46,847	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Charitable group that was willing to bring her to the US under a certain type of Visa program that allowed for
EDL	00:56:46,847	00:56:47,615	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Humanitarian
EDL	00:56:48,383	00:56:50,175	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I'd like a Medical Treatments
EDL	00:56:50,175	00:56:51,199	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And
EDL	00:56:51,199	00:56:55,295	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	That the cardiologist who had examined her and Haiti had thought she had a
EDL	00:56:55,807	00:56:56,831	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Rheumatic heart
EDL	00:56:56,831	00:57:00,159	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Disease that was causing her lung problems and that it could be
EDL	00:57:00,159	00:57:02,463	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Surgically corrected but when she came to the US
EDL	00:57:02,975	00:57:03,743	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	In fact
EDL	00:57:03,743	00:57:06,303	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It was found that she had much more serious
EDL	00:57:07,071	00:57:10,399	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Condition and she really needed a transplant and she
EDL	00:57:10,911	00:57:11,679	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Didn't
EDL	00:57:11,679	00:57:12,191	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Didn't make it
EDL	00:57:16,031	00:57:17,311	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Does this make you
EDL	00:57:17,823	00:57:18,335	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Wonder
EDL	00:57:19,103	00:57:20,127	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	So you've got a rule
EDL	00:57:21,407	00:57:23,967	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And maybe in some Broadway it's helping but
EDL	00:57:24,479	00:57:24,991	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	In that
EDL	00:57:25,503	00:57:26,783	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Vehicle looking at
EDL	00:57:26,783	00:57:27,551	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	This woman
EDL	00:57:28,063	00:57:29,087	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	You wanted to
EDL	00:57:29,087	00:57:29,855	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Break the rules

EDL	00:57:31,903	00:57:33,695	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Moral and decent reason
EDL	00:57:35,231	00:57:37,535	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	In these extreme circumstance
EDL	00:57:37,535	00:57:38,815	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	This is where life and death
EDL	00:57:39,583	00:57:40,351	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Wrestling
EDL	00:57:40,351	00:57:40,863	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Each other
EDL	00:57:42,911	00:57:43,423	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Can you make
EDL	00:57:43,935	00:57:44,447	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Rules
EDL	00:57:44,959	00:57:46,495	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I mean I am because
EDL	00:57:46,495	00:57:49,311	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It's like you can't fall if you offer taking her off yet
EDL	00:57:49,311	00:57:52,127	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And you can't fault you for trying to get her on the ox
EDL	00:57:53,663	00:57:55,711	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	What's the conclusion to draw
EDL	00:57:55,711	00:57:59,039	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Well let's not give up you know the conclusion is let's not give up
EDL	00:57:59,551	00:58:04,415	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Like it turns out there was there were options for this woman it turns out that somebody
EDL	00:58:04,415	00:58:06,975	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Was able to extend her life now you could
EDL	00:58:06,975	00:58:12,607	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Very well argue that she should have died in that moment because look at all the resources that were spent
EDL	00:58:12,607	00:58:17,983	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	But I just feel like like there was some value in her existence there was so much value
EDL	00:58:17,983	00:58:24,383	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	She came to the US and my God she took up a collection for all the patients back in the Haitian.
EDL	00:58:24,383	00:58:25,663	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Hospital who she was friends with
EDL	00:58:25,663	00:58:27,711	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	She contributed till the day she died
EDL	00:58:28,223	00:58:34,623	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	She changed my life too so I don't know how to do the math on this one you know the problem
EDL	00:58:34,623	00:58:41,023	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Guidelines require like a lack of compassion the cold hard rigidness of it and
EDL	00:58:41,023	00:58:42,559	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Everything your tiny butt has to do with compassion
EDL	00:58:43,071	00:58:45,119	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	This is Simon Adler by the way our producer
EDL	00:58:45,119	00:58:48,959	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And how do you make compassion work on that large of a scale
EDL	00:58:50,239	00:58:55,103	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Without caring about people and then you care about some people more than other people in the night
EDL	00:58:55,103	00:58:58,943	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Check now or never hurting people so very good point
EDL	00:58:58,943	00:59:02,015	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	If you don't systematized it you you risk
EDL	00:59:03,039	00:59:06,879	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Choosing people based on factors that are really not fair
EDL	00:59:07,391	00:59:10,207	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Spider-Man does Wonder like what if Natalie weren't such a nice person
EDL	00:59:11,231	00:59:11,743	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Wood
EDL	00:59:12,255	00:59:14,303	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Her without a change things
EDL	00:59:14,303	00:59:20,703	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Well you know if Natalie was a mean person that I don't think I would have felt any better watching her suffer its
EDL	00:59:20,703	00:59:22,751	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It's just about the person in front of you
EDL	00:59:22,751	00:59:29,151	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	And I think that the more unbearable it is so the more you have to look someone in the eyes the more
EDL	00:59:29,151	00:59:29,919	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	It makes us
EDL	00:59:29,919	00:59:34,783	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Try to figure out creative ways to avoid doing it
EDL	00:59:34,783	00:59:40,671	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	You you somehow refusing to acknowledge the subject when it really really gets tough
EDL	00:59:42,719	00:59:43,487	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Avoid that
EDL	00:59:43,999	00:59:50,399	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Over and over again let's not facing the real problem which is that it's a problem to have to ration
EDL	00:59:50,399	00:59:56,543	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	We're not going to figure out the best way to ration because there is no one best way because everyone in society will have a different view on that
EDL	00:59:56,543	01:00:01,919	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	I think that's in some way unimpeachable I think you're absolutely right we should always strive to not have to make the
EDL	01:00:01,919	01:00:03,967	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	We do have to make the choice
EDL	01:00:04,479	01:00:05,503	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	How do we do it
EDL	01:00:06,015	01:00:08,063	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Well that's a very tough question
EDL	01:00:09,087	01:00:12,415	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Let me tell you that I think what you hit upon here
EDL	01:00:12,415	01:00:13,951	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Is an impossible
EDL	01:00:14,719	01:00:15,487	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Piece of human piss

EDL	01:00:19,839	01:00:20,863	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Is a NeNe
EDL	01:00:20,863	01:00:21,887	| radiolab_podcast16playinggod |	Human act which
