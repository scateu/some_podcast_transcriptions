EDL	00:00:06,656	00:00:10,240	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Listening to Radiolab
EDL	00:00:11,008	00:00:12,288	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Radiolab
EDL	00:00:12,800	00:00:17,152	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	From WNYC
EDL	00:00:17,920	00:00:19,456	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	And NPR
EDL	00:00:20,736	00:00:25,600	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Hey I'm Jared I'm running Robert Radiolab the podcast
EDL	00:00:25,600	00:00:28,672	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Actually brought a list okay let what it was 22
EDL	00:00:28,672	00:00:29,952	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Share with me your list
EDL	00:00:31,232	00:00:32,768	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	This is Andrew Moran
EDL	00:00:33,280	00:00:35,584	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	He's a writer and editor at the New Yorker magazine
EDL	00:00:36,096	00:00:38,912	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	I might have gotten lost to occasionally pops on do I show
EDL	00:00:38,912	00:00:40,448	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Maybe you were mugged
EDL	00:00:40,448	00:00:41,984	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Here it is
EDL	00:00:42,496	00:00:46,336	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	And he recently got obsessed with a the list of measure
EDL	00:00:46,848	00:00:48,128	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Base units are called
EDL	00:00:48,128	00:00:49,152	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Ver SI basic
EDL	00:00:50,176	00:00:51,968	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	System international
EDL	00:00:52,992	00:00:55,296	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Who did this way you ever wondered
EDL	00:00:55,808	00:00:57,600	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	How long an inch
EDL	00:00:58,368	00:00:59,136	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	I'm exactly
EDL	00:01:00,672	00:01:04,256	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	I know I took a ruler but how do you know that your ruler in my ruler do I have the
EDL	00:01:04,256	00:01:05,024	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	The same amount of each
EDL	00:01:05,536	00:01:08,864	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	He's worried that someone in China that their inches are inches your engine is
EDL	00:01:10,656	00:01:12,960	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	I haven't really thought about it but I'm just a
EDL	00:01:12,960	00:01:14,240	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Assume that there's like a master
EDL	00:01:14,240	00:01:16,032	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Strange somewhere
EDL	00:01:16,032	00:01:18,592	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	How do I say in French
EDL	00:01:18,592	00:01:22,688	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	That is what was on this listing and you was looking at its a list of standard measures
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:26,528	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	For everything we have around how big something is
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:28,320	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Bar something in hot something
EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:29,088	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	It's all in the
EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:29,856	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Okay
EDL	00:01:29,856	00:01:31,904	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	So when you go down the list of the
EDL	00:01:32,672	00:01:34,976	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Sistema Internacional do you need
EDL	00:01:34,976	00:01:36,768	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Here's what you got a meter
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:39,072	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	A meter is
EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:44,448	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	A fraction of a second of the distance traveled by light in a vacuum okay
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:45,216	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Is
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:51,616	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	How much radiation corresponds to the transition between two hyperfine levels of the ground
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:58,016	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	State of the cesium 133 atom that's the definition of a second is a particular atom jiggle yeah
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:02:02,368	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	An ampere which measures electric current you know
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:03,136	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Is
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:09,536	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Constant current which has maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length would produce between these conductors
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:13,376	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	The force is equal to 2 x 10 to the negative 7th Newtons per meter of length
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:14,400	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	I have no idea what that
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:20,800	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	See that's the thing if you look at the actual definition
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:22,336	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	There is one
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:23,104	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Standard on the list
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:24,640	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	It is unique
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:26,432	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Fritz simplicity
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:29,504	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	The definition of the standard unit of measurement that is a kilogram
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:32,832	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Is no man no numbers it is a
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:35,136	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Sing
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:37,952	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	A particular thing
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:38,976	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Plum-sized
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:41,536	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Sing
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:44,096	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	It is the only
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:46,656	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	We used to measure things
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:49,216	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Six the last one standing you'll
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:51,776	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Physical standard lab why is it the last
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:53,824	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Hawaii weather is it what wait what
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:56,896	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Let me just take you back to the beginning of the story
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:02,016	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Like I must admit that I I expected this
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:03,296	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Story to be
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:06,624	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	A lot more boring that I found it's like an epic
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:07,392	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Story
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:13,536	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	That is Latif Nasser science historian regular on our show he says if you go all the way back to the very first farmers back in
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:17,632	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	All of the earliest measurements were super intuitive
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:19,680	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	And he says a lot of them came from the body
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:23,264	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	As in that bunny is coming close to the net
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:25,312	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	How close dad two hands
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:28,640	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	But it's not just like hands and feet but it was also
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:35,040	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	So many other kinds of measurements like you would say oh something is as far as you know my voice
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:35,552	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Skin care
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:38,112	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Something is as far as
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:39,392	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	I can see
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:41,440	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Sitting on the top of a camel
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:43,488	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Or something is as far as
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:46,304	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	I can throw a stone
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:51,168	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	That would be like saying okay I'm going to build
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:51,936	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	A
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:53,216	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Farm here
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:53,984	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	And I'm going to do it
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:55,264	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Three throw rocks
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:04:01,664	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Across the way I read about it was like Travelers like if you're a Saharan traveler you know
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:03,456	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Junior you need to know where the next
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:04,480	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Watering Hole is
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:09,088	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Measurement yeah they would say it
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:11,648	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Cinema 3 throw rocks away or it's time for a Rockaway
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:16,256	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	But you know that there might be some built-in uncertainty there because you ask Achilles
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:18,815	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	It could be to throw rocks
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:24,191	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	This way but he asked me it would be like 78 exactly the problem
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:24,703	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	System
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:27,263	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Annie's problems kind of came to a head
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:28,799	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	In the 1700
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:30,847	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	It's the eve of the of the French
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:37,503	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	In a little town called Paris Cosmopolitan place which means that people are coming from different places and they all have their own
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:38,527	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Measure
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:45,439	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Approximately 250,000 different units of measurement and regular you a hundred and fifty thousand
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:51,071	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Commodity has its own measures do you have green wine oil salt hay for wood fabric everything
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:53,631	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Ordinarily
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:54,399	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Confusing
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,447	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Not to mention it's
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:57,727	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Extraordinarily bad for
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:01,567	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	I came to you and I said miss you I have video
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:02,079	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Of cloth
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:03,359	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	You would say
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,151	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	How much luck you got
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:08,223	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Do Urology
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:09,503	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	What's a yard
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:12,319	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Amelia
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:13,087	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Is this March
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:16,415	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Is this
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:22,815	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	And that you can see that it's frustrating it was frustrating and making matters worse 1780s
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,095	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Was a real family
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:25,887	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	So there was a shortage of grain
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:27,679	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	And people were
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:30,495	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Hungry and people were angry
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:32,031	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Which I am going to
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:34,335	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Call audit they were hangry
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:36,383	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	They were hungry were very hangry
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:41,759	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Studebakers at the time they knew that if they raise the price of bread like an angry mob would basically
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:49,183	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	But they also knew that with no absolute standard it was no way to be sure that what you were getting is what you were getting and so
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:50,463	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	What they started doing
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:51,487	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Was he started
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:54,047	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Just lightening their bread loaves by Jess
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:56,607	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	So as the fam and got worse
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:06:00,191	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	People would be waiting in longer and longer lines
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:01,727	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	To pay the same amount of money
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:03,007	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	For smaller and
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:03,775	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Smaller load
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:06,335	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	So they were getting hungrier and hang
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:08,127	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	And so one of the things that
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:11,199	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	People are like crying out for is that they want
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:12,479	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Standardized weights and measures
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:14,271	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	If I go to the bakery
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:16,831	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Can I buy a loaf of bread I want a whole loaf of bread
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:18,111	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Don't short me on
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:19,903	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Serious
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:21,951	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Well you you know what happens now
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:26,047	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	The Bastille
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:26,815	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Stormed in
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:28,863	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	The king is under house arrest in
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:30,143	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Then under the
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:33,983	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Guillotine and as soon as the Revolutionary government
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:35,775	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	All right
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:39,615	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Okay this is one of our first priority is we are going to make a new stand
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:42,175	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	But not based on something arbitrary like
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:43,967	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Kik
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:45,759	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Why don't we
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:47,551	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Drawn some kind of totally
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:50,111	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	The authority of nature
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:52,671	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Of nature
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:07:01,631	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	So long story short they took the circumference of the earth they took a quarter of that circumference divided that by 10 million and they got
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:08,031	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	The meter the mirror they then / 10 cubed it filled the cube with water to the mass of the water into the cylinder
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:10,079	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Metal with that mass and why
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:11,103	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	They created the world
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:12,383	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	First
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:14,175	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	The idea of this
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:17,503	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Was if we make this thing that is so beautiful and perfect
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:19,039	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Everybody can
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:19,807	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	I see it that way
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:22,623	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Then not only will France use it
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:24,671	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	But the whole world will use it
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:28,767	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Then goods and ideas can be exchanged
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:31,071	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Everywhere by all people and it will be
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:41,311	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	They wanted something that would be Eternal and unchanging for everybody
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:42,591	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	For all time
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:46,431	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	So now I guess you want to see it though
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:47,455	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Yeah okay
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:48,735	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Okay so it's in here
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:51,551	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	We ended up visiting the National Institute of
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:53,087	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Standards and Technology
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:58,975	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	This is where we'll be going in but we're going to go in for this guy was our guide
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:02,815	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	They took us three stories down into the Bedrock of the
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:03,583	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	State of Maryland
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:04,863	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Could they want things down here
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,143	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Totally
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:09,215	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Still just gone through one Dumbledore
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:11,263	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Here comes another Dumbledore
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:15,359	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Let me step into the Vault of the room
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:16,895	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Kinnaird was
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,687	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	What we're looking at Fan is
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:25,599	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	A glass jar with a handle on top and then inside that is another glass jar with a lid
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,879	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Little handle on top
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:33,279	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	And inside that is is the thing do you think it's
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:34,047	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Kind of
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:37,119	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Who is this really
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:39,679	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	The shiniest loosens you ever seen
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:42,239	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Very small and it looks very clean
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:49,151	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Hard to tell where the like Russian doll glass jar stop because it's over
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:49,919	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Reflective
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:56,319	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	This might be crazy question but can we hold a kilogram that's a producer the levy
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:09:02,719	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	It feels like we've been talking about it so they are very careful with
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:04,511	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	The real
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:06,815	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	The original of the original of the original
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:08,351	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Original gong
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:09,119	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Caught
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:11,167	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	As they call it leaves in a basement
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:12,959	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	In France you can't get anywhere near.
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:16,799	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Are you cooking I can get all Tom Cruise on that die trying
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,847	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Here's how it works
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:24,479	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	The international prototype is Laguna that's the one used to calibrate 6
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:28,575	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Identical Platinum sellers what they call witnesses for tomorrow
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:34,975	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	In French those Witnesses are then used to calibrate another set of cylinders which are then used to calibrate the u.s. standard Witchwood
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:38,559	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Esau and that one is used to calibrate all kinds of things
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:44,191	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	The weight of your lemons the scale in your bathroom
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:48,799	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Every time somebody loses a pound of that TV show Biggest Loser
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:55,199	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	You can actually Trace that like a bloodline if you will or an unbroken chain
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:55,967	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Back
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:57,759	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	To the international prototype kilogram
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:10:02,367	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Grab to a single object in a basement in France the holy of holies
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:03,391	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	What is the Killer
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:07,231	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	But you're telling me that when something is weighed in the world often it goes
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:08,255	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	All the way back
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:12,863	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	One hunk of metal or something which was why the next part of the story
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:13,631	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Is so
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:15,679	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Disconcerting
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,959	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	What happened in 1989
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:21,823	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Is that according to Andrew the folks who take care of the official kilogram a big k
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:22,847	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	He took it out
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:24,639	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Jars they put it in a steam bath
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:28,223	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Hit it with the steam
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:29,503	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	The prince is everything
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:30,783	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Wait for it to dry
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:32,575	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Then
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:35,135	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	They commenced a ceremonial way
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:39,231	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	How do you weigh the thing that is the standard of weight while you weigh it against the copy
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:40,767	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Like the US copy
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:43,327	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Beef example so they get one of those and they put it on one side
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:46,399	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Okay on the other end
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:51,007	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Vipk the logo on car the one
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:52,543	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Is light
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:58,431	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	What
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:01,759	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	It doesn't how many how many how much
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:02,527	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Lighters invented
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:04,831	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Roughly the
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:06,367	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Mass of a grain of
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:07,647	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Sugar
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:15,071	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	So was that gigantic tits measurable but how do they know that it was light and not the other ones
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:16,351	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Heavy right well they didn't
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:20,703	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	So they used the second sister copy still light and
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:21,983	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	The third sister copies
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,263	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Still late in the fourth
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:29,151	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	5th and second comes the man from Germany from Canada light in comes the man from Spain
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:33,503	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Which led them to the troubling possibility that the international standard for weight
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:36,063	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Was losing weight
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:38,111	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Well we think that we think the big guy
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:40,415	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	As far as how it lost that weight
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:45,279	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Really knowing us one possibilities about cleaned too much and maybe some of it.
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:46,559	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Scraped away although
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:49,631	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	It's disputed whether cleaning it more would make it lose weight or gain weight
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:55,775	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	The other theory is outgassing like maybe a little hydrogen is seeping out of the metal and then there was one thing I read that
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:12:02,687	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Foul Play cannot be ruled out I was thinking maybe
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:07,807	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Malaysian here we got a hunk of metal losing weight and yet because it easily standard it still weighs exactly a killer
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:10,367	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Write up the definition of a kilogram is
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:12,927	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	The mass of the international prototype kilogram
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:16,255	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Whatever happens when you put that thing on the scale that's a kilogram
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:20,863	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	You can't do that and then everything else in the world is wrong
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:24,703	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Doesn't sit right that's like something that like the North Korean government would do
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:27,007	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Just feel like no more cash
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:29,823	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Like that we can't just go around capriciously doing so
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:36,223	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:41,087	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting a show
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:42,623	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	And I request
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:49,023	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:52,351	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	About what we're calling tiny moments of childhood brilliance
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:56,447	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:59,519	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	It just means you lean back and say wow
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:00,799	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	How do they do that
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:06,175	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:08,735	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Or maybe the kid was a piano
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:13,087	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of the musical score
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:17,695	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:20,255	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	We're interested in the
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:21,535	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Specific moments where
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:26,143	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	A kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with the test
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:28,191	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	If you have a story please share it with us
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:30,239	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Go to radiolab.org

EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:52,255	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Rights of the standard of weight is
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:54,303	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	As you're saying losing weight so how do you fix
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:55,327	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Well
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:59,167	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	I'm getting 0 cell phone reception down here it means we're really do
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:01,727	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	When we were down in that underground room in Maryland we met a guy
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:04,287	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Oh there is
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:11,455	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Okay his name is John Pratt I'm the leader of the fundamental electrical measurements group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:12,479	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Analogy
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:15,807	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	John wants us to even more high security doors
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:18,111	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Gloomy walked into this by God
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:20,671	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Amazing Race
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:23,231	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	It's big it is big
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:25,791	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Three stories tall
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:27,839	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Take a silver room
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:31,423	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	It has a silver gray floor at silver shiny wall
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:34,239	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	And your hair is on the Silvery side
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:38,335	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Very much so
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:40,639	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	I don't even know how to do
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:41,663	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	It looks
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:45,503	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Like a wheel turned on its side with the thing itself
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:48,575	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Looks sort of just like a like a massive
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:51,903	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Round metal cauldron more like big metal
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:52,671	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Pot
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:59,071	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	But then there are all these weird little gizmos and part in and all these coiled up wires and just a stunning machine
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:02,143	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	But it's all just for the benefit of the one
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:08,031	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	1 measure 1 kilogram extremely
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:11,103	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Extremely sensitive balance
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:13,919	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	An equal arm balance
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:15,199	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Basically like a seesaw
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:16,479	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Our a teeter totter
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:17,247	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	And
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:21,087	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Usually you would set that up so that you would literally put
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:27,487	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Kid on one side of the teeter-totter kid on the other side of the teeter-totter now you've been in a playground so you know how this goes but what they've done here is
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:29,023	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	One side of the teeter-totter they've.
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:30,559	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	The kilogram like the ground guy
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:31,583	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Number one
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:33,887	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	On the other side
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:35,935	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Gattu will have
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:37,727	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Highly variable magnet
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:43,103	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Now here's the thing the magnet won't be touching that side of the scale it'll be exerting a force
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:44,639	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	An invisible force
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:46,687	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	It'll produce a force
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:47,199	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	And
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:49,247	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	We could use that
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:50,271	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	To hold the balance
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:52,063	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	And of course he takes
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:54,111	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Hold up the balance that of course is to
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:55,391	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Same as the weight
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:57,183	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Cosseting
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:16:01,791	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	And if you can convert that Force into a number that everybody agrees to Wawa
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:07,167	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	You have just redefined the kilogram you have wrenched
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:08,703	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Get from the world of things
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:09,983	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Has become attached
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:12,031	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	The fundamental forces of the universe
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:14,591	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Depth even grasp the gist of it
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:17,919	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	You want to see that happen
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:19,711	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Have a great now I can show you this
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:23,039	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	With our Lego version of the watt balance
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:29,439	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	If I can fire it up Lego Lego one will see that the big one was being tested or something so
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:30,207	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	So they took us
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:31,743	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Over to look at the little one
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:32,511	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Okay so
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:37,631	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	We have hello scale disturb the balance and it's
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:40,191	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	El chikilin around a little hitch free-floating
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:45,311	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Hey so you're now going with your tweezers and your pucking a titty bitty
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:49,663	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	What's this tiny little symbol thing on the Mountain hours going to East
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:50,431	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	To levitate
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:54,271	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Now it seems he promised me Macon Macon
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:58,367	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	You know I'm going to put the Macon
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:16:59,903	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	And
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:05,791	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	When do we see the levitation
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:09,631	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	That was it I didn't I missed it do it again it was floating
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:10,911	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	It is floating
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:13,471	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Sitting on the balance
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:22,431	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	That's a different idea of levitation
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:28,831	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Now the truth is that once I finally figured out what this guy was doing it was actually sort of cool he had taken a little metal way
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:29,855	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Play he put it on one side of the
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:31,391	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	On the other side of the scale
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:33,183	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Empty baguette
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:34,207	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	The thing didn't
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:35,743	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Skip over because the empty
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:38,303	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	I actually had a magnetic force equivalent
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:38,815	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	To the metal
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:39,839	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Holding
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:41,375	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Perfectly still
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:44,447	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Dark Souls II able to do that does that mean that the grand Cay
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:45,471	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Is rain is
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:52,639	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Not yet no because first of all week that you have to get straight with a lot of man MC squared new work back
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:55,711	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Backwards / eaten by Amazon to be filled
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:18:02,111	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Let's go and you're watching your Planck's constant classical Bohr model of atoms and stuff anyway
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:05,183	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	It is actually way more complicated
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:06,207	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	This whole thing that I
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:07,231	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Prank people ever
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:09,279	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Understand but here's where we are at
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:17,471	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	You got all these different teams around the world you got John's team in Maryland with his seesaw you got another lab a couple of them
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:19,519	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Have their seesaws you got a third level
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:25,919	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Literally counting the atoms are all doing experiments comparing numbers trying to get the numbers to agree so that by
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:30,271	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	I would ever rude everybody agreed on exactly what a kilogram is
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:33,855	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Right now they're closed their they're in agreement out to about 6
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:34,623	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Decimal
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:37,951	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Places and that's not good enough they want the numbers to be at the 8
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:38,719	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Decimals
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:39,743	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Play see if they can do that
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:43,839	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	And only then
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:45,631	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Will the grand Cape be no more
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:46,655	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Yeah
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:49,983	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Because instead of defining the kilogram as
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:51,775	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Whatever is equal to the ground k
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:53,567	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Now you have a new death
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:56,639	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	The new definition of the kilogram to kilogram
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:19:03,807	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Is the SI unit of mass its magnitude is set by fixing the numerical value of Planck constant speed equal to exactly
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:06,111	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	6.6 26069
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:09,183	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Do we have X's cuz we haven't all agreed with the final
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:14,047	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Does the missing decimals
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:17,375	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	When is expressed in the unit fractions Joule seconds which is
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:21,215	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	A meter squared kilogram per second
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:25,055	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	That'll be such a simple definition
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:26,335	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	No u
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:31,455	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	What will happen to the Grand Cay when the new definition goes into effect
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:32,735	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	When I saw this is the
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:36,831	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Looks like a tree
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:40,671	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	Is the church where the
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:44,767	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	The ground Kami eventually end up in a in a place like this
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:48,607	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	That's a big deal with so many standard
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:49,887	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	I've gone to die
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:53,215	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	This is the Music These are they mature
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:53,727	| radiolab_podcast14_kg |	In Paris
