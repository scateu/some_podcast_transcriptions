EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:45,472	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Going to church every Sunday and then
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:47,008	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	In 2009
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:48,032	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Agile
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:51,104	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	When Joel was born
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:52,384	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	How old are you
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:02:00,320	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	If I was 25 when Kayla was born and then Isaac was born I would have been like 20
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:01,600	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	7 - 28
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:02,880	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	I was 2800
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:06,720	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Everything was normal sign
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:09,280	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And then just a little before his first birthday
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:12,096	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Amy noticed that his head was a little boy
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:12,608	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Tilted
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:15,936	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Decock to one side
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:17,984	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	A couple days later he starts throwing up
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:20,032	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Can't keep any food down
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:25,408	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And so they do a bunch of tests and the doctor says listen your son has
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:26,688	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Elysian
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:27,200	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	The counselor
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:30,272	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	So they biopsy the tumor and then they come back with
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:33,344	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Snooze that it's something called in a trt
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:37,184	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	It's very very difficult to treat so when you have an atrt
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:38,208	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	You
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:45,376	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Go through all the most intense chemotherapy and all the most intense radiation they throw the kitchen sink at it
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:49,728	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And doing that you have about a 50% chance of surviving for 5 years
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:56,128	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	I double check this and it turns out the odds of survival are even Grimmer it's a 50% chance of snow
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:57,664	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Surviving just two years
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:04,320	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	When you hear this kind of news is there any part of you that's like
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:05,856	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	What are you doing
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:07,392	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Do the treatment I remember
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:13,280	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Before his first surgery asking them a lot about likely have to have chemotherapy and thinking to myself cuz I can't
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:14,560	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	We can't we can't do this
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:16,864	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	This is crazy we can't do this
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:20,192	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Botanas timer on and by the time we actually when I heard about that
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:21,216	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	That tumor
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:27,104	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Then you're just thinking like 50% like that's half like we got a good shot that he gets through this
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:34,528	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	What do you think Isaac he's in the hospital so they're taking care of him
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:38,880	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	This is from a home video of jewels Brothers meeting him in the hospital
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:40,928	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Isaac is two and a half
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:42,464	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Looking kind of scared
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:47,072	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Jaw is a little over a year old he's lying in a small red wagon
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:48,096	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Hooked up to an IV
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:51,680	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Skinny and his head is perfectly round
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:52,192	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Food
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:54,240	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	His food goes to that too
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:55,776	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Yeah
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:04,992	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	So they start going through this treatment starts off with intense radiation and then just you know months of chemotherapy
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:11,136	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	I didn't know what that meant it means that you just hold the baby for 6 7 8 hours a day
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:14,464	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	You just lying in bed with them while they get these infusions
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:18,815	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And so do you like this 8-hour pump and you took it up at night and it would be this
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:21,119	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Like this white milky substance
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:25,471	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	That would provide all of his nutrition because he couldn't swallow very well
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:27,263	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	One day it was Amy chef
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:33,663	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	She was holding Joel is sitting in his room with him ever seen him a song and clapping
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:35,711	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And he was clapping his hands
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:42,111	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And then he was sort of like Babble singing along and so like for me it was just one of those moments that you felt like I'm always
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:42,879	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Remember this
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:46,207	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Like sometimes you just have a moment and you going to remember this the rest of my life
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:48,767	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	A man that made me sad because I thought
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:53,375	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Old like but the reason I think I'll remember this the rest of my life is because he could die
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:59,775	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Until eventually I did just kind of decide like I think I need to be all in like
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:03,871	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	I think I need to love him like mad and I think we need to live our lives like he's going to live
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:06,943	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	That's what they did
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:07,967	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	4 year
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:12,063	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And then in November 2010 just before Joel 2nd birthday
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:14,367	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	The doctors call them in and they say
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:16,927	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	We're really sorry
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:18,207	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Joe has another tumor
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:23,583	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	All these chemicals we've been pumping into him they didn't do anything and so it's time for us to stop
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:27,935	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	He will eventually die we're not sure but we thinking about 4 months
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:34,335	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	But as Shruti Hassan explaining the story
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:35,615	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	That definitely wasn't it
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:39,455	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Cuz there's this one night when situation was
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:40,991	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	You must had his worst
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:46,623	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And something happened to stomach bug you throwing up got dehydrated
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:49,183	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	So Ryan spend the night with him in the hospital
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:51,487	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	I just remember I'm really wanting apple juice
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:55,327	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Cuz I was one of his favorite things at the hospital but then I give it to him anytime
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:06:01,215	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Throw it up again and he's crying and crying and his prize just got more frantic
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:07,615	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	An animal and there's nothing that Ryan can do
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:14,015	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	I just remember like I wanted to hold him and I couldn't put him down because he would get so upset and
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:20,415	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Put him down Joel would start hitting his head against the wall of his crib eventually Ryan himself started
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:26,815	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	You said he was crying too and then in the early hours of the morning he lay down
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:28,095	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And prayed
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:31,167	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And I remember that's when he stopped crying and he fell asleep
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:36,031	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	I was just one of those
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:40,383	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Smooth few moments in life where
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:43,455	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Like it felt like an answer from God
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:45,503	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:48,063	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	It wasn't like I Heard a Voice or saw
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:52,415	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	You know a burning bush or anything like that but it was just it felt so much like
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:53,951	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Mercy
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:58,815	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And Beyond just Shear relief Ryan had this
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:06:59,327	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Other thought
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:00,607	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Franklin
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:01,631	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	A weird thought
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:05,727	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	This whole ordeal reminded him of a video game
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:11,871	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Like you have to get the baby to stop crying so you keep trying things give him choose bounce him talk to him
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:13,407	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	But the weird thing is
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:15,199	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	This awful game
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:19,295	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	None of those things actually work they're all like fake choices
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:20,575	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Brian thought
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:21,855	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	What if
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:23,135	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	I can make a game like this
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:26,975	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Where you the player you don't really have control
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:30,047	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And so he starts to think like
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:31,839	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	I wonder if I could make that
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:37,983	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	I can make that scene we could make the scene of Joel in desperation and then give him an option
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:42,335	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Is that the thing is is there any active saving being a no
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:46,431	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	So he's going to make a video game where everything you do doesn't work baby still cries
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:49,247	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	I think he was just intrigued by that because it seemed
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:50,783	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Bizarre
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:51,295	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Yeah
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:52,319	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	I'll make
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:53,599	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Video game where you
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:55,391	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Can't do anything
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:59,487	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Set prayers
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:04,095	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	High likelihood of being a popular game popularity
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:10,495	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Not essential he wasn't even thinking that cuz he wasn't thinking oh this is a game that I will release it was almost like a thought
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:13,311	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Experiment right in his brain where he's thinking
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:15,871	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	You know usually people come into a game trying to solve it
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:20,991	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And I wonder how if I can make this game where they couldn't they would understand me
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:22,527	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	How I feel right now
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:28,159	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	I want to make a game about that day that Joel is dehydrated in the hospital
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:33,279	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Facebook terrible that's not a game and no I don't want to play that like
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:35,583	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Think of that word game men like
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:38,655	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Something you do in your leisure time
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:41,727	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	You know and so who wants to spend their Leisure Time
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:46,591	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Reliving the worst moment of a man's life so I said do not make that
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:47,359	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	That is horrible
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:51,967	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	He come to the idea so finally Amy said okay I'll give you 3 months
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:58,623	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	So
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:09:02,463	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	A few months later it's the game developers conference in San Francisco
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:05,023	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Alongside Assassin's Creed 3
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:09,631	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Battlefield 4 the new Oculus Rift VR headset
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:12,191	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Hi everybody my name is Ryan
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:12,959	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Bear
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:16,031	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Was Ryan
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:21,407	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	My son Joel had just turned one-year-old the day that we found the monster in his brain
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:23,455	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Ryan is standing in front of
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:25,247	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	A bunch of young Tech dudes
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:26,015	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	You're listening
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:27,807	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Half-heartedly
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:34,207	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Joel is alive and fighting his eighth tumor are doctors fight for him our family fights for him
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:40,607	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And we serve a God that's the god of the living not the dead in the middle of all this pain and suffering and mud in her ass
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:43,679	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	The cancer is right in our family we have a drink of water
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:47,007	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	That's made of hope and love and light and we hope to share it with
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:51,615	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Amy stayed home
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:53,407	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Reading because
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:57,503	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	They were almost out of money and she was worried that Ryan would come home
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:58,271	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Feeling crushed
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:01,087	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	But that's not what happened
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:06,207	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Ryan got back and said it was amazing
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:11,583	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	This person introduced me to that person that person is just in that one there's two or three different people
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:17,983	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Who want to fund my game market for a game like this but different
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:21,055	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	So I want to be clear it
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:24,127	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	The world of these kinds of emotional games it's a small one
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:25,151	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	But
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:29,759	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	There are people there investors in there who are looking for games
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:32,063	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	They're doing something different
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:33,343	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Meaningful in some way
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:36,415	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And so I think a few of them
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:39,487	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Wade through the scene this dehydration scene
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:40,511	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And they thought
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:44,607	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Okay let's let's let's see what a full-fledged version of this will be
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:46,655	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	End
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:48,703	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	We're just
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:54,847	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	It's like a video game generation has grown up right like if you were born in the 80s
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:56,127	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	The seventies
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:11:03,039	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	But you played games for certain reasons when you're a kid and now we're grown up and we're having these different experiences like I'm child going through
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:03,807	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Cancer
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:06,367	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	You know the death of my father or
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,903	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	These things which suddenly you're like
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:10,719	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Why can't I tell the stories with video game
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:16,863	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And what was Amy's reaction when she heard people wanted to fund the game
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:21,983	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Because of your dehydration game that I told you to never make and he realizes like
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:25,311	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	You never played it like you never play this mean
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:26,591	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	So I put on the headphones
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:30,175	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	She finds herself
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:30,687	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Back in the house
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:33,247	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	You don't see Joe
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:37,087	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	You see an empty crib and you can hear him cry
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:38,623	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	You're playing as Ryan
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:43,231	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Move your mouse around the screen
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:43,999	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And options
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:44,767	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Appear
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:48,095	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	You can give him choose you can try to bounce him you can
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:49,631	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Walking to the bathroom
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:52,191	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Look at the window but no matter what
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:52,703	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	You do
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:59,615	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Trying to fix worse and worse hold you please
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:01,151	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Stop
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:04,223	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	After five or six minutes of this
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:06,271	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Brian sits in a chair
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:07,807	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Drops his head into a glass
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:14,207	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And praise still here
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:15,743	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And then
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:19,327	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	The crying stops
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:25,215	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	So I put on the headphones
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:28,031	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And I just lost it and I was just
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:33,407	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Is crying and crying and I knew Joel was okay and he was like right there like Jones right there with us and
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:35,455	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And yet
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:38,783	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Brought me back to that space in a much
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:39,807	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	More
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:42,111	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Real way that I thought that a video game
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:50,047	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Amy didn't need any more convincing she said okay let's do this
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:56,447	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Pull the rest of our savings and make this game
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:13:02,591	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	They named it that Dragon cancer
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:11,807	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	I'm just use the same teas that reply all using their podcast coming up
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:16,671	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Ryan and Amy encounter what might be the world's biggest design problem

EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:48,063	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework were interested in the

EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:34,655	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And the mom and dad have decided to express the experiences there going through interval things a video
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:40,031	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	You're so Amy and Ryan and their 6-person team they begin to build the scenes of the games
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:40,543	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Surreal
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:41,567	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Vignette
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:43,871	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Were you the player
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:47,711	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	You take on different characters and every senior
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:49,759	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Job Your Role basically is to
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:52,319	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Can you take care of baby Joel
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:54,111	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Let's not go back to
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:54,879	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	The peace and two swords
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:56,927	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	The first scene is at the pond
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:58,719	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	You start off as a duck
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:02,047	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	You paddle two words a little boy it's Joel
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:04,095	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Or the origami version of him
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:08,191	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	He doesn't have eyes or mouth but he has a voice
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:10,239	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And that is actually Joel's laugh
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:12,287	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	As you hand them pieces of bread
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:13,823	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	A throws them in Stillwater

EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:48,127	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	There's other vignettes
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:48,895	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Like
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:52,735	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	There's one time in a hospital when to keep juul entertained
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:59,135	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Ryan blew up surgical gloves like balloons it's this for Justine where you see Joel
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:02,975	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Loading into the nighttime sky towards the moon holding on to these
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:05,791	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Surgical balloons
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:10,399	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And then you see these black birds appear from the corner
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:11,679	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Doctor cancer
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:14,751	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And a pop the balloons on my one
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:19,103	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And throughout these scenes
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:24,479	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	You play Minigames you discover rooms listen to voicemails from Annie there's even little levels you can beat
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:28,831	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	But the cancer is always around the edges of this world
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:30,879	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Barney and black
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:31,647	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	I'm Creepin in
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:36,767	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	At one point you'll arrive here
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:43,167	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	The waiting room where doctors tell Amy and Ryan the jewels cancer is terminal as they break the news
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:47,007	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Rain start pouring into the room
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:53,407	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And Ryan slowly starts to slip under the water
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:59,807	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Monday
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:06,207	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	We're very good at 8
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:12,351	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	We're very good at managing cake and masking symptoms at the end
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:24,895	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Just jumping one second we asked Rudy so as Ryan and Amy and the team were crafting these scenes
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:26,175	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	What was happening with Joel
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:28,479	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	She says what happened
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:29,247	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Surprised
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,527	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Thing that happened was
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:33,855	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	That tumor where you know the doctor said listen he's terminal
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:35,391	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Going to be over soon
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:36,159	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	The radio
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:37,695	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And it goes away
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,975	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And then a few months later
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:39,999	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	He gets another tumor
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:41,279	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	The radiator
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:45,375	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	I goes away and then this happens again and again and again
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:46,399	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And so
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:52,543	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	He's two years old he's three years old he's four years old he's doing things that the doctors never thought he would do
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:58,175	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Bucky Turn 2 and 1/2 and said his first word
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:19:00,479	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Num num
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:04,319	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	He starts to swallow again
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:06,623	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Don't shut the food
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:07,391	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Starts
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:13,279	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	When he's three
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:18,655	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	He just became this miracle baby somebody in their church that they had a vision
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:25,055	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Women in the church told her that she had a vision that Joel would do great things
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:31,455	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Another reason they wanted to make this eventual is because they felt as if
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:34,783	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	He has Christians they were living a miracle
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:37,087	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And they wanted to share this with people and show them
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:39,647	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And then
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:43,487	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	A doctor calls a man and he says listen
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:44,767	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Joe has a new tumor
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:47,071	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	The steamer is different
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:51,167	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	It's in a place that we've already radiated explain to us
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:55,775	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	That cannot continue to radiate an area too much what can cause brain death
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:57,567	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And it was right
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:58,591	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	On
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:19:59,871	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	The brainstem
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:02,431	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	The doctors say we're not going to radiator
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,503	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And then what happened
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:07,295	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Is condition
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:09,855	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Like very rapidly deteriorated
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:15,999	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Having more trouble breathing can't swallow again a lot of the things that he was able to do like walk and
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:17,535	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	B stops
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:18,559	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And so
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:25,983	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Bay invite their entire church Community to come to their house in
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:29,823	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Pray we had a prayer night just praying for him to be healed and
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:35,967	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	We just had everyone over and we spent hours just worshiping and praying this video footage of the snow
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:41,855	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	It's in there small living room there's family members friends people from their Church community
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:43,903	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Ryan is holding jaw and they're praying
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:45,695	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	What we have is death here on this Earth
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:47,487	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	That's all we have
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:51,583	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	The only hope we have is your Resurrection.
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:55,423	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Why would hope
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:57,727	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	All I have is my disappointment
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:20:59,519	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	That's what I start with
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:06,175	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	But I have hope that that you can fill my disappointment that you make it right that you redeem it
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:21,024	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Yes
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:31,776	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	What's your strongest memory from
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:36,128	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	I think it's just realizing that he was gone
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:46,112	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	It's that space of being with a bunch of people that
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:49,440	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Desperately want the same thing that you willing are crying out
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:54,816	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	For that Grace in that Mercy to convey the situation
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:22:03,008	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Joel died later that night it was March 3rd
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:09,408	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	13 2014 because we were believing that he would be healed and because we were believing even if he died
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:11,200	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	I maybe should be raised from the dead like
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:17,600	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Which is my cousin weird and I don't get that is weird but because
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:23,232	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	We still believe that he could live I feel like we didn't
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:26,048	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Go through all the processes of getting ready for him
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:28,096	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	To Die the way that maybe you would
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:29,376	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	If you are certain that this
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:33,984	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	So at this point
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:37,824	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Undertale sweetie tells us well they had to finish the game
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:40,128	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Lemonade invested in enormous amount of
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:40,896	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Diamond heart
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:43,712	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Talent in building this game
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:44,736	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	But now
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:46,528	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	The facts of change
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:48,832	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	It started as a game that was supposed to be about
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:49,856	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Experience of
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:52,416	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Fighting cancer but also the experience of
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:54,208	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Try and think of her
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:56,512	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	It can't be that game anymore
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:58,048	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Like what do you do as
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:22:59,328	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Game designers
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:00,096	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Parents
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:03,168	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	How do you finish a game where you don't have many choices
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:04,192	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And you can't win
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:09,312	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	It fits part as we're talking with treated me so visual
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:10,592	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	She just
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:13,920	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Sat down and walked us through as descriptively as she could
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:15,968	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	How Ryan Amy Ryan
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:18,272	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Try to solve this design bra
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:20,320	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	The end of the game
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:24,160	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	North Shore but it was basically going to be a two-part scene
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:26,464	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Where there's the moment of his death
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:28,768	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Yeah and they weren't sure how to
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:29,536	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Do that
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:32,608	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	There's a moment of his death and right after that a moment where he goes
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:36,192	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	I have an essentially there was this little Island
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:36,960	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And so
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:39,264	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Ryan sucks about making
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:41,312	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	The scene of his death
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:42,336	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	It starts off
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:44,128	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Pretty simple
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:45,408	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	In a hospital there's
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:47,968	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Little Jaws sitting on a green chair
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:52,064	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And there's some tubes of this neon fluid feeding into him
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:54,368	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And there's pipes
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:24:00,768	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	All that rise up above him Witcher like pipe organ pipes and there was a little bit game play where you can play the pipe organ anyway
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:01,792	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And then after that
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:02,816	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	He said
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:04,352	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	This isn't this isn't enough
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:05,888	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	This is the scene where
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:08,448	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	My son dies and so it must be
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:09,472	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Just like
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:09,984	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Epic
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:14,336	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And so he creates this almost european-style like oversized
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:18,432	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Cathedral where you know the walls are soaring up in the
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:21,760	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Ceilings are intricate and contain all these different
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:24,064	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Like
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:25,088	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Bod
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:30,208	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	It's almost as if he's coating Joel's body into the architecture so he is
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:35,328	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	You know pieces that look like ribs and there's this part that looks like it's heart I can show you guys this picture is its
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:39,936	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Sound Transit Howard told your laptop to the glass
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:44,800	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	I just quickly want to show you this
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:45,824	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	That's amazing
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:50,176	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Is so
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:50,944	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Pretty
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:52,736	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	I was not prepared for the
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:56,832	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Who TF is very intricate interlacing arches
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:25:00,416	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Light cascading down.
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:02,720	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Catacombs on stained glass
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:06,560	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	He's very ornate ceilings and sweets. The building that
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:13,728	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And it's beautiful and it just gets bigger and bigger and then suddenly feels like you know this is too light and
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:18,848	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	So then the cathedral becomes a place of darkness and all the lights are neon
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:20,128	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Oh so now it's very
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:22,176	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Does trees growing into the
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:23,712	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Cathedral now that's the cancer
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:28,064	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And then he's in the space and he's like so what should people be able to
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:31,392	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Doing the space we have all the scene of these tubes and things
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:32,928	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Fruit for chemo
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:37,792	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	I want to put in the machines that we're keeping Joel alive so we were feeding him
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:40,608	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	With these nutrition IV things we had
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:42,144	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Oxygen tanks
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:44,704	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And we trust building actual equipment
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:46,752	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	That the user would have to like
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:53,152	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Fiddle with the levers and you know make things just right so that the jewels getting what he needs to stay alive
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:53,920	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Does anything
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:58,272	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Oh well if they do it wrong then they'll feel as if Joel
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:01,344	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Died because of them and that's terrible
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:03,136	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Enter Then he says you know what's crap this whole thing
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:07,488	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Shruti showed us maybe sixty different sketches
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:09,280	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	A different iterations of a
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:10,560	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Cathedral that were all
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:15,424	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Super detailed in a kind of Terry Gilliam on steroids sort away
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:17,728	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	My friend since there is one sketchware
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:20,288	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Ryan head head head head built an entire
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:23,104	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Amusement park in the cathedral
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:27,456	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And that was supposed to represent all of Joel's favorite things
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:31,552	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Now it's all there just like too much stuff it's distracting so then he takes up the whole
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:32,576	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Amusement park
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:34,880	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And then he puts in
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:36,160	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	These prayer candles
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:43,328	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	He's like you know really what I want people to take away is this feeling I had
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:45,120	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	On the last night of Joel's life
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:45,888	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Where
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:47,168	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	All you can do now is pray
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:52,544	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And so you like one of these candles and you hear a prayer from that night
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:58,176	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Boys Life returned to him to not let you go and let
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:03,296	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And it's been hard I can for both of us to get to a place where we say
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:05,344	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	It can't say all the things
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:06,368	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	The cathedral
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:10,720	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Can't say all the things we wanted to say just had to cook something else in the game cuz we couldn't finish it
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:16,096	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And it's hard cuz you just want to never finish it and make it as beautiful as possible
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:21,984	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	And I don't know like there's part of it feels like we've betrayed a project by finishing it and by saying it can only be
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:23,520	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	But of course
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:24,800	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	They have to finish it
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:26,080	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	There's investors
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:28,640	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	There's a release date was disappointing to me
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:30,688	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Is how quickly it fades
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:35,808	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Dole how did how the memories in the
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:38,368	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	The person of dulfersitz because he
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:39,392	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Start here he's a
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:41,696	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	He becomes more and more an idea
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:44,000	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	This
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:47,328	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	This game is not him it's just an echo of him it's not
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:49,632	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	It's not even the best echo of him
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:52,192	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	I think that's the thing that I'm struggling with
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:55,264	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	As we as we're approaching the end of this
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:58,848	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Do all this
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:28:00,128	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Or why it why is it that
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:01,408	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Why do we do this
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:04,736	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	The game is coming out mid January
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:08,064	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	The cathedral to Ryan will always be
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:09,600	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Unfinished
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:11,392	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Can you show me the last scene with app
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:25,984	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Ryan was able to finish the place that comes right after the cathedral
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:28,544	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	It's the scene where you say goodbye to Joel
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:30,848	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	You find yourself in a boat
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:31,360	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Next to Joel
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:33,152	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	There's no oars
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:34,432	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	You're headed towards an island
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:37,504	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	You got there
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:41,088	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	You walk along a small path and you end up in a clearing in the woods
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:45,696	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	There's a picnic blanket
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:48,000	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	Angel sitting on it
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:50,048	| radiolab_podcast16cathedral |	I'll remember you
