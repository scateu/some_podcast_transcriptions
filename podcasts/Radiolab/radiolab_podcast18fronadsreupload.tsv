EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:19,967	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	There must be something else going on like that should be gone
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:23,807	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Didn't know what else to do
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:31,487	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Buttendz insurance work with a good cover that so they just decide

EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:50,687	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	What if
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:54,271	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	6 days later their New York City with a new doctor
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:58,879	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Dr. Carol portlock Sloan-Kettering and they had spent all of their
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:00,159	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Test results to this docker

EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:05,023	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And then
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:05,791	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	She sits down
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:07,583	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Says
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:08,863	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Okay
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:10,399	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I've looked over your test results
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:12,703	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And you have stage 4
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:14,495	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:16,287	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	She gets very aggressive
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,311	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:19,871	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	It's a 70% chance you're going to die
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:23,967	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I just remember feeling like
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:29,087	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Kind of like with her words and how quick they were in kind of cold it was kind of like
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:31,135	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Might not
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:34,719	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Turn out the way we both really really wanted to
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:48,543	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Ask the doctor how you treat this
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:54,943	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Your says it's this super intense chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant which is
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:10:01,343	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	A very intense procedure and then I asked her
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:06,207	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	What can I do about my fertility and she looked at me like I had three heads you know like
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:08,255	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	My darling
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,279	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Forget the fertility
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:10,815	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	You're fighting for your life
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:13,631	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	A nanny says back to her
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:15,679	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	No I want children
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:17,471	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Like I don't think you get it
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:18,751	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	We have a plan
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:23,871	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I put this on a placemat I signed it I'm going to beat this you might not believe it
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:24,383	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I believe
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:25,663	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I'm having kids
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:27,711	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I'm having kids with Greg
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:31,551	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And when I asked her why she was so adamant about it she just said
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:33,343	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	It was a couple of thing
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:39,487	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	One she was always really wanted to be a mom that's what I wanted I wanted to be a mom
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:46,143	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Just Married Greg just made this promise that they could have kids together and she felt like if she
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:47,935	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Couldn't do that she was breaking
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:48,447	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	That promise
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:50,239	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Okay so I get through it and then
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:55,359	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	He's maybe not going to want to be with me anymore like you know like once I get healthy because
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:11:01,759	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	He's got dreams of himself individually like separate from mine you know even though we're married you know I mean like
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:06,111	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Kind of like a worried that like maybe if we can't have
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:07,647	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Have kids but like we might break up
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:10,719	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Not really a worry
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:13,791	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	But I thought, you know as usual a there in your
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:17,119	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Well I definitely wanted kids
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:19,935	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	You know but I wasn't

EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:27,103	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I'm getting her healthy
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:30,943	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	It was interesting cuz whenever they talked about like kids

EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:36,831	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Trying to get through stuff they kept

EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:40,415	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Keep saying like
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:45,791	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Like they were like tossing something in front of him they would make the gesture of life
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,071	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Of like
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:49,631	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I'm going to stand like throwing a ball out

EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:09,599	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Circular things you can see it
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:11,391	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I don't know I just felt like it was
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:11,903	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Hope
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:13,183	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Of
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:14,463	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	There's the gold go get it
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:17,279	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	So
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:18,815	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Portlock is like
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,863	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	No I don't think you understand like
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:24,703	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	We need to get you in treatment right away like within like maybe a week
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:30,847	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And any fertility treatment would take too long like egg freezing takes too long IVF
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:32,127	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	That would take weeks
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:33,919	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	But Annie is just like
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:36,991	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Come on anything give me a shot
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:40,319	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And she just paused for about 30 seconds
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:44,671	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And then she goes
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:46,207	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	There is a doctor
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:47,743	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Across the street at Weill Cornell
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:48,511	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	He is
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:50,303	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	A fertility specialist
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:52,095	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	She's doing a study right now
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:53,887	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I don't know much about it but
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:55,935	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I will make sure you have an appointment tomorrow morning
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:13:00,799	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	So the next morning Annie is in the doctor's office across
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:02,847	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	The street and in walks this mystery.
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:05,151	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	All right the duck is in the house
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:08,735	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Crazy curly black hair
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:11,807	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Me and a white lab coat on for faster
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:12,319	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And like
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:15,647	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I kind of like this guy don't know why I like this guy
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,927	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Do you remember when you met her
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:19,743	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Yeah and was one of the
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:23,071	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	First few patients that we did the freezing for
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:28,703	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Oh this is our guy from a episode 1 Mr magical Donuts on Hazard a magical Oregon
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:31,007	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Yeah
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:35,871	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Okay we're back with the magic of the gonads we're about to re-enter the magic land
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:38,943	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And he's also the guy that brings us to freezing
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:40,991	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	But
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:42,271	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	First a little contact
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:52,255	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Acquired an egg and sperm and sex
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:53,279	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And then
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:56,095	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Some magic happened and a baby popped out
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:59,423	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	We started trying to figure out how to control that process
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:01,983	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	So what starts
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:04,031	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	The freezing of reproductive parts
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:08,127	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Don't started with sperm 1700s they realize that
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:09,663	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Sperm
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:13,247	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Slow down and became really sleepy when it got cold
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:18,879	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I don't know but that's what they saw
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:22,463	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	It wasn't until the 1950s and they actually figured out how
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:24,767	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	To freeze sperm thawed sperm
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:26,559	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And then use that to make
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:27,327	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	A real baby
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:28,863	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And then
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:30,911	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	It's like okay well
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:34,751	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	We figured out sperm that's like half the population
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:36,031	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	So what about
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:36,799	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Eggs
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:38,591	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And so they start trying to
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:40,895	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Freeze eggs that that turns out to be a lot harder
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:43,967	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Because eggs are so
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:45,503	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Full of liquid
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:48,063	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	So when you try and freeze them ice crystals for a minute
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:50,367	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Pierce's the egg
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:55,999	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And it's at this point sort of in the 90s that act a walks into the room
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:57,535	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	He was studying
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:58,303	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Kind of
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:00,351	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Eggs in general and fertility
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:02,655	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And he ends up in a lab
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:06,239	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	That is saying you know if we can't freeze eggs
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:10,079	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Maybe what we should actually do is just freeze the ovary
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:17,503	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Which is a totally different ballgame because an ovary is an entire organ
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:18,271	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I'm a big
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:19,551	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	How big is
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:21,599	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	7/8 minutes the size of like a
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:23,135	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I don't know a walnut
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:26,463	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	But yeah it's not a small task it is still a whole working
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:28,767	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And that is actually what is
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:30,303	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Cool about this whole thing
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:33,375	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Because it is the Egg Factory
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:37,471	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	See if you can figure out how to freeze an ovary you can potentially freestyles
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:37,983	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	The banks
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:39,519	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And so
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:43,103	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	When an e shows up onto the scene
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:46,687	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	This was just an idea it had never been done before
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:52,063	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Different animals but the idea that Hansel doctors including okte had was
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:59,231	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	4 women and an e situation you know let's freeze some of your ovarian tissue and then maybe one day that technology
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:15:59,999	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Will catch up
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:01,023	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And we can do something with it
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:05,887	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	So when Annie walked in the door
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:07,679	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	How
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:09,727	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Experimental was what you were doing
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:12,287	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	No it was a highly experimental because
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:13,823	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	She was one of the first few patients
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:16,383	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And he comes in and
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:16,895	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	She says
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:18,431	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	There's this thing
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:23,551	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	It's ovarian freezing this is brand-new I've never successfully done this in a human
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:25,599	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	There were no pregnancies are in
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:31,999	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	He told Annie what I'm doing here is a shot in the dark and this is like the basketball shot all the way across the court at the buzzer
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:33,279	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	But unfortunately this is your only option
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:36,863	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And then she said she was basically Life Bouquet
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:43,263	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	He explained the process the new this is what we will try to do we can take out one of your ovaries freeze it in liquid nitrogen
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:44,031	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And then
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:47,359	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	If you survived your cancer which is big if at this point
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:50,431	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And if you make it to the two-year Mark which is a big landmark
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:51,199	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	For cancer survivors
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:53,247	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	We can look at reimplanting it
EDL	00:16:53,759	00:16:56,319	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	You just hear those papers you like sign away so I can
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:57,087	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Sign my name like
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:17:00,159	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Do you remember when any of the waivers were
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:01,695	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I just signed everything
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:02,719	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Didn't read it just sign
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:08,351	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Like he could have been the first sighting it's a China we're going to have babies with like your ovary over there
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:09,631	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I did not like
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:12,191	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I did not like to pay any attention
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:13,471	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I just wanted a chance
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:17,823	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Coming up she gets a chance
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:20,895	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And things get weird

EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:24,895	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:31,295	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework were interested in

EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:13,535	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Terrible cancer diagnosis in Annie is in the OR and Doctor Octopus
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:15,071	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Takes out one of her ovaries
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:18,143	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	What walk me to the operation what's involved
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:19,423	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	As far as surgeries go it's
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:23,775	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	It's super simple easy painless
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:26,591	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	He put you under anesthesia and then he makes
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:32,479	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	An incision in her abdomen where you go through patients bellybutton with a camera and then
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:33,759	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Two little love
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:37,599	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Punctures along the bikini line and we can pull the ovary out
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:39,647	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Through that incision in the belly button
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:45,535	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And then they drop it in a freezer this is like a 45-minute the outpatient procedure
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:48,351	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Once it's done you just walk home yeah oh yeah
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:49,375	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	A week later
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:51,423	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	She's at Memorial Sloan-Kettering getting chemo
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:55,519	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And the treatment is like
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:57,055	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Saying
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:04,991	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	She goes through rounds of chemotherapy where she gets chemo all weekend in a lake the big
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:07,551	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Ziplocs like the freezer bags like the gallon
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:09,343	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	That's what they were hanging up
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:10,623	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Field of chemo
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:11,647	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Thumbs up
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:14,463	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Down one up time for another one
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:17,535	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Down one up time for another one
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:19,839	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Time for another one
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:22,911	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Constant in this kind of chemo they kill a lot of
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:23,679	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Cells in your body
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:31,103	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Good cells your bad cells your immune cells are stem cells they kill everything you're basically dead for all
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:34,431	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Purpose of them in the blood counts are all by no doubt there's no there's nothing
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:36,223	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Is there a whitetail red Zara playlist
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:43,647	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	From there she gets a stem cell transplant which is taking your blood out and putting stem cells back in
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:49,023	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	India is at then she would regrow her immune system hopefully without cancer
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:53,631	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	May 26th
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:54,399	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I walked out of
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:58,751	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Annie is
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:01,567	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	False no eyelashes no eyebrows
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:04,895	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Skinny male stores it sucks
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:06,687	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	But according to the doctors
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:08,735	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	They were like you're good she's cancer-free
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:13,343	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	You're clear so when we got out we walk to the park
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:15,135	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Got slice
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:17,696	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Her people was at the greatest pizza ever
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:24,096	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	The sun is shining and horns honking and it was New York like it was like I said as I not like
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:25,888	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Like this is life
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:30,752	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	There was
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:33,568	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Pretty good chance that the cancer could come back
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:36,128	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Pusheen Greg go home and
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:37,408	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Wait
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:39,968	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	1 month goes by

EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:55,328	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	For I would think about the cancer
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:56,608	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Most of the day
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:57,632	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Where would like

EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:09,152	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	When did you
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:11,200	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	First have the ovary reenter your mind
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:13,504	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Well
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:15,040	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Started to I went

EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:18,624	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	You know the two-year mark
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:20,672	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	They did a pet
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:22,976	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Pet scan blood work all that and
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:24,256	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I was clear
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:26,304	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And that
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:28,608	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Jay wenzhou Lactaid
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:31,936	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Just walked across the street
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:36,288	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	In what you remember is the last time she talked to aktay the deal was
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:42,432	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Get to the two-year Mark if he gets the two-year Mark give me a call I have no idea where will be at with this technology
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:45,760	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	No idea if I'm going to be able to give you a baby but we'll see
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:51,392	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Now in that interim period in those two years okte had been continuing to experiment

EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:58,048	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	What not wear YouTube
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:59,072	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Expect
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:02,656	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Originally we did this in the forearm
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:07,008	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Like my under my watch like on my forearm
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:09,568	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Correct it would just take it and stick it in the muscle
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:10,592	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	In the forearm
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:12,384	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	An ovary in the forearm
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:14,176	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	How does that even make sense
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:17,760	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Will it make sense because this is how crazy weird
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:19,808	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Like an ovary is
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:24,672	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	You can put it literally anywhere in the body that has good blood supply
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:25,696	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Nginx
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:27,232	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	3 to 10 days
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:28,512	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	New blood vessel
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:31,328	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	So just it just pops on
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:35,936	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	How do you get a baby out of an ovary that's in your forearm
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:37,984	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Oh so the idea is
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:39,520	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	That you could just
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:40,288	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Yesterday
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:41,824	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Lock the mature eggs
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:43,616	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Out from just underneath the skin
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:49,504	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And then you could combine them with a sperm in a Petri dish and just do normal IVF read makeup
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:51,296	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Umbreon petri dish and then implant
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:58,464	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Got you but by the time an Ewok didn't know one had done this and gotten it to work there had yet to be
EDL	00:23:58,464	00:24:00,256	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	A baby born from an ovarian trance
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:02,560	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	When Anna showed up though
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:03,584	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Octavius ready
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:06,144	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	He said I'm going to take the 21 in strips
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:09,728	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	These little bits of her ovary that have been frozen
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:13,568	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	For two years so we're going to suit your own right underneath your your belly button in your stomach
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:20,992	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Well he has he put prior to me he had put a few in a woman's rear end
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:27,392	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	No really it actually wasn't in that did that but rumor on the street is that there's no Rihanna but somewhere but he's cell
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:29,696	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	That putting it closest to where
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:33,280	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	The other ovary is and where its original spot was
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:35,328	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Was probably the most beneficial migas
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:37,120	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Hopefully within 2 months you'll get
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:40,448	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Menstruation cycle and he goes and then you'll come out of menopause
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:45,312	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Cuz remember that chemo would shut down that remaining over and put her in a full on menopause
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:47,616	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	We don't
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:48,128	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	We just got to say
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:54,784	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Swanky does the procedure again it's super simple implants a few bits of over in the skin next to your belly button
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:57,856	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	2 months later started field first little marbles
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:03,232	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Down around her belly button have these lumps
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:10,656	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Describe it but like under the skin can actually like kind of grab it
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:17,056	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Put your finger right here you could you can feel them and should you notice certain times of the month that they would be able to get images
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:18,080	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Bigger
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:19,872	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Eggs on the skin
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:26,784	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	It was really weird I mean I have all different sizes like sometimes less than a dime sometimes as big as a quarter
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:29,856	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I just feel like if you rub your finger across

EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:45,472	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	It's good.
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:51,616	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	He says they hurt me I couldn't buckle my jeans cuz the bucket like the button on the jeans would hurt
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:52,896	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Pressing against
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:55,200	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Skin cuz they were sticking out you know

EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:57,472	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And now you're saying that suddenly a baby appeared in her uterus
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:28:59,520	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	It's a long way away from her belly button
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:00,288	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I don't get it
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:02,848	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I don't get it likes it what did the belly button

EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:04,128	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	What happened
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:05,920	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	That that's the quest
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:10,528	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	There are so many different definitely something
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:11,296	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Happened there
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:13,088	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And what was that something
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:15,136	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Divine intervention
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:16,416	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I don't know
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:19,488	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	So act a Venturi does publish to papers on this
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:22,304	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And he raises like a lot of different ways
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:24,608	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	This could happen
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:27,680	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	In Annie says maybe the thing to remember for all these explanation
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:33,056	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	So if you think about Annie's body right now there's the one ovary that was left inside
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:34,592	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	That is now defunct
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:36,896	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Describes
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:38,176	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Dead over
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:39,712	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	It's been killed by the chemo
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:46,112	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Right so you got the dead ovary Insider you've got the transplant a lower belly button in the skin
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:48,416	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Which is very much alive full of eggs little Marvel
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:49,440	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	So
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:50,976	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	To get a pregnancy
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:52,768	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Here's what might have happened couple different option
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:54,048	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	First
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:55,328	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Maybe
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:57,632	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	One of these immature
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:29:59,168	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Turn of egg
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:30:01,216	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Sal's near belly button
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:04,288	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Flips out of the transplanted ovarian tissue
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:10,688	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	It's into the bloodstream is transported through the bloodstream all around the body
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:11,456	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Opposite ovary
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:12,736	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	The Dead one where
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:15,808	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	It is like this is the place I want to be
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:19,136	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Saddles and then in there is
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:20,160	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Matured
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:23,232	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And then can be sucked up by the fallopian tube and made into a baby
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:24,256	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Correct sir
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:26,048	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Biologically speaking
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:27,072	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	It's plausible
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:28,096	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Let's remember
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:30,912	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Germ cells got to the ovary three long migration
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:35,776	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Remember last episode with Great Migration The Great Migration
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:39,616	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	This will be the Great Migration * a million cuz it's going all around the body yeah
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:43,712	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	The most likely and most reasonable
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:45,248	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	That probably happened
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:46,528	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Is
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:48,576	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	That the ovarian trance
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:54,976	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Plant in reconnecting with the body sends out its signal is like hey hey hey hey
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:57,792	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	We got some hormones going on here
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:30:58,816	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	These
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:30:59,840	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Hormones
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:01,120	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Help the other ovary
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:01,888	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Wake up
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:03,168	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Turn back on
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:09,568	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And then if it had any remaining egg cells that were like dormant maybe you could
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:11,872	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Rejuvenate them or get them to mature
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:13,920	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And then throws could become a baby
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:19,552	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Well so either these eggs are going on a journey like no other
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:21,088	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Or
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:22,112	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	They're waking the Dead
EDL	00:31:22,624	00:31:28,768	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Yes to very reasonable option that's been both ways double banana it is so banana
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:32,352	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	That when it happened aktay just thought it was
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:33,120	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Luck
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:37,472	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Like maybe that over inside of the Dead one just had like one last
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:37,984	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Stag
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:45,920	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	But
EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:47,456	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	A month-and-a-half later
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:47,968	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Pregnant
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:49,504	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Again
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:51,552	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	In the same way
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:53,088	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Are uterus
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:53,600	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Yeah like
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:31:56,672	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Crap
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:58,208	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	My body healed enough I could Excel
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:31:59,744	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Shiva pregnant
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:01,280	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	See without intervention
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:02,304	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And so
EDL	00:32:03,072	00:32:04,096	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	September 25th
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:05,376	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	2005
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:15,360	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Sienna and dower was born a healthy baby weighing 8lb 6oz
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:18,176	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	The first baby ever born in the US of an ovarian trance
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:22,016	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Even though the chances of conceiving a child was Unthinkable like
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:28,416	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	1 and 5 million miracle baby
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:32,512	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Greg Annie octech dr. Cutler poked eye little baby Sienna
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:34,560	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Hit the road on a media blitz
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:39,168	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	She is now the mother of a bouncing baby girl the first ever to be born in the US
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:40,960	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	By using this particular
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:43,520	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Technological breakthrough
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:46,080	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	So that happened
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:48,640	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And then
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:51,200	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	3 years later
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:51,968	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Pregnant
EDL	00:32:51,968	00:32:53,760	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	It happened again with little Greg
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:55,040	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Same thing you'll fashioned way
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:32:57,344	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And at this point they're like
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:32:59,392	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	We had a girl a boy there
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:02,464	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Healthy no issues think on they felt like
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:04,000	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	We've executed
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:05,280	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	I dream of the place
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:07,072	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	No intention of having another one
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:08,864	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Like zero
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:10,400	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	But
EDL	00:33:10,400	00:33:11,424	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	4 months later
EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:12,192	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Pregnant
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:13,984	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Again three babies
EDL	00:33:13,984	00:33:18,080	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Back-to-back-to-back I mean how do you become super fertile
EDL	00:33:18,848	00:33:20,128	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	After being in
EDL	00:33:20,640	00:33:22,176	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Clinical menopause for 2 years
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:32,416	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Does he still think there any and Greg got lucky that this was kind of a one-off
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:36,768	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	No because since Sienna was born we've had
EDL	00:33:37,280	00:33:43,680	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Many more babies born from this procedure as we spend over a hundred babies
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:45,472	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	More all around the world
EDL	00:33:45,472	00:33:51,872	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	And it's no longer like just happening within the fertility Community I bumped it
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:55,968	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Doctors that are experimenting using it with
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:58,016	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Women's were going into menopause
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:33:59,808	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	An ovarian patch
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:03,392	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	That will inject hormones to delay menopause
EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:09,792	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Are the other place I bumped into it is in the trans Community where kids who are transitioning from
EDL	00:34:09,792	00:34:11,584	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	From female to male
EDL	00:34:11,584	00:34:17,984	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Are opting to or their parents are choosing to freeze or ovary so they have a chat
EDL	00:34:17,984	00:34:20,032	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Chance of possibly having by Logic
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:20,800	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Kids
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:21,568	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	If they
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:22,336	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Want to do that
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:27,200	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	So it is it is cool because you you have this feeling of like when I was
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:30,784	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Standing in the room with Annie I kept having this like feeling of
EDL	00:34:33,600	00:34:35,136	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	You just feel like
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:35,904	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Really
EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:42,304	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Close to some sort of power like maybe because it's an it it would just kind of ridiculous because I have this power to write Ivo
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:46,144	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Ovaries but this damn being outside
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:49,216	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	The body and like like she said kind of like
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:51,008	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Sci-fi experiment
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:57,152	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	Just like humans are Marching toward this moment of just like regulating every part of the human process
EDL	00:34:57,152	00:35:00,480	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	But then almost as quickly as you have that thought
EDL	00:35:00,480	00:35:01,504	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	You realize
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:04,832	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	13 years later
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:06,880	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	You have these kids running around
EDL	00:35:07,648	00:35:10,208	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	An act a still doesn't really understand
EDL	00:35:10,720	00:35:11,488	| radiolab_podcast18fronadsreupload |	What happened
