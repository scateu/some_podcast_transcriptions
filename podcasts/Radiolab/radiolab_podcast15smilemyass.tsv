EDL	00:01:05,024	00:01:08,608	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Media history we're like the line between show and life
EDL	00:01:08,608	00:01:09,888	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Was really clear
EDL	00:01:09,888	00:01:16,288	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Then Along came a guy named Alan Funt who muddy that line in a way that was fascinating but
EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:17,568	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Fakta spiritual
EDL	00:01:17,568	00:01:19,872	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	I think those bite marks around all of our butts
EDL	00:01:19,872	00:01:20,640	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	So check your tush

EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:31,648	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Binged
EDL	00:01:32,160	00:01:35,232	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	All of I I watched every single clip I go again
EDL	00:01:36,000	00:01:38,816	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And then that's around the time when I found out that it's
EDL	00:01:38,816	00:01:42,656	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Started as a radio show which was even more interesting to me because I was like
EDL	00:01:42,656	00:01:43,424	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	A Rios
EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:45,216	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	How does that even make
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:47,776	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	What is that even what would that be
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:49,568	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	So I called up one of the
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:51,616	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Few people who have
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:52,384	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Studied

EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:20,032	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	The electronic communications
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:22,080	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Sperm for the Armed Forces at a time
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:27,712	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	So fun teaser a few years out of college by this point he is stationed in Oklahoma at Camp Gruber

EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:34,112	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	For the Armed Forces Radio one of these
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:38,208	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	The grape grape grape
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:40,256	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Basically the show
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:42,048	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Burnt wood gets old
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:44,096	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	You're stationed at the camp to come into His Studio
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:45,632	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And talk about their gripes
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:53,056	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Barracks in about the food in about you know their girlfriend is cheating on him back home or whatever you know things that were bothering
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:55,616	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Not a very good idea for morale
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:03:00,480	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Oh I think it's a great idea from around really good if I would imagine it would bring the soldiers down
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:03,040	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Together
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:03,808	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Fair enough
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:07,136	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Anyhow so he's bringing these soldiers into a little recordings
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:10,720	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Studio one of the things that he found with it as soon as the red light would go on
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:14,048	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	To indicate that recording was going on
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,352	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	They clam up
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:17,376	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	They would get tongue tied
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:19,936	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Mike fright micro
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:25,312	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Mike fry in any tells me stories about how it was amazing to see these soldiers
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:27,616	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Who would go out in the battle
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:29,408	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Without maybe blinking an eye but
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:30,688	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Break into a cold sweat
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:31,968	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	At the thought of sitting in front of Michael
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:37,856	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	So what was what does he do also disconnect the red light
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:39,648	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And record them secretly
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:46,816	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	So basically you bring them in and say okay let's just do a practice round let's just talk over the things the kind of things you will talk about
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:49,120	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And then
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:52,448	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	When then finally they were ready to start I already got it
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:54,240	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	He would get better material
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:56,288	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	When they didn't know they were being recorded
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:59,872	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Would they be okay with that likes will you just collect mission after work
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:02,688	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	20 more
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:04,992	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	It's a sort of Truth deferred
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:09,856	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	You might say but according to Jacob Smith front was like
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:10,624	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	This is a
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:16,512	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Great trick yes you know the red light goes off in the great Booth but a red light goes on infant's mind
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:22,143	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And so after the war he pitches this idea as candid microphone
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:28,287	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Which goes on the air on ABC in 1947
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:49,279	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	This is Sonny Fox
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:53,119	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And he was one of the original guys to work with Alan
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:53,631	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Microphone
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:55,423	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	I can eat just so happy
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:56,959	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	When he came into our
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:58,751	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Studio we manage
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:00,543	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Him on

EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:10,527	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Up to Snuff
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:12,063	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Why is my
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:18,207	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Hot water now all of a sudden not so driven would have helped
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:21,535	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Alright okay we're here to talk about much more exciting
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:25,887	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	So when you were working with Al-Anon candid microphone

EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:06,335	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	That was the core of what we did
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:08,127	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	I will have to do everything
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:18,367	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	How long was the Arbiter obviously of whether we did something that didn't just have these two what was like what was the goal

EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:38,847	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	We go out to the studio in the world everyday life
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:41,407	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Sociologist Erving Goffman called bugging the backstage
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:46,783	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	What we would do is everyday sunny and crew would go to their office in Manhattan
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:48,319	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	2 room office
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:49,343	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Jidenna
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,879	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	I think up ideas
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:52,415	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Separately scratching our heads
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:58,815	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	What about this
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:00,607	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Barber shop or a magazine
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:02,143	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Maybe that's something we could
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:04,447	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	You know
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:07,775	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Restaurant shoe store
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:12,383	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	So what they do is they take this big clunky portable recorder
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:15,711	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	It was like a suitcase it wait I think maybe
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:18,271	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	60 lb but they put a handle on top
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:19,039	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Opposite of supporter
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:23,391	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	He says that they would lug around this massive suitcase
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:25,183	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Do whatever it was a recording
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:26,463	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And they try to hide it
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:28,767	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	So that no one would see it so they could record this
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:37,471	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	In all these different locations including the women's bathroom
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:38,751	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	I really don't
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:39,775	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Vinyl
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:45,407	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	The teeth they gathered front was disappointed to discover that was the most uninteresting
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:47,967	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Garbage you could imagine it was
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:51,295	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Frustrating it doesn't have you know the nice shape
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:53,599	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	The rise and fall
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,135	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Climax
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:57,439	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	That I'm is going to keep listeners hook now
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:00,511	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	That presented us with any problem
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:02,303	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Better half hour show
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,583	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	But they needed to fill
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:04,095	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	His house
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:06,655	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Desperate I was I was having a date
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:08,959	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	First date with a young woman
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:10,751	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	I bugged my car
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:14,079	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And try to see how she would sound on a first date
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:17,407	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	She found out about that was not amusing that was the last

EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:33,279	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	So here they had this show that was supposed to be about real people real talk everyday conversation but turned out that
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:38,399	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	So then the question became how can we mix it up how can we Stir It Up how can we
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:41,471	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Change this into something more spectacular
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:44,799	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And that's when Alan Funt added a little
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:46,335	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	It's something that Jacob Smith

EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:07,583	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Mike is like his
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,863	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Strange situation

EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:10,463	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	But this is
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,487	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Basically like
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:12,767	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Reality TV in a nut
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:14,047	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Like

EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:24,799	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Within inside of it snippet of life
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:27,103	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	We've all been there
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:30,687	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Situations where we've been frustrated when we don't understand what's going on
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:33,247	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Situations where we bewildered
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:34,527	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	So what would start pushing
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:39,135	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Tweaking it changing it trying out new permutations and sometimes
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:41,695	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	It's very much like a fly on the wall
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:42,975	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Another these days

EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:12,063	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	She's writing in to complain that this was in a crossing a line

EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:43,039	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Avenal prison
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:44,063	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Out and out
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:45,343	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Snooping
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:47,391	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	In your letter you said
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:53,279	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Is that a little more strongly you said you thought were a bunch of dirty sneaking spy
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:54,303	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Well
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:59,167	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	I suppose that the time and I was listening to the program I felt that way
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:05,311	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Look at these people in their homes extemporaneously about the
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:08,383	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	What was it that you went into Sandman bedroom
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:14,015	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Oh you mean the one where the wife awake in the house

EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:24,511	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Why you may have something there but don't you think it's funny that sounds a man makes when he awakens
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:31,167	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	They're funny but they're only for him though in his own bedroom and I'm sure he doesn't enjoy having the whole world know about it
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:37,055	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	What you think most people are nervous and self-conscious in front of them

EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:47,935	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	But when the show goes out on TV
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:51,007	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	A lot of viewers think that it's mean-spirited
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:53,567	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	That the subjects
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:55,103	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Being somehow
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:57,407	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Mystery that there were critics who were
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:59,455	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Very unnerving
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:03,807	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Set by there were people certainly do the critics say oh man I made a list
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:04,831	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Tear of
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:08,415	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Of a whole bunch of that criticisms from the 40s and 50s
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:14,047	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And they're great their likes to know like they're so sweeping so okay so
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:16,863	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	So there was this one guy in the New Yorker this is in 1950
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:19,679	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Who said and I love this
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:22,495	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	For my money
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:24,031	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Candid camera is
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:24,543	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Sadistic

EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:31,199	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	What year was another
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:32,479	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Hold on there is another kind of great
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:32,991	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	String of object
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:36,063	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	There's so many of
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:40,159	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Another guy for different guy from The New Yorker
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:41,951	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	He found Alan Funt
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:43,743	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Horse
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:44,767	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Nagging
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:45,535	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Suspicious
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:47,839	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And misanthropic and to make matters worse
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:51,167	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Zestfully cell
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:57,567	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	But I mean I think that becomes Canada PR problem that he has to fix
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:58,591	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And according to Jacob
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:03,455	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	It was not a small problem no even all through the 50s
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:07,295	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	It's on and off doesn't really get its audience
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:09,087	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	It moves around different Networks
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:13,951	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And all the while he's tweaking it and changing it adapting it
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:15,231	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Early 60s
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:17,023	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	She hits on
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:20,607	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Second little tweak
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:22,911	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	That would make all the difference
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:24,191	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Fonts term was
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:25,471	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	The reveal
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:28,543	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	The reveal
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:35,455	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	By 1962 he locks it and you start to see this thing happened over and over
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:41,087	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	The end of segment
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:43,391	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Classic reveal is let's say
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:51,839	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Dad is in a diner and there serving this guy if tiny little teacup
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:55,423	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And he wanted a big coffee mug
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:21:00,287	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Serving the tiny little teacup what's going on
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:05,919	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Guy gets pissed off and then previously but would have let that keep going but now
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:09,247	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	What is the guy is about to blow
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:12,575	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Punch someone out
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:14,623	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And they kind of grab the guy in their life
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:17,184	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Santa camera
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:18,976	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	They show him the hidden camera
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:19,744	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	On
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:21,536	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Camera and as he's looking at that hidden
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:23,328	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And he's like
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:24,096	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Huh
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:26,912	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	The camera Zooms in on his face
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:29,728	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	MMG
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:30,752	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	What did actually happen
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:32,288	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Cool people in place
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:37,408	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	It's for that very moment because one of their first reactions are to turn away or to cover their face
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:41,504	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	So he would sometimes have to physically restrain them and turning them towards the camera
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:42,784	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	So they can capture
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:43,808	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	That one
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:44,576	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Weeding
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:45,088	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Moment
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:52,000	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And in that moment you see so much on their face they're they're angry they're embarrassed or ashamed of confused
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:53,536	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	You don't know how to feel a tendon
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:54,560	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Right that moment
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:55,328	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Fun says
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:56,352	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	The magic word

EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:27,328	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	It's your lucky day it went from being like this
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:30,656	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	You Alex
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:31,936	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	This works
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:37,312	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Much better I take it out I was hugely successful it was one of the top-ranked shows from
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:40,128	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Basically all of the early 1960s
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:42,688	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Million different tens of millions of people watched it
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:46,016	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And I think part of the reason why was it
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:50,880	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Without that sort of meanness it bled out the meanness and people could now
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:56,000	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	What it really was which of these
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:57,024	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Kind of a little
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:59,072	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Peepholes into
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:00,608	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Human Nature
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:03,424	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	The first one I ever saw was the the elevator sketch
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:07,264	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Do you know the elevators now headed to walk me through the elevator sketch
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:08,800	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	It's just really simple
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:09,824	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	It's really
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:12,128	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Simple and it's so beautiful
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:14,688	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	The gentleman in the elevator now
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:16,480	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Is a candid stop
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:20,832	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Basic setup is guy walks into an elevator there's a hidden camera
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:21,600	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	He doesn't know
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:23,904	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Is a fella with his hat on
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:24,416	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	In the elevator
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:31,584	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	He is like everybody else wearing his overcoat and a hat and he stands in the middle of the elevator and then
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:34,912	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	All of the other people in the elevator who we later learned hard
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:35,680	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Confederate
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:37,216	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	They
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:38,752	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	They take offense
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:39,520	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Take off their hats
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:45,920	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And one by one by one what have up to have top five hats off
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:49,760	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Open elevator door in he's just sort of standing there awkwardly and then he just
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:51,040	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Assertive
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:56,928	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Hesitantly is he just takes off his hat and then holds it in front of his you know chess
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:23:57,440	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Maui
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:00,000	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	The procedure
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:06,400	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Then all of the people around him they put their hats back on
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:09,472	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Anthony started laying around and like it's almost it's
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:15,872	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	How many of this is somewhere between conscious and subconscious level and then he sort of just puts his hat on
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:23,040	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	It's really funny it's really really nice guy wasn't clearly just was trying
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:27,392	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	To fit in in this weird way it's interesting I never
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:28,416	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Watch the T
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:31,744	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	But it's weird like we
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:33,280	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	When I was 7 we still
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:35,328	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	We would say all the time like
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:38,912	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Smile you're on Candid Camera even though I've never seen the show
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:43,776	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	It was like the idea of the show is like in a way way bigger than the actual show
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:48,128	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Yeah, came up but it but it was less about
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:48,640	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Kind of
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:52,224	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Investigating human behavior and more about
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:52,736	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Vanity
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:54,528	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	In this weird way it was like this idea that
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:56,064	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	You
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:58,880	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Tiny sliver of your private life
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:24:59,648	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Could be
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:01,952	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Exercised and then broadcast
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:02,464	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	To the world
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:05,536	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And that idea
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:07,328	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	That idea would get away from
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:10,656	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Fontaine it would go all over the world and then it would
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:11,936	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Come right back and vitamin
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:12,448	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	The botanist
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:15,264	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Really funny and strange
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:17,056	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	What what happened
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:18,336	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Well
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:19,872	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Okay it starts like this

EDL	00:25:58,016	00:25:58,784	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Tempered glass

EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:05,440	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	For about the first 20 minutes
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:06,720	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Maybe an hour who knows
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:09,792	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	They're about a hundred miles or so offshore and
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:14,400	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	You know the bathroom all of the sudden
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:16,704	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	A man stood up in the back of the flight
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:19,008	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And he took out a knife
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:24,384	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Any put it to the throat of the one of the flight attendants and he walked her

EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:28,736	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Passing every pass
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:29,504	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Easter on the flight
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:35,648	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	I did hear noises which were a little bit different
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:36,416	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	In the back
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:42,816	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Does Fred Weaver retired Eastern Airlines pilot he was one of the flight crew and next to him

EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:52,288	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	You know I hear the knock on the door and I just open the door and I turned around to see who it was there she is
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:57,920	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	The flight attendant with the hijacker provider with the knife up against your throat
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:58,944	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Shane
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:05,344	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Kuba Kuba also was staying that his friend had a bomb in the back of the airplane
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:10,720	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	I do write this I said
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:12,000	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Here we go
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:16,352	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	The stewardess was walking around
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:22,752	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Talking with all the past years asking them if anybody knew how to speak Spanish
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:25,568	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Coach 11 years old at the time I didn't think much of it
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:27,104	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Until
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:31,200	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Till the announcement came on the loudspeaker
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:37,344	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Gets on and says ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen we have some gentlemen up here that want to go to Cuba so
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:39,392	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	We're going to Havana
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:44,256	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And then came the part of the story that I've been told was the waiting
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:45,280	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	The
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:47,584	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Frozen
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:48,096	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Silent
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:49,888	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Staring at each other
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:50,400	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Waiting
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:27:59,104	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	But then
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:00,640	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	This one woman
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:03,200	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	A few rows away begin to recognize my
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:10,112	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And she began to look and look back and forth to other folks and point a little bit and there was a slow
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:12,160	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Building of her certainty
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:15,488	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And then all of a sudden
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:17,024	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And sad
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:20,608	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Second we are not
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:21,888	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Being hijacked
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:27,776	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	It's a Candid Camera stunt I'm quoting him
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:34,176	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	The plane went absolutely crazy
EDL	00:28:34,176	00:28:40,576	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Pension Thrift off of
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:42,880	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	People were lined up with
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:49,280	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	There are sickness bags to get autographs from my father
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:50,560	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	My dad is
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:54,400	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	No I know it's not me I'm not involved
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:56,448	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	BRB hijack
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:28:59,264	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And they said come on Allen
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:05,664	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	We know it's you just trying to persuade people he's not getting any purchase
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:07,456	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Behind him
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:09,248	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Disease
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:09,760	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	A priest
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:18,208	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	He runs over the priest will you please help me convince these people this is not a
EDL	00:29:18,208	00:29:20,256	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Maniac Is For Real
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:28,704	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	You can't get me Allen
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:35,104	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Are we supposed to see a guy with you by the clerical collar everything
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:36,384	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Where is the hijack
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:40,736	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Terrifying people up in the cockpit
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:43,040	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	But eventually at some point
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:49,440	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	He hears this kind of commotion from first-class and so he does open the door and he pokes his head out
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:55,840	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And everybody begins to applaud and applause
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:59,168	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	We're not totally sure about that last detail might be in Embellishments
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:29:59,936	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Bored
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:03,008	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Seems clear is it around this time Alan Funt
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:06,848	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Starting to feel
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:11,968	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Keeping so successful at
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:12,736	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Bugging the back
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:18,880	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Messing up the line between private and public in real life in Showbiz
EDL	00:30:18,880	00:30:24,512	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Couldn't when he needed to we couldn't reassert that clearline I was worried
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:27,328	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	That he was going to come up with some idea to try to
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:31,936	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Mitigate this situation and deal with it
EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:35,008	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	What's he got so frustrated that he decided to just
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:37,824	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Deal with the hijackers himself yes
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:39,616	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	So it starts formulating
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:40,384	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Plant
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:46,784	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Grab the guy I'm not going to the floor and my mother sang
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:50,880	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Playing alone sit down before he's going to be like
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:57,024	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Apparently the flight attendant had to tell him to sit down what happens now will you have you took it to the point where
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:31:01,376	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Now the plane is landing in what I guess the people in the plane think of
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:01,888	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Florida
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:08,800	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	People the front of the plane notice Cuba Cuba correct into the terminal what greeted as the plane is
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:10,592	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Open to buy Cuban Military Officers
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:18,528	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	I saw a Cuban Soldier a gun in his hand and he had bandoliers you know with lots of bullets on him
EDL	00:31:18,528	00:31:19,552	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Maven Circle the airplane
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:24,416	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And it seems at this point everyone on the plane maybe the first time
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:24,928	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Would like
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:28,256	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Everybody really got it
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:30,048	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	But it was a hijacking
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:32,608	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	That was finally the reveal
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:33,632	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Just really late
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:40,288	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	The Story Goes when they're getting off the plane when he's Cuban soldiers are escorting them off the plane he was standing in his seat
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:42,592	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Twisty
EDL	00:31:42,592	00:31:43,360	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Aspective
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:46,688	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Human psychology all the passengers were
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:50,528	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Filing down the aisle past him he began to take there
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:51,296	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Feelings out on him
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:53,344	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And they became angry at
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:55,136	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	And each one of them
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:32:01,024	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Had sort of their own grab bag of curses for him as if he had tricked them as if he had
EDL	00:32:01,536	00:32:03,584	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Set them up in some way
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:06,912	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Person in that line from to my father and said
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:10,240	| radiolab_podcast15smilemyass |	Smile my ass
