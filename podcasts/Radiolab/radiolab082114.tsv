EDL	00:00:16,640	00:00:17,920	| radiolab082114 |	And NPR
EDL	00:00:19,456	00:00:20,480	| radiolab082114 |	Hello this is Lynn
EDL	00:00:20,480	00:00:21,760	| radiolab082114 |	Someone on the other side of us
EDL	00:00:21,760	00:00:24,832	| radiolab082114 |	Hey
EDL	00:00:24,832	00:00:28,160	| radiolab082114 |	So a couple months ago a producer Lynn Levy did an interview with
EDL	00:00:28,672	00:00:30,464	| radiolab082114 |	Yeah her name is Margaret Lovett
EDL	00:00:31,744	00:00:38,144	| radiolab082114 |	This was Margaret's first time doing a radio interview magic voice
EDL	00:00:38,144	00:00:40,448	| radiolab082114 |	But this is definitely not her first time
EDL	00:00:40,448	00:00:41,216	| radiolab082114 |	Talking into a microphone
EDL	00:00:41,216	00:00:42,496	| radiolab082114 |	Profound
EDL	00:00:42,496	00:00:43,264	| radiolab082114 |	Two three four
EDL	00:00:45,056	00:00:47,104	| radiolab082114 |	R34 this is the orange Ma
EDL	00:00:48,128	00:00:54,528	| radiolab082114 |	Almost exactly 50 years ago recording was made on November 19 1964
EDL	00:00:54,528	00:00:57,088	| radiolab082114 |	At 2300 hours
EDL	00:00:57,088	00:01:01,696	| radiolab082114 |	Margaret was at the center of this amazing weird experiment
EDL	00:01:01,696	00:01:02,976	| radiolab082114 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:01:02,976	00:01:09,376	| radiolab082114 |	Who were you at that time like what were you like well I I've always had a bit of if everybody's going left all going right
EDL	00:01:09,376	00:01:15,520	| radiolab082114 |	Cheap tri-college for awhile University for a year but she dropped out and I was
EDL	00:01:15,520	00:01:16,544	| radiolab082114 |	19 Somethin
EDL	00:01:17,312	00:01:20,384	| radiolab082114 |	And move to st. Thomas in the Caribbean
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:26,272	| radiolab082114 |	Got a job at this hotel did menus check people in and out and one day she hears about this strange research
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:27,808	| radiolab082114 |	Facility on the other side of the island
EDL	00:01:27,808	00:01:31,648	| radiolab082114 |	I wonder what that is about and I asked a few people nice I don't know
EDL	00:01:31,648	00:01:33,184	| radiolab082114 |	They don't like people they are kept
EDL	00:01:34,464	00:01:36,512	| radiolab082114 |	And I was told not to go there so I went there
EDL	00:01:41,120	00:01:42,144	| radiolab082114 |	And that's
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:43,168	| radiolab082114 |	Sourdough starter
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:51,104	| radiolab082114 |	That's how I can start the show I'm chatting Ron I'm Robert krulwich Radiolab producer Lynn Levy brings us a couple
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:57,248	| radiolab082114 |	Full of Close Encounters
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:02:01,856	| radiolab082114 |	Cut alien like not out there
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:07,744	| radiolab082114 |	Hello
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:19,776	| radiolab082114 |	What happened what she ended up becoming roommates with a dolphin one bedroom apartments
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:24,640	| radiolab082114 |	Sort of yeah she did end up living with a dolphin for for many months
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:25,408	| radiolab082114 |	In this
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:27,968	| radiolab082114 |	Buy me a
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:32,576	| radiolab082114 |	Kitchen area with
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:35,136	| radiolab082114 |	It was a little two burner stove or something
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:41,792	| radiolab082114 |	And a pot and a tea kettle but the thing that's a little bit weird about the apartment is that whole apartment was
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:43,072	| radiolab082114 |	Filled with water
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:46,656	| radiolab082114 |	It completely film well I wasn't submerged but I was in water up
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,936	| radiolab082114 |	Miss size
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:49,472	| radiolab082114 |	Is just flooded with water
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:54,336	| radiolab082114 |	Just about there she could share it with this dolphin die young male Peter
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:03:01,248	| radiolab082114 |	Peter was a 10ft long bottlenose dolphin young adolescent male and he lives there with
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:07,648	| radiolab082114 |	With Margaret and like he would you know he could swim under the desk and there's balcony
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:09,440	| radiolab082114 |	The balcony
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:14,560	| radiolab082114 |	The balcony was also flooded yeah it's really cool what was the idea of me to try and study the dolphin
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:16,096	| radiolab082114 |	To study the dolphin
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:18,144	| radiolab082114 |	And take a lot of
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:19,680	| radiolab082114 |	Extensive notes
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:21,216	| radiolab082114 |	Did you have waterproof paper
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:22,752	| radiolab082114 |	No I had a
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:23,776	| radiolab082114 |	Typewriter
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:27,872	| radiolab082114 |	Board hanging from the ceiling they also had microphones
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:30,432	| radiolab082114 |	And specifically the tasks she was given
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:33,504	| radiolab082114 |	Pacific Peter
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:34,272	| radiolab082114 |	To speak English
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:41,184	| radiolab082114 |	She was supposed to keep the dolphin English
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:42,464	| radiolab082114 |	Really well
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:44,000	| radiolab082114 |	I mean this was John Daly's
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:44,512	| radiolab082114 |	Project
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:54,240	| radiolab082114 |	Just for some context people get all like a little bit crazy these days about dolphins shirts with dolphins
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:59,104	| radiolab082114 |	Poses with dolphins in blacklight posters right so this all kind of
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:02,432	| radiolab082114 |	Sort of comes from the sky John Lilly
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:08,320	| radiolab082114 |	Who was a scientist or researcher starting in the forties total Right Stuff
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:10,880	| radiolab082114 |	Physics major kind of guy out of Caltech
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:16,768	| radiolab082114 |	Man's man according to Graham Burnett
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:17,791	| radiolab082114 |	Epiphany
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:25,727	| radiolab082114 |	During the second world war at the time people just weren't thinking that much about dolphins
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:28,287	| radiolab082114 |	In general like it was not this idea that they were sort of
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:29,567	| radiolab082114 |	Extraordinary beings
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:30,591	| radiolab082114 |	They were just like
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:31,871	| radiolab082114 |	Big dumb fish
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:33,151	| radiolab082114 |	No they were shot for sports
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:35,711	| radiolab082114 |	Regionally is doing this
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:36,991	| radiolab082114 |	Research about
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:38,015	| radiolab082114 |	Brain map
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:40,575	| radiolab082114 |	And he ends up working with dolphins
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:41,343	| radiolab082114 |	And
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:42,111	| radiolab082114 |	Bonded
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:45,183	| radiolab082114 |	The story that that he's told goes that he was
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:47,999	| radiolab082114 |	Experimenting on these dolphins and
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:49,791	| radiolab082114 |	As he's working with them you know kind of like
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:51,071	| radiolab082114 |	Shoving
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:53,119	| radiolab082114 |	Things into their brains they make
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:53,631	| radiolab082114 |	Noises
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:54,655	| radiolab082114 |	As with anyone
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:57,471	| radiolab082114 |	And when he listens back to the noises
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:58,751	| radiolab082114 |	She's recorded
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:02,079	| radiolab082114 |	It sounds to him like the Dolphins are trying
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:08,991	| radiolab082114 |	To say something to him in not in a not a dolphin e-way
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:10,783	| radiolab082114 |	But in a human
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:12,319	| radiolab082114 |	Way like trying to speak
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:13,855	| radiolab082114 |	Really
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:16,415	| radiolab082114 |	What did you say the dolphin was trying to say 2
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:18,207	| radiolab082114 |	I don't think that we know that
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:21,535	| radiolab082114 |	But it sounded to him enough like human
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:23,839	| radiolab082114 |	That he he thought like
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:25,887	| radiolab082114 |	Something's going on here this is
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:30,495	| radiolab082114 |	According to Graham he said later that
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:34,079	| radiolab082114 |	It made him realize like we are not the only intelligent organisms
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,871	| radiolab082114 |	Like we have company
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:38,431	| radiolab082114 |	That maybe humans are what happens when
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:41,503	| radiolab082114 |	High Intelligence involves in an animal that also has
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,015	| radiolab082114 |	Has hands
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:43,807	| radiolab082114 |	And dolphins
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:45,343	| radiolab082114 |	Or what happens when
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:46,367	| radiolab082114 |	Comparably
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,135	| radiolab082114 |	If not
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:48,927	| radiolab082114 |	Still more extravagant
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:49,439	| radiolab082114 |	Intelligence
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:50,719	| radiolab082114 |	Evolves
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:51,743	| radiolab082114 |	And I want without him
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:58,399	| radiolab082114 |	What do hands get you hands basically got you an appetite for punching people in the head
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:04,543	| radiolab082114 |	It makes us to users but the distance between us
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:05,823	| radiolab082114 |	You're the hammer
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:06,847	| radiolab082114 |	That you use
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:11,711	| radiolab082114 |	2 watt knock open your coconut and the hammer that used to knock open the head
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:14,271	| radiolab082114 |	That other Cro-Magnon you were never that Keen on
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:15,295	| radiolab082114 |	Is in fact
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:17,343	| radiolab082114 |	Zilch there's no difference at all
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:22,207	| radiolab082114 |	By the time get to the sixties if you know like peace and love exciting to think
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:24,767	| radiolab082114 |	The dolphins and whales
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:28,863	| radiolab082114 |	Ibiza huge Brands but they don't like they're not after
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:32,959	| radiolab082114 |	Anything I'm not doing anything with enough Turner anybody that not building cities
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:33,983	| radiolab082114 |	They're just
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:35,263	| radiolab082114 |	Like being
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:43,711	| radiolab082114 |	And keep in mind this is on the verge of the Vietnam War where you have all this anxiety about
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:46,527	| radiolab082114 |	Do the overpopulation Environmental
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:47,551	| radiolab082114 |	Construction
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:49,599	| radiolab082114 |	What are they doing
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:53,695	| radiolab082114 |	So very quickly the Dolphins become like this
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:55,999	| radiolab082114 |	Vision how we made ourselves
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:56,767	| radiolab082114 |	So Def
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:06:59,839	| radiolab082114 |	Then we come to feel
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:00,863	| radiolab082114 |	We were tragically
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:01,887	| radiolab082114 |	Stomach signs
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:05,215	| radiolab082114 |	So tell me was one of the first people to get swept up in all this
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:09,055	| radiolab082114 |	He quit his government job moves to the Caribbean and sets up this
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:11,359	| radiolab082114 |	Lab John Lilly's communication BC
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:12,127	| radiolab082114 |	Search Institute
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:13,151	| radiolab082114 |	To try to talk to dolphin
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:20,063	| radiolab082114 |	Which is where Margaret ended up and my feeling was this is everybody was talking about how bright they were and how smart they were and it was
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:20,831	| radiolab082114 |	Awesome stuff
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:22,879	| radiolab082114 |	Dolphins and then it was it was the Hot Topic
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:24,415	| radiolab082114 |	And yet every
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:27,743	| radiolab082114 |	Hey everybody at that building would get in their car and go home
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:29,279	| radiolab082114 |	Yeah
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:30,047	| radiolab082114 |	What is that
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:31,071	| radiolab082114 |	So
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:32,863	| radiolab082114 |	She volunteered to stay
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:35,423	| radiolab082114 |	Her bed was on this kind of wooden plat
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:36,703	| radiolab082114 |	Farm in the middle of the apartment
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:37,727	| radiolab082114 |	I was maybe
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:39,775	| radiolab082114 |	Two-and-a-half 3 inch
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:40,543	| radiolab082114 |	Bob's
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:41,055	| radiolab082114 |	The water
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:44,127	| radiolab082114 |	And Peter was right there and Peter could
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:46,175	| radiolab082114 |	Flip me a little water and wake me up in any
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:50,271	| radiolab082114 |	And that was the whole point of it I mean if this wasn't just sleep all night and then
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,831	| radiolab082114 |	Excuse me working today and then
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:56,671	| radiolab082114 |	Sleep again all night and then do some work in the day I might as well go home so
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:08:01,023	| radiolab082114 |	I eventually I didn't really shave my head but I buzzed it
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:03,071	| radiolab082114 |	Whatever it's called now really close
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:08,191	| radiolab082114 |	Because any you know the hair getting wet thing in the middle of the night was very annoying
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:09,983	| radiolab082114 |	Yeah of course I just got rid of hair
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:15,871	| radiolab082114 |	And and that was helpful and then when Peter with comments word some water or want to play or throw something at me
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:18,943	| radiolab082114 |	Then I could just roll off this elevator into the water and be with him
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:19,455	| radiolab082114 |	Do whatever
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:22,271	| radiolab082114 |	She says he was fascinated by the things she
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:23,295	| radiolab082114 |	She brought with her
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:24,063	| radiolab082114 |	Piece of
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:24,831	| radiolab082114 |	Sloth
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:25,855	| radiolab082114 |	A tea bag
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:28,415	| radiolab082114 |	Tea bag was a fascinating thing and I
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:29,183	| radiolab082114 |	PrankDial
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:29,695	| radiolab082114 |	20
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:33,023	| radiolab082114 |	And the tea bag would fall into the water
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:35,583	| radiolab082114 |	And he would come and get it
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:36,863	| radiolab082114 |	And
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,399	| radiolab082114 |	Sonar it
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:40,447	| radiolab082114 |	What is creaking noise they make on there
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:41,215	| radiolab082114 |	Sonar
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:42,751	| radiolab082114 |	And
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:44,543	| radiolab082114 |	Take the string oversby cancer
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:46,079	| radiolab082114 |	Women around
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:47,103	| radiolab082114 |	They probably will
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:49,663	| radiolab082114 |	Tea bag and then you throw it up
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:51,199	| radiolab082114 |	Against the wall and it was stick
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:55,551	| radiolab082114 |	And then he squirt water on it and it would come back down into the water and
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,831	| radiolab082114 |	Cuban playlist
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:58,111	| radiolab082114 |	Eventually coursehero
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:59,647	| radiolab082114 |	Would fight it is very short teeth
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:04,511	| radiolab082114 |	And that was a very exciting thing when the teabags finally broke open
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,535	| radiolab082114 |	It had babies
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:07,327	| radiolab082114 |	Billions of
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:10,911	| radiolab082114 |	Tea leaves floating around and he was so nice of them all in one
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:12,191	| radiolab082114 |	Count every single one of them
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:18,079	| radiolab082114 |	What did you think you would find out
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:20,895	| radiolab082114 |	Now
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:23,711	| radiolab082114 |	You know I was not coming out at
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:24,735	| radiolab082114 |	Cos formula science
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:28,575	| radiolab082114 |	Point of view that that's not what I was bringing to the table
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:32,415	| radiolab082114 |	Yeah I just I just I did I had no idea I
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:32,927	| radiolab082114 |	I was
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:36,255	| radiolab082114 |	Programmed by by John to work on the speech
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:44,447	| radiolab082114 |	Aeio she had sort of declared that they could probably speech
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:55,199	| radiolab082114 |	Look when your
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:10:00,063	| radiolab082114 |	Trying to have a conversation with someone
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:04,927	| radiolab082114 |	One person speaks
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:10,559	| radiolab082114 |	And then you speak and and I listen and end people sort of normally do that back and forth
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:18,239	| radiolab082114 |	When you start with a dolphin making Airborne sounds once they get the idea that's a lot of raining at those are
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:24,383	| radiolab082114 |	Every so often they want to overwrite you
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:30,527	| radiolab082114 |	I am not
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:33,599	| radiolab082114 |	So you have to
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:37,951	| radiolab082114 |	Spend a lot of time getting it down to I'm talking now
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:39,231	| radiolab082114 |	Speak now
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:39,999	| radiolab082114 |	And now it's your turn
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:45,375	| radiolab082114 |	I can see it now
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:48,447	| radiolab082114 |	Upset about something Hill over my face
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:54,847	| radiolab082114 |	Pater
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:55,871	| radiolab082114 |	Come on Peter
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:57,151	| radiolab082114 |	1
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:11:02,783	| radiolab082114 |	233
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:03,551	| radiolab082114 |	Start again
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:05,087	| radiolab082114 |	1
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:05,855	| radiolab082114 |	2
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:12,255	| radiolab082114 |	3 yes but he learned very quickly to listen to me
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:17,119	| radiolab082114 |	1 2 3 4
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:20,959	| radiolab082114 |	Babies
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:24,799	| radiolab082114 |	And not to pick up my instruction
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:30,431	| radiolab082114 |	I would say no no no Peter I don't want you to do that I want you to do
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:31,199	| radiolab082114 |	This
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:31,967	| radiolab082114 |	This
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:32,479	| radiolab082114 |	This
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:35,295	| radiolab082114 |	He would give me back this
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:36,063	| radiolab082114 |	This
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:36,575	| radiolab082114 |	This
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:39,903	| radiolab082114 |	Cartwheel off and saying no no no Polly want a cracker
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:41,951	| radiolab082114 |	They will beat the whole thing of whatever you say
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:43,743	| radiolab082114 |	Peter Woods
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:46,047	| radiolab082114 |	Would pick up what I wanted when he was
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,071	| radiolab082114 |	Being a good
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:49,631	| radiolab082114 |	And he was a good student there seem to be
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:55,519	| radiolab082114 |	Which is one dolphin anyway can't speak for all of them and interest
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:57,311	| radiolab082114 |	In in what we were doing
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:59,615	| radiolab082114 |	She wanted to practice
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:00,895	| radiolab082114 |	Does he wanted to get it right
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:07,295	| radiolab082114 |	Yeah there was a mirror and he would spend long periods of time by himself didn't want me
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:08,319	| radiolab082114 |	To be part of it
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:12,159	| radiolab082114 |	And he would practice whatever it was we have been doing
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:13,183	| radiolab082114 |	In the lesson that
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:15,487	| radiolab082114 |	Over and over and over and over
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:16,767	| radiolab082114 |	He wanted to get it right
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:28,543	| radiolab082114 |	Wouldn't work at that
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:32,639	| radiolab082114 |	For no reason he's not getting fish I'm not interacting with one another
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:33,407	| radiolab082114 |	Just once
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:34,943	| radiolab082114 |	I like doing homework like homework
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:40,319	| radiolab082114 |	And after a few months of this
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:40,831	| radiolab082114 |	1
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:43,903	| radiolab082114 |	Peter did start to sound
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:45,951	| radiolab082114 |	Really different 1/2
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:53,119	| radiolab082114 |	1 2 3
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:54,911	| radiolab082114 |	Better
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:01,567	| radiolab082114 |	Getting better
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:04,383	| radiolab082114 |	Really difficult for them
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:11,807	| radiolab082114 |	They just have a blowhole like they do not have the apparatus to relieve asses are almost impossible
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:15,391	| radiolab082114 |	I would feed him my name
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:21,791	| radiolab082114 |	And M is very hard he would eventually roll over almost into the water with the
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:24,095	| radiolab082114 |	Blowhole to Muscle Up
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:34,079	| radiolab082114 |	Hi the same really you're saying he would he would use the water as a way to help him make the sound
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:34,847	| radiolab082114 |	With that word
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:40,735	| radiolab082114 |	And
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:42,527	| radiolab082114 |	And I knew that was your name
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:45,855	| radiolab082114 |	I don't know
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:48,671	| radiolab082114 |	But nevertheless we were up
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:49,183	| radiolab082114 |	Pretty good match
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:54,815	| radiolab082114 |	I know his mood his temperament
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:56,863	| radiolab082114 |	And he and he knew mine he knew when I was sick
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:58,655	| radiolab082114 |	And I would get sick
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:01,727	| radiolab082114 |	Pioneer in the water all the time you're bound to get a cold or something
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:06,079	| radiolab082114 |	He just loved my anatomy he wanted to know what my knees were doing
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:11,711	| radiolab082114 |	He would go behind my knee and sonar and look at it and feel it and push it
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:14,783	| radiolab082114 |	And find out which way it wouldn't wouldn't go he just
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:17,343	| radiolab082114 |	And I gave him the time
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:21,439	| radiolab082114 |	Cuz I wasn't going home
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:23,999	| radiolab082114 |	To look at my knee
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:24,767	| radiolab082114 |	To look at my feet
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:27,071	| radiolab082114 |	He was enormously interested
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:30,399	| radiolab082114 |	Oddly enough in the space
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:31,423	| radiolab082114 |	Between
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:31,935	| radiolab082114 |	My fingers
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:34,495	| radiolab082114 |	Not the fingers so much
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:36,287	| radiolab082114 |	What's he would
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:36,799	| radiolab082114 |	I mean it
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:39,871	| radiolab082114 |	You don't speak to just barely sit there but he wanted
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:42,175	| radiolab082114 |	Put in between each finger.
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:42,687	| radiolab082114 |	NC
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:43,711	| radiolab082114 |	What that was all
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:45,759	| radiolab082114 |	The same with the toes
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:47,551	| radiolab082114 |	You didn't have any spaces anywhere
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:50,111	| radiolab082114 |	You know he had solid flippers
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:55,487	| radiolab082114 |	But no space in between them do you think he was so interested in your fingers and toes because
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:56,767	| radiolab082114 |	He didn't have any
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:58,047	| radiolab082114 |	Yes I do
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:04,191	| radiolab082114 |	Margaret and Peter ended up spending
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:05,727	| radiolab082114 |	About 9 months living together
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:07,519	| radiolab082114 |	But towards the end
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:09,567	| radiolab082114 |	Things kind of started
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:10,591	| radiolab082114 |	To unravel
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:11,359	| radiolab082114 |	First of all
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:12,895	| radiolab082114 |	Don't really results from this
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:14,943	| radiolab082114 |	Experiment they never were able to publish any
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:15,711	| radiolab082114 |	Scientific
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:16,479	| radiolab082114 |	Papers
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:17,247	| radiolab082114 |	And
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:19,295	| radiolab082114 |	There were other problems Lily got
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:20,831	| radiolab082114 |	Very involved in
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:21,599	| radiolab082114 |	Drugs
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:24,159	| radiolab082114 |	Especially LSD he did bring it down
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:25,183	| radiolab082114 |	He did
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:27,999	| radiolab082114 |	Give LSD
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:29,791	| radiolab082114 |	He says he did I believe him too
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:32,863	| radiolab082114 |	Two two of the dogs I would not let him give LSU to Peter I wouldn't
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:35,423	| radiolab082114 |	Why would he give them LSD well
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:40,031	| radiolab082114 |	It's not a hundred percent clear but it seems like he was trying to find
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:42,335	| radiolab082114 |	A way to get the Dolphins to open up
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:43,359	| radiolab082114 |	Connect
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:44,639	| radiolab082114 |	Maybe to talk
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:46,431	| radiolab082114 |	In any case by 19
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,711	| radiolab082114 |	5566
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:49,247	| radiolab082114 |	His funding it started
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:50,015	| radiolab082114 |	To dry up
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:51,295	| radiolab082114 |	When people heard about
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:52,063	| radiolab082114 |	Markets work
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:55,135	| radiolab082114 |	They tended to focus on like one particular
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:56,415	| radiolab082114 |	The story
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:59,231	| radiolab082114 |	You don't have to answer but a lot has been made of your
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:06,911	| radiolab082114 |	Sort of sexually engaging with Peter and I just want to ask if you don't seem like a shrinking violet I just want to ask is there anything you want to
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:07,423	| radiolab082114 |	Say about that
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:12,031	| radiolab082114 |	What would I like to say about that I think
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:15,871	| radiolab082114 |	It is The Sensational side of it is
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:17,919	| radiolab082114 |	Cheers what Margaret told me
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:19,455	| radiolab082114 |	Peter was a young dolphin
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:20,735	| radiolab082114 |	He was horny and
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:21,759	| radiolab082114 |	He would hump her leg
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:22,783	| radiolab082114 |	What kind of
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:24,319	| radiolab082114 |	A dog might do
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:25,599	| radiolab082114 |	Just getting in the way of their work
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:27,647	| radiolab082114 |	So eventually I just said the heck with it
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:29,439	| radiolab082114 |	And she use her hand to
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:34,047	| radiolab082114 |	You know and and it would quickly satisfy him and then we could go back to doing what we would do
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:37,887	| radiolab082114 |	And I I never really gave it another thought I never thought
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:40,191	| radiolab082114 |	Don't let anybody know I never thought
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:43,007	| radiolab082114 |	That shouldn't be because of details like this
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:44,287	| radiolab082114 |	Drugs
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:45,823	| radiolab082114 |	This experiment became a
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:47,103	| radiolab082114 |	Extremely controversial
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:50,431	| radiolab082114 |	Almost untouchable
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:56,831	| radiolab082114 |	People didn't want to be associated with Lily nobody wanted to fund anything that sounded like Lily
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:57,855	| radiolab082114 |	It just got this like
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:16:59,903	| radiolab082114 |	Aura of
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:04,511	| radiolab082114 |	Don't go there don't go there even people who wanted to do really rigorous
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:06,559	| radiolab082114 |	Work with human dolphin communication
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:07,583	| radiolab082114 |	Had a tough time
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:11,167	| radiolab082114 |	Getting a fun day and that lasted for a long time
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:15,519	| radiolab082114 |	The thing is
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:16,543	| radiolab082114 |	Even though there are
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:18,591	| radiolab082114 |	So many reasons to disa
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:20,383	| radiolab082114 |	Approve of this experiment
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:23,199	| radiolab082114 |	When you talk to Margaret
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:23,711	| radiolab082114 |	Champs
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:25,503	| radiolab082114 |	How much
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:27,807	| radiolab082114 |	Want to be in that apartment
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:28,319	| radiolab082114 |	What's up
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:34,463	| radiolab082114 |	He would come over and when he was in what I call his sweet mode and Peter had a lot of very very sweet moods
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:37,535	| radiolab082114 |	He would sink to the bottom
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,327	| radiolab082114 |	And take my
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:40,351	| radiolab082114 |	Foot
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:41,631	| radiolab082114 |	In his mouth
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:48,799	| radiolab082114 |	And he wasn't so narang and he wasn't looking at anything he was almost like a little kid, she just wants to hold your hand and
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:51,871	| radiolab082114 |	He would just sink to the bottom and closes eyes and just hang onto my foot
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:56,479	| radiolab082114 |	And then you have to come up and
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:59,039	| radiolab082114 |	Breathe and then you go back down
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:00,063	| radiolab082114 |	NHS
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:01,087	| radiolab082114 |	Grab my foot
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:05,951	| radiolab082114 |	And he would do this for a good while
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:14,559	| radiolab082114 |	I'll be back in a moment with another encounter
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:16,607	| radiolab082114 |	You have two new messages

EDL	00:19:57,311	00:20:00,383	| radiolab082114 |	This summer
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:01,663	| radiolab082114 |	And I request
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:05,247	| radiolab082114 |	For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:06,271	| radiolab082114 |	Aunts and uncles
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:10,879	| radiolab082114 |	Teachers were looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments of childhood brilliance
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:13,439	| radiolab082114 |	Basically I want to hear about this
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:15,487	| radiolab082114 |	When a kid you know did something
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:18,559	| radiolab082114 |	It just means you lean back and say whoa
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:19,583	| radiolab082114 |	How do they do that
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:21,631	| radiolab082114 |	Maybe it was the moment that
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:25,215	| radiolab082114 |	A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:27,775	| radiolab082114 |	Or maybe the kid was a piano
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:32,127	| radiolab082114 |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:36,735	| radiolab082114 |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:38,271	| radiolab082114 |	We're interested in the
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:40,575	| radiolab082114 |	Epic moments where
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:43,135	| radiolab082114 |	A kid does something super smart
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:44,927	| radiolab082114 |	It doesn't have anything to do with the test
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:47,231	| radiolab082114 |	If you have a story with us
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:49,279	| radiolab082114 |	Go to radiolab.org

EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:17,184	| radiolab082114 |	Or the dolphin might say
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:18,464	| radiolab082114 |	Howard Johnson
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:25,376	| radiolab082114 |	I don't know I'm glad that you know what that is exactly kind of the question of this next segment mean to dream that a human being and
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:28,192	| radiolab082114 |	Talk to a dolphin or any animal really getting their heads
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:34,336	| radiolab082114 |	Cross that Gap this is a dream that you must have had four since like forever Saint Francis of Assisi goes away by
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:36,896	| radiolab082114 |	No it's so far as dolphins are concerned
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:40,224	| radiolab082114 |	After the John Lilly situation
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:45,088	| radiolab082114 |	Researchers did get a little tepid
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:48,160	| radiolab082114 |	No
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:54,560	| radiolab082114 |	Along Came this one doctor Denise Herzing director of the wild dolphin project
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:58,144	| radiolab082114 |	Best decided to take John Lilly's experiment and flip it
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:21:59,936	| radiolab082114 |	Rather than have the Dolphins speak
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:02,240	| radiolab082114 |	English let's have the humans speak dolphin
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:06,848	| radiolab082114 |	Are the very least let's create a shared language were humans and dolphins can speak
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:10,688	| radiolab082114 |	Or at least whistle
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:12,224	| radiolab082114 |	Finding
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:13,504	| radiolab082114 |	Finding a place you
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:15,552	| radiolab082114 |	Meet back to producer Lynn Levy

EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:19,392	| radiolab082114 |	This dream of finding that meeting spot
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:23,744	| radiolab082114 |	It goes back to when she was a little girl when I was 12 years old I used to

EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:26,048	| radiolab082114 |	Through the inside
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:30,912	| radiolab082114 |	Wikipedia Britannica in the days when we had books and I would always stop at the whale and dolphin
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:35,008	| radiolab082114 |	Look at the Dolphins and go now I wonder
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:41,664	| radiolab082114 |	What their brains are like cuz they've evolved in the water we were 12 I was I was I was a total nerd in fact
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:42,688	| radiolab082114 |	I entered this
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:44,736	| radiolab082114 |	Contest in Minnesota like what would you do for the world
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:47,296	| radiolab082114 |	Do something and I actually wrote I would
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:49,344	| radiolab082114 |	Build a human animal translator so weak
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:50,112	| radiolab082114 |	I can't figure out what's going on
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:56,768	| radiolab082114 |	Am I the animal so yeah I don't know I got the bug early and here I am a fantasy about what you might learn
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:00,096	| radiolab082114 |	No I was just curious
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:03,680	| radiolab082114 |	I don't know you look in their eyes there's definitely something behind there
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:05,216	| radiolab082114 |	Don't know what it is
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:07,264	| radiolab082114 |	Fast forward many years
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:14,176	| radiolab082114 |	Denise got a bow and I went out to the Bahamas she was like if I'm going to study these dolphin I'm going to do it in the
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:18,272	| radiolab082114 |	That's where they lived so she track down a pot of wild dolphins
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:19,296	| radiolab082114 |	Yep she just
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:21,600	| radiolab082114 |	Try to blend it I actually
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:28,000	| radiolab082114 |	Anchor the boat in one spot most of the time the spot in the Bermuda Triangle in the middle of cycle of the Dalton Highway
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:31,584	| radiolab082114 |	Where Dolphins come and go they could come by if they wanted to and if they didn't
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:32,352	| radiolab082114 |	They didn't
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:34,656	| radiolab082114 |	When they would come by
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:35,936	| radiolab082114 |	She and her team would just
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:39,264	| radiolab082114 |	Flip into the water and behave ourselves to start a watch
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:41,568	| radiolab082114 |	Pay attention to who which dolphin had a
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:42,336	| radiolab082114 |	Cricket sandwich
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:45,152	| radiolab082114 |	And when they believe we'd get out and
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:48,224	| radiolab082114 |	That's really how we operated for the first 5 years and it worked 5 years
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:49,504	| radiolab082114 |	Spent five years
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:50,016	| radiolab082114 |	Just watching
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:51,808	| radiolab082114 |	Not doing anything else yes
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:57,952	| radiolab082114 |	Dentist take an enormous amount of patients sure I mean
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:00,768	| radiolab082114 |	Grabacin Pocus entradas
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:03,328	| radiolab082114 |	So they started just going about their own business
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:06,144	| radiolab082114 |	Like feeding mating nursing and tok
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:13,312	| radiolab082114 |	Or at least making a lot of noises
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:17,152	| radiolab082114 |	Which team her team would record
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:26,368	| radiolab082114 |	Wow that's all dolphins looking kind of
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:28,160	| radiolab082114 |	Squeaking sound that they make
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:38,912	| radiolab082114 |	Sounds like a whistle that are more kind of Distinction and they make sounds are like longer
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:40,960	| radiolab082114 |	Weirder and
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:45,312	| radiolab082114 |	If you have any sense that each of these sounds means something different
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:46,080	| radiolab082114 |	Well
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:49,664	| radiolab082114 |	That's exactly what we don't know I could tell you what kind of sounds are correlated
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:52,480	| radiolab082114 |	Fighting in with meeting or discipline
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:54,528	| radiolab082114 |	Find a calf what we don't know is
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:55,296	| radiolab082114 |	Are there detailed
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:58,112	| radiolab082114 |	Words and there's are more kind of encoding
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:25:03,232	| radiolab082114 |	Information but what they do know is that each Dolphins seems to have its own kind of signature with
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:04,768	| radiolab082114 |	Just basically a name
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:06,048	| radiolab082114 |	Every individual has
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:09,376	| radiolab082114 |	Peter had a name nobody has ever asked me that
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:10,400	| radiolab082114 |	Here's Margaret again
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:11,168	| radiolab082114 |	His name was
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:19,616	| radiolab082114 |	Really it is almost saying Peter here
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:25,760	| radiolab082114 |	So I can call you Lynn by your whistle and you Robert by your whistle I could be a dolphin.
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:29,856	| radiolab082114 |	Slim
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:30,368	| radiolab082114 |	Baidu
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:34,720	| radiolab082114 |	Not only that apparently Dolphins will use
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:37,280	| radiolab082114 |	The names of other Dolphins who aren't even around
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:40,096	| radiolab082114 |	Nickel talk about each other behind their backs
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:42,144	| radiolab082114 |	Yes maybe
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:43,424	| radiolab082114 |	Well that means that
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:44,704	| radiolab082114 |	There
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:47,520	| radiolab082114 |	Using representations
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:50,592	| radiolab082114 |	Things which aren't in front of them which is certainly the beginning of language
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:55,200	| radiolab082114 |	If that's what they're doing what they're doing then yeah that's kind of like
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:55,968	| radiolab082114 |	The edge of language
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:57,504	| radiolab082114 |	So you know
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:25:59,040	| radiolab082114 |	It gives us hope that there's
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:00,832	| radiolab082114 |	Probably more information going on there than
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:01,600	| radiolab082114 |	Arduino
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:02,112	| radiolab082114 |	Now
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:04,160	| radiolab082114 |	Finally
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:06,464	| radiolab082114 |	She has
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:07,488	| radiolab082114 |	That
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:08,768	| radiolab082114 |	Device
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:15,168	| radiolab082114 |	Which device can the magical you know human animal translator device
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:18,240	| radiolab082114 |	Place that she was dreaming of writing about when she was 12
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:22,336	| radiolab082114 |	She has this box that can generate dolphin noises
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:24,128	| radiolab082114 |	And it can recognize dolphin noises
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:28,480	| radiolab082114 |	And if it works the way that you know that she's dreaming it'll work
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:31,296	| radiolab082114 |	It could be the first like
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:31,808	| radiolab082114 |	Real
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:35,392	| radiolab082114 |	Two-way back and forth conversation between a human
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:39,488	| radiolab082114 |	And a wild animal
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:40,768	| radiolab082114 |	So we're looking forward to
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:43,584	| radiolab082114 |	Summer and getting out and getting more data and really exercising the Box
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:52,032	| radiolab082114 |	Getting ready so I beg my way
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:56,896	| radiolab082114 |	Everybody good seasick pills left
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:59,200	| radiolab082114 |	On July 8th from Florida
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:01,504	| radiolab082114 |	And headed for the Bahamas
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:07,904	| radiolab082114 |	To see the spot that she's been following with kind of forever most 30 years now
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:14,304	| radiolab082114 |	Photos called the RVs Donella Donella is the scientific name for the
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:20,704	| radiolab082114 |	Particular type of dolphin the spotted dolphin have you seen
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:27,104	| radiolab082114 |	Boat like a tiny boat but it's not a big boat and it was just absolute
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:33,504	| radiolab082114 |	Full human
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:39,904	| radiolab082114 |	And you got a captain first mate research assistant
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:46,304	| radiolab082114 |	Meijer's Les Mason Bethany aulier volunteers
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:52,704	| radiolab082114 |	Images of men for a long time I couldn't even figure out where everybody sleeping cuz they both seem so small is like there is not room for all these people on this phone
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:59,104	| radiolab082114 |	Stop hot soldering iron next to fridge
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:02,944	| radiolab082114 |	His name is bad starter you don't have
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:05,248	| radiolab082114 |	Like any dolphin experience before this right
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:11,648	| radiolab082114 |	Oh hell no to invented Google Glass
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:18,048	| radiolab082114 |	And I'm out here and was hungry weather to do what
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:19,072	| radiolab082114 |	He's in charge of these
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:25,472	| radiolab082114 |	These boxes with the boxes fry cost 100K at this point
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:31,872	| radiolab082114 |	Wiz when he came down to visit my lab I was telling about the two-way work in the difficulty with underwater stuff and he said
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:38,272	| radiolab082114 |	Wearable computers shouldn't be hard
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:44,672	| radiolab082114 |	Four years later what is this machine look like if you'd like one of those fancy Chrome
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:46,976	| radiolab082114 |	Toasters except you wear it on your chest
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:53,376	| radiolab082114 |	Are they silver they are silvery they have a bunch of sort of knobs and buttons and speakers on them got pre-program
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:54,400	| radiolab082114 |	Whistles in it
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:55,168	| radiolab082114 |	I can punch
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:56,192	| radiolab082114 |	Chucky and a project
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:28:58,240	| radiolab082114 |	Whistle Aid
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:28:59,264	| radiolab082114 |	It was the be
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:06,944	| radiolab082114 |	She's programmed in signature whistles of some of the Dolphins rat pellet Bijou
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:10,016	| radiolab082114 |	We made signature whistle
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:10,528	| radiolab082114 |	Ourselves
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:11,808	| radiolab082114 |	Oh
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:15,136	| radiolab082114 |	She can call their names and then go hard
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:20,512	| radiolab082114 |	That's what you think that is the idea yeah and and if they do call her name
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:24,608	| radiolab082114 |	This name that she's made for herself then the Box should be able to recognize it
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:26,400	| radiolab082114 |	And can tell her
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:28,960	| radiolab082114 |	That she's been called by name it'll actually
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:30,496	| radiolab082114 |	Say into her ear in English
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:34,080	| radiolab082114 |	Denise this is real time I call it real time sound
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:35,104	| radiolab082114 |	Ignition but it's real time
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:35,872	| radiolab082114 |	Whistle
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:36,640	| radiolab082114 |	Definition underwater
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:38,176	| radiolab082114 |	How does
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:44,832	| radiolab082114 |	If she's made up this name for herself how is it that they're going to know that that's her name
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:49,952	| radiolab082114 |	She gets into the water over and over and she says you know if equivalent of hi I'm Denise hi I'm Denise
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:54,816	| radiolab082114 |	Over and over and over and they learn it you know they developed this
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:55,840	| radiolab082114 |	Start music
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:57,376	| radiolab082114 |	Call her
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:29:59,168	| radiolab082114 |	Hope they call you
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:00,960	| radiolab082114 |	How do you release a decision
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:04,544	| radiolab082114 |	Vegas the very least
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:06,336	| radiolab082114 |	You could call their names and see how they react
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:08,640	| radiolab082114 |	Right with you that would be a Eureka moment I thought
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:09,664	| radiolab082114 |	Think if you hit
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:13,504	| radiolab082114 |	The Lolita button and Lolita suddenly
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:16,320	| radiolab082114 |	Turned and look right at you
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:17,856	| radiolab082114 |	You with a shotgun
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:18,880	| radiolab082114 |	What the heck
EDL	00:30:18,880	00:30:19,648	| radiolab082114 |	Wow that's
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:20,416	| radiolab082114 |	Even called me by my side
EDL	00:30:21,184	00:30:24,000	| radiolab082114 |	Solo hasn't happened yet it hasn't happened
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:25,280	| radiolab082114 |	Yet
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:30,912	| radiolab082114 |	And this is something I just did not appreciate for a while I was on the phone with
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:37,312	| radiolab082114 |	Why is this so hard like seems like it should be these people are so smart like this should be easy but they're just like constantly
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:43,712	| radiolab082114 |	Being defeated by the ocean basically which I the ocean is like a worthy foe but
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:50,112	| radiolab082114 |	It's like the first year to work
EDL	00:30:50,112	00:30:56,512	| radiolab082114 |	Everything broke the boxes just kept shutting down as soon as we get in the water
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:31:02,912	| radiolab082114 |	That's not good. What you want and last year that the box is working but then we couldn't find the Dolphins
EDL	00:31:02,912	00:31:06,752	| radiolab082114 |	The Dolphins just disappeared where did they go
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:12,640	| radiolab082114 |	They went a hundred miles away to another location they don't know why I kept up with my side of the other days
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:14,944	| radiolab082114 |	Your Dolphins stood you up
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:19,040	| radiolab082114 |	One of the reasons I was on the boat is it felt like everybody was thinking like
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:22,368	| radiolab082114 |	This is it this is the year we're going to go out there where
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:24,672	| radiolab082114 |	Find some dolphins and we're going to make some history
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:32,352	| radiolab082114 |	You ready
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:38,752	| radiolab082114 |	Now
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:41,312	| radiolab082114 |	Any minute now
EDL	00:31:45,408	00:31:51,808	| radiolab082114 |	Okay turns out it's not that easy to find these Dolphins they're not tagged you know they're wild dolphins so
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:58,208	| radiolab082114 |	So you just like you go to where you think they might be he stare at the water
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:32:03,328	| radiolab082114 |	And you wait
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:11,008	| radiolab082114 |	For the first three days pretty much I would we were just
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:12,288	| radiolab082114 |	Driving around
EDL	00:32:13,056	00:32:13,568	| radiolab082114 |	Game of Thrones
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:16,384	| radiolab082114 |	In circles like literally in circles
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:18,432	| radiolab082114 |	Yeah I feel like I had like a like a
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:24,064	| radiolab082114 |	5 our conversation about Game of Thrones I've never even seen an episode of Game of Thrones
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:25,856	| radiolab082114 |	Dolphins anywhere
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:33,024	| radiolab082114 |	No nothing else to do
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:39,424	| radiolab082114 |	Again
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:44,544	| radiolab082114 |	Looks like a dolphin that looks like a dolphin
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:46,592	| radiolab082114 |	I just say that I would like
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:49,664	| radiolab082114 |	Everything looks like a dolphin to me right now
EDL	00:32:49,664	00:32:50,688	| radiolab082114 |	There are days like that
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:07,328	| radiolab082114 |	Often they are right there
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:13,728	| radiolab082114 |	All the sudden out on the water with one fin to Sims 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:20,128	| radiolab082114 |	There's so many of them in there so cool standing there watching them Denis turns to me
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:23,968	| radiolab082114 |	I don't know what do you recommend it
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:28,320	| radiolab082114 |	And I was not prepared her to say that and also holding recording equipment everything
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:31,392	| radiolab082114 |	And so I just I ended up to tell me to go in like in my clothes
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:37,792	| radiolab082114 |	I like my shorts and like a bra and I'd like ice all modesty aside like a throw
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:42,400	| radiolab082114 |	Decide they're like you can go in and
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:43,680	| radiolab082114 |	Cheesecake
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:44,192	| radiolab082114 |	Ergo

EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:24,384	| radiolab082114 |	Hey I'm Jenna Cam'ron I'm Robert Kovac does Radiolab and today their shows called hello back to Lynn
EDL	00:34:24,384	00:34:30,784	| radiolab082114 |	I mean it
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:37,184	| radiolab082114 |	Poodle sensory shift the temperature change
EDL	00:34:37,184	00:34:43,584	| radiolab082114 |	Everything goes quiet it almost feels like this like classic through the looking
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:49,984	| radiolab082114 |	Last moment where are you like you go through the Looking Glass in like everybody
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:56,384	| radiolab082114 |	He's walking on the ceiling and I jumped in and they were too pretty big dolphins coming
EDL	00:34:56,384	00:35:02,784	| radiolab082114 |	Wright Patman maybe two feet from my head
EDL	00:35:02,784	00:35:09,184	| radiolab082114 |	And staring at me and I was like
EDL	00:35:09,184	00:35:15,584	| radiolab082114 |	What did you do
EDL	00:35:15,584	00:35:21,984	| radiolab082114 |	And how far were they from you oh my God
EDL	00:35:21,984	00:35:28,384	| radiolab082114 |	Like what we see you and also there they make these sort of clicking
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:34,784	| radiolab082114 |	Zonare sounds are like talking to you or just talking about you
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:41,184	| radiolab082114 |	It is so darn me looking at me with their with sounds
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:47,584	| radiolab082114 |	It was vibrating they can see not just body shape they can see your bones they can see
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:50,400	| radiolab082114 |	Cn2 you like you really feel
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:50,912	| radiolab082114 |	What that
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:53,472	| radiolab082114 |	It was heart-stopping
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:59,616	| radiolab082114 |	Whois
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:02,176	| radiolab082114 |	Oh
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:10,880	| radiolab082114 |	Put in now and I am happy
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:13,696	| radiolab082114 |	You know and everybody was like calm down
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:16,000	| radiolab082114 |	Those weren't even the right dolphins
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:18,560	| radiolab082114 |	Well those are bottlenose dolphins Denise studies
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:19,072	| radiolab082114 |	Spotted
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:27,776	| radiolab082114 |	The next day we set out again
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:34,688	| radiolab082114 |	Go for a few hours Bethany does this Dolphin Dance
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:41,088	| radiolab082114 |	And got some
EDL	00:36:41,088	00:36:44,928	| radiolab082114 |	You sound right yeah right there yeah there we go
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:51,328	| radiolab082114 |	So then everybody's like you I was like all hands on deck situation it is like strapping
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:57,728	| radiolab082114 |	Headphones
EDL	00:36:57,728	00:37:01,824	| radiolab082114 |	It's like a fire drill now I'm putting on my box
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:03,872	| radiolab082114 |	Here's the problem I'm just testing
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:04,640	| radiolab082114 |	Unlike
EDL	00:37:04,640	00:37:06,944	| radiolab082114 |	A captive dolphin wild dolphins
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:07,968	| radiolab082114 |	They have other things
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:08,992	| radiolab082114 |	They have
EDL	00:37:08,992	00:37:12,832	| radiolab082114 |	Betta fish to catch you kind of have to entice it into having a conversation
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:14,624	| radiolab082114 |	Otherwise it'll just swim away
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:16,672	| radiolab082114 |	How do you do that when you don't know what's language
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:23,840	| radiolab082114 |	Well turns out dolphins are just crazy for scarves
EDL	00:37:23,840	00:37:29,728	| radiolab082114 |	Scarf scarf they sweep it up with their tail fin and then they let it go and it wasp
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:36,128	| radiolab082114 |	Through the water and another dolphin comes up and sweep sit up with their Rostrum to the ideas use the scarf as kind of like a
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:36,640	| radiolab082114 |	Bridge
EDL	00:37:37,152	00:37:37,920	| radiolab082114 |	Denise
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:44,320	| radiolab082114 |	Another diver will get in the water with a scarf passing it back and forth
EDL	00:37:44,320	00:37:50,720	| radiolab082114 |	Human the human like hey look at this funny thing we're doing the game sometimes we'll take
EDL	00:37:50,720	00:37:54,048	| radiolab082114 |	Press the word for scarf
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:37:58,656	| radiolab082114 |	They just made up a whistle for scar
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:38:04,032	| radiolab082114 |	Ideally and this is the key the Dolphins will pick up the word and use it to ask
EDL	00:38:04,032	00:38:04,800	| radiolab082114 |	For the scarf
EDL	00:38:04,800	00:38:06,336	| radiolab082114 |	If and when they do that
EDL	00:38:08,896	00:38:11,200	| radiolab082114 |	Tiny bit of common ground that you can build on
EDL	00:38:12,736	00:38:19,136	| radiolab082114 |	Okay so you got
EDL	00:38:19,136	00:38:25,536	| radiolab082114 |	Yes we're waiting for them right we have just before they jump into nice walks another diver to the game plan
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:31,936	| radiolab082114 |	You're going to hold it and you're not going to give it to him
EDL	00:38:31,936	00:38:38,080	| radiolab082114 |	Stop it in like way better and just really get them with you moments later
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:41,152	| radiolab082114 |	Good already
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:47,552	| radiolab082114 |	Any something followed by three other drivers
EDL	00:38:47,552	00:38:53,952	| radiolab082114 |	Corn water were you in the water the sun no actually to watch the whole thing from the deck and like you can see from the store
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:56,000	| radiolab082114 |	Surface 3 or 4
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:38:57,536	| radiolab082114 |	Adolescent dolphins
EDL	00:38:57,536	00:39:03,680	| radiolab082114 |	Hey Denise is right up next one of them to the back of her head and her little snorkel
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:06,240	| radiolab082114 |	Sure
EDL	00:39:08,032	00:39:11,360	| radiolab082114 |	They're kind of like twisting around each other I will say this
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:12,896	| radiolab082114 |	She is
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:19,296	| radiolab082114 |	Tremendously grateful in the water if she gets in the water and she's like totally at home
EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:22,368	| radiolab082114 |	She might secretly be a dolphin sound like around and around
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:23,648	| radiolab082114 |	She goes on there
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:25,440	| radiolab082114 |	And what is happening under there
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:28,000	| radiolab082114 |	This is what it sounds like underwater
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:40,544	| radiolab082114 |	This is the actual sound from the scarf and stay record everything that
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:41,312	| radiolab082114 |	Go down together
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:39:57,184	| radiolab082114 |	I'm in a lot of that is the Dolphins
EDL	00:39:57,184	00:39:58,720	| radiolab082114 |	Just doing whatever they're doing
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:02,560	| radiolab082114 |	But some of it it's me with the boss making this
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:04,352	| radiolab082114 |	Scarf whistle over and over like
EDL	00:40:04,864	00:40:05,376	| radiolab082114 |	Scarf
EDL	00:40:06,144	00:40:07,168	| radiolab082114 |	Got the scarf
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:07,680	| radiolab082114 |	Yeah
EDL	00:40:08,448	00:40:10,752	| radiolab082114 |	Garf cuz she's like trying to get a dolphin to say the word
EDL	00:40:11,264	00:40:12,032	| radiolab082114 |	Right yeah
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:18,688	| radiolab082114 |	Eventually she and the Dolphins surface and
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:26,624	| radiolab082114 |	One of the Dolphins is holding the star of red
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:28,672	| radiolab082114 |	Then they all go back under
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:36,864	| radiolab082114 |	Anthony's comes back up with it
EDL	00:40:37,376	00:40:38,144	| radiolab082114 |	That's real good
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:40,192	| radiolab082114 |	Wednesday
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:44,800	| radiolab082114 |	After about a minute she surfaces
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:46,848	| radiolab082114 |	Lincoln East has it now
EDL	00:40:47,872	00:40:49,152	| radiolab082114 |	She dies one more time
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:58,368	| radiolab082114 |	A minute later dolphin has the scar
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:41:04,768	| radiolab082114 |	I just went on and on and we're passing it back and forth so fluidly that I thought maybe
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:07,584	| radiolab082114 |	The dolphin has begun to ask for the scarf by name
EDL	00:41:09,376	00:41:14,496	| radiolab082114 |	Eventually nice cap
EDL	00:41:14,496	00:41:18,592	| radiolab082114 |	And we all just heard gather around like
EDL	00:41:18,592	00:41:21,664	| radiolab082114 |	Well pick up the scarf right away
EDL	00:41:22,432	00:41:23,968	| radiolab082114 |	Play something that you whistle
EDL	00:41:23,968	00:41:29,344	| radiolab082114 |	Five piece of seaweed
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:34,464	| radiolab082114 |	Nothing that trigger the system but it looks like
EDL	00:41:37,024	00:41:38,048	| radiolab082114 |	Exhausting
EDL	00:41:38,048	00:41:39,328	| radiolab082114 |	Didn't get anything
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:42,912	| radiolab082114 |	Well I mean nothing the Box recognized as a match
EDL	00:41:43,680	00:41:46,752	| radiolab082114 |	You know nothing that indicated the dolphin like learned a word
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:50,592	| radiolab082114 |	So what's the right there
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:41:58,015	| radiolab082114 |	But
EDL	00:41:59,039	00:42:00,319	| radiolab082114 |	There was this one thing that have
EDL	00:42:01,087	00:42:02,367	| radiolab082114 |	She said that when she
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:04,415	| radiolab082114 |	Address
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:05,695	| radiolab082114 |	One of the dolphins
EDL	00:42:06,207	00:42:06,719	| radiolab082114 |	Bias
EDL	00:42:08,767	00:42:10,815	| radiolab082114 |	The dolphin turned around and looked at her
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:11,839	| radiolab082114 |	Intitle caca
EDL	00:42:11,839	00:42:12,351	| radiolab082114 |	Pitbull dog
EDL	00:42:12,863	00:42:13,375	| radiolab082114 |	Really
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:20,543	| radiolab082114 |	Wow
EDL	00:42:21,055	00:42:27,199	| radiolab082114 |	Also there was this moment where that and Celeste were looking at the data later and they saw that
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:28,735	| radiolab082114 |	Right after Denise meters
EDL	00:42:28,735	00:42:34,879	| radiolab082114 |	Signature whistle another dolphin made its signature Whistle Sweet
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:38,463	| radiolab082114 |	You mean like she said hi and it said hi back
EDL	00:42:38,463	00:42:40,255	| radiolab082114 |	Yeah that's amazing
EDL	00:42:40,255	00:42:41,791	| radiolab082114 |	Well maybe I mean
EDL	00:42:42,559	00:42:44,863	| radiolab082114 |	The thing is dolphins make their signature whistles
EDL	00:42:44,863	00:42:45,631	| radiolab082114 |	All the time
EDL	00:42:49,215	00:42:50,751	| radiolab082114 |	Or it could be this
EDL	00:42:54,591	00:42:55,103	| radiolab082114 |	Moemon
EDL	00:42:56,895	00:42:58,431	| radiolab082114 |	I mean she's a very rigorous scientist
EDL	00:42:58,431	00:42:58,943	| radiolab082114 |	Like she wants
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:00,479	| radiolab082114 |	That to happen
EDL	00:43:00,479	00:43:01,503	| radiolab082114 |	Another 30 times
EDL	00:43:02,015	00:43:02,783	| radiolab082114 |	4eva
EDL	00:43:02,783	00:43:03,551	| radiolab082114 |	I'm starting to take it
EDL	00:43:03,551	00:43:04,063	| radiolab082114 |	Seriously
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:05,087	| radiolab082114 |	But still
EDL	00:43:06,623	00:43:08,415	| radiolab082114 |	It does make you think about the possibilities
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:10,463	| radiolab082114 |	Do you want to ask
EDL	00:43:10,463	00:43:13,535	| radiolab082114 |	I don't know I want to ask everything so
EDL	00:43:15,071	00:43:16,095	| radiolab082114 |	Like what
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:23,007	| radiolab082114 |	I'd like to know what their lives are like when we're not around how do you spend your day and do they think about
EDL	00:43:24,031	00:43:24,799	| radiolab082114 |	Do they sing about
EDL	00:43:26,335	00:43:29,663	| radiolab082114 |	Think about the past I mean we know they have long-term memories you know
EDL	00:43:29,663	00:43:31,967	| radiolab082114 |	How did they remember their calves from 10 years ago
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:32,991	| radiolab082114 |	Do they think about death
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:37,855	| radiolab082114 |	Anything you'd ask your friends right
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:49,119	| radiolab082114 |	Everyone disliked
EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:53,983	| radiolab082114 |	They even get there
EDL	00:43:53,983	00:43:55,775	| radiolab082114 |	Miami will sit goals to have a Converse
EDL	00:43:56,287	00:43:58,079	| radiolab082114 |	And you can't do it this way we are
EDL	00:43:58,079	00:43:58,591	| radiolab082114 |	The wild
EDL	00:43:59,103	00:44:02,175	| radiolab082114 |	Can touch them you got very favorite whistle 35 * 1
EDL	00:44:02,687	00:44:09,087	| radiolab082114 |	Are they ever actually going to have a conversation

EDL	00:44:10,623	00:44:12,159	| radiolab082114 |	All the problems of that
EDL	00:44:12,159	00:44:12,671	| radiolab082114 |	Experiments
EDL	00:44:13,439	00:44:15,999	| radiolab082114 |	Which she was actually getting somewhere with Peter
EDL	00:44:15,999	00:44:19,839	| radiolab082114 |	Like they're actually having a real Exchange in the moment perhaps but
EDL	00:44:19,839	00:44:20,863	| radiolab082114 |	Thinking forward
EDL	00:44:21,375	00:44:22,399	| radiolab082114 |	I believe that
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:24,447	| radiolab082114 |	What you can accomplish by talking
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:26,751	| radiolab082114 |	They having a two-way conversation
EDL	00:44:28,287	00:44:29,311	| radiolab082114 |	Just infinitely greater
EDL	00:44:29,311	00:44:32,383	| radiolab082114 |	And I totally agree but if it's taking her thirty-something years
EDL	00:44:33,151	00:44:33,919	| radiolab082114 |	To get
EDL	00:44:33,919	00:44:34,431	| radiolab082114 |	2
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:37,503	| radiolab082114 |	A maybe hello
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:39,807	| radiolab082114 |	Yeah I don't even know what you got to Hallelujah and
EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:41,599	| radiolab082114 |	If all she has is a
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:42,623	| radiolab082114 |	What's the limit amount of time with
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:43,391	| radiolab082114 |	Dolphins every summer
EDL	00:44:43,903	00:44:44,927	| radiolab082114 |	And 50 more times
EDL	00:44:45,439	00:44:45,951	| radiolab082114 |	51 years old
EDL	00:44:46,719	00:44:47,487	| radiolab082114 |	God's plans
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:49,791	| radiolab082114 |	17 degrees warmer by that point
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:52,863	| radiolab082114 |	Dolphins are in a ball migrated to some other spot it just feels like
EDL	00:44:53,631	00:44:57,727	| radiolab082114 |	Just get in the pool and hold little left but the dolphin hold your foot
EDL	00:44:57,727	00:45:02,335	| radiolab082114 |	She's already got the hello going for her maybe so that's like a start
EDL	00:45:02,335	00:45:05,663	| radiolab082114 |	And then gets in 50 years should we have move past hello to

EDL	00:45:12,575	00:45:14,879	| radiolab082114 |	I would put money on a three-word sentence in 50 years
EDL	00:45:15,647	00:45:17,951	| radiolab082114 |	Question is do we ever get to the point of
