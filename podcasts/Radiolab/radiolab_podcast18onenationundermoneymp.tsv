EDL	00:00:50,944	00:00:51,712	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The very beginning
EDL	00:00:53,248	00:00:53,760	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Oh my God

EDL	00:01:12,960	00:01:15,776	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	My first question I bumped into and learning by the Supreme Court
EDL	00:01:17,568	00:01:23,968	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Was why does everybody keep talking about this thing called Commerce Clause
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:28,576	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The Commerce
EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:30,880	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Yes that had a Dazzle for you
EDL	00:01:30,880	00:01:33,184	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	No I just wanted to know what the hell is it well
EDL	00:01:33,184	00:01:37,792	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It's Article 1 Section 8 Clause 3 of The Constitution 16 words
EDL	00:01:37,792	00:01:40,608	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Two commas Congress shall have the power to regulate
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:43,168	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Commerce with foreign Nations
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:44,704	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Among the several States
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:48,032	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And with the Indian tribe the power to regulate commerce
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:54,432	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Four nations and among the several States and with the Indian tribes there are no more sexier words in the English language
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:57,504	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Better words for wooing we're never written
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:02:00,320	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That's Jamie Floyd savitsky Wilmington properly in a second
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:01,088	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Okay so
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:04,160	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Turns out that question of like what is it
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:06,720	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Is pretty easy in words
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:08,256	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	In the Constitution this a
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:11,328	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Congress has the power to regulate
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:13,120	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Commerce from one state to another
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:15,936	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Like as soon as it goes between states across state borders
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:16,960	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Besides
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:21,056	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Regulate I think there was a sigh would begin and end and that would be the other it's all good
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:22,336	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Yes
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:23,872	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	But here's the thing
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:27,456	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Within that she'll of boring
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:33,344	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Impolitely silence here is
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:35,392	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	I didn't mazing story
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:42,304	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Of a kind of cosmic power that develops from very humble beginnings to something truly extraordinary and maybe traveling
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:43,072	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	New York
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:48,192	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	A cosmic power you mean this phrase from the Constitution has had consequences
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:49,728	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That surprised you a hoe boy
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:53,568	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Oh boy here's how I've been thinking about it in the more perfect story
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:55,616	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	For me
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:59,968	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The experience I had learning by the Commerce Clause was a little bit like watching the X-Men movies
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:06,880	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Initially it was like my name is Magneto why is Magneto the head of the bad guys
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:10,464	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Was why were they follow him he has the most boring power
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:16,864	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Mega control metal OK Google like Mystique can shift into any shape she wants storm can
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:22,752	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Control lightning initially his power seem like you have the worst one
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:25,056	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Sup we start with the Commerce Clause
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:29,920	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And we asked the riddle of Magneto trying to cross the bridge getting I'm getting there
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:35,552	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	All I'm saying is that like initially I didn't understand the true deep nature of his power but then
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:44,512	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	You see the seats where he's like being attacked by a thousand policemen and he just kind of
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:51,936	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Mixed are bullets freeze in midair for a pics of a whole Bridge with lights
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:56,288	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Pointing at it and then hit you up
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:03:59,360	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	He has the best power
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:06,272	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Because the whole world is made of metal she can control the world
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:13,696	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	If we build the world a different way baby not but
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:17,024	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	In this world you say I'm Frankenstein's monster
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:22,399	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Periodic table baby periodic table baby
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:24,959	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	For me what it was like to learn about the Commerce Clause
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:29,055	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	What initially seems stupid and boring
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:35,455	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Extraordinary powerful once you understand the world in which it is situated is that mean you're about to take a
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:39,807	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	On a journey which begins with something that feels utterly trivial
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:41,343	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And ends up with being
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:42,111	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Something
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:43,647	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Enormously powerful
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:44,927	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Wow
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:48,511	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Has a question to which I simply must answer

EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:22,463	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Take a dollar bill and buy
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:26,815	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Some Sour Patch Kids or whatever dollar buys these days anywhere in America
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:28,863	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	But in the late 18th
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:30,911	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Century back all the way through
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:32,191	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	220 century
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:36,799	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Was like that no no no no no all the states have their own Banks
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:43,199	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Their own bills different sizes colors example there's a moment when South Carolina has it pretty little green South
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:45,503	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	South Carolina Bill same time Rhode Island

EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:52,159	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Square thing and if you are a South Carolinian in Rhode Island trying to buy some
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:59,583	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Carrots and potatoes let's say while you hand them your South Carolina bill
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:02,655	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Well the Rhode Islanders would look at that and say why don't know what this is
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:06,239	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Who's the trust this bank right and so they would
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:10,335	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Discount the note based on the distance
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:13,919	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	From their own home they would discount the note based on
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:16,735	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	How it looks how professionally drawn up it was
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:18,783	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	They might look at that $10 and say
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:22,111	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That's only worth 8 to me I feel horrible
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:23,903	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Horrible way to do business
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:26,975	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That sucks for the person holding the note right
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:31,327	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Until what the government decided to do is to say 8 words is one bill

EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:36,959	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	This is one of the ways God was going to pull all these
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:38,239	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Different states
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:40,799	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Together they're going to regulate the current
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:44,127	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And not just the currency itself they were going to regulate the flow
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:45,919	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Event currency
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:48,991	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And this is where the Commerce Clause comes in
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:54,623	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	This is Jamie Floyd

EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:22,271	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	No we're not other people
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:27,903	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	She says 1824 to Steamboat operators get into a thing it's a business
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:34,047	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Are you going back and forth between New York and New Jersey that you think they should be the only one allowed to do that and it makes its way as we say
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:37,887	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	All the way to the US Supreme Court
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:44,031	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Who's sitting up there will a big bad dude named John Marshall
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:50,943	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Marshall is the sort of Rambo

EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:07,583	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Did those words give Congress the power
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:09,119	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	To regulate

EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:18,335	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Is for the federal government to come in
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:19,871	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And controller
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:23,967	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Again the idea is it this is the only way for the country
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:26,783	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	To function as a unified thing
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:30,623	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	John Marshall's decision
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:31,647	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	He says
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:33,951	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	You look we have United States of America
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:39,071	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	We don't have a divided States of America or independent States of America
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:43,167	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Or New Jersey and New York existing separately
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:44,447	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	We decided
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:45,727	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	To organize
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:47,263	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	As a United States
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:48,543	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And so what
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:50,079	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	John Marshall says his beak
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:51,103	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Cause of that
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:56,479	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	There has to be a power to regulate trade between those days in amongst those days
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:57,503	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	When there are disputes
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:01,599	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Otherwise it's all going to fall apart
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:09,535	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It was at that point that the Commerce Clause
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:11,839	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Began to Glow
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:14,655	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Womb very faintly
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:23,359	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	For the next hundred years the government experiment with Commerce Clause in cases involving trade with a Native American tribe
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:25,151	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Navigation but if you want to talk about power
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:26,687	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Like real
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:27,711	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Raw
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:30,271	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Weird
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:31,295	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Penn Power
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:35,903	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That power got Unleashed at a very specific moment around 1941
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,207	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	In a wheat field
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:42,303	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Well what happened in the weekly okay well let me introduce you to
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:49,983	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	My father was a farmer I'd like to say all of his life
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:56,127	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Pride in the fact that he never he never work for another man he would tell me that
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:59,199	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Well my name is the same as my father at
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:01,503	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Roscoe Curtis filbrun
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:07,903	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	I'm a junior Roscoe filburn the time use a 5th generation farmer
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:14,303	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	In Montgomery Ohio our farm was just right next to Dayton OH
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:15,839	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	While moscow
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:17,631	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Is about 40 year old man
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:18,399	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	At this point
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:21,727	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Can we talk about 1941-42 good-looking
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:22,495	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Sturdy
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:25,823	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Fiercely independent I never worked
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:28,127	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	For another man in my life
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:30,175	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Apparently that was his motto
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:36,319	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	He would tell me that many times over the years if you had to put like Captain America with a pitchfork
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:38,623	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	This is
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:44,255	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	So Roscoe's got this far more than a hundred cows on it
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:50,655	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	He would milk cows until both of these arms when practically now catch chickens mm
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:57,055	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And a we had a very big Garden he would plant things you know light string beans lime
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:12:03,455	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Angie's sweet corn potato carrot radishes all different kinds of apples
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:09,855	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Trees are strawberries and raspberries
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:12,159	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Different kinds of Halo and of course
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:13,439	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Sweet sweet
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:17,791	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Okay set up out of the way here's what happened
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:20,095	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It's 1941
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:21,631	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Roscoe
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:25,215	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Senior my dad was out in the field I think on his tractor
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:29,311	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That day he was plowing the weed or something and
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:33,407	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Apparently must have been some guy
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,223	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	From the
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:39,551	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Department of Agriculture locally
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:43,903	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	I guess going around to various farmers in our community
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:46,719	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Wanting the farmers to answer
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:49,535	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Several pages I think of questions
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:55,167	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And this particular day this government gentleman came out into the field
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:55,935	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	You looked around
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:59,263	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And he said Roscoe
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:02,847	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Oceans you got 22 Acres
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:06,175	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	You're over your quota
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:08,479	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	He was 11.1 Acres over
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:09,503	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	What was permitted
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:12,063	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Roughly inside with the guy tells him he have to pay a fine
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:15,647	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	A really big fine
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:23,839	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	My dad looked over and he was just as sober as a judge in a courtroom on a murder case
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:26,655	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And what happened next
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:28,703	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	We change the country forever
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:34,079	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Ways that we are still literally living with but make sure to fill in the gaps here
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:37,407	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Play what you need to know about why they're they were even having this conversation
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:40,991	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And to help me with that my name is
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:45,343	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Sorry savitsky and I'm an attorney at law
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:52,255	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	An important thing to understand is that you know when our story starts with Roscoe filburn
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:58,655	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Pictures of the Great Depression is happening
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:05,055	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And the Dust Bowl
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:11,455	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And so you have a lot of people who rely on selling crops and buying crops and so wheat prices to matter of life
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:12,735	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Millions of Americans
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:19,647	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	This nation is asking for action and action now
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:26,047	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	1938 Congress in Acts was called the agricultural adjustment act to reboot
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:32,191	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The economy so the 1938 agricultural adjustment act got the federal government into the
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:34,751	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Regulating wheat
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:40,127	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Busy with the government did was they said to the farmers America we are going to give you essentially alone we're going to
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:44,223	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Guarantee you a certain minimum price
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:45,247	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	For wheat
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:48,575	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	We're going to give you X number of dollars per bushel or whatever it is
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:51,135	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That will help lift you out of poverty
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:52,671	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	In exchange for that
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:54,719	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	You have to promise US
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:57,791	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	To only grow a certain amount
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:15:00,095	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It's in the big fear was it they grew too much
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:01,119	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	There be the
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:04,703	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Flood of Supply on the wheat market prices would crash
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:11,615	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And that would be bad for everyone you know weed is sort of a collective action problem right everyone's going to sell as much weed as they can but that
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:13,407	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That means prices go down and everyone makes less
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:20,063	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	So what the government decides to do in addition to giving out loans is that they placed a cap on how much wheat a person could grow
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:21,855	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	So quote
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:22,623	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Straight up quotes
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:26,975	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That way you ensure the supply of wheat is steady and you insured
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:29,023	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That that the prices don't crash
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:32,095	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And whole reason the government could do this
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:33,887	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Regulate the entire wheat Market
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:36,191	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	What's by henredon the Commerce
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:37,983	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Colossus 16 words
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:39,007	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Basically said
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:44,895	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That when something like wheat is bought and sold and moved from one place to another one state to another cross state lines
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:48,991	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Well that's Interstate Commerce and that's something that Congress can regulate
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:57,183	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	So my father having his back to Roscoe filburn without inspector
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:15:57,951	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	On his farm
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:15:58,975	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Spectra says
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:05,887	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Look Roscoe you've grown too much weed my dad looked over and he was just as sober as a judge in a courtroom
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:07,167	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Romano murder case
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:13,567	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And what do you think he says back he says wait a minute I'm going to show you exactly how I feel about that
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:14,079	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	No
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:20,479	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That's how I feel know you government might have been a family guy she says I don't get it
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:24,319	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	I'm not I'm not have nothing to do with interstate commerce
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:25,599	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:26,367	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	This is the key
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:31,487	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Explain to the inspector that yes
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:37,631	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	According to the government quota I'm only supposed to grow about 11 acres a week and I am growing 23
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:39,423	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The next R12

EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:44,543	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	He doesn't trade the way
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:49,151	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	What's he doing with this week he uses all the wheat to feed his animals

EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:44,447	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	My my father
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:49,823	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Apparently he wasn't real crazy about that and I guess he didn't like that too much
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:52,895	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	If I'd have been 20 or 25 years old
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:58,527	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	I would have probably advised my father not to do what he did but I guess they sue the federal government
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:17:59,039	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Huh
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:06,463	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	His army was like look I'm just trying to feed my cows come on I guess it went to our core
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:07,999	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Church in Dayton Ohio
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:09,791	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That was the first and I believe
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:16,959	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That he wants round1 to Roscoe the Ohio court agreed there's no
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:23,359	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Commerce of any kind going on your unlike the original case with the boat price I believe I even remember
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:28,223	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	My sister telling me that the he came a home
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:32,319	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And he was just delighted that he did win
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:32,831	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	But then
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:40,767	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Government feels the case and of course the one that got to the Supreme Court of the United
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:41,279	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It states
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:44,351	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	He he did he lost
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:48,959	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Key lost
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:51,007	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Any decisions that I think it's fair to say
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:52,287	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Still
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:55,871	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Drives conservatives and Libertarians bonkers
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:58,431	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Either one of those things but I get it
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:00,991	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	What does Supreme Court set
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:06,111	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Is it Roscoe filburn growing that extra weed and not selling it still
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:08,671	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Counts as interstate commerce
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:11,743	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Could have that extra week causes him to not
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:14,559	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	On the market
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:19,935	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	He needs less wheat from the market in all the farmers of America did that
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:27,103	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Cannot be really bad for the market the idea is that if you need more wheat than the quota
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:28,895	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	You go on the market and buy it
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:30,687	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Even though you can grow it yourself
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:36,319	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Everyone can produce their quota and then whatever extra they need
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:38,879	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	I'm pretty soon the regulation breaks down
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:42,719	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Which means it's a government intervention in the wheat Market will have failed
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:44,767	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	You will have to
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:49,887	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Beaded our attempt to regulate this Market therefore we have to regulate even the things you don't do
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:56,799	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That is so weird it's such a mine frankly it's like
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:59,359	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	He's not doing anything
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:03,711	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	What was the term literally known Behavior this is Obamacare
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:10,879	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Getting heated over Health Care individual mandate
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:16,511	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Just explain that's a reference to Barack Obama's healthcare plan hotly-debated
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:18,559	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Couple years ago still hotly debated
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:22,911	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	What are the key ideas without plan is it in order for health care to be affordable for everyone
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:26,495	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Everyone should have to buy it so we're going to require people
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:28,031	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	To buy insurance
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:29,311	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Where else you pay a penalty
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:35,711	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Which made a lot of people mad cuz they're like hey the government force me to buy something I don't want my decision not to get Healthcare
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:36,479	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Is not
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:38,015	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Participation in interstate
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:40,063	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It's not even economic activity
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:42,367	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	I'm sitting here on my couch not buying
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:44,159	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	You sitting here
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:49,279	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	From the individual perspective that makes perfect sense but if you can out
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:51,327	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And Justice Kagan said this in court
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:56,191	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It's not so simple uninsured people are increasing
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:21:00,287	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Normal family premium Congress
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:01,823	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	$5 a year
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:12,319	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The price that everybody pays for the service
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:18,720	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Obamacare makes sense to me away but getting back to Roscoe
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:23,328	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Things you're not because you cannot know farmers and Island this is the case
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:24,864	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	In which
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:25,632	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Congress
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:29,472	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Receives a tremendous amount of power from the US Supreme Court
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:31,264	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Essentially this case
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:34,080	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It says that Congress can regulate
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:37,152	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Almost anything
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:38,688	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And that is
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:40,224	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	D single
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:42,272	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Most significant precedent
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:48,416	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	In the area of the Commerce Clause the Big Bang
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:22:01,472	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Did anyone try to raise their hand in the
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:06,080	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Camillus be like whoa if you can regulate the non behavior of this American Farmer
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:13,248	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Then that's not even a slippery slope that's like a cliff that goes right down like there's no slope to that
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:16,576	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Times editorial from November 13 1942
EDL	00:22:16,576	00:22:21,184	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Set the farmer who grows feed for consumption on his own Farm competes with Commerce
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:25,280	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Would not the housewife who makes herself address suzhou equally
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:27,584	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The net of the ruling in short seems to be
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:32,192	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The Congress can regulate every form of economic activity if it's so decide
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:35,008	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Would not the housewife who makes herself address
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:42,176	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	You so you got to say yeah it's like yeah if you make something like shoot I've my wife and I with our kids made these little like
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:46,272	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	A miniature stuffed animals for them to play with the other day are we then in violation of some
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:49,856	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Oh my God
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:55,232	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	So like what happened here essentially Robert Issa thiam
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:57,792	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The definition of Commerce
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:02,912	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Changed and is in a sneaky but it really powerful way
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:05,728	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Is now it wasn't just like the buying and selling of stuff
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:07,776	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It was the not buying and selling
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:09,568	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Yeah it was your negative
EDL	00:23:10,080	00:23:16,224	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Commercial acting all the things you don't do is a much bigger territory than the things you do do
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:17,760	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Yeah
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:18,528	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Extension of
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:23,136	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And that expansion would continue over the next few decades and it would move them just weeds
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:26,208	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	To something much deeper to like
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:29,280	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Beyond markets into the into matters
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:30,816	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The heart
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:34,400	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	You mean like people hating on each other people
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:36,448	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Trusting people being bred people
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:43,360	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	All will become clear after the break myaurora and after the break
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:49,760	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Excuse me while I get myself of this sizzling drink and settle down in my black leather couch

EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:19,072	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	You couldn't remain that way
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:20,352	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The way to work
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:28,288	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	So what is the temperature of the Commerce Clause okay so the Federal
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:31,616	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	At the time this will be the Kennedy administration and LBJ
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:38,528	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	They want to come down and places like Ollie's barbecue but their hands were sort of tied
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:44,928	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	We have this thing called the Fourteenth Amendment says no State shall deprive any person
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:51,328	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Life liberty or property without due process of law nor shall any state the night equal protection of the laws
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:56,448	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Stephanie person
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:28:57,984	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	4 written
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:28:59,776	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Basically outlaw
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:00,800	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Things like segregation
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:02,592	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Corseted work
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:06,432	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	We have another 80 plus years of Jim Crow and the reason for that
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:10,528	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Is it the Supreme Court shortly after the 14th amendment was passed
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:14,112	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Kind of neutered it not kind if they did
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:20,512	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	What they did was by insisting that we read the 14th Amendment as being targeted
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:26,912	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Only at States if you look at that sentence II says the Fourteenth Amendment says no state knost
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:33,312	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	State shall deprive any person of life liberty or property without depressive problem is is when
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:39,712	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	A restaurant owner like Ali McClung deny service to Black patrons
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:42,528	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It's not Alabama doing the damage
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:48,928	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Just private business of Alabama ordered McClung family to discriminate against black patrons they just
EDL	00:29:48,928	00:29:51,488	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	So if the 14th amendment can only get two states
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:58,656	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Hear it has no reach because there's no State action there is nothing to regulate at the state level
EDL	00:29:58,656	00:29:59,168	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	So
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:03,264	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The best decided to do
EDL	00:30:03,776	00:30:05,312	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	If that's a dating
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:07,872	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Legal gymnastics is they decided to use
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:12,736	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Commerce Clause
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:18,880	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Congress passes the most sweeping Civil Rights bill ever to be written into the law
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:23,744	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	July 2nd 1964 Congress passes

EDL	00:33:48,800	00:33:55,200	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Lays it out why the government should be allowed to use the Commerce Clause of all things to desegregate
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:34:01,344	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Napoli's operate a restaurant in Birmingham Alabama specializing in Barber
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:08,768	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	He said this is a business that sells and buys a lot of meat
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:09,536	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	1960
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:15,936	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Yeah please prices about $70,000 worth of meat 60 9680
EDL	00:34:15,936	00:34:22,336	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	$3 to be exact
EDL	00:34:22,336	00:34:25,664	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Tim Alabama
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:27,456	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Song that that plan
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:31,808	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Came from other states so did move to another state
EDL	00:34:31,808	00:34:38,208	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	In other words you think you're a local business but you're not meat is sourced from places other than
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:44,608	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	In Alabama what about your ketchup aesthetically
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:51,008	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Not mine in Alabama so even though we bought it from a local vendor that local vendor probably bought it from somebody who
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:57,408	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Bought it from somebody that they were reaching beyond what it ever been done before basically
EDL	00:34:57,408	00:35:00,480	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Gavin was basically telling them the same thing they told Roscoe Phil breath
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:02,528	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	You are not an island
EDL	00:35:06,624	00:35:09,440	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And that was only the government's first argument they had another argument
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:13,024	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That is a second then still more directly
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:14,304	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It was even more
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:15,840	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Radical
EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:17,632	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Trans racial discrimination
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:18,144	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Restaurant
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:19,424	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Interstate
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:23,264	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Which is caused by the artificial narrowing of the
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:24,032	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Supermarket
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:25,568	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Resulting from the
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:29,152	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	So here's the argument
EDL	00:35:30,176	00:35:33,760	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	If you deny black people access to restaurants and hotels
EDL	00:35:33,760	00:35:37,344	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	You are effectively shutting down interstate travel by them
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:40,672	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Imports of the country where this practice
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:41,440	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Is commonplace
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:42,720	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Entire
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:47,584	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Deep South you're limiting their ability to cross state lines and
EDL	00:35:48,352	00:35:49,376	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The central argument
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:51,168	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Suggestion is that
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:53,728	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	When you discriminate against someone
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:55,776	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	You create
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:35:57,312	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Down
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:57,824	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Stream
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:35:59,104	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Negative
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:00,640	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Commercial effects
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:03,200	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Like you create a chilling effect
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:08,064	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Because the person you're discriminating against is then less likely to travel a
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:09,088	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Across state lines
EDL	00:36:09,856	00:36:10,624	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Send money
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:11,904	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	So in effect you are
EDL	00:36:12,416	00:36:14,464	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Depressing their future
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:15,232	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Interstate commerce
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:16,512	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	If you ask
EDL	00:36:17,024	00:36:18,048	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Black people
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:19,584	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	With this experience
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:21,888	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	From this time.
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:24,448	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	They were universally say
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:27,520	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	We never left home unless
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:29,056	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Every
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:29,568	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Tire
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:31,360	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Was triple checked
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:32,128	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Every
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:34,432	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Belt was triple checked in the car
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:35,968	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Because we did not
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:40,064	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Want to have a car breakdown in a hostile southern town
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:42,112	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And get lynched
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:43,648	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Right right
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:46,720	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It is an entire system
EDL	00:36:47,232	00:36:49,536	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Of travel and commerce that's
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:50,560	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	At stake here
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:53,888	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Essentially the argument was discrimination is bad for business
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:54,912	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Is expensive
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:56,192	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:36:59,520	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Ultimately in a unanimous decision
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:00,544	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The Supreme Court
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:04,896	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Same court that 100 years earlier had basically gutted the 14th Amendment
EDL	00:37:04,896	00:37:05,664	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Supreme Court
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:07,200	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Agreed
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:12,320	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That discrimination in restaurants pose significant burdens on the quote
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:15,648	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Interstate flow of food and upon the movement of products China
EDL	00:37:19,488	00:37:21,024	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Remember that decision coming down
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:21,792	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	I'm certainly
EDL	00:37:22,304	00:37:22,816	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Where were you
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:24,352	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Pause at work
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:28,448	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Can you tell me a little bit about how you and your dad
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:31,008	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Process that decision
EDL	00:37:32,288	00:37:33,312	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Simply
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:35,616	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Heard anyone who came in after that
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:37,664	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And they were
EDL	00:37:37,664	00:37:43,296	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The very next day there was a group of local law civil rights leaders who came in and ate lunch
EDL	00:37:44,320	00:37:45,856	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	I knew some of them by
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:48,416	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Haven't seen him in the news that sort of thing
EDL	00:37:48,416	00:37:50,208	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	They were not our regular customers
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:51,488	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Orlando actor
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:52,512	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Franklin

EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:57,120	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Celebrated our what even want to say
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:59,680	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Tested I don't know what the motive was because I came in late lunch
EDL	00:38:00,704	00:38:01,472	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	They got served
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:02,240	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It's like anybody else
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:05,312	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	They came in and it was fine
EDL	00:38:06,592	00:38:09,152	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The law was recited seoul
EDL	00:38:09,152	00:38:09,920	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That was it
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:11,200	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	With a tent
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:14,272	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	No
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:18,112	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	I don't know why Tricia was waiting on those
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:19,392	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	She was a little
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:20,928	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Answer about it
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:23,232	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And it was at this way just to see a black woman yes
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:25,792	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It was now but she was
EDL	00:38:27,072	00:38:29,632	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Like most my employees been there a very long time
EDL	00:38:29,632	00:38:30,144	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Panda
EDL	00:38:30,912	00:38:31,680	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Have never
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:33,216	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Served other black folks
EDL	00:38:34,496	00:38:36,288	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	In a sit-down situation and
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:38,080	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And Quest
EDL	00:38:38,848	00:38:39,872	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It was surreal
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:40,384	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Little bit
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:43,456	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Say upsetting but
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:46,528	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Different cute little hesitant at first sight
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:49,088	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	What's the right hand side of abdomen
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:50,880	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	She didn't we didn't
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:52,672	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That was not a problem
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:58,304	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	After the ruling it's not as if a lot of Black customers 70/30 coming into Ali's BBQ
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:38:58,816	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	They didn't
EDL	00:38:59,840	00:39:02,144	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	A guy named Nathan Turner Jr put it

EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:09,056	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Just a fact of olive
EDL	00:39:09,056	00:39:10,080	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Pushed it that far
EDL	00:39:10,848	00:39:11,616	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	To take it to the
EDL	00:39:11,616	00:39:12,384	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Supreme Court
EDL	00:39:13,152	00:39:14,432	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It left a bad taste
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:15,968	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Pun intended
EDL	00:39:16,992	00:39:19,040	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	In the mouth of a lot of black
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:19,808	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	People in Burma
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:23,904	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	In-N-Out 53 years later
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:26,976	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	How do you think about that Supreme Court decision
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:29,536	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Well
EDL	00:39:30,304	00:39:33,888	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	You're at if you're asking about segregation that's one thing we asked about Supreme Court and
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:37,728	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Seasoning on the Commerce Clause I still disagree with
EDL	00:39:39,264	00:39:41,056	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Let me put it real
EDL	00:39:41,056	00:39:42,080	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Real succinctly
EDL	00:39:43,360	00:39:44,128	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	I think
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:46,176	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	What you had
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:47,456	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And that
EDL	00:39:47,456	00:39:47,968	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Decision
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:50,016	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Was it rather than
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:51,296	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Can affect my
EDL	00:39:51,296	00:39:52,064	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Civics
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:53,600	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Correct but I don't know
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:57,184	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It rather than three-quarters of the Congress
EDL	00:39:58,720	00:40:02,304	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And 3/5 of the states I believe it is having two
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:04,096	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Or maybe 2/3 Carlos whatever it is
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:06,400	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Having to vote to
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:08,704	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Repeal an amendment to the car
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:09,216	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Constitution
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:13,824	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	You had basically 9 appointees who repeal the 10th Amendment
EDL	00:40:14,592	00:40:15,104	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Constitution
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:18,432	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The Tenth Amendment basically says that the powers not given to the feds
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:19,712	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Are reserved
EDL	00:40:20,224	00:40:20,992	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The states
EDL	00:40:20,992	00:40:21,760	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	For the people
EDL	00:40:21,760	00:40:23,040	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That's about as succinct as I can
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:26,624	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Would you understand how this is going to sound to a lot of our listeners
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:30,208	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	I mean that you are making a states rights argument
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:33,024	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	As a not-so-veiled weight
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:34,048	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	To continue to discriminate
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:36,096	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	They're really in the end this is not about
EDL	00:40:36,096	00:40:38,656	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	States rights I think that's going to I was going to sound to a lot of people
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:41,728	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Well it may very well but it's not the case
EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:45,056	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Was there segregation yes
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:48,640	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Where we going to voluntarily
EDL	00:40:50,176	00:40:50,944	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And that
EDL	00:40:51,456	00:40:52,480	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Probably not
EDL	00:40:52,992	00:40:55,296	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Would we go back and reinstate if we could
EDL	00:40:55,296	00:40:56,064	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	No apps
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:40:56,576	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Not
EDL	00:40:57,344	00:40:58,112	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	But
EDL	00:40:58,112	00:40:58,624	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The
EDL	00:40:59,904	00:41:01,696	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Issue that you're talkin about with the
EDL	00:41:03,232	00:41:04,256	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Commerce Clause in the
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:06,048	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Constitutional
EDL	00:41:06,048	00:41:06,560	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Issue
EDL	00:41:07,072	00:41:08,352	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Are still just what I said
EDL	00:41:10,912	00:41:15,520	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	So you still believe 53 years later that the Supreme Court got it wrong that they should have never
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:19,360	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Use the Commerce Clause to make you desegregate Ali
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:21,408	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Yep that is correct
EDL	00:41:22,432	00:41:26,016	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	But don't hear me say that I don't want to go back to have segregation again
EDL	00:41:26,016	00:41:26,784	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That's
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:27,552	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Separate issue
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:29,856	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	But is it separate I guess is my question you know
EDL	00:41:30,368	00:41:31,136	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	My God grant you
EDL	00:41:31,648	00:41:33,184	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	If you think of it in the abstract
EDL	00:41:34,208	00:41:35,744	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Federal government being able
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:36,512	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	How to regulate
EDL	00:41:37,024	00:41:38,048	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Commerce across
EDL	00:41:38,048	00:41:39,328	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	All boundaries
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:41,376	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Is an enormous power
EDL	00:41:42,144	00:41:45,984	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And he could be a scary power so I grant you that at the same time
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:47,776	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	You have a Civil Rights Act
EDL	00:41:48,544	00:41:49,312	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That
EDL	00:41:50,080	00:41:52,128	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It speaks to a different amendment in the Constitution
EDL	00:41:52,128	00:41:57,247	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Egyptian writing that you and your father were not willing to follow so how is the government going to get you to
EDL	00:41:57,759	00:41:58,527	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	To pay attention
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:41:59,295	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And again line
EDL	00:42:00,063	00:42:01,599	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	They've got to use the Commerce Clause
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:03,135	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	So on some level isn't it
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:04,671	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Isn't
EDL	00:42:04,671	00:42:05,183	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Power
EDL	00:42:05,695	00:42:06,207	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Present
EDL	00:42:06,975	00:42:08,255	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Because the other principles
EDL	00:42:08,767	00:42:11,327	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It would otherwise regulate your Behaviour
EDL	00:42:11,327	00:42:11,839	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Just aren't working
EDL	00:42:14,143	00:42:14,911	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That's the point
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:16,703	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Choose which
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:19,519	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Which is the priority
EDL	00:42:20,287	00:42:20,799	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Basically
EDL	00:42:22,847	00:42:24,639	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	I understand that you would which is the priority
EDL	00:42:25,407	00:42:26,175	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	I will
EDL	00:42:26,175	00:42:27,967	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Which is the priority of
EDL	00:42:28,991	00:42:30,015	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Those amendments
EDL	00:42:31,551	00:42:34,111	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Until for you the 10th Amendment that grants states rights
EDL	00:42:34,623	00:42:36,159	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	For everything. Enumerated
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:37,183	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Outweighs
EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:38,975	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The Dignity of black people
EDL	00:42:39,743	00:42:40,511	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	No
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:42,303	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	No
EDL	00:42:42,303	00:42:44,095	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Will put so say to me differently then
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:45,631	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Well
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:49,471	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The 10th Amendment
EDL	00:42:50,495	00:42:51,263	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Lieutenant
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:52,031	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The states
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:56,639	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The Fourth Amendment yes
EDL	00:42:56,639	00:42:58,175	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	An agreement to take the 14th amend
EDL	00:42:58,175	00:42:58,687	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Guess
EDL	00:42:59,199	00:43:00,223	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	People rights
EDL	00:43:00,735	00:43:01,503	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Everyone rides
EDL	00:43:02,271	00:43:03,807	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	But here's the thing about rights
EDL	00:43:05,087	00:43:07,903	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It's kind of like the first law of thermodynamics
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:09,439	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	There's only
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:13,279	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And people don't realize this a lot of times they only so many rights
EDL	00:43:13,791	00:43:15,327	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Only a finite number rights
EDL	00:43:16,095	00:43:17,375	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	If you take some
EDL	00:43:18,655	00:43:19,935	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Give something to someone
EDL	00:43:19,935	00:43:22,239	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	They come from someone else or somewhere
EDL	00:43:23,519	00:43:24,031	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Now
EDL	00:43:24,799	00:43:26,079	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It's very well to say that
EDL	00:43:28,383	00:43:29,919	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The end of segregation
EDL	00:43:29,919	00:43:31,199	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Was a higher
EDL	00:43:31,199	00:43:31,711	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Right
EDL	00:43:32,991	00:43:34,015	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And more importantly
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:35,807	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Then
EDL	00:43:37,343	00:43:39,391	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	They misuse of the Commerce Clause
EDL	00:43:39,903	00:43:40,927	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Whatever you want to say
EDL	00:43:42,207	00:43:44,511	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	But you're still a balance and just
EDL	00:43:45,023	00:43:45,791	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Which one you
EDL	00:43:46,815	00:43:48,095	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Think it's most important
EDL	00:43:49,375	00:43:51,935	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Today's products become a zero-sum
EDL	00:43:58,335	00:43:59,871	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Bali's basic point
EDL	00:44:00,383	00:44:02,175	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	We talked about this for another hour
EDL	00:44:02,175	00:44:04,479	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Was it in achieving desegregation that
EDL	00:44:05,759	00:44:06,527	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	By the way
EDL	00:44:07,295	00:44:08,319	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Civil Rights Act
EDL	00:44:08,319	00:44:10,111	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	54 dramatically alter
EDL	00:44:10,111	00:44:12,671	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Without the desegregated huge parts of the South
EDL	00:44:12,671	00:44:14,207	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	By doing it that way
EDL	00:44:14,207	00:44:14,975	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Says with the converse
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:17,791	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Something was sacked
EDL	00:44:17,791	00:44:20,607	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Feisty calls it a zero-sum I wouldn't call it that
EDL	00:44:20,607	00:44:21,631	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	I don't think most people
EDL	00:44:22,143	00:44:22,655	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Call it that
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:24,959	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Treating people with dignity
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:26,751	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Quality is a net win
EDL	00:44:28,287	00:44:28,799	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	.
EDL	00:44:31,871	00:44:32,383	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	But
EDL	00:44:33,151	00:44:34,431	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It is legitimately strange
EDL	00:44:36,479	00:44:38,271	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Did the government had to take such
EDL	00:44:38,271	00:44:40,831	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Around about ass-backward way
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:42,367	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	To fix this
EDL	00:44:43,647	00:44:45,183	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	To fix this grave Injustice
EDL	00:44:45,183	00:44:47,743	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	What what what you would think would be the obvious
EDL	00:44:47,743	00:44:50,815	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That you would go right to those civil rights
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:52,863	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Parts of the Constitution
EDL	00:44:52,863	00:44:58,751	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It was weird is it we have the 14th Amendment and yet we go to the
EDL	00:44:58,751	00:45:00,287	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Commerce clause for something
EDL	00:45:00,799	00:45:06,175	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That is so clearly stated in one of the amendments
EDL	00:45:07,711	00:45:10,271	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Search Jamie Floyd Again by the way
EDL	00:45:10,783	00:45:12,831	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The lawyers in those cases
EDL	00:45:12,831	00:45:14,623	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Is that what they wanted to win
EDL	00:45:15,135	00:45:19,231	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	They wanted to win more than they wanted to make a social statement about
EDL	00:45:19,231	00:45:23,583	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Equal justice equal rights the 14th Amendment I mean those things matter
EDL	00:45:24,095	00:45:26,399	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Most of all they wanted to win
EDL	00:45:26,399	00:45:29,215	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	They wanted to shut down discrimination
EDL	00:45:29,215	00:45:35,615	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Athos lunch counters and if Congress could shut them down or require them to open their doors to all them
EDL	00:45:35,615	00:45:36,895	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Americans using
EDL	00:45:36,895	00:45:38,175	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Those 16 words
EDL	00:45:38,943	00:45:39,711	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	I'm okay with that
EDL	00:45:40,223	00:45:41,759	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:45:41,759	00:45:45,343	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	No I mean obviously the if the ends do justify the means in that case
EDL	00:45:45,855	00:45:50,975	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	But it does make you if you should have put that case and the weak case in your mind as a kind of split screen
EDL	00:45:52,511	00:45:53,023	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It's
EDL	00:45:53,535	00:45:56,863	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It's a little strange because I do think okay we have
EDL	00:45:56,863	00:45:58,399	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	I didn't mean it I said it
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:46:00,191	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Hopefully we're Americans with principles
EDL	00:46:00,191	00:46:03,263	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Does it matter you know that we believe in equality believe in racial
EDL	00:46:03,263	00:46:03,775	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Call Justice
EDL	00:46:05,055	00:46:06,335	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	But really we just believe in money
EDL	00:46:07,615	00:46:10,431	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And we can do all the other stuff by bootstrapping it
EDL	00:46:11,199	00:46:11,711	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	E-commerce
EDL	00:46:12,479	00:46:14,271	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	But somehow as as pure principles
EDL	00:46:14,783	00:46:18,623	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Play what don't have teeth while it's deeply troubling that we have to use
EDL	00:46:18,623	00:46:20,927	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Commerce to achieve our
EDL	00:46:20,927	00:46:21,695	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Higher values
EDL	00:46:22,719	00:46:23,999	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That is weird to me that is
EDL	00:46:24,511	00:46:25,279	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Fundamentally weird
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:27,327	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It's kind of cynical
EDL	00:46:27,327	00:46:28,863	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Well yeah I mean
EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:30,143	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	I
EDL	00:46:30,143	00:46:31,935	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	You are right we are
EDL	00:46:31,935	00:46:34,239	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	At least in large part about
EDL	00:46:34,239	00:46:35,007	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Commerce in the sky
EDL	00:46:35,775	00:46:37,823	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	But if that's who we are
EDL	00:46:37,823	00:46:41,407	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Then we should embrace it and use it to our advantage
EDL	00:46:42,431	00:46:46,527	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And if we can use it to our advantage perhaps it does take us
EDL	00:46:46,527	00:46:47,807	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Two are higher princess
EDL	00:46:48,575	00:46:51,391	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	How to understand why it's not all bad
EDL	00:46:52,415	00:46:58,815	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	What if Jamie's points actually thought it was that
EDL	00:46:58,815	00:47:00,095	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Legislating morality
EDL	00:47:01,119	00:47:03,167	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Fletchling what is good and what is bad
EDL	00:47:03,935	00:47:04,959	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Doesn't always go well
EDL	00:47:06,239	00:47:08,031	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Cuz we very often don't agree
EDL	00:47:09,823	00:47:13,919	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Galaxy there been times where people kept slaves and thought that was
EDL	00:47:14,431	00:47:17,503	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That was right
EDL	00:47:17,503	00:47:22,111	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	400 years you had the 14th amendment in place but it couldn't solve all these barbecue
EDL	00:47:23,391	00:47:24,415	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And here was a way
EDL	00:47:25,695	00:47:30,303	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	For the government without going at the moral questions head-on
EDL	00:47:31,583	00:47:37,983	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Government can reach its hand all the way into the barbecue joints in the hotels in the restaurants and the houses and now the cake shops of America
EDL	00:47:37,983	00:47:41,567	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Reached an all the way down into the local
EDL	00:47:43,359	00:47:47,199	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And it was because of this increasingly expensive idea of Commerce
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:51,295	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That was now no longer the buying and selling of things or the knot
EDL	00:47:51,295	00:47:53,087	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Buying and selling of things it was now
EDL	00:47:53,599	00:47:54,879	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Any Behavior
EDL	00:47:56,159	00:47:57,951	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	They could create a kind of butterfly
EDL	00:47:59,999	00:48:01,279	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That might one
EDL	00:48:02,047	00:48:03,839	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Day many steps Downstream
EDL	00:48:04,607	00:48:06,399	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Have a future effect
EDL	00:48:06,399	00:48:08,447	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	On the buying and selling of things
EDL	00:48:10,239	00:48:13,311	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Has right his case
EDL	00:48:13,311	00:48:14,335	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That was a massive shift
EDL	00:48:16,895	00:48:23,295	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It shifted totally the federal government's role Beyond business even if you
EDL	00:48:23,295	00:48:25,087	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	You think it's good then that's fine
EDL	00:48:25,855	00:48:27,135	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And it's for the better
EDL	00:48:27,135	00:48:29,439	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	But just asked me realize that it was a
EDL	00:48:30,207	00:48:31,743	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	MasterChef from
EDL	00:48:31,743	00:48:33,535	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The way
EDL	00:48:33,535	00:48:36,095	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The country been up before that time
EDL	00:48:43,007	00:48:46,079	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	After the McClung case James Chen says
EDL	00:48:46,079	00:48:48,127	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Service governments use
EDL	00:48:48,127	00:48:54,527	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Of the Commerce Clause pretty much when Y no real limit
EDL	00:48:54,527	00:49:00,927	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Begin wave those 16 word sort of like a magic want to pass laws on everything
EDL	00:49:00,927	00:49:07,327	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Fair labor standards to schedule drugs
EDL	00:49:07,327	00:49:13,727	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	68 guns Justice for victims of trafficking Act

EDL	00:49:26,527	00:49:29,855	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Even had to make the argument itself
EDL	00:49:30,367	00:49:32,159	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	What's the government even has to defend itself
EDL	00:49:32,671	00:49:39,071	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	James Chen says there were times when the government would pass a law it get taken to court in the government would basically
EDL	00:49:39,071	00:49:39,839	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Not show up
EDL	00:49:40,351	00:49:45,215	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And he would still with the government even has to argue
EDL	00:49:46,751	00:49:50,591	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	So you can see the McClung case as sort of a second big bang but then
EDL	00:49:52,127	00:49:53,151	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	You get to the midnight
EDL	00:49:55,199	00:50:00,575	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	At this point 1994 U of a democratic President Bill Clinton Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress
EDL	00:50:01,087	00:50:01,599	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And
EDL	00:50:02,111	00:50:03,135	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Together they pass
EDL	00:50:03,647	00:50:04,927	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The violence against women act
EDL	00:50:04,927	00:50:06,719	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Today is the first day of

EDL	00:50:19,007	00:50:20,799	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	This is an important day
EDL	00:50:20,799	00:50:27,199	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	The Act was service sweeping rethink of the federal government's role in trying to prevent violence against with

EDL	00:50:29,759	00:50:36,159	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Of violent crimes against women prosecution's it allowed women to sue their alleged attackers in federal court
EDL	00:50:36,159	00:50:37,183	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	We had to take
EDL	00:50:37,695	00:50:44,095	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Responsibility domestic violence is now the number one health risk for women between the ages of 15 and 44 in

EDL	00:50:44,863	00:50:49,471	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And the law was hinged on the Commerce Clause same essential argument is in the barbecue
EDL	00:50:51,519	00:50:57,151	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That same fault my name is Christy brzonkala I'm 19 years old

EDL	00:51:10,207	00:51:16,607	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	These two football players she alleged had raped her repeatedly on a single night in 1994
EDL	00:51:16,607	00:51:19,167	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	She went to the local campus authorities

EDL	00:51:35,295	00:51:36,319	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Ultimately decides

EDL	00:51:41,951	00:51:42,463	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And the case
EDL	00:51:43,999	00:51:45,535	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Ultimately makes it to the Supreme Court
EDL	00:51:47,327	00:51:52,703	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Will hear arguments number 99 5 Christy brzonkala vs Antonio Morrison
EDL	00:51:53,215	00:51:59,359	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	When Christie's case got to Supreme Court her lawyer made the same argument
EDL	00:51:59,359	00:52:03,199	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	About women that the government is made in the Ollie's barbecue case about black people
EDL	00:52:03,967	00:52:05,247	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	That discrimination
EDL	00:52:05,247	00:52:06,783	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Or in this case outright violin

EDL	00:52:31,871	00:52:36,223	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	And again the court was given tons of evidence about the economic effects
EDL	00:52:36,735	00:52:38,271	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Congress heard from women
EDL	00:52:38,271	00:52:41,599	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Whose batter is kept their partners for morphine
EDL	00:52:41,599	00:52:47,999	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Every year this cost the country billions of dollars and that economic Downstream effect was not hard
EDL	00:52:47,999	00:52:48,767	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	How to prove in this case
EDL	00:52:49,535	00:52:53,375	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	She dropped out if you ever get it right it's not just her

EDL	00:52:59,775	00:53:03,103	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Yarygin what's happening in a very different time in the country very different mood
EDL	00:53:03,871	00:53:06,943	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	In front of an increasingly conservative Supreme Court
EDL	00:53:09,247	00:53:15,647	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	It just wasn't buying it anymore and Arbors on Carla's complaint alleges that she was the victim of a

EDL	00:53:22,047	00:53:28,447	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Justice could fail to provide her a remedy for Morrison's conduct but gender motivated crimes
EDL	00:53:28,447	00:53:34,847	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Economic activity
EDL	00:53:34,847	00:53:39,455	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Another word for very sorry for what may have happened to Christine broccolibutt
EDL	00:53:39,967	00:53:46,367	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	This is not Commerce this is violence suggestion was at least in the Ali's case there was
EDL	00:53:46,367	00:53:52,767	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Something bought sold in here they felt like I was too thin
EDL	00:53:52,767	00:53:58,143	| radiolab_podcast18onenationundermoneymp |	Accordingly reject the argument that Congress May regulate non-economic violence coming all time.
