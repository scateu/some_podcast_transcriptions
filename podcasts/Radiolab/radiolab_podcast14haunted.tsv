EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:37,344	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	So

EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:06,016	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Vons or so after my mom died my dad found out he had stage 4 prostate cancer
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:12,160	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	And he was really too sick to take care of the house and just be the guy by himself at that point
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:16,000	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Now that's pretty much had to come home I take care of him

EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:39,871	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	At night
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:42,943	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	I would have these dreams where
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:49,855	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	My parents just kind of came through the back door and it was just like a what are you doing here
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:56,255	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Oh that's right your your dad and then I would turn my
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:58,559	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	My back and then
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:00,351	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	They would have
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:01,119	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Somehow
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:03,423	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Undone all of the things that I did
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:05,983	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	All they had brought the house back to where it what
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:08,031	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	State it was in when they were alive
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:14,431	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	And I probably had this dream I'm not kidding like at least a hundred times wow
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:18,527	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Night after night after night just kept going on and on and
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:20,063	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Ultimately kind of
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:26,719	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Drove me crazy until one day after yet another one of these dreams Dennis is finally like
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:27,743	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	All right
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:28,767	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	I'm selling it
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:31,583	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Put it up in the markets waiting for a buyer
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:32,863	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	And then
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:34,143	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Something
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:35,167	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Strange happens
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:37,983	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Well something kind of strange I made this
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:44,383	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Friend and she came over for the first time
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:50,783	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Lady friend on a date you taking her back to your house and so
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:52,831	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Improvements until she was in
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:55,135	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	The kitchen right by the basement door in the kitchen
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:59,231	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	When she was like there's some kind of weird presents here
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:05,631	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	And I was just like okay well that was kind of sign that was not going to last.
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:11,775	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Fast forward a few years didn't really think too much about it until one day Dennis's realtor is having an open house
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:15,359	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	No one shows so she was in the house by yourself and then it starts getting these
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:20,479	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Text messages from her dude your house is haunted
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:21,503	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Like I can hear people
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:24,063	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Walking around and
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:25,343	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	She texted that there was
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:31,743	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Definitely something weird going on right by the basement door that's the same spot
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:33,535	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	That's that's kind of weird
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:38,399	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	But then here's the crazy thing called friend is in Eastlake
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:41,983	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Hey funny thing to different people two separate occasions
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:43,007	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	They come over to the house
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:45,567	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	And they said they felt this weird
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:51,967	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Presents and she was like wait right by the basement door get out

EDL	00:08:55,551	00:09:00,159	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	To say they feel this weird presents consider yourself a bit of a skeptic about such things
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:04,767	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	I would say so rashly I'm just going to say no
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:08,351	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	So you don't believe in ghosts no all right what happened next
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:10,399	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	This also having to be right at the time that I
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:15,519	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Sold the house Dennis to finally put the pen to paper signed the contract packed up all stuff
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:21,151	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	And so Carla the girl that first felt this thing because he went on a date with think they stay friends
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:22,687	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Sad to me like

EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:42,047	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	We both saw
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:43,583	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	A woman looking out the window
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:46,399	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	So what did she look like
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:48,959	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	I didn't really see what you look like

EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:56,895	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Dennis was like whatever
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:11:02,783	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	They set up cameras the basement in the kitchen in the clairvoyants had they wanted to try to talk
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:03,807	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	To this woman
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:05,599	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Any other scared in the house
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:12,511	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Tell Brittany she's like the ringleader of the night she sort of explained how she does things
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:14,815	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Things you know she was like the best way
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:21,215	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	That she could get them to talk to to to them was through flashlights
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:24,031	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	What to do if they take a few flashlights turn him on
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:26,079	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Enemy unscrew the tops of them
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:26,591	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Juice
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:28,895	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	So that they turn off
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:32,479	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Let me just kind of set the flashlights that better now off
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:34,271	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	In the room by themselves
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:35,807	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	The idea is that if
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:38,623	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Ghost of the spirit wants to communicate
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,647	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Distorted
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:42,719	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Touch the top of one of the flashlights with their dosti finger
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:49,887	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	And I'll turn it back on
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:53,215	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	It's not that you are
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:54,495	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	And I was like okay
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:57,823	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	So she took three flashlights
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:12:01,151	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	And we all sat in this dark room in a circle
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:07,551	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Okay and precept flashlights in the middle of circle by themselves
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:11,647	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	And she says Brittany
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:14,975	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	I love to be able to talk with you
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:18,815	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Can you turn on the lights on
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:22,399	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	And reset their me sit there

EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:27,775	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Then all the sudden this light

EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:34,687	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	And then she said okay
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:35,455	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Thank you
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:36,735	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Please turn it off
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:39,295	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	I'm going to goes off
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:44,927	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	What we can do with these lights here is if I can ask her then she says we have three
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:47,231	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Lights you're the one you just turned on will call you us
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:52,095	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Please turn on one more and that will be no
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:55,423	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	And then a
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:56,959	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Second light comes on
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:13:03,871	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	No way any the room like looking for somebody who has like a little switch or something
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:10,271	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	These people so they have no reason to fake this I suppose but now I just keep thinking well
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:12,063	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Houses close to the
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:17,183	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Train tracks that maybe maybe the train vibrations of the train
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:21,535	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	But all the sudden they were like
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:24,607	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Can you hear that
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:27,423	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Footsteps
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:35,103	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	And they're going towards the kitchen
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:40,479	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	And I can hear
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:45,599	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Dishes rattling on the countertop in the kitchen
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:47,647	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	No one's in the kitchen no one's in the kitchen
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:51,743	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	If you're in the kitchen right now can you turn one of these lights on
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:55,327	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Teresa didn't stare at these three flashlights
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:02,495	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Then
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:10,431	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	I'm leaving the room what happened

EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:27,232	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	I'll probably never set foot in this house again.
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:33,120	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	I don't want you to stay here and feel
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:35,936	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	When you belong here I want you to Clearwater Beach
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:37,216	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Free
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:41,824	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Can you
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:44,896	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Coco's house
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:11,264	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	I am going to
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:12,544	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Recognize
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:18,432	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	The Haunting my dreams a lot
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:23,296	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	That's very important to you
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:23,200	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	That's where it ends
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:33,696	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	That's how I Call of Duty
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:34,976	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Exactly like that
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:37,024	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	And
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:40,352	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Yeah kind of teared up
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:46,752	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Keep in mind that this was the first time that didn't heard this tape and so
EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:48,544	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	He played it back to him
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:50,848	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Cuz we just wanted to see you like
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:55,968	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	How we remember that experience I guess part of part of part of my fear
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:59,040	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	I'll listen to it was that it would change it
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:02,368	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	And that it would be a different
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:05,696	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Experience it would be a little more hokey and it would be a little more
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:08,768	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Unclear what was happening but
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:10,304	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Listen to it again
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:12,352	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Yeah it was
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:13,888	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	As I recall it being
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:16,704	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Sonia does he believe he was
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:17,984	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Actually talking to his
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:18,496	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Dead parents
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:21,824	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	No
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:24,384	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	No I ended up actually
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:26,944	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Calling this guy who explained to me
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:29,248	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	How this whole flashlight thing
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:30,528	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Works and that there is
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:33,856	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	A perfectly non paranormal explanation
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:40,512	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	As to what's going on with the flashlight almost Goes Bad Manners at this point to have a pact with me but I'm very curious to hear it
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:45,120	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	What's going on is you turn the flashlight on
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:48,704	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	When you turn the flashlight on the bulb gets really hot
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:51,520	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	When you take the top of the flashlight and you unscrew it
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:54,080	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Just like enough that the flashlight flickers off
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:55,872	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Flashlight off
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:27:02,784	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	And the bulb it got really hot to the inside of the flashlight also got really hot and there's this little piece of plastic inside the Flash
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:05,088	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Flashlight it when it got hot it expanded
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:11,744	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	And now is the flooding since the flashlight off that piece of plastic it starts to cool down and starts the contraction we can track
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:13,536	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	He pushes these two
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:15,328	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Tiny bits of metal together
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:18,656	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	The two little bits of metal come into contact and that's your circuit
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:25,824	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Did the circuit open the light bulb it goes back on or that it warms again
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:32,224	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Dysplastic it starts in the hottest Spanish people chose this flashlight because it had that
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:38,624	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Particular property do you think it's like a condor something no I don't think so no I don't think so I mean
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:44,000	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	He's like I think they're just trying to make sense of Randomness I mean they don't I don't think you necessarily know that this flashlight
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:48,352	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Does this thing and therefore they can manipulate people here's my don't think it's a car
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:51,680	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Because in this case it's such a it's such a
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:52,704	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Strange
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:53,472	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Coincidence
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:58,080	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	The whenever he wants his mom and dad his ghostly mother and father
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:27:59,872	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	To approve of him
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:01,920	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	And congratulate him
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:03,200	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	And honor him
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:04,480	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	With a yes
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:08,832	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Miss Random you could get a nobody gets a yes
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:09,856	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	It's just chance
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:12,416	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	And util Dancehall
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:18,816	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Yeah I told that it's cuz you told me to tell that it's true
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:21,376	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Okay so when you told him what did he say
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:22,400	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Well
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:25,472	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	I want level like it didn't phase him
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:28,544	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Denim Paisley said like look I know I know
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:29,568	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	That
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:35,968	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	The way that the world works is the way the world Works people don't come back from the tab
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:38,528	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	People don't talk to you through
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:40,320	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Flashlights
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:41,856	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	He also said that like he's not
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:43,904	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Going to let go of
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:44,672	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	That experience
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:51,584	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	He wants to have it both ways I guess so I guess I guess I would have both yes this didn't happen and yes this apps
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:52,352	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Truly happened
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:54,400	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	I understand that
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:58,752	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Even if you are the world's biggest skeptic if you don't believe in ghosts like
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:00,032	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	There
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:01,568	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Really aren't that many ways
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:05,920	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Talk about these sorts of things these are the things that we all feel
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:07,968	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	You know guilt for free
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:11,296	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Things are becoming our past the loss of those who
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:12,320	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Will Be Loved
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:14,880	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	That like ghost stories kind of seem to stick around because
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:16,928	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	They aren't experienced
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:19,744	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	I'll be at like a metaphorical experience experience
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:23,072	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	But let's talk about these things that we
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:24,608	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Can't adequately talk about
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:28,448	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	You know that feeling of being haunted
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:37,152	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Anticipated he eventually sell the house move out of the house moved out no more dreams
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:40,992	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Parents haunting him
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:42,784	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	In the time that I sold the house
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:43,808	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Now
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:46,112	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	I thought the dreams would stop
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:48,160	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	And now
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:49,696	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	The dreams are the
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:53,280	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	I'm the one haunting The House of the new people
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:56,608	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Or I will just walk in
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:29:57,632	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Hear the
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:29:58,912	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	What are you like
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:00,960	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Going around repairing things
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:01,984	| radiolab_podcast14haunted |	Nope I'm just
