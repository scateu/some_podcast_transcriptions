EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,671	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Go off on the NHL
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:59,071	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And eventually that leads them to talk about the other what they see is the other really dumb thing about that year
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:06:59,583	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	All-Star Game
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:03,167	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Fan voting has long been apart of the game

EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:12,127	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I trying to grab like 30 of them

EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:47,711	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	History tradition should be to what we really want
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:48,735	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	With this All-Star game which is
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:50,015	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Fan engagement
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,831	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I just hope that everyone

EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,975	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And that point they start thinking
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:02,815	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	What if we use the little voting power that we do have
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:04,607	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Mess with the all-star
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:09,215	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	We need some we need someone in there who normally would not be in this game

EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:13,055	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	We should vote somebody in who just does not
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:16,895	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And Greg's like I like that thought

EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:48,799	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	From that point on there was no other answer to the question like that was the guy that it would have to be
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:10:00,831	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And what started there as a train joke between two guys on a podcast

EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:31,519	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I don't know how we lucked out with her
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:32,543	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	She was on number 5 in
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:34,847	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	We needed that.
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:36,639	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	But perfectly evident
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:39,711	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	We're back alright let's let's get back
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:40,479	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Okay we're back
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:43,039	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Jump back in
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:46,879	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	John plays throughout his school years by the time he's getting closed
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:49,951	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	College a lot of his friends are getting
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:51,743	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	You know offers scholarships to different
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:56,351	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Yeah big-time schools University of Minnesota Boston College places like that
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:57,887	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	4 John
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:59,167	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	There was just no intro
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:02,239	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Like the coaches thought he was too big to play wouldn't be able to
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:03,519	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Keep up out there on the ice
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:09,919	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	But eventually he did get one offer to play for a mid-level university
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:10,943	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Michigan
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:12,991	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And I just figured I would
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:18,111	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	In all honesty I would finish college and get a job that would be it I would have got an education for free and
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:19,903	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	You know I play hockey with
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:22,719	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The guys on the weekends but that was down to the end of hockey
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:23,999	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	But then a couple of things
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:29,887	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	First at school I kind of always noticed him because he was
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:32,703	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	About 2 ft taller than anybody else on campus
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:37,055	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Engineering student started dating senior year
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:39,103	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The rest of History
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:43,455	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Any other thing that happened was I got this opportunity to go play
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:45,503	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Time for the Houston Aeros
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:50,623	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Minnesota farm team minor league team that wasn't crazy money it was 30,000 or 35,000
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:53,439	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	To talk to Danielle about it he was like
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:55,231	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Well let me give this hockey thing
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:59,839	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Like a go because the only chance I'm going to get to be able to say I played Pro
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:03,423	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	In the way that I kind of looked at it was okay
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:05,215	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	It's just like
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:06,239	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	A little head
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:10,847	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Start and then once I graduate like we'll both get our jobs like a real job
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:13,407	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And move on with our lives
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:23,903	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	So John moved down to Houston I didn't have any expectations I just work my tail off I was the bad skater I work
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:27,231	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	At skating I was a bad pastor I would work at passing after practice
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:30,047	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	But he says no matter what he did
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:30,815	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	He would not get any pie
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:33,375	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I was always a step or two behind
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:39,263	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I think the ninth defenseman on the roster and you only dress 6 for a game so I never played
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:40,543	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The first
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:42,079	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I think month of the season
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:44,383	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Buljan was in Houston
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:45,663	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Notice
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:48,223	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	If there were these other big guys on the team
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:49,759	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And they were getting
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:52,319	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	They they kind of took me under their wings
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:54,367	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And they said Hey listen
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:58,463	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	If you really want to get noticed on your if you really want to go to the NHL
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:00,511	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	You should learn how to fight
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:02,303	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	It work perfect
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:03,327	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Play because that's what happened
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:08,191	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	So for those of you who don't follow hockey
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:14,591	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I have guys in my team
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:20,223	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Million nine million eight million dollars and they are paid the score and they are paid to perform and play well
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:28,159	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	But there are also guys out there who their job is to
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:32,511	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Pester annoy and we call them the rats the pest
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:35,583	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And you can hear these guys like when they're mic'd up
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:42,239	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Like 10 guys her right now running their mouths they try to get under the star players skin
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:49,663	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	How do you spell star players put sometimes
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:57,087	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Immortal check them into the Borg
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:17:00,927	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Dope in order to deal with past
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:02,463	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	You got people like John
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:03,487	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Floor
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:04,767	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Called
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:05,279	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Enforcer
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:09,119	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	So basically my job is to make sure those pests
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:10,911	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Don't pester my top guys
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:13,215	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And so when we would go into a game
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:19,615	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I would know exactly who to pinpoint because you know you do your scouting and I would go up to those guys and I would say Hey listen
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:21,407	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	If you're going to do that I'm going to
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:22,687	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Put my fist through your face
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:24,479	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And more often
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:25,247	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Minaj
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:25,759	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The fear of
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:28,831	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The retribution if they did something with
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:29,343	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Would stop them
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:33,439	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Can you could see the frustration in Big John Scott.
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:37,023	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	But if they did do something my job was to beat them up
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:43,679	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And I was the heck of a fighter when I made the NHL
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:55,199	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	They wouldn't fight I would usually grab their tough guy
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:18:01,599	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And beat him up if we were playing flat and we didn't have energy
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:07,999	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Big John Scott trying to spark his team I would go out and try to fight to get my guys going
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:14,399	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Or if it was a really bad head I would just grab that guy and I would be his doors off
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:20,799	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Itsfunneh throughout my career I really hated fighting
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:24,895	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Thursday's I wouldn't sleep at night just because I knew I was going to get into a fight but
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:26,687	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	You just do your job
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:28,991	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And I think I did my job well
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:34,111	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Well enough that John was able to make a career in the NHL it's everything you dream of as a kid
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:38,207	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	It's kind of like a leap of faith and it worked out great
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:45,119	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	So by this point Danielle and John had gotten married you know we had bought our first house ever had their first tooth
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:46,911	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Kids beyond anything we
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:48,959	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Are I ever expected
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:54,847	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Will tell me tell me all the names of all the teams that you played for omigod so I'm embarrassed
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:19:01,759	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Doe in 2008 John started playing in the NHL for the Minnesota Wild
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:03,295	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	After that he played for
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:05,087	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Chicago in New York
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,623	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Buffalo in San Jose
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:09,695	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And and throw his whole career as an enforcer
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:12,511	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	There was this shift going on
EDL	00:19:12,511	00:19:13,279	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	In professional
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:15,071	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Justin incredible
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:20,447	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Printable play a lot of the hockey establishment in the media decks in the league
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:22,495	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	We're pushing for the game to be more heists
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:25,567	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Anymore about
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:26,335	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Gil
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:32,735	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And a lot of people started coming out and saying there should not be a place in this week
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:34,527	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	For fighting I was an easy target
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:35,295	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	This guy
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:37,599	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Is it cool if you haven't seen the movie you don't have
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:38,623	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Have to bother this is
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:43,487	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	They went after me and they said listen we don't need guys like this in the league has no room
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:44,255	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Forward in the game
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:44,767	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	There's no room
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:51,167	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Their sole purpose is to punch people
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,447	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Not simply
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:53,727	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Ignite a fight
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:55,007	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	You were going to eliminate
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:55,519	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Players like this
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:20:00,127	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Which is one of the reasons why
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:04,991	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Four guys like Greg wyshynski and Jeff Marek
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:07,807	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Booting John Scott in the All-Star game was not
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:10,623	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Just a hilarious joke about a big I couldn't skate
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:14,207	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	What is also a big fat middle finger
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:14,719	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	To the hockey is
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:17,535	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I'm sorry I'll just do the whole day
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:20,095	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The big point I do it I was we were
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:23,679	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	On the road and we are on the bus heading to
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:29,311	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	A game or pre-game skate it was December 2015 John was playing for the Arizona Coyotes
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:33,151	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And a guy my team Anders lindback gargar goalie he
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:36,991	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Was sitting beside me and he's like a year you know you're in
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:40,831	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	It was like 56 place or something you know
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:45,183	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	About the fan voting I was like oh you know it's great people think it's a joke they're going to vote
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:47,231	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	For me a little bit and it was it was nothing
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:49,279	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Seriously that's how I first heard of it on the bus
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:52,607	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	So we go to the we go to the rink we do our skate
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:54,911	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Literally after the skate
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:57,471	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	He checks his phone again and he's like holy comment your like
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:20:59,007	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Top 25
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:00,799	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	It happened that fast
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:01,567	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And then
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:05,151	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The next day I was top 5 and then like the day after that I was number one
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:11,039	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	There's a surprise leader in fan voting for the upcoming NHL All-Star Game and his name is
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:12,575	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	John Scott
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:14,879	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	So is like a
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:18,976	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	For the mega story. Is leading the NHL
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:21,792	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	It was unbelievable how quickly accrue
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:25,632	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Number one the number one vote-getter among all players in the NHL
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:28,960	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Which method would be at All-Star Game captain
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:29,472	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	King cat
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:31,008	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	At the All-Star Game
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:32,800	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Let that sink in for a second
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:39,200	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And for the fans who were voting for John there's definitely a bit of like oh you Shrunk the number of players we can vote in
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:41,504	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Oh really
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:43,040	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Here's Johnny
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:47,392	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	But I think for a majority of Voters voting for John
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:48,416	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	It was just released
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:50,976	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The reason John Scott's leading voting is because it's funny
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:54,816	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	John Scott is not an ulcer
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:22:01,216	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Star is one goal over eight games he barely plays
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:01,984	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Skill
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:04,288	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Wouldn't it be funny to see this
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:10,432	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Arizona Coyotes thun ogre objectively bad at hockey
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:12,992	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I don't know what he's doing in the league
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:15,040	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Make a fool of himself though I hated it
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:18,112	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	This isn't funny anymore I get it like on this
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:19,648	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Durable player who
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:23,488	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	You guys think would be fun to watch me you know fail in this game but
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:28,864	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I just figured it would end on its own honestly I thought it would last a few days and people would get
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:31,680	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Me and older enough of it and it would go away but it just didn't
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:34,496	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And that's for the NHL
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:35,264	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	They were pissed
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:37,568	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Frankly
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:39,872	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I definitely got the sense
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:44,224	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	From some of the people that I speak to you on a regular basis the NHL that they were really
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:46,016	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Angry this was happen
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:52,416	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And white like I can you get any more specific about like why this would have been an embarrassment to them like what is it exactly that they
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:58,816	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	They were so sensitive about about the fact that the All-Star game is something that a lot of old-time
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:01,120	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I'm hockey people and there's a lot of old time hockey
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:02,400	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	People that run the National Hockey League
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:04,960	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	See as something prestigious
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:07,264	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	One of the ultimate honors for a player
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:08,544	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And so
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:10,336	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	This was not something they wanted to happen
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:14,688	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And it was happening and they didn't really know what to do about it
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:16,992	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Because they didn't have any fail-safes
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:17,760	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Someplace to Ravenna from half
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:23,392	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	After one day of John sitting atop the All-Star vote
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:24,416	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Kids are sleeping
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:25,696	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	John gets a text
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:29,280	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	He gets about a bed cuz overdose phone starts reading it

EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:56,416	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Basically his own team is saying step away for
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:56,928	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	From the All-Star Game
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:24:03,328	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I saw him like respond yeah that statements fine and then delete it and then just sit there and look at it
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:05,376	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And I just remember us

EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:12,800	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	It was so
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:14,592	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Fun to watch in Iowa
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:16,384	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Dream to be in
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:17,152	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	So yeah
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:17,920	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I'm like woah
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:22,528	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	They want you to release the statement released a statement but make sure that it's
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:23,040	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	True
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:25,856	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I'm so John and separating statement that reads
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:26,880	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Quote
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:29,440	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	It's nice to be thought of by all of the fans
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:32,256	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And for that I am truly flattered and grateful
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:35,072	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And while I would love to experience an All-Star Game
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:38,400	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I think a few of my teammates are a bit more deserving of
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:40,192	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Enzo tour lights
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:42,240	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I would go if I get voted
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:43,776	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	But there's other people who deserve it
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:50,176	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I said yeah sure send it out I wasn't totally on board with that but I just wanted to appease the higher-ups to hopefully
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:51,712	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Help them
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:52,992	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	But even after that
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:53,760	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	It was
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:56,064	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Still John's got number one go-getter
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:57,600	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Go by far yeah it
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:25:00,416	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	It's funny they stop showing how many votes to players were getting
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:04,000	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	They took that option off the website because I think I was ahead by SoMo
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:06,304	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	You broke the website
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:08,352	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Yeah I still they they took that away and then
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:10,144	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The NHL
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:16,544	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Babe really try to strong-arm me what happened there so I was in my bedroom in Arizona and they called
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:17,056	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:19,360	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	It was one of the higher-ups in the NHL and he's a
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:22,944	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	You want to know how I was feeling was getting really close to the end of the voting
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:28,320	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I just said yeah you know I want to go to the game I think it'll be fun I think it'll be good for everybody involved
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:32,672	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And he's like really you sure like you think you'll be able to keep up
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:39,328	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	You think you're good enough like guy you're not exactly a skill guy John and they started that way and I just kind of brushed it off you know I was like yeah

EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:58,016	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And I was like what's like
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:26:02,624	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I don't think that has anything to do with this and I kind of brushed at off in at this time I'm getting a little angry

EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:21,312	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And as soon as he brought my kids into the equation I just like lost it
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:26,432	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And I kind of snapped back at him like you're being a real

EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:08,320	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music

EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:13,280	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	That's the thing no one knew
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:15,328	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	He says right after he
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:16,608	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	He was demoted to the minor league
EDL	00:35:16,608	00:35:19,680	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	People started did you know read through the by-laws read through the books
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:21,216	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Trying to figure out like
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:23,264	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Hen a minor league player
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:24,288	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Play in the
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:25,568	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Professional
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:26,336	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	NHL All-Star
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:30,944	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And it turns out there was no rule that even remotely address
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:32,224	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Situation like
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:33,760	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	It was totally impressive
EDL	00:35:33,760	00:35:37,088	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And so the pressure stayed on the NHL new
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:38,112	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	That
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:41,184	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	If John Scott wasn't in the All-Star Game
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:45,024	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	There's probably Visions from the NHL of protest signs along the glass
EDL	00:35:45,024	00:35:48,608	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The band out the outside the arena holding a rally because John Scott was
EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:50,912	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And according to Greg hockey
EDL	00:35:50,912	00:35:51,936	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Keep an czarnota
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:52,704	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Aureus

EDL	00:35:55,776	00:35:58,336	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Scenes and eventually
EDL	00:35:58,848	00:36:03,968	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The National Hockey League had to acquiesce they put out a statement they made a statement saying hey if John wants to go you can go
EDL	00:36:04,480	00:36:07,296	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	But John says at this point I told everybody I'm not going
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:09,856	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Like nhlpa I told all my friends
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:16,768	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The teammates like I'm done like this is a bogus sick I don't want to do this he says between the fans making fun of him and Allie demoting him
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:18,048	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The whole thing was just
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:19,072	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Just to humiliate
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:19,840	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	But I was

EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:09,504	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I would be representing the

EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:17,184	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	It was essential who everyone said they were stacked because they had all the
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:18,208	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Stud players on our team
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:19,488	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Players play

EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:39,200	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	McDaniel
EDL	00:37:39,200	00:37:40,736	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Everything is buzzing

EDL	00:37:49,696	00:37:53,024	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And before the game the coach comes up to him to ask me if I wanted to
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:54,048	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The starting I just said no

EDL	00:37:56,096	00:37:57,120	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Nicole chisley
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:57,888	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	All right
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:37:58,656	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	But you're going in early
EDL	00:38:02,752	00:38:05,312	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	John teammates get out to center ice
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:07,872	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	He's sitting on the bench butterflies in its stomach

EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:22,976	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Jaheim
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:24,768	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Go down one nothing
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:30,400	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Literally one not too late and how about the hands in the playmate from the Maddie Duchesne right there on the Colorado Avalanche
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:31,424	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Brilliant Steve
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:37,568	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The James Neal it was like it was like
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:38,848	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	It was a goal that all stars
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:42,432	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Gunsmoke
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:43,200	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Scott
EDL	00:38:43,200	00:38:43,712	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	You're in
EDL	00:38:44,480	00:38:50,112	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Remember this is three-on-three there is a ton of open eyes there's nowhere to go like there's nowhere to hide
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:52,928	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And John says it's kept thinking
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:53,696	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Don't mess up
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:54,464	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Don't mess up
EDL	00:38:54,976	00:38:57,280	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Don't make a fool yourself that's all I was thinking of
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:38:59,328	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Rats got the puck
EDL	00:38:59,328	00:39:03,424	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Hold it about Center Ice I don't belong here I think you're a joke don't screw it up
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:05,472	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Drop set what's the puck drop
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:17,504	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	You just kind of you know everything else goes away
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:20,832	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Can you just start playing hockey
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:30,048	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	This was like going back to when I was younger I wasn't the best I was in the fastest but you and I know you just start playing
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:35,424	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And that's what I did
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:38,752	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	This time
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:42,592	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	John Cena
EDL	00:39:43,104	00:39:44,384	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Frenzy at the park
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:45,408	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	We're going up the ice
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:50,528	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	John and the team is charged across Center Ice they move into their opponent Zone
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:51,296	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	When
EDL	00:39:53,088	00:39:55,648	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Brent Burns passes the puck to John
EDL	00:39:56,160	00:40:01,280	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	John manages to control it kind of up against the boards so he's using his body to protect
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:03,328	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Tupac trying to figure out what to do next
EDL	00:40:08,192	00:40:11,520	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Burnsy had to park on the right wing and all the sudden I notice
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:16,896	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Between two of the Defenders there's a nice little Lane right to the net I went to the net
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:19,968	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Burn spotted Johnny what the f*** rate on my
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:20,480	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Stick
EDL	00:40:20,992	00:40:24,576	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	John's just like a few feet from goal in the Ghoulies actually out of
EDL	00:40:24,576	00:40:26,368	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Position that a wide open net
EDL	00:40:26,368	00:40:29,696	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And I shot it and I missed the net
EDL	00:40:32,256	00:40:33,792	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Like a like a white oak
EDL	00:40:33,792	00:40:34,560	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Open Nat
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:37,632	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	But the goalie was luckily sliding back into position
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:38,656	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	So the puck
EDL	00:40:38,656	00:40:39,680	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Hit the goalie
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:40,960	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Bounce
EDL	00:40:40,960	00:40:41,984	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Off the goalie
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:48,896	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And into the back of the net
EDL	00:40:50,944	00:40:51,712	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	There you go
EDL	00:40:53,504	00:40:58,112	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	It was awesome like I was so jacked up by Goosebumps like after the goal I was so need
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:03,488	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	It was cool
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:06,816	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	That was anything the crowd I didn't know how they were going to react
EDL	00:41:06,816	00:41:07,840	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Usually they boo me
EDL	00:41:07,840	00:41:11,424	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Everybody boo'd me and they they they are all for it
EDL	00:41:19,616	00:41:21,152	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The weird thing about the masses
EDL	00:41:21,152	00:41:22,176	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Two it's like
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:24,736	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	How quickly everybody can go from hating you
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:25,504	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	You to loving you
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:28,576	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	It was such a sense of relief for me
EDL	00:41:28,576	00:41:29,600	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The huge monkey
EDL	00:41:29,600	00:41:31,392	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Was lifted off my back cuz I was like okay
EDL	00:41:32,672	00:41:35,488	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I did something for the team I didn't mess up he's going to relax
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:36,512	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Have fun
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:38,304	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Just playing
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:45,984	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Be himself in place which he did
EDL	00:41:45,984	00:41:52,128	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Laid out the guy Patrick Kane
EDL	00:41:58,783	00:42:05,183	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Drop the glove pretended to have a fight
EDL	00:42:05,183	00:42:11,583	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	He got a couple make passes at a real
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:14,911	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Bluetooth shot on goal he was just kind of doing everything
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:15,935	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Everytime John Scott
EDL	00:42:16,447	00:42:19,519	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Was on camera or touch the puck the crowd would come to life
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:27,199	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Greg wyshynski was actually they're reporting at the game and he was down in the tunnel
EDL	00:42:28,991	00:42:33,343	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	What happens when you're down in the bowels of the arena is at the All-Star games on TVs
EDL	00:42:33,855	00:42:35,135	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	But there is a
EDL	00:42:35,135	00:42:38,207	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Delay between what the broadcast has and what's happening
EDL	00:42:38,207	00:42:38,975	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	On the ice
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:42,047	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	So typically you'll hear something happen in the game
EDL	00:42:42,047	00:42:43,583	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Before you actually watch it on TV
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:45,631	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And I remember hearing this
EDL	00:42:46,143	00:42:49,215	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Gigantic Roar from the
EDL	00:42:49,215	00:42:49,727	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Crap
EDL	00:42:50,239	00:42:52,543	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And then everybody kind of looked over at the
EDL	00:42:52,543	00:42:53,055	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The TV
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:54,847	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And watch the all-star
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:42:59,455	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	If tie-dye shootout
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:05,855	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	What happened with a listed it. Rohr was that it was getting to the end of the game tight game
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:08,415	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Johnson was up by one we were in our Zone
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:10,463	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Point defense all of a sudden
EDL	00:43:13,023	00:43:16,351	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	13 shot it
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:19,167	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	We had a save and burns you got the puck behind the net
EDL	00:43:20,191	00:43:20,959	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	End
EDL	00:43:20,959	00:43:21,727	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I just
EDL	00:43:21,727	00:43:25,311	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Bluetooth on a skid loaders on as fast as I could cuz I knew he was going to get it
EDL	00:43:25,311	00:43:27,103	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	He saw me up in that all I need
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:30,943	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Fire tonight pass and I corralled it
EDL	00:43:30,943	00:43:32,479	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Took off down the center of the ice
EDL	00:43:34,015	00:43:38,367	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	They had someone hounding me able to keep the defender off of them
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:39,903	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	So it was just John
EDL	00:43:39,903	00:43:40,927	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The goalie
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:41,695	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And then that
EDL	00:43:41,695	00:43:45,791	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Gather dipakai Ripa shot top corner on the goalie
EDL	00:43:45,791	00:43:48,095	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Can a 1in
EDL	00:43:58,591	00:44:00,127	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	No goalie deflection tool
EDL	00:44:00,127	00:44:01,407	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Bounce Jeddah
EDL	00:44:01,407	00:44:02,687	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Solid steel shot
EDL	00:44:02,687	00:44:04,735	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	There was just for this moment of this black
EDL	00:44:05,247	00:44:09,855	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Laughter from the players being waited to be interviewed laughter from the media downstairs
EDL	00:44:09,855	00:44:12,415	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Unbridled Joy of watching it all happen
EDL	00:44:12,415	00:44:17,023	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I was just like as it's even happening like it I started to just be like
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:18,559	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Cuz I think I could
EDL	00:44:19,071	00:44:19,839	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Physically
EDL	00:44:19,839	00:44:20,863	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Adidas Milan
EDL	00:44:20,863	00:44:22,399	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Stan
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:27,007	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The guys on the ice jumped on me they're like holy cow this is unbelievable
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:30,079	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The Final Chapter
EDL	00:44:32,895	00:44:34,687	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Of the John Scott story
EDL	00:44:35,199	00:44:37,247	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	At least as it pertains to the all-star game
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:38,527	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Is
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:41,599	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Really beautiful thing
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:44,927	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And so
EDL	00:44:45,951	00:44:48,767	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	So there's this scene in Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan

EDL	00:44:54,399	00:44:55,679	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	It looks like
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:57,983	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The Enterprise is going to get away
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:44:59,775	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Having defeated car

EDL	00:45:05,919	00:45:08,991	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	He's going to try to trigger the doomsday device on a ship
EDL	00:45:09,759	00:45:10,271	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Kill Everybody
EDL	00:45:11,039	00:45:15,391	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	It's so as as as as their prizes

EDL	00:48:32,767	00:48:35,327	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And paraded around like he was Rudy
EDL	00:48:35,327	00:48:41,471	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Greatest sports movie ever
EDL	00:48:59,135	00:49:01,695	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	I wanted to go down by
EDL	00:49:01,695	00:49:03,743	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The ice so that the kids could see John and
EDL	00:49:04,255	00:49:10,655	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Keep for trying to help me down the stairs like parting the sea so I could get down there
EDL	00:49:10,655	00:49:16,543	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And it was so weird like it was literally like Disney wrote a script and said okay now he kisses his wife
EDL	00:49:17,055	00:49:23,199	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	You took me in her eyes locked and it was just we both are kind of like shaking your head like we're both a little bit
EDL	00:49:23,199	00:49:23,967	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Beast Boy
EDL	00:49:23,967	00:49:24,735	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Now he grabbed
EDL	00:49:24,735	00:49:25,503	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Kiss
EDL	00:49:25,503	00:49:26,271	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Scoop them up

EDL	00:49:32,927	00:49:33,951	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Like every time
EDL	00:49:34,463	00:49:38,815	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Like I would just look at him and I can't even believe this is happening and it was no
EDL	00:49:38,815	00:49:39,583	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Like I just can't
EDL	00:49:40,863	00:49:44,959	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And if it came off the ice there were crowds of people waiting asking questions
EDL	00:49:44,959	00:49:48,543	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Pictures with. But we had to fight the next morning at like 5 a.m.
EDL	00:49:49,311	00:49:50,847	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	He had to get back to the minor leagues
EDL	00:49:51,615	00:49:52,895	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	And before that
EDL	00:49:52,895	00:49:54,943	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	They still had to have these babies
EDL	00:49:54,943	00:49:56,991	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	City Russian to give birth to the twins
EDL	00:49:56,991	00:49:59,295	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	4 days after babies were born and went back to St John's
EDL	00:50:01,087	00:50:01,855	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	My God

EDL	00:50:22,591	00:50:23,103	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Butts
EDL	00:50:23,871	00:50:24,639	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The Legacy
EDL	00:50:25,151	00:50:26,431	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Arby's All-Star appearance
EDL	00:50:27,199	00:50:28,479	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Lived on in two ways
EDL	00:50:28,991	00:50:29,503	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	First
EDL	00:50:30,015	00:50:34,879	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The day after the game it was announced that John Scott's helmet-to-helmet he wore during the game

EDL	00:50:45,887	00:50:47,935	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	The NHL created a new rule
EDL	00:50:48,447	00:50:49,983	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Known as the John Scott rule
EDL	00:50:50,495	00:50:54,847	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Which states that any player who is voted to be a captain in the All-Star Game
EDL	00:50:54,847	00:50:57,151	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Then gets demoted to the minor leagues
EDL	00:50:57,151	00:50:59,967	| radiolab_podcast19punchline |	Will be disqualified will not be allowed to play
