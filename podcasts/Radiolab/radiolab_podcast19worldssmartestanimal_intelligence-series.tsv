EDL	00:00:36,864	00:00:37,632	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	We did
EDL	00:00:37,632	00:00:39,168	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Lots of Stories on human
EDL	00:00:39,168	00:00:39,936	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Intelligence
EDL	00:00:39,936	00:00:43,520	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	But we also found ourselves thinking about intelligence in other end
EDL	00:00:44,544	00:00:47,104	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Enter to get into that we decided to host an event
EDL	00:00:47,104	00:00:48,384	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	All about animals
EDL	00:00:49,152	00:00:51,456	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	And today we're going to share that event with you
EDL	00:00:51,968	00:00:54,016	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Just a quick warning at there are
EDL	00:00:54,016	00:00:54,528	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Some curse words
EDL	00:00:55,040	00:00:56,064	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	I and Joe
EDL	00:00:56,064	00:00:57,088	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	So say that mine
EDL	00:00:58,112	00:01:01,696	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	And the reason that we're doing this is because a couple of months ago
EDL	00:01:01,696	00:01:05,792	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	I ended up on the phone with the science writer I really love named an amber
EDL	00:01:06,560	00:01:08,096	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	And then went on a rant
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:10,144	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	About how messed up is that
EDL	00:01:10,144	00:01:13,728	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	We only seem able to talk about animal intelligence in terms of our own until
EDL	00:01:15,264	00:01:15,776	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	He said
EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:18,080	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	So much of animal intelligence research
EDL	00:01:18,592	00:01:21,408	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	I is built on making animals do stuff
EDL	00:01:21,408	00:01:22,944	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	That we feel like
EDL	00:01:22,944	00:01:23,712	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Humans would be good at
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:26,528	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Instead of considering their Intelligence on their own
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:31,648	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	And tonight we decided we're doing episode about animal intelligence
EDL	00:01:31,648	00:01:32,928	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	That shifts the focus from
EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:33,696	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	From us
EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:34,720	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	To them
EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:36,768	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	That considers their unique abilities
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:37,792	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	On their own terms
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:39,584	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	I enjoy doing so
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:42,656	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	I hopefully might help us redefine a little bit what we think about
EDL	00:01:42,656	00:01:43,168	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Intelligence
EDL	00:01:43,680	00:01:44,448	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	A general for Olive
EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:48,032	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	And because we're humans and
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:48,800	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	We like

EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:37,695	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	A slime mold is a brainless single-celled

EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:57,663	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	What is fine
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:11:00,479	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	So this is a superorganism

EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:06,623	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	And they will collectively decide to make a decision for the group
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:11,999	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Humans on the other hand are not at all good at collectively finding a good food source

EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:12,959	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	With Laurel
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:13,471	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Take it away
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:14,495	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Sperm whales
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:16,287	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Are huge
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:17,823	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	The biggest toothed whales
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:19,359	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	But in a lot of ways
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:20,127	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	They're like us
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:21,919	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	They have big brands
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:23,711	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	And really complex socialized
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:24,991	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	But unlike us
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:26,527	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	They live in a matriarchal culture
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:34,207	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	They probably even have stronger social and emotional bonds than we do
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:38,815	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Young males go off on their own to find a new pod and then everyone else stays together for life
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:43,679	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Sperm whales communicate a lot like us to physically and with
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:48,031	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	But they also have a third way and I think we should consider it like
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:49,311	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Sense
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:53,919	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Maybe you think about echolocation like boat sonar
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:55,967	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Like a ping goes out
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:58,783	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	And then it bounces of the sound bounces off
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:17:59,807	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Nothing in their environment in the
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:01,087	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Comes back
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:04,671	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	And giving give that boat like a grainy shape of whatever
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:10,047	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	A dolphin and whale sonar does this too and so do bats
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:13,631	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	But animal sonar also comes back as a physical feeling
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:17,215	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	In a case of sperm whales is really loud
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:20,287	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	They make the loudest sound
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:21,823	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Any animal on Earth
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:23,871	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Up to 230 decibels
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:25,919	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	I know
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:30,015	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Is actually it's louder than standing next to a jet engine at
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:34,367	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Are eardrums can rupture at 150.
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:37,695	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Which is basically like a gun going off next to your head
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:40,511	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Sperm whales make these click
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:42,559	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Creaking and buzzing sound in their knees
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:47,423	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	And then they amplify and direct them with this big fatty wack
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:48,959	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Taxi organ in their forehead
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:52,543	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Called the melon and it's like
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:53,311	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	I know it's
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:55,359	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Terrible where they probably have another word for it
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:19:00,991	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	But it's like a huge built-in megaphone in their head
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:14,559	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Just like that but way louder like
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:17,631	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Read aloud so loud that it would have hurt us to be listening to
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:23,519	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	And this echolocation is so powerful that if they can track a squid up to a mile away
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:26,335	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	And their social messages
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:29,151	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Probably travel just as far
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:32,735	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	So knowing what we know is are really complex social lives
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:36,319	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Expense likely comes with its own emotional
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:37,087	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Experiences to
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:40,159	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	But we can't name those because we don't know what those feelings are
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:41,695	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	So
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:42,975	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	I want you to try to imagine it
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:45,535	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	What would it be like to be like
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:46,303	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Reading a book
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:48,351	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	What's suddenly finding out
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:49,631	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Just by feeling it
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:53,471	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	But your ex girlfriend is coming around the corner of an underwater Shelf
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:55,007	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	A half a mile away
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:57,567	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Now
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:19:59,359	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	She broke up with you
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:02,687	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Matriarchal culture
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:09,087	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	You been so lonely but now you know the signal is meant for you just because of how it feels
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:09,855	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	When you pick it up
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:16,255	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	And not only that but you have an immediate accurate picture of exactly what she looks like not just the shape of her
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:20,863	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	But the perfect curve of her jaw her sexy 12 inch layer of blubber
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:23,679	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	That you've missed
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:28,287	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	But also you can also immediately tell how much
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:30,591	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	She cares about you too and that's why she's coming
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:33,407	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Also you've been hunting a giant squid
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:39,807	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Might have a particular emotion that goes along with experiences
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:42,623	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Any maybe even have a different sense of
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:47,743	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	In the mid-1980s a neuropsychologist named Harry Garrison
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:51,071	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Proposed that are collocated Communications that are emotional and nature
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:53,375	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	For joy
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:54,143	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Might be
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:58,495	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Experience by whales and dolphins as more than shared information they at
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:21:00,543	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Actually might come in as shared feelings
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:02,335	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Shared emotional
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:02,847	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Experiences
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:07,199	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Jerrison thought that this might give rise to something called the communal self
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:10,271	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Meaning whales and dolphins might not say
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:13,087	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	I they might always be a we
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:16,159	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	We are sad
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:16,672	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	We are
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:18,464	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	And there's some evidence for this
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:21,024	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	So like in whale strandings for example
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:22,560	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	When a bunch of whales
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:25,632	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	We'll come up to the shore and strand themselves and die
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:26,912	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	But when we actually
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:30,752	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Do studies on the way we find out that maybe only one or two and 100 was actually sick
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:34,848	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Something is going on here and I think it may be
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:35,360	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	We sick
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:38,688	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Stop
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:42,272	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	I don't want to end on that super sad no guys
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:46,368	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	It also might be why whales in
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:52,256	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	I'm going to tell you one really nice singing
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:54,816	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Turn it over to the mystery mystery animal
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:58,912	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	It also might be why dolphins and whales are
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:03,008	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	So many reports of them coming to the aid of swimmers who are struggling
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:06,080	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Or fending off sharks from somebody who really needs
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:07,104	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Action or help
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:09,408	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Or even doing things like this which I love
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:10,432	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	This is a case of
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:12,736	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Sperm whales who adopted a deformed dolphin
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:15,040	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	So if I'm golfing with us
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:18,368	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Spinal abnormality who they welcomed into their pod
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:19,392	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	So
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:21,184	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Sperm whales man
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:25,536	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	What looks like extreme empathy to us
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:27,840	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Might just Demby being themselves
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:30,144	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Or maybe it's a new kind of intelligence
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:32,192	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	One that requires
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:35,520	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	A kind of communal feeling as opposed to thoughts about other people's
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:43,456	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Thank you
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:46,272	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Okay well done

EDL	00:22:57,792	00:22:58,816	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	A chicken
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:00,608	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Can beat a human in tic tac toe
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:04,448	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	A chicken almost always
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:05,728	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Pizza human in tic-tac-toe
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:08,032	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	I learn this back
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:09,824	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	In high school when my friend Rob
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:12,128	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Obsessed with one particular
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:14,176	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Chateau plain chicken named Willie
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:16,736	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Who lived at the video arcade at Mott Street
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:18,528	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Add Willie beat RAB
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:21,600	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Over and over and over again it's
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:22,112	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Tic-tac-toe
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:25,184	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Willie wasn't unique birds like him we're one
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:28,512	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	A pretty common Carnival attraction their popularity
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:32,352	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Peaked in the early 80s when train chickens were shipped around the country
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:34,656	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Rent it out for $200 a day
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:36,448	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Or sold for several thousand dollars each
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:40,800	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Annies chickens were so good at Tic-tac-toe
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:42,336	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	That humans were getting demoralized
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:47,200	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	At least one distributor started having the birds lose on purpose
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:48,480	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Every fifth game
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:50,272	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	To make it seem more fair
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:57,696	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	How it turned out this whole thing it started years earlier in the south at a place called the IQ zoo in Hot Springs Ark
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:23:59,744	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	There
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:01,792	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	A pair of scientists Marion
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:05,632	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	And Keller Breland head build a business out of training up strange animal behavior
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:09,472	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	There's it was like a product showroom a place to demo
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:10,752	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	The Ducks they talked

EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:25,344	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	You don't have to be that smart to go on trapeze
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:27,136	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	The prelims mosto
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:28,416	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Popular in during Act
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:29,952	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	What's the bird brand
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:34,816	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	A chicken in a box which disappeared behind a screen to Packo's onto a game board
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:38,144	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Chinatown Willie with one of those or maybe
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:42,752	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Someone else's knockoff in any case I watch that chicken play a lot of tic tac toe
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:46,080	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Peering over my shoulder I tried to figure out
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:47,104	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Chicken secret strategy
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:49,152	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	But then
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:50,176	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Last week
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:52,224	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Really last week
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:54,528	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	I discovered that all those observations were
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:59,648	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Preferred not as I got ready for tonight's talk I stumbled across a copy of an old instruction manual
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:01,184	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	What's the breland's
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:02,720	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Would send out with her bird rain units
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:05,280	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	According to that manual
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:06,816	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Chicken in the Box
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:09,888	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Wasn't really playing Tic-Tac-Toe at all in fact
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:13,216	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Behind the screen there's nothing but a single light bulb and a switch
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:16,032	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	When the light went on the chickenpox
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:19,616	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Headed out to appeared somewhere on the board in the spot chosen by computer
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:23,456	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	I found this
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:27,296	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Kind of devastating
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:30,112	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Partly because I promised had a talk on the intelligence
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:32,672	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	The chicken
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:34,464	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	But here's the reality
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:37,024	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Chickens are kind of dumb
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:43,168	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	As we seen their even dumb compared to other birds they don't
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:44,448	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Have funerals
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:45,728	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	You know they're not
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:48,544	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	I or make tools like crows
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:52,896	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	They don't learn to speak like parrots in fact if a chicken has any special talents at all
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:55,712	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Is that when you chop off its head it can go on acting
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:57,248	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Like a chicken
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:59,552	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	4 days or weeks or even months
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:05,952	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	But still I think there's something amazing about Willie and the other bird brain
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:09,536	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	It's not that these chickens were smart enough to beat us at Tic Tac
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:11,328	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Because they weren't
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:13,632	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Is that we humans
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:17,472	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	We're dumb enough to lose
EDL	00:26:19,264	00:26:20,032	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	I mean
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:22,592	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Tic-tac-toe is not a complicated game actually
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:29,760	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	If you can think of had just a bit you ought to be able to play any round of tic tac toe to withdraw even against the computer and yeah
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:34,112	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	It seems we humans can't or won't succeed even at this
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:36,160	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Very modest test of our intelligence
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:40,512	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	I think that's useful to remember especially tonight
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:41,536	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Because this whole
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:42,304	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Project
EDL	00:26:42,304	00:26:45,632	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	2-ranked species according to their smarts takes it as a given
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:52,032	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	The ugliest exists between the very dumbest in the very smartest animals that the chicken and the chimpanzee or the spur
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:55,104	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Sperm whale or the crow live on separate continents of cognition
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:56,896	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	But I call that vanity
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:59,712	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	That's what Willie taught us that
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:02,016	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	There we were standing the same arcade
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:04,576	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Befuddled by the same computer
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:07,392	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Each unable to succeed at the same simple game
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:09,696	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	We were joined together across
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:13,280	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Several hundred million years of evolution by what we couldn't do

EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:25,824	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	If the vote for Unity

EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:53,728	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	What I would I
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:56,800	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	I don't even know what what are you which way are you leaning
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:28:03,200	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	I did not know that stuff about the sperm whale actually played

EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:06,176	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Can I ask if I see question about the best formula is
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:10,272	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Isn't all emotion somehow it is fits a physical physical rap
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:14,624	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	So is it a question degrees is it somehow they are experiencing that
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:17,440	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Or is it an entirely different kind of intelligence
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:20,512	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	I think that they have another way of
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:21,792	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Accessing their emotional
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:24,608	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Then we do so they have everything we have
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:27,424	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Write like their friend can go up and clap them on the back or

EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:33,824	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Sperm whale hug or whatever they still have that and they also have language but then they have his other thing
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:36,384	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Which item just because
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:38,432	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	I avoid my inbox or whatever
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:42,784	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	It feels like some form of email right like you send it at a great distance
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:44,832	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	What is emotional and you pick it up with your face
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:55,840	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	I I think I got it ice my heart go sperm well I thought the political platform I vote chicken

EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:17,856	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	But this point the first round was finished at the judges
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:20,672	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Waitin on some pretty compelling cases for

EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:32,960	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Table to make a case for
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:36,288	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	But this time we threw a couple curveballs at them

EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:08,544	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	So in part one of our competition we heard Arguments for the intelligent
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:09,568	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Of The Crow

EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:15,712	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	And in part 2 we decided to raise the stakes a little
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:17,760	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	I give our competitors a couple more chine
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:24,672	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	The first challenge is that they are now going to have to compete with their nemesis from the first round

EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:32,352	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	The other challenge we gave them is we noticed that
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:38,752	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	We weren't really paying that much attention to the furry mammals I think a lot of us imagined that we may be amongst
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:43,360	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Smartest animals in in the in the animal kingdom and some of us want yeah

EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:13,728	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	What are sagacity order Skillet making mischief
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:19,360	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	This is the odd and tragic story of how we came to understand briefly a century ago
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:22,176	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	That raccoons were among the very shrewdest animals of all
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:23,200	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	And then
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:24,480	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	We forgot
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:28,576	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	The link between animals

EDL	00:33:48,800	00:33:49,312	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	But for animal
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:52,384	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Then in 1907
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:59,552	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Psychologist in Oklahoma named Lawrence Wooster call thought to put raccoon through the same puzzle boxes to learn
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:02,880	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	If you put it there proper place in the scale of mammalian and television
EDL	00:34:04,416	00:34:06,208	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	And he found some amazing things

EDL	00:34:09,024	00:34:09,792	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	And Dolly
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:16,704	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	What did X Break Free of the puzzle box and then ignore the food reward it was as if they'd gone through the exercise

EDL	00:40:59,648	00:41:04,000	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Here's how dumb koalas are their brains only take 2% of their body mass
EDL	00:41:04,512	00:41:07,840	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Which is Apparently one of the smallest brain to body mass ratios

EDL	00:41:50,080	00:41:53,663	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Perhaps koalas aren't conventionally intelligent
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:58,271	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Just like how choosing koalas for this presentation wasn't conventionally intelligent
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:04,159	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	But I propose that we rethink intelligence
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:11,327	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Partly because I'm stuck with this animal but mostly because I believe that this animal is in many ways smarter than us
EDL	00:42:11,327	00:42:14,399	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Perhaps koalas are like how my mom describes me
EDL	00:42:14,399	00:42:17,471	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Smart in their own special way
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:20,031	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Let's compare koalas and humans
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:21,311	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Sissy who look smart bike
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:21,823	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Comparison
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:24,383	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	This is a koalas daily schedule
EDL	00:42:26,687	00:42:28,991	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	A koala sleeps 20 hours a day
EDL	00:42:28,991	00:42:31,807	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	While the remaining four hours they spend eating and mating
EDL	00:42:32,319	00:42:33,343	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Incredible
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:35,903	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Imagine only being awake for the amount of hours you need to
EDL	00:42:35,903	00:42:36,671	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	To eat and have sex
EDL	00:42:37,695	00:42:43,839	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	I mean I'm not a huge fan of sex because I'm quote-unquote awful at it but boy do I love eating
EDL	00:42:44,863	00:42:47,679	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	The human schedule on the other hand is horrendous
EDL	00:42:48,191	00:42:50,751	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Weekly Pond average 6.8 hours a night
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:55,615	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	We wait for my nightmares then spend 10 hours reading emails and worrying
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:57,407	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	5 hours on a conference call
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:43:03,807	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	In 2 hours eating dinner out of a big bowl while watching billions and hoping to God that Paul Giamatti voice can Lola
EDL	00:43:03,807	00:43:04,575	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	What's to sleep again
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:09,695	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	In conclusion koalas have optimized themselves for Life's greatest gift
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:10,463	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Eating
EDL	00:43:10,463	00:43:11,231	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Having sex
EDL	00:43:11,231	00:43:16,607	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Those who enjoy that kind of thing and sleeping without the need to listen to Paul giamatti's voice
EDL	00:43:17,119	00:43:17,887	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	And that
EDL	00:43:17,887	00:43:18,655	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Smart
EDL	00:43:18,655	00:43:19,679	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Now who sounds

EDL	00:43:43,487	00:43:49,631	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Feeding a koala would have done that
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:54,751	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Wow okay so
EDL	00:43:57,055	00:43:58,847	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	We've heard from both the hairs

EDL	00:44:13,695	00:44:17,535	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Taking their a lot of different arguments were put forward I
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:20,095	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Think I got to give this to the marsupial
EDL	00:44:20,095	00:44:26,239	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Duet alright alright alright

EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:43,903	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	But before I got a chance to always win
EDL	00:44:43,903	00:44:50,047	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Raymond has walked a giant bone across the stage and giving it to Macy the dog judge
EDL	00:44:50,047	00:44:56,191	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	A pretty curious incident of bribery went down
EDL	00:44:58,751	00:45:02,591	| radiolab_podcast19worldssmartestanimal_intelligence-series |	Don't you do it to keep things Fair we decided to just throw the whole thing over to the audio
