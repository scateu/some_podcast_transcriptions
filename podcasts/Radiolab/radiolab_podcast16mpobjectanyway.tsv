EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:54,367	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Is amazing
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:58,719	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That's the prosecutor about Joe Gutman
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:00,255	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I'm from Louisville Kentucky
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:02,815	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Gripped and loyal raised in Louisville
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:09,215	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Wanna be a lawyer since he was a kid my parents would through a divorce when I was very young and I wanted to go to law school to help
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:15,615	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Kids in divorces
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:19,199	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Become a lawyer James's case was in the first 6 months
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:21,247	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That I was in the prosecutor's office
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:23,807	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Pretty impressive first year
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:25,599	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Starting out
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:27,135	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I lost my first date trials
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:28,671	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Really
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:34,815	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Batson's case you know this low-level burglary of breaking of a house in a purse being stolen he was a go
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:37,375	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Maybe this'll be my Wendy evidence
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:39,679	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Disappeared that he was guilty of the crime
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:40,447	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	James was
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:42,751	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Accuse not data Fighters the one is having done it
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:48,895	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Eyewitnesses they're saying James these Witnesses photos of him before
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:50,175	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Because
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:51,199	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Do you need naps
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:52,479	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	So
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:54,015	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	To come to the case
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:55,295	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	It goes to trial
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:56,575	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:57,599	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Had a hung jury
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:58,879	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	They end up being a hung jury
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:00,159	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Hip hip hooray
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:01,695	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	It means they can come to unanimous.
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:03,231	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	James gets off
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:07,327	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Why is it a hung jury in Kentucky you have to have unanimous
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:12,191	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	So the defense is looking for that one juror that keeps from convicting
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:13,727	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	There is apparently one jar
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:17,567	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Who just didn't buy it then by the evidence and thought James was legit
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:18,847	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	It was a black
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:20,895	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	One black lady came to visit me
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:22,175	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	After Drew's over
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:25,247	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	She said I really really don't think you're guilty the rest of
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:26,015	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The jury
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:27,807	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Was trying to make me say that you
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:29,599	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Guilty and I was saying not guilty
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:31,903	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	So end up being a hung jury at was
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:32,415	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Disappointed
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:34,207	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	At that point I was
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:34,975	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Having sex
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:36,255	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Thoughts about
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:38,047	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Is this the right career for me
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:39,327	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	SoJO gottman
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:44,447	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	He says imma try this case one more time it was pretty close to guilty
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:46,751	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I have this one Drew hung it up
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:50,335	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Tell me two or more time and it does something this time
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:52,383	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	A little differently
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:58,783	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Just a setup as you know when you get a jury summons you go in you're on a jury pool
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:05,183	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	At the beginning of a trial
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:11,583	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Jury selection
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:17,983	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Maybe ask you touching your call if we're both side the prosecution the defense sometimes the judge they get jurors into a room and they start
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:24,383	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Asking lots of questions is there anyone here who has been the victim of a crime
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:30,527	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Victims of crime
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:38,207	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	To figure out which jurors do we want
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:42,303	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Member of a church pictures do we want to get rid of
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:48,447	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And that's the more important part of this process which jurors do we want to toss off history pool
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:52,543	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	So what are the rules to get rid of jurors
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:56,383	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	There's two ways to get rid of jurors to get down to that group of 12 in this
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:59,455	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And the first way is called striking
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:02,783	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Cause this type of move to excuse him for causing this time
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:09,183	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Tracking for cause is like when they ask you can you be fair in this case if you say you know Noah
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:13,791	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I really can't I really strong feelings about the people or the subject matter
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:18,399	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That's a strike for cause or it's like hey that lady who's sitting in the chair of the defendant
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:19,423	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That's some
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:20,447	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That's my cousin
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:22,239	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	We grew up together
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:24,799	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Don't like conflict Venture Lane, that's my boss
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:27,871	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	We go out every Saturday for brunch whatever it is
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:29,407	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	You're too close to this
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:31,199	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	You can't be fair
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:32,735	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Got it so that one's cause
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:37,087	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That's pretty much common sense it makes sense to everyone but the second way is
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:38,623	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The heart of this whole matter
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,647	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	This whole story
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:41,439	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	It's called a peremptory challenge
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:44,255	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Preempt rear entry
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:45,023	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Peremptory
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:47,583	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That's a word depending on how you punch it into Google
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:53,727	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	It'll be like that's a type of a son what does it mean what is peremptory mean sound means you get a certain number of straw
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:57,055	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Just to get rid of people you think might not be
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:58,847	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Fair to you
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:01,663	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	But you can really use them anyway you want and
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:02,431	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	But these strikes
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:04,223	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	You want to give any reason
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:06,271	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	How many days do you get
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:08,319	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	So it varies from state-to-state in some states
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,599	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	20 in other states
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:10,367	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	It's for
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:13,439	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	In Kentucky then and now each side gets
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,719	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	88 juror
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:19,327	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That they just get to put the Exxon and say you're not going to sit on this trial
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:23,935	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Hooker crook anything and this isn't just some
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:25,727	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Weird legal rules we made up
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:27,263	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Like 20 years ago this is something
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:28,287	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That has been around
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:30,079	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	It's older than America
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:32,895	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Goes back to England in the 11th 12th century
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:34,687	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And before that some say he goes back to like
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:38,271	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	104 BC Roman times really really
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:41,855	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And the idea is I feel like the visualization is like
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:42,367	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Like a seesaw
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:44,671	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Like okay
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:47,231	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	We need to get to this perfect group of 12 people and
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:53,631	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	You know there's going to be people who are biased either side so each side gets the eliminate people you get three you get
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:55,167	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	You get for you get for and then we'll
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:56,959	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Come to this balance
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:57,727	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Send the jury
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:59,519	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	A group of people
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:00,799	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Port going to be fair
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:03,871	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Tilted their way from other side
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:10,015	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The thinking of the land up balanced yet and also the thinking was that this would give both sides more faith in the process and
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:11,039	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	At the same time
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:12,319	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Protect both sides
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:12,831	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	From
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:14,623	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Tyranny of a trial judge
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,415	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Too much power
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:17,439	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Got you okay
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:20,255	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	What happens in this case is the second trial begins
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:22,047	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Take me to the
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:24,607	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Imagine early
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:26,399	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Yeah that's that's the first thing that happens
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:28,447	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Set a scene from a well
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:29,983	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The only people that were in the courtroom
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:34,591	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Were some family members of mr. Batson his attorney a detective
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:35,871	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And me
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:36,895	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And the jury
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:40,991	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	So the reason we're talking about this case and Joe gottman and James Batson
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:45,087	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Is because the next thing that happens is Joe Gutman gets up there
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:49,695	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	He scans the jury pool and at this point he says there are 13 people left
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:50,719	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	For that were black
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:53,791	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	9 that were white and he uses his peremptory challenges
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:56,095	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The strike of 1
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:56,863	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	2
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:57,887	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	3
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:58,655	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	4
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:13:59,679	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Black jurors
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:00,191	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	They're all gone
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:02,495	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Leaving all white
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:05,311	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Do you remember striking
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:05,823	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	For minority
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:11,455	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Do I specifically remember
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:12,735	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The reason for each
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:14,271	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	No I don't
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:17,343	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I asked Joe was the reason because they were
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:18,111	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	In fact
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:19,391	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Black no
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:21,439	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I can see that they were not stricken
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:22,463	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Because of race
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:24,255	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And I remember
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:27,583	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Specifically that one of the jurors lived in the neighborhood
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:32,191	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Is exactly remember what his reasons were for all four black chairs but
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:38,079	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	What's important for our story is to know that James Batson is sitting there in the room
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:40,383	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	As all of this is happening
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:44,479	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Just completely destroyed

EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:52,927	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Not fair
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:56,255	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	He should know it's a long-standing rule he's allowed to do that
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:57,791	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Describe what we want
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:58,559	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Was he loyal white or what

EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:22,623	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I don't care this long-standing rule
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:24,927	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And he did
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:28,255	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And it all came behind that one objection
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:32,863	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	What happened
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:35,423	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Is after the jury was select

EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:43,615	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	We went up to the bench
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:44,127	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	He said
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:46,943	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Your honor you can see there's an all-white jury
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:48,991	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I would like for him to explain his strikes
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:51,807	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	But before I could get another word out of my mouth
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:53,343	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Judge Ryan
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:55,135	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Said Mr gottman does not have to
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:56,159	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Explain his rights
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:56,927	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	It's not the law
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:58,207	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Let's move on
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:00,255	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Move on
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:03,071	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	So they moved on with an all-white jury
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:04,351	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I got found guilty
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:09,215	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I got 20 years
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:12,543	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Yes
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:15,615	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Sebastian goes to prison
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:16,639	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Danville Court
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:19,455	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And he said his first move when he got there
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:21,759	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Appeal immediately
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:27,391	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And ultimately his appeal ends up in the hands of the sky David niehaus
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:29,183	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Jefferson County public
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:29,695	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Defenders
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:30,719	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Office
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:33,535	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Anyhow decide to do something
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:34,303	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Ambitious
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:35,583	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	What we did is
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:36,863	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	We call it taking
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:38,399	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	A tour of the jurisdiction
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:40,447	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Washington
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:41,471	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Khalid
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:44,543	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Healing takes illegal road trip
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:49,663	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Sesame house and his team start looking at other states looking at other regions to find out what this is
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:50,431	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The problem
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:52,479	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Elsewhere is this just something
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:54,271	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Limited to the South or is it
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:56,063	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Something else
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:58,623	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	You mean like our people in other places doing what Joe got midday
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:00,159	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	French braids
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:08,863	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And what he found is that this was happening pretty much everywhere
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:10,143	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	So
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:11,167	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The following appeal
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:12,959	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Which worked its way up through the courts
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:15,519	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And in December 1985
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:22,687	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Thank you gentlemen the cases submitted to hear arguments next year in Kentucky
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:24,991	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Case arrives at the
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:26,527	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Supreme Court of the United States
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,855	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I get a call one day
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:33,439	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	From the Associated Press that showed up
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:34,463	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	How do you feel about the
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:35,743	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Supreme Court accepting
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:39,839	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The case of James Kirkland Batson and I was almost speechless and
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:41,887	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I did
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:48,799	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Go just to observe and learn
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:51,615	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Mister chief justice and may please the court
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:53,407	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	So here's an ultimately went down
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:56,991	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Bat inside my house
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:17:59,807	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	He argues that these strikes were being used take black people off
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:04,159	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Jerry's and this is happening everywhere able to list some 25
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:05,695	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Jurisdictions and
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:09,023	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Practice violated the 14th Amendment which is equal protection
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:10,303	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And the 6th Amendment
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:15,679	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Which is the right to a jury of your peers as representative of the community as possible
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:19,519	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	So if Lewisville is like 17% black
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:21,311	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Detroit probably be about
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:22,335	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	17% black
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:23,103	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:24,383	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The prosecutor shouldn't be like
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:26,175	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Askew that without having to give a reason
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:28,479	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	First of all
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:31,551	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Kentucky's response to report
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:34,367	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	We Believe
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:38,463	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The historical nature and function of the device itself to Kentucky saying
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:43,071	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	We shouldn't have to justify these strikes the court has told us that again and again
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:45,375	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Is always been unsettled enough controlled by the court
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:47,423	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Unexplained and his practice
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:49,983	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Centuries and
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:53,055	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Yes and maybe some of uses but this is a tool that lawyers need
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:56,639	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Thank you gentlemen McKay's this semester
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:00,735	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	4 months later the court delivers
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:01,247	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Its verdict
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:04,063	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And in a seven to two decision
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:07,135	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Batten wood
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:11,999	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The court found that the prosecutor's actions for sure violated the 14th Amendment
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:16,351	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	They said racial discrimination of any kind in jury selection
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:17,119	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Is not allowed
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:24,287	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Que Dan Rather Bhai courtroom today it is illegal totes illegal even on a Grand Prix challenge it is
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:27,615	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Is it illegal for a lawyer to reject a juror on the basis of race
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:30,175	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	James Batson sentence with immediately vacate
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:32,991	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Can you send describe them
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:36,319	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	If you were in prison and you know your sentence is being
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:36,831	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Take it away
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:41,695	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Talk to break every now and then
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:42,719	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Discount fishing come up
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:45,023	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Just be hanging out playing chess
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:47,583	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I got a law in the logbooks Batson rule
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:50,911	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And that was the biggest deal
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:51,423	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Of all this
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:52,447	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The headline
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:54,751	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	This new
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:59,103	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Rett syndrome named after him
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:00,895	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Justices put new limits
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:07,295	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	What is called freedom to re-challenge the Baton Rouge the Bat signal is an echo of what James did in court that day
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:13,695	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	You see people minorities getting booted off of a jury you can say your honor I think that's an option violation
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:16,511	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	In the other side B of the defense of the prosecution
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:19,327	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Pastor provide non-racial reasons
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:23,167	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	For why they eliminated that you're in for a lot of people this is a break
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:25,983	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	This is like finally we figured out how to do this right
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:32,127	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	There was a system in place to protect everyone and that system was even extended to civil cases and eventually the women is
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:38,783	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	It was a big deal when the case was decided and the initial elation
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:40,319	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Was quickly
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:41,087	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Tempered
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:44,159	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	With a strong dose of reality
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:50,047	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	This is Jeff Robinson he's a director of the ACLU Center for chest
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:53,119	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Because what bats and prevents is
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:53,887	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Deliberate
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:55,167	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Racial
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:55,679	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Discrimination
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:59,775	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And I almost immediately
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:01,567	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	All over the country
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:04,895	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Prosecutors started training each other teaching
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:07,455	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Each other on how to get around Batson
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:10,271	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That's fine Simpson he's the director of the Equal justice initiative
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:11,551	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	In Montgomery Alabama
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:13,599	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Are there a train is all across the country
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:15,135	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Do some of these are on video
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:16,672	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And I found one
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:23,584	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Music on YouTube you got to stay these basic rules this is one of those videos this one
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:29,984	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	In the Philadelphia prosecutor named Jack man lecturing to a room full of young prosecutors on how to pick a jury
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:31,520	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Selecting black
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:38,688	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	You don't want the real educated ones and my experience black women young black women are very bad there's a
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:43,808	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Antagonism I guess maybe cuz they're dancing to respect women and their black sand
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:49,952	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	So there are downtrodden to areas and they somehow want to take it out on somebody and you don't want it to be you
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:57,888	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The crazy thing about this video is that it was film just a few months after the Batson decision
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:22:01,472	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Batson vs Kentucky I'm sure you've all become aware that case
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:04,544	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Jack man basically tells his prosecutors look we got this new rule
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:09,664	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Here's how you break it you strike the black person off the jury but just say it's for another reason
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:12,224	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Because that's what Batson required
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:17,344	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	This is a racially neutral reason
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:20,160	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	When you do have a black shirt you question them at like and
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:26,304	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Honest Little Chute that you have Mark something down that you can articulate later time if something happened
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:28,096	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Black
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:34,496	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Start with first three people write it down right then and there I'd rather ride in my little box there you know the woman had a kid
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:38,336	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	About the same age as defending and I thought you'd be sympathetic to a more
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:44,736	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	She's unemployed and I just don't like unemployed people because I find enough today before this is almost this training to create
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:46,016	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Catalog of reasons
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:51,136	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Put on the face where race-neutral just say you're excluding them because they are too tall
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:58,304	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Are there two old that person was wearing a black sweater things like well he lives in a bad neighborhood
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:23:02,912	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Person would maintain eye contact body language or they belong to a church
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:03,680	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Tattoos
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:04,704	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	What are a nurse
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:06,752	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Any of those reasons have a markdown
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:12,128	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	As long as a prosecutor doesn't say I excused that person because they're black
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:14,176	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Batson says it's completely okay
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:20,064	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I was actually working on a case this is lawyer Bryan Stevenson
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:24,928	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	My office said the time was called the southern Christmas defense with Jesus and I was in Atlanta Georgia
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:25,440	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Before I move track
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:28,000	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Alabama and when was this
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,024	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	This is 1986
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:32,864	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And we were defending someone down in Swainsboro Georgia
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:34,144	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Guy by the name of Gamble
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:37,728	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And the bathroom decision
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:38,240	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Qingdao
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:43,360	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I and objections were made with the prosecutor used his peremptory strikes
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:44,640	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Exclude all of the African-American
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:48,992	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And we said wait a minute you're on if there's a new decision Batson vs Kentucky
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:50,528	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Which means that the prosecutor can't do this
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:56,416	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And the courts at while I read baton. What this means is that the prosecutor has to give race-neutral Visa
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:58,464	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I've got my race-neutral Visa
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:01,280	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Is Weis truck this woman
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:06,400	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Because she looks just like the defendant there was an African American man to wait a minute what is that
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:08,192	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	No she doesn't
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:11,520	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	He said he did
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:15,360	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	What struck this man because he lives in South Winnsboro
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:16,896	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And that's where the defendant
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:21,504	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And we record the sale of all the black people live in South Waynesboro
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:22,272	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	All the way to
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:24,832	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That's not a reason to reason. You know that is a recent movie
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:27,136	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Pizza Hut stock one person
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:30,464	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Because this man was in the military and he was discharged
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:32,768	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	After 5 years in the military
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:34,304	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And in my experience your honor
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:38,656	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	You only get discharged honorably after an even number of years
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:41,216	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	What a juror was put back on the Stanley Cup
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:45,568	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Were you discharged from the military honorably yes I was I was actually decorated
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:48,384	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I got this medal I got this award I got these things
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:50,176	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Well I still accept the Prosecco
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:51,456	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Just waiting for excluding that
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:52,992	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	My personal favorite was
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:58,624	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The prosecutor said it gets better
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:25:00,928	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	This man because he testified
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:02,208	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That he was a mason
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:06,560	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And he said you're on I just don't want anybody who's a member of a masonic lodge
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:10,400	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	All my jewelry they have their own code their own rituals are all culture
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:11,168	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I don't want that
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:16,032	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The jury was put back on the stand we acid or are you a member of the Masonic Lodge
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:18,336	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Watching the tree said no I'm not he said I'm a brick mason
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:24,480	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And the judge says I still know what you mean I'll let you exclude that person right
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:28,320	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And so almost from the very beginning there was this
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:31,392	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Cynicism this gameplay I used to tell people
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:34,976	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Bath is not going to eliminate racial bias in jury selection
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:38,560	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	But it will make the jury selection process a lot more entertaining
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:41,376	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Y'all should come to court and just watch the show
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:47,264	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	So you not only did Batson
EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:50,336	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Not change anything but that's in made things worse
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:55,712	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	As one lawyer Steven breit put to me what bad son is really is basically
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:26:02,624	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Set of procedures to sorta legitimize and cover up the race discrimination that's going
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:03,136	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Going on
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:04,928	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	You had this
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:09,024	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Smelly putrid problem of racial discrimination in jury selection
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:10,048	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And instead of
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:11,072	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Tossing it out
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:11,584	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	We just
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:13,376	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Sprayed Febreeze
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:17,728	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	He just kind of perfumed it vaguely she cologne it's still there
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:19,776	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Begley hidden
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:22,080	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And now with the Batson rule
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:24,896	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	If you think the prosecution or the defense
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:27,200	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Is striking people off because of race
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:29,504	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	You have to call them out and then you have to
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:30,784	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Somehow
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:34,112	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Try and prove that the reason they're providing is a lie
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:35,136	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And that's
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:36,416	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Really really tough
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:39,488	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Since
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:42,816	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	1986 Ford xample in the state of Washington
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:43,584	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	There been
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:50,240	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Probably 4748 challenges on Batson issues where people have been convicted make sad waiting
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:52,544	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The prosecutors were excusing
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:54,336	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	People of color from the jury
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:55,872	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Because they were people of color
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:27:00,224	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Out of those 46 250 challenges there's been one
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:00,992	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	River
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:03,808	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The state of Tennessee has not reversed a single case
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:05,600	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Under Batson
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:08,928	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And the 30 years for it it's inside the Baton decision came out
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:10,208	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	As a result
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:15,584	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	He says there still many counties in America where the diversity of the jury is not increase
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:16,608	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Very much at all
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:21,984	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	So for example in one Louisiana Parish they looked a felony cases
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:23,776	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Is over an eight-year period
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:25,824	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And found it nearly half the black jurors
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:26,848	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Worst truck
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:29,408	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Houston County Alabama
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:30,944	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Over a five-year period
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:34,784	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Data stops at 80% of the African Americans qualify for jury service
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:35,296	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Restaurant
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:39,648	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	80% 80% and that's in debt
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:41,440	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Panda cases cell
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:44,256	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I mean if you think about that like a big percent of time Deezer
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:45,536	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Lawyers who are
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:48,352	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Going around the Baton Rouge going on the law
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:49,120	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Corn on the cob
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:51,424	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Tuition to get these all-white juries
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:53,984	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Who are then oftentimes pudding
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:54,752	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Black
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:55,520	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Mint
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:56,032	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	To death
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:57,056	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:58,592	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That reminds you some pretty dark
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:02,688	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Super basic
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:05,248	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I mean
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:07,552	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That video
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:08,576	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Training video
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:10,624	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The assumption that video is it
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:11,392	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Having black
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:12,160	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	People on the tree
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:13,184	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	It would hurt that guy
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:13,696	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Would hurt the
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:14,976	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Yeah
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:17,280	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Show me Justice
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:18,816	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Assume that or is there any
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:20,608	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Any data that would say that's even remotely
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:22,912	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Betru the hardest thing about looking at this stuff
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:24,192	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Analytically
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:25,472	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The juries are like
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:26,496	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Black Box
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:28,288	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	They don't let
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:29,312	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Journalist
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:31,104	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Akademiks
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:31,872	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	In off
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:33,408	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Study
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:34,432	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	What's going on
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:35,456	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The jury is kind of sacred.
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:36,736	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Yeah but
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:38,784	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The few times we've gotten data like that is
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:41,088	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	This group called the capital jury project that looks at
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:41,856	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Data speed
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:42,880	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	SafeLink application
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:44,160	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Because that's where the stuff ends up
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:44,928	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Living life or death
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:46,976	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	So they looked at data in
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:49,536	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Like 350 cases in 14 States
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:52,352	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Over a number of years and they found that
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:54,144	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	White man
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:57,728	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Are more likely to go for the death penalty than black men
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:29:02,336	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	When you get to sentencing that number that the difference between white and black it's really exaggerated like
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:03,616	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	White men are
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:06,432	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Are seven times more likely to want the death penalty
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:07,200	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Black person
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:09,248	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	There's another study that was done in Florida
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:13,088	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Amazon look at felony cases over like 10 years and
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:13,856	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	They found them
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:15,136	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	All-white jury pools
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:16,928	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	In Florida convicted black defendants
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:17,952	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	16
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:18,720	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Percent
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:19,232	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	More often
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:26,656	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Okay but was really interesting like that that cap was practically eliminated one at least one member of the jury pool is black
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:28,448	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Interstate but one black person
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:29,472	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And that difference
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:32,032	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Catastrophes
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:33,056	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Why I mean
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:35,616	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Oxycodone cases
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:38,432	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Usually involve cops and reason is often cited as
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:40,224	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That nope black
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:41,760	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Jurors are less like
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:42,528	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	To believe
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:44,320	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Cops
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:46,112	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Bikers are more likely to
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:47,648	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Insert some sense of
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:48,416	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Suspicion
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:48,928	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Into
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:52,768	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The Estates are the Commonwealth or whatever is testim
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:55,072	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And almost everyone talked to
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:56,864	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Gave me a version of this
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:29:59,680	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That that you know when you're blocked going to jury to deliberate more
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:03,520	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And that black people are less likely to trust law enforcement especially
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:04,544	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Jack McMahon
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:07,872	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Who was the guy we heard from in that video
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:09,408	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Anybody knows me knows I am
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:12,224	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Anti-racist
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:12,992	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Person that
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:13,504	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Could ever imagine
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:15,808	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Stone Cold liberal
EDL	00:30:17,344	00:30:20,672	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	To the nth degree but I was talking about practicality
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:21,952	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Jewelry box
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:24,512	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I still stand by that
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:25,792	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	If you're prosecute
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:28,352	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Let me ask you this
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:30,912	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And you're trying to drug test
EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:34,496	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And the defendant is going to claim that the
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:39,104	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And you're the project
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:41,152	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	What
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:42,688	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Demographic
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:44,224	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The group has had more

EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:46,528	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The police live
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:48,064	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Then

EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:50,624	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	They have seen
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:51,648	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Police
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:53,184	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Lima believe police
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:54,720	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Live more than
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:59,072	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Some white guy lives in a rich area believes that police officer every guy everything he says
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:01,888	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And so is the prosecutor you're trying to win the case
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:03,680	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And that person is not going to be
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:04,704	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The person is going to
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:05,728	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Questioning
EDL	00:31:06,240	00:31:07,008	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Witnesses
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:08,032	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And you're given the Opera
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:08,544	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Opportunity
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:12,128	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	True peremptory challenges to strike them why wouldn't you
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:13,152	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Give me a full mattress
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:13,664	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Well I guess
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:18,016	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I see the argument that you know use your peremptory challenges
EDL	00:31:18,016	00:31:22,880	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Is to get the best year you can to win but doesn't eliminating a black
EDL	00:31:22,880	00:31:26,720	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Jerry because you believe they might have certain biases against app
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:28,768	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Police officer versus a white juror
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:31,072	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	In some way violate
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:33,376	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The equal protection clauses
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:33,888	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The 14th
EDL	00:31:34,912	00:31:35,680	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I don't think so
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:39,264	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Not at all because it's not because of
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:40,032	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The color of their skin
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:42,592	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Cause of there

EDL	00:31:43,872	00:31:44,384	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And where

EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:53,600	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I think those Facts of Life in those societies
EDL	00:31:53,600	00:31:55,392	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Demographical Concepts
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:57,440	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	All stem from the color of
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:32:00,512	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Their skin
EDL	00:32:00,512	00:32:02,304	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Maybe a deeper issue that we can't deal with
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:04,352	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	But you're right
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:05,632	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	But the reality is
EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:08,704	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The reality is that that that that's what this
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:10,240	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Situation is so
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:12,288	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	So you're saying that if you're the prosecutor you
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:13,824	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	You should take out for this guy probably worse
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:15,616	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	For me he probably
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:19,456	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I believe those cops are line but I'm going to take him because I want to uphold the
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:24,320	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	There is no prosecutor in the country
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:27,904	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I want to I want to show my altruism
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:29,696	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And I'm going to keep this guy on my
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:30,720	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Jewelry who made this
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:31,232	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Believe my
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:34,560	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Because I want to be altruistic
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:36,608	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The way life is
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:52,736	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	How to solve a problem like Batson
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:59,136	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	More perfect will continue

EDL	00:33:36,512	00:33:38,048	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Basically I want to hear about this
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:40,608	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Times when a kid you know did something
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:43,680	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	It just means you lean back and say whoa
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:50,592	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:52,896	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:56,992	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:34:01,856	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:08,768	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:09,792	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Have anything to do with the test

EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:44,352	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	It's about
EDL	00:34:44,352	00:34:45,120	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Racial bias in juries
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:46,656	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I think we should
EDL	00:34:46,656	00:34:53,056	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	It's because of a case that was in front of the Supreme Court this term in case 1483
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:54,080	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	349
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:55,360	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Foster versus Chapman
EDL	00:34:55,872	00:34:59,200	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	So basic facts this is a murder case in Georgia
EDL	00:34:59,200	00:35:00,224	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	A younger black
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:04,064	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Man kills an elderly white woman the prosecutors dismiss
EDL	00:35:04,064	00:35:05,600	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	A bunch of black jurors
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:09,184	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Is and the defense having this new Batson rule says hold up
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:10,464	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Can't do that
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:15,072	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And prosecutors give these race-neutral reasons and the judge says
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:15,840	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That looks good to me
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:22,496	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Years later something sort of incredible happens through like one of those Freedom of Information Act
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:23,264	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Type
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:24,032	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Things
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:24,800	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The defense
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:25,568	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Actually gets
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:26,336	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	See

EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:37,856	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	This is one of those rare times when we pull back the curtain and we find out what the prosecutors were doing
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:40,672	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	This is lawyer Steven breit he actually argued Faust
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:43,232	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	After case in from the Supreme Court late last year
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:46,816	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And he says what you saw these notes was that the process
EDL	00:35:46,816	00:35:48,864	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Xcution they literally wrote
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:51,424	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	A little B next to the name of
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:56,032	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Each and every black juror B1 B2 B3
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:36:02,432	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Highlighting all the black sand in in green on the list of all the people summoned for jury
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:05,504	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Racial discrimination is really hard to prove
EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:08,320	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	This is actual physical proof
EDL	00:36:08,320	00:36:11,904	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Violin the state like this is the Smoking Gun
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:18,304	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	We've been waiting for so what are the what are the prosecutor how did the prosecution argue this in front of pink car
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:19,840	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Once an ultrasound they said
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:24,192	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	We were just running those bees because we wanted to make sure we noticed
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:25,728	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The black Jersey you want to keep
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:26,496	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Track them
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:28,800	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	4 months
EDL	00:36:28,800	00:36:30,848	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Prior to trial defense counsel
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:34,688	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	We're filing a bat
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:37,504	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That's the lawyer representing Georgia Beth Burton
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:42,112	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And she saying of course we're going to notice race this is the post Batson world end
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:44,416	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	We're going to no trace and we're going to write it down
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:50,304	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I would be more surprised quite frankly if there wasn't some sort of highlighting or
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:54,912	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Is that is that the reason he highlighted
EDL	00:36:55,424	00:36:58,496	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Actors in green he being the original prosecutor
EDL	00:37:03,616	00:37:06,176	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Was because he was preparing defense in case
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:11,296	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Correct. Justice Breyer asking well why didn't you make that
EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:12,832	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Argument
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:13,600	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Like
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:15,904	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	When the case was actually happening the years and years ago
EDL	00:37:20,768	00:37:22,304	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	What isn't surprising
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:24,096	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	But he never thought of it
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:28,704	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Didn't tell anybody
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:32,544	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I would say that's on
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:37,152	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The good news is that
EDL	00:37:39,200	00:37:42,272	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	In a 7 to 1 decision the Supreme Court agreed
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:44,576	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That this prosecutors reasons War
EDL	00:37:45,088	00:37:47,648	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Utterly ridiculous
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:52,256	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I'm just going to ask you is in this is clear that's in violation
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:54,048	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That's Justice Kagan
EDL	00:37:56,608	00:37:57,632	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Is that
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:38:01,472	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	This case was in front of supreme court at all
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:04,544	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Good at to get appealed up to the highest court in the land
EDL	00:38:05,056	00:38:06,336	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Before someone said
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:07,616	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Oh yeah that's about annihilation
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:08,896	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That's how hard it is
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:12,480	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And the Supreme Court so it made a force
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:13,248	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Full
EDL	00:38:13,248	00:38:14,528	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Decision 7 out of 8
EDL	00:38:15,040	00:38:16,064	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	They didn't make a new rule
EDL	00:38:17,088	00:38:18,880	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	This is not work
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:24,256	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	They didn't offer up but that's in 2.0 or they didn't double down or throw it out or do some new rule
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:25,536	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	No they said
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:27,072	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	This is really wrong but
EDL	00:38:27,072	00:38:28,864	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Didn't go as far to say
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:29,888	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Oculus doesn't work
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:30,912	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	So we still got bad
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:37,056	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	So okay if we want to diverse juries and we know that bad
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:38,080	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Doesn't really work
EDL	00:38:39,616	00:38:40,384	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	What do we do
EDL	00:38:40,896	00:38:41,664	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	So I asked
EDL	00:38:41,664	00:38:42,432	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Everyone I talked to
EDL	00:38:42,944	00:38:43,456	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That question
EDL	00:38:44,480	00:38:45,760	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Got a lot of different answers
EDL	00:38:45,760	00:38:46,528	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	But this was the
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:48,064	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	One and done agency
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:49,856	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Margaret is a professor of law
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:50,880	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	IIT should
EDL	00:38:50,880	00:38:52,416	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Chicago-kent College of Law
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:54,976	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	What I'd like the court to do
EDL	00:38:54,976	00:38:56,256	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Is eliminate
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:38:58,560	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Peremptory challenges
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:39:01,376	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Again steambrite is a lawyer we have to
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:04,960	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Supreme Court gives you these rules
EDL	00:39:04,960	00:39:06,240	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Appropriate challenges
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:08,544	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And it says
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:09,312	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	What weight am I
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:11,872	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Don't just break people
EDL	00:39:15,456	00:39:17,504	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Even Jack McMahon the guy from that
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:18,784	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Training video he was over
EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:25,696	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	We've had 30 years of experiment with Batson and it's not working
EDL	00:39:25,696	00:39:27,232	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	We now have to go the route
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:33,632	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That Justice Marshall suggested back in Batson
EDL	00:39:33,632	00:39:40,032	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	So in the bathroom decision you've got Thurgood Marshall like the most
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:44,128	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Important attorney in the Civil Rights Movement turn the first black Supreme Court Justice
EDL	00:39:44,128	00:39:45,920	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Key in the same paragraph
EDL	00:39:45,920	00:39:47,456	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Call the Baton decision
EDL	00:39:47,456	00:39:48,224	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Historic
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:50,784	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And then said this isn't going to work
EDL	00:39:50,784	00:39:52,320	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	This decision isn't going to do anything
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:56,928	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	It he was basically a fortune teller he said both those things in the same breath
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:40:00,512	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	In one paragraph he starts about going this decision today
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:02,560	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Historic by the end of the paragraph
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:05,632	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	You're never going to fix this until you get rid of print through challenge
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:12,032	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Set an alarm for 9 breakfast just do away with from three strikes
EDL	00:40:12,032	00:40:16,384	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Constitution
EDL	00:40:16,384	00:40:19,456	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Both sides are denied
EDL	00:40:20,480	00:40:26,880	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Peremptory challenge
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:27,904	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Challenges
EDL	00:40:27,904	00:40:30,208	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	You will have discrimination
EDL	00:40:30,208	00:40:33,792	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	What surprised me most in reporting this story is that like I talk to people
EDL	00:40:34,304	00:40:36,352	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	On the left side of the criminal desk
EDL	00:40:36,352	00:40:39,424	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	On the right side of the Criminal Justice System ACLU types
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:42,496	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Law professors academics conservative
EDL	00:40:42,496	00:40:44,032	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Secure is all of these people when you say
EDL	00:40:44,544	00:40:49,664	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Guys we got to get rid of printer towns right almost every single one will say no
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:50,688	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	No
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:57,088	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That's a crucially important to let you know it's an easy solution just get rid of
EDL	00:40:57,088	00:40:58,368	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Peremptory snow helmet
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:05,024	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Italian style are legal editor law professor sunwolf from Santa Clara University and lawyer David niehaus again
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:05,792	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And here's
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:07,328	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	One of the arguments
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:13,216	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I heard if you take these things away all the decisions about striking jurors would be made by the judge
EDL	00:41:13,728	00:41:17,568	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	On the question whether Jerrika be fair and impartial and for that to work
EDL	00:41:17,568	00:41:19,104	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I thought you have to have a fair judge
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:20,640	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And
EDL	00:41:20,640	00:41:22,176	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	There are an awful lot of judges
EDL	00:41:22,688	00:41:23,712	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Who aren't there
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:26,016	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Here's another argument I heard from Jackie Robinson
EDL	00:41:26,016	00:41:26,784	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Sing from the ACLU
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:28,832	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And this is based on my
EDL	00:41:28,832	00:41:31,136	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Experience of 34 years in the criminal justice
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:34,720	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Jeff Robinson says if you can find some way to take race
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:37,536	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Out of the equation for entries are
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:38,816	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Super useful
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:40,096	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Annie told me about this one k
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:42,144	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Very high-profile homicide
EDL	00:41:42,144	00:41:43,168	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Case in the state of Washington
EDL	00:41:43,936	00:41:47,264	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	This case was incredibly complicated and also
EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:49,312	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Potentially involved
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:50,336	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	A course
EDL	00:41:50,336	00:41:51,360	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Confession
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:52,895	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Buy some undercover cop
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:53,663	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Sand
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:54,687	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	There's a police officer
EDL	00:41:54,687	00:41:55,455	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Surrounded your iPad
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:41:56,991	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	He says
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:41:58,015	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I can be fair
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:42:00,575	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I know the police officers that investigated this
EDL	00:42:01,087	00:42:02,879	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Pyside worked with him before
EDL	00:42:02,879	00:42:05,439	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I think they're really good people but don't worry
EDL	00:42:05,439	00:42:06,463	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I can be fair
EDL	00:42:06,463	00:42:07,999	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Everything about his back
EDL	00:42:08,767	00:42:09,535	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Was saying
EDL	00:42:10,047	00:42:12,351	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I do not want this man to serve on this
EDL	00:42:13,119	00:42:14,655	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	But he was saying
EDL	00:42:14,655	00:42:15,423	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I can be fair
EDL	00:42:16,191	00:42:18,239	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I could not exclude him
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:19,519	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Moana challenge
EDL	00:42:19,519	00:42:20,031	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Call
EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:21,567	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Why not
EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:27,967	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Because he said he could be fair the fact that he's a police officer doesn't mean he can't be fair it isn't saying I'm
EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:34,367	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I know some of these people involved in this case enough to get him dismissed for cause it's enough to get more questioning but how well do
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:35,391	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	You know I'm not very well
EDL	00:42:35,903	00:42:41,279	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	So you saying that case if you said okay. I like to dismiss jurors 17-4 cause the judge would say there's not a wreck
EDL	00:42:42,047	00:42:44,095	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I don't think any judge in this country
EDL	00:42:44,095	00:42:46,655	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	What dismiss that juror for cause
EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:48,959	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And so a peremptory challenge is important
EDL	00:42:49,471	00:42:50,751	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	So
EDL	00:42:50,751	00:42:55,359	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Watched more jury selection videos on YouTube than any person
EDL	00:42:55,359	00:42:56,127	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Evershed
EDL	00:42:56,127	00:42:56,895	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And
EDL	00:42:57,663	00:43:00,991	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	It's this amazing thing where you see these people but not necessarily use
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:02,271	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	To being in a courtroom
EDL	00:43:02,271	00:43:05,343	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	There's certainly not used to being grilled in public
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:07,135	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	500 people in suits
EDL	00:43:07,135	00:43:08,927	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Take it up there to the jury panel
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:14,047	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And they got to ask these questions in the trial
EDL	00:43:14,559	00:43:16,607	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Over and over
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:18,655	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Can you return a partial
EDL	00:43:18,655	00:43:24,543	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Yes sir you're like a blank slate you just got to listen to the evidence can you do all that
EDL	00:43:25,311	00:43:26,591	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Nobody says no
EDL	00:43:27,103	00:43:28,127	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Everyone feels like
EDL	00:43:28,127	00:43:31,455	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Yes I can be fair
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:35,551	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I'm thinking I could I can be totally unbiased
EDL	00:43:35,551	00:43:39,391	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And I think some of them believe that they can actually do this nearly impossible task
EDL	00:43:39,903	00:43:44,511	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And others they know they can't but they might say yes anyway anyone who tries the case
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:45,279	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Believe me
EDL	00:43:45,279	00:43:46,815	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Knows the bias Jersey
EDL	00:43:47,327	00:43:53,727	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Comment they don't reveal things they lie about things for people that when you're crushing them in a jury that you know they're lying to you
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:58,335	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Trying to get onto jewelry or trying to get off the jury bias people are being allowed to serve
EDL	00:43:58,335	00:44:03,455	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	So any tools that can help reduce the number of biased yours and yours
EDL	00:44:03,455	00:44:04,735	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Is essential to just
EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:08,063	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	So yeah if you got a really
EDL	00:44:08,063	00:44:14,463	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Crappie outlook on chores and humans then maybe you need more friend through challenges but the way Jeffrey Robinson put it to me was that if you're using friends WeChat
EDL	00:44:14,463	00:44:15,743	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Challenge the right way
EDL	00:44:15,743	00:44:17,279	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	It forces you to be like
EDL	00:44:17,279	00:44:18,815	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Equal opportunity
EDL	00:44:18,815	00:44:19,327	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Suspicious
EDL	00:44:19,839	00:44:20,351	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Suspicious of
EDL	00:44:21,375	00:44:21,887	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Everyone
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:23,423	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And that's
EDL	00:44:23,423	00:44:24,447	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The only way to be fair
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:25,983	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	My parents
EDL	00:44:25,983	00:44:29,823	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	We're both active in the civil rights movement in Memphis Tennessee
EDL	00:44:29,823	00:44:32,383	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Is active as two people you could ever want to meet
EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:32,895	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Both black
EDL	00:44:34,431	00:44:36,991	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I would never let my mother
EDL	00:44:36,991	00:44:39,295	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Set on a criminal defense jury
EDL	00:44:39,295	00:44:42,879	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Because my mother's view about black defendants was
EDL	00:44:42,879	00:44:45,951	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	You're the reason I have to lock the door in my neighborhood
EDL	00:44:45,951	00:44:49,279	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	You're the reason that I get disrespected when I go out into the
EDL	00:44:49,279	00:44:50,047	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Community
EDL	00:44:50,047	00:44:51,327	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And I'm going to take it out on
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:54,655	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	My father's position would be
EDL	00:44:54,655	00:45:00,031	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I wouldn't believe a police officer if he told me it was raining and the water was coming down on my head
EDL	00:45:00,031	00:45:02,079	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And so what this is about
EDL	00:45:02,079	00:45:02,847	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Is
EDL	00:45:02,847	00:45:03,615	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Actually
EDL	00:45:04,383	00:45:06,431	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Putting into effect what the rules say
EDL	00:45:07,199	00:45:10,015	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Talk to jurors and find out what they think
EDL	00:45:10,015	00:45:11,807	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	But what about Thurgood Marshall's idea that
EDL	00:45:12,319	00:45:18,719	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	You know if you have learned through challenges if you give people a way to discriminate they will discriminate
EDL	00:45:18,719	00:45:19,231	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Well
EDL	00:45:20,767	00:45:22,559	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I was born in 1956
EDL	00:45:23,071	00:45:27,935	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	It's on 1954 Thurgood Marshall argued Brown versus the Board of Education
EDL	00:45:28,703	00:45:29,471	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Which
EDL	00:45:29,471	00:45:30,239	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Had
EDL	00:45:30,239	00:45:32,799	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	A significant impact on my life
EDL	00:45:32,799	00:45:35,103	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Thurgood Marshall was someone that I
EDL	00:45:35,103	00:45:39,711	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I have respected and someone I admired virtually my entire life
EDL	00:45:39,711	00:45:43,807	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	But I can't agree with him that I want all peremptory challenges eliminate
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:48,415	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And why do you think Thurgood Marshall Justice Marshall went straight to
EDL	00:45:48,415	00:45:51,231	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	No print I think Justice Marshall concluded that
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:53,791	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	He did not have faith in America
EDL	00:45:54,559	00:45:55,583	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	To be able
EDL	00:45:55,583	00:45:56,863	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	To make these kind of decision
EDL	00:45:57,631	00:45:59,679	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And I understand why you concluded that
EDL	00:46:00,191	00:46:01,727	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And you do you have that face
EDL	00:46:05,055	00:46:05,567	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I still do
EDL	00:46:07,359	00:46:09,407	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And how long that will last I don't know
EDL	00:46:09,407	00:46:10,943	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	But I still do right now
EDL	00:46:17,599	00:46:19,135	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Robinson says that
EDL	00:46:19,135	00:46:20,159	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	To give up on this
EDL	00:46:20,159	00:46:24,255	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Parentheses is like giving up on who we might be one day
EDL	00:46:25,023	00:46:27,071	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Because of who we are right now
EDL	00:46:27,583	00:46:29,375	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That's conceding
EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:33,727	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	That we are so divided by race that we will never be able
EDL	00:46:33,727	00:46:35,007	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	To try and fix it
EDL	00:46:35,007	00:46:36,543	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And I'm not prepared to conceive
EDL	00:46:41,663	00:46:44,223	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Okay one last thing for my trip to Louisville
EDL	00:46:45,759	00:46:46,527	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	What's up Shane
EDL	00:46:48,319	00:46:49,343	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	All right
EDL	00:46:50,879	00:46:51,647	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Thunder blew me away
EDL	00:46:52,671	00:46:55,743	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Banjo getting it I'm a teacher at Central High School
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:46:57,279	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Also an attorney at law
EDL	00:46:57,279	00:47:00,095	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I'm James Batson truck driver in
EDL	00:47:00,607	00:47:02,911	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Construction worker amongst other things
EDL	00:47:02,911	00:47:04,703	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I probably should add that on the
EDL	00:47:04,703	00:47:07,007	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Former prosecutor of mr. bathrooms case
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:14,687	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Joe gottman and James Batson those two people whose conflict in a courtroom back in 1983 gave us the bat
EDL	00:47:14,687	00:47:15,199	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Rock and roll
EDL	00:47:16,223	00:47:18,527	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	They are now in 2016
EDL	00:47:19,039	00:47:19,551	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Prince
EDL	00:47:20,575	00:47:23,135	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I'll talk to him about time you have to
EDL	00:47:23,135	00:47:24,415	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Yep we're friends now
EDL	00:47:24,415	00:47:27,743	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	How often is it that a prosecutor becomes friends with someone
EDL	00:47:28,767	00:47:29,535	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Helps convey
EDL	00:47:30,047	00:47:33,887	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Not not often I mean retired from a
EDL	00:47:34,399	00:47:37,215	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Prosecuting Austin 2001
EDL	00:47:37,215	00:47:38,495	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Hit Cena
EDL	00:47:39,519	00:47:40,799	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Too many awful things
EDL	00:47:41,823	00:47:46,943	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	To make a long story short it was time for me to do something else
EDL	00:47:46,943	00:47:49,759	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And starts teaching at a high school in Louisville
EDL	00:47:49,759	00:47:51,039	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	80% black
EDL	00:47:51,039	00:47:53,343	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Where do we
EDL	00:47:53,343	00:47:54,623	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Posing drug testing covered
EDL	00:47:56,159	00:47:57,439	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Jackson
EDL	00:47:58,463	00:47:59,999	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Well drug testing in schools
EDL	00:48:00,511	00:48:02,815	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Seems like a good idea but in actuality
EDL	00:48:03,327	00:48:07,935	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Tell the day I visited Joe gottman's classroom which is like a full-on Mach
EDL	00:48:07,935	00:48:09,215	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Courtroom in
EDL	00:48:09,215	00:48:09,983	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Classroom
EDL	00:48:09,983	00:48:11,263	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	He's doing his mock trials with a
EDL	00:48:13,823	00:48:16,639	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I'll be allowed in schools and public schools cuz if no funding
EDL	00:48:16,639	00:48:17,919	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	When it's all said and done
EDL	00:48:18,431	00:48:19,967	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I would prefer to be known
EDL	00:48:20,479	00:48:22,015	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	More 4
EDL	00:48:22,015	00:48:23,807	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	The accomplishments in this classroom
EDL	00:48:24,319	00:48:25,343	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Jennifer Batson
EDL	00:48:28,159	00:48:31,487	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	As for James at the batting cages
EDL	00:48:31,999	00:48:33,535	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Eventually
EDL	00:48:33,535	00:48:34,559	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Illegal
EDL	00:48:34,559	00:48:35,583	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Activities
EDL	00:48:35,583	00:48:37,375	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Andy Roebuck
EDL	00:48:37,375	00:48:38,143	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	War on jail
EDL	00:48:38,911	00:48:39,935	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Concept
EDL	00:48:39,935	00:48:41,215	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Me trying to get people
EDL	00:48:41,215	00:48:42,239	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Stop doing crime
EDL	00:48:42,239	00:48:45,311	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And the books actually you how these two sort of met up again
EDL	00:48:45,311	00:48:49,663	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	One day a few years ago James came to Jose school to give him a copy
EDL	00:48:49,663	00:48:55,551	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	He gave me a copy of his book and asked me if I'd look over it I wanted his opinion on it I read the book that night actually
EDL	00:48:56,575	00:48:58,623	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	50 books into the school system
EDL	00:48:58,623	00:48:59,903	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Where is Jefferson County now
EDL	00:49:03,743	00:49:05,535	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	What happened in the past is in the past
EDL	00:49:06,303	00:49:08,863	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	30 years ago he did what he did I did what I did
EDL	00:49:10,399	00:49:10,911	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Let It Go
EDL	00:49:11,423	00:49:16,031	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	As far as a legacy the Batson challenge goes it's really interesting to hear them talk about it
EDL	00:49:16,031	00:49:17,311	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Especially because
EDL	00:49:17,311	00:49:19,871	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	In the eyes of a lot of people who know these issues
EDL	00:49:20,383	00:49:22,431	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Joe was a villain that was always
EDL	00:49:22,431	00:49:24,223	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Painful part about
EDL	00:49:24,223	00:49:25,247	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Decision in Batson
EDL	00:49:25,759	00:49:27,551	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Is the label of being a racist prostitute
EDL	00:49:29,087	00:49:30,623	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Well that was a horrible lie
EDL	00:49:31,647	00:49:32,927	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Yeah I mean so horrible
EDL	00:49:33,439	00:49:35,487	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	But that's in started
EDL	00:49:35,487	00:49:37,791	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	I needed discussion and I need a change
EDL	00:49:38,303	00:49:39,839	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	On jury selection in America
EDL	00:49:40,351	00:49:41,375	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Can maybe I was just
EDL	00:49:43,423	00:49:44,447	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	They're Weatherby
EDL	00:49:44,447	00:49:45,215	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Fate or whatever
EDL	00:49:46,239	00:49:47,775	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	But this was the start
EDL	00:49:47,775	00:49:48,543	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Change
EDL	00:49:55,455	00:49:57,503	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Take it for what it's worth
EDL	00:49:58,783	00:50:01,087	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	Maybe if Robinson's right we can look at all this
EDL	00:50:01,599	00:50:02,367	| radiolab_podcast16mpobjectanyway |	And
