EDL	00:00:47,616	00:00:49,152	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Where in the Heartland Nebraska
EDL	00:00:49,664	00:00:50,944	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Seneca Nebraska
EDL	00:00:51,456	00:00:54,528	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	This tiny little town in Central West
EDL	00:00:54,528	00:00:55,552	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Nebraska
EDL	00:00:55,552	00:00:56,320	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Okay
EDL	00:00:56,320	00:00:58,880	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	It's near the town of Mullen Nebraska what you got
EDL	00:00:59,392	00:01:05,792	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	You know obviously also don't know this is Matthew Hanson
EDL	00:01:05,792	00:01:12,192	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	He is a reporter with the with the Omaha World-Herald and a couple months back you got in touch with us because
EDL	00:01:12,192	00:01:14,752	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	The story about this town right so
EDL	00:01:14,752	00:01:21,152	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I I got an email from a woman who lives a couple miles outside of town she's really upset cuz back in 2014
EDL	00:01:21,152	00:01:22,944	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	The town was
EDL	00:01:22,944	00:01:23,456	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Split in half
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:28,064	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And in fact there was a group of people in the town who were circulating a petition
EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:29,344	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Petition
EDL	00:01:29,856	00:01:30,880	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	That would end the town
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:36,256	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	We circulate a petition to end the town do you want to be in town anymore
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:39,584	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Right by law if you have
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:41,376	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Enough signatures on a petition
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:47,264	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	You can get things on the ballot and the question that ended up on the ballot was should Seneca
EDL	00:01:47,264	00:01:48,288	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Cease to exist
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:56,224	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And it's split that a group of people to try to end their own town
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:57,760	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	It got us thinking about
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:02:04,160	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Let's put that seem to be the selection right now and it occurred to us that maybe just maybe this tiny little town in
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:07,744	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	In the middle of Nebraska might have something to say about the rest of us
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:10,048	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Let's back up there
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:12,096	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	When when did
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:14,400	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	All is well in Seneca until what
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:20,032	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	It started with the horses
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:23,616	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Actually let me sit back there a lot of horses in Seneca
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:25,920	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Most people in Seneca ride horses
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:27,200	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Imini on them
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:30,272	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	But there were these six particular horses
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:31,552	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Right in the middle of town
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:32,320	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:33,856	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	You know that the split
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:35,136	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Sort of started
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:41,536	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Right there so I got so curious about what went down in Seneca
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:47,936	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	That I flew to Denver one two three four five five and a half hours into the Sandhills of West
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:54,336	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Central Nebraska. Let's see if we can get anything on the radio here rolling sand dune
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:03:00,736	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Carpeting grass at the ranch catalog is another Ranch what's this Wednesday and smack dab in the middle of the Sandhills
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:07,136	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Is Seneca after many hours and many miles we
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:08,160	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	We are here okay
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:09,440	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	So why
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:12,512	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Cathy's Rolling Hills that are green. With these yellow flowers
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:20,192	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Junction 86a Seneca okay with that kind of an old big red sign that says welcome
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:21,472	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Seneca with a big
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:24,288	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Okay and get there it looks like
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:27,616	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Starting to drive through town a picture postcard
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:32,224	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Small town from yesteryear found by railroad tracks
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:33,504	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Direct got the railroad I'm taking a
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:36,576	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I mean really pretty to my right
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:37,856	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	An abandoned house
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:39,136	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	To my left
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,672	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Another boarded-up house
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:47,328	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Another street with absolutely nothing on it no gas station all boarded up another rundown house
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:48,352	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	It says no trespassing
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:51,680	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And just really tiny I think one into the other is
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:52,704	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	One eighth of a mile
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:53,472	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And we're done
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:56,032	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	So there you go
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:58,080	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	At 30 miles per hour it takes
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:58,592	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	10 seconds
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:00,640	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Okay turning around in

EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:15,551	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And there is a big fuss about them and their abuse of these animals
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:17,855	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	So sure these animals are being abused

EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,943	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And I think they wanted to
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:21,247	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	To keep us lower class people in line
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,271	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And so

EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:54,015	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	The ordinances were were necessary because of the situation that we were presented with
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:55,551	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	There was no elitism
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:58,623	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	They weren't on that board to dictate to anybody on this town
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:09:00,671	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	They need to cover nuts for the horses.
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:02,975	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Where you started and then
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:05,023	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	You had people that was trying to

EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:12,959	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And if you look around a little town you'll see the ones that take pride in what they have
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:15,263	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I'm sorry
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:19,103	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	So
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:20,895	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	The town was split into
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:24,735	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I mean we could have liked each other
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:28,831	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	But we've had nothing but constant
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:29,599	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Constance

EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:52,799	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	They make fun of Seneca
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:53,567	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Quite a bit

EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:02,271	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	It's not like it used to be
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:06,879	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I mean years and years ago this just be at the neatest little town yet everyone live in
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:10,207	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And then it just I don't know it just went
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:10,975	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Downhill
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:16,607	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I mean that
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:18,911	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	That's the only way you can say it
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:19,935	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Cindy Hansen
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:21,215	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Wanted save the town
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:23,263	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Unofficial Town distorted
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:25,567	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Started smacking
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:27,871	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	73 I believe it was
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:30,943	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Stop being a division point
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:32,991	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	So the trains no longer stopped here
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:37,599	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	So that did away with the three hotels the 24-hour cafe
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:43,999	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	The man that had Filling Station pulled out in front of a semi at Mullen that ended that business
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:45,279	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	His brother had the shoe shop
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:50,399	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And he died of a heart attack sitting there working on his shoes
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:53,215	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	The lady that had the variety store
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:59,359	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Tripped on a kitten and broke her hip that close that and
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:03,967	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Remind me to print
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:11,135	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Anyhow
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:13,695	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Seneca really start dying
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:16,255	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Presley
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:17,023	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Get away from there
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:21,119	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	What's so I guess I'm here because I'm trying to talk to as many people as I can
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:24,447	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I understand what happened with the whole voting corporate
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:26,751	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Again
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:30,079	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Sabre Milly it started out that there was
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:30,591	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	6 horses
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:34,175	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	They were up in mud up to their probably belly
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:36,735	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And I think
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:39,295	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	One of them had to be put down because it was
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:41,087	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Kicked this is how close they were
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:44,159	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Together anyway I mean I'm an animal lover
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:45,951	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I wanted something done about it
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:46,719	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	7-Eleven
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:47,743	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Instead so
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:48,767	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	We had a meeting
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:56,447	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	The board tried to tell him that's not sanitary we did this
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:13:02,847	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Scusset you know we going to get the horses gone that's the purpose of the the ordinate but it was not just
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:09,247	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Judith Brown and they wanted to get rid of all the horses all the cattle all the chickens that is
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:10,015	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Ridiculous
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:11,039	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Chappie chicken
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:17,439	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	But do you want your chickens do they run around town people are so afraid that their animals were going to be taken away
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:18,975	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And then
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:20,511	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Eventually
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:23,327	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	The board members forbid people to have animals
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:24,863	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	That was the gist of it
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:28,191	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And so more and more and more the count.
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:35,103	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	There's a group of people here in a group of people here nobody gets along nobody on the
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:40,479	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Town board with speak to anybody at which course then that just mad I just yell at him louder
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:46,879	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Certain people that I just give hand gesture
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:53,279	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I said things like my dog doesn't want to be friends with your dog it was awful
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:54,303	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Terry bison
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:14:00,191	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Can I have appointment to your time to talk and the town
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:06,591	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Got ugly they started taking pictures of people's places and put it on Facebook and say how they
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:11,967	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I didn't clean up their property and just public shaming people this was the same Seneca people that were posting
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:18,879	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Supposedly you know there were aggressive comments that we did have the sheriff come up did anyone tell you
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:25,279	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Are you that it was just out of control I mean Xanax you know I took a lot of
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:28,095	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	It was a very unhappy
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:33,215	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Time and so finally people started going around with a petition
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:40,127	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	To get the onion corporation on the ballot we thought we will just unincorporate
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:44,479	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Corporate unincorporate unincorporated our village
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:49,087	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	There are agitators in every group
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:15:00,351	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Okay that's me that seems kind of like the nuclear option here right like we're just going to blow the whole thing up
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,887	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Oh yes absolutely
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:05,983	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I think that
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:07,775	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Sense of shared community
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:10,591	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Was just slowly dissolving
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:11,871	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Year-by-year
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:15,199	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Again Matthew Henson of the Omaha World-Herald
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:20,831	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And it didn't have it had probably to do with what was happening Seneca but I also believe that I had to do was happen in the United States
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:23,135	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Sort of the idea that
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:24,671	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Winning the argument
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:27,231	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	It is more important
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:28,255	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Then
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:30,047	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	The much harder job
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:33,887	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Of coming together and say okay we disagree on this
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:35,167	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Let's find
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:35,679	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	A
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:37,215	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	A solution to our
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:48,223	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I'm having a little trouble finding out what about the hot like how close is this
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:54,367	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	The sense in the town was certainly that this thing was just a dead heat really split right down the middle

EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:22,847	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	God awful trouble trouble
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:26,943	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Happy town was so upset with the town in the government and the people of the town
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:28,991	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	That they were circulating a petition
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:31,807	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	That would end the town itself
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:34,879	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I mean I got where they were upset
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:39,743	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	But I certainly don't get the idea that the solution is 2
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:45,887	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	In this place that is existed since 1888 this again is not to Hansen reporter for the Omaha World-Herald

EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:50,495	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And why why did that bother you because I'm from a small town
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:52,287	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I could imagine it
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:54,079	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Happening to my town
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:58,175	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	A&i I can also empathize with a frustration

EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:55,775	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	It is
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:57,055	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Because
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:20:02,175	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Been a town 420 cm
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:02,687	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	So
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:06,015	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	What is it what does it mean to be a town
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:09,855	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	What does it mean it means Neighbors coming together
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:11,903	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	For the good of each other
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:14,207	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	When my husband died
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:15,487	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	He died in Texas

EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:22,655	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Having a graveside service out there at Cemetery
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:25,471	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Well the time people wouldn't hear that
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:29,311	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	They had a big meal prepared my yard was mowed
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:32,127	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	The water was turned on everything was ready to go
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:34,431	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:35,711	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	It became a fool
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:36,735	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Service
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:38,527	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	What is Edgefield
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:40,319	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Felt like home
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:44,159	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Like the way you're supposed to feel you know
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:46,207	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Warm and wanted
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:53,887	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	You see they're talking about something that used to be
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:56,191	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Again to the brown who wanted to end the town
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:58,495	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	They wanted to preserve it the way it was
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:21:01,823	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And I agree that used to be a lot of fun
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:06,431	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	But that's true of any Town up and down this Railroad
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:08,223	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	If they're trying to
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:11,039	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Preserve it then what are you trying to do
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:14,111	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	You're just accepting that we're going downhill here
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:17,184	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	No I'm accepting that
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:18,976	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I myself
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:23,840	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Do any better than this for myself as an aging woman
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:26,144	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I've only lived here twenty years
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:27,936	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	But I'm from here

EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:42,784	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Like I don't care
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:43,808	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	About my house
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:45,088	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Falling down

EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:58,656	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Didn't put enough for years
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:21:59,424	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Could do that
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:05,568	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Was that the nerve that was being touched your bad because you want to live this way yes
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:09,408	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	These people saying we can be proud of our town we can
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:11,968	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Make it hustle and bustle
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:13,760	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	So they're saying nothing you're saying
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:15,040	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	No we can be proud of
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:15,808	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Just the way it is now
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:16,320	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Yeah

EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:24,512	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	When did you first hear about
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:26,048	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	The petition going around
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:27,584	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Car wash
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:31,680	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Again Millie from the safe Seneca side
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:36,800	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I think the same day it was going around I heard about it
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:38,848	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And how how did you feel in that mode
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:42,176	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	It was horrible it really was it was just
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:44,992	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	It was more than frustrating it was
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:48,320	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Just like somebody punches you in the gut
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:51,904	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	She lets all the air you know it's just
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:53,696	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	It's the sad
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:59,584	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Mostly it just seemed like if we could get rid of this unbelievable piece
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:00,352	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Bureaucracy
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:02,912	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	We could just live here
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:07,520	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	So finally the incorporation it got on the ballot
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:11,616	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	At the regular election where you do the Senators and all that
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:18,784	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	We had a special ballot for Seneca where we voted for the town and would it or would it not be a name
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:19,552	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Incorporate
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:20,576	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	What did you feel when
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:26,208	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I don't remember feeling anything except I've got to get in there and vote
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:29,792	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Dim if you don't mind just telling me how you about it
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:31,840	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Oh I voted to the unincorporated
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:41,312	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I voted to keep the Town Incorporated incorporate I voted to keep the town
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:43,616	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And then she said okay that's the last Seneca Valley

EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:57,440	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Can you explain the night of the election and what what actually happened
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:24:02,048	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Well you know we have internet access so we were watching the election results
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:04,608	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	On the internet to see how it came out
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:11,008	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Who is we are there were I don't remember the four or five of us six of us maybe I'm not sure who all was there
EDL	00:24:11,008	00:24:14,336	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	What's the weather would you like refreshing the page over and over again how did that
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:20,736	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	No we knew about what time they'll be on you know we gave him an hour or so and we logged on and
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:21,248	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Song
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:23,808	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	We saw that
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:25,344	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	The Village was unincorporated
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:28,160	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	It was by one vote
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:35,072	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	It was 15 to 16 we lost our town
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:36,352	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Sandy Hanson again
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:37,376	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	What was that
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:42,240	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I can't stay at Public Radio
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:48,640	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	What was lost the day after they decided to abolish the town
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:52,224	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Sheriff come down with him I don't know what they thought we were going to
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:54,272	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Shoot him off with guns or what
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:25:00,416	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	But the sheriff came down they took the greater they took the tractor took our snow plow
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:01,440	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:05,024	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	We no longer have our Street Maintenance our lights
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:07,072	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Maybe your identity
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:07,840	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I don't know
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:10,656	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	We never had much here but we didn't ask for much
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:12,192	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I mean
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:12,704	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	We lost
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:13,728	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	We lost
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:17,056	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Sunny kobe taken off the map
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:20,128	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And if it isn't on the map where they can look it up
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:22,688	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Mayberry nor nobody even knows it's there
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:27,040	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Why I cried but I mean it hurt
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:30,112	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Janet Jackson again
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:33,440	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	People are moving away from ready to go
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:36,256	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	We're all ready to leave
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:39,584	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	We don't have anybody there's been nobody move here since
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:41,120	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Nobody
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:43,424	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	It sounds like you're saying the future is gone
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:48,032	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I wouldn't say it's gone but I would say it's very very limited in unlikely
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:51,104	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Yes I am famotidine incorporate
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:55,456	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Again Terry Hartman
EDL	00:25:55,456	00:25:56,480	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I love this town
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:26:00,576	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And I think the people who voted to unincorporated
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:04,160	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Are the people who wanted to keep things the way they were
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:05,952	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	We didn't want to change
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:08,256	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I know everything has to
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:08,768	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	To change but
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:10,560	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	But I didn't know what else
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:13,120	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	To stop the fighting
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:15,168	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	You know this is my hometown to
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:17,472	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I don't know how to explain it is
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:20,544	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	It just got so ugly and out of hand and
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:24,384	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Some of the members of the village board for just crazy
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:26,432	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	But the town board
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:27,968	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Was just three members
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:28,736	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Millie
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:30,016	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	They have to do
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:32,064	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Really what
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:33,856	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	The majority of the time once
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:34,368	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	To do
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:36,672	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Otherwise we can get rid of them
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:39,488	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Do you believe in the Democracy of Senate
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:41,792	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I believe in democracy
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:45,120	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Does that make me thin idiot
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:49,472	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I mean I live in Hope
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:49,984	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	You know
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:57,152	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	It just it really
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:58,176	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Felt like
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:02,784	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Seneca had lost something essential
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:07,136	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	When were talking about basic American democracy
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:09,696	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Again Matthew Hanson of the Omaha World-Herald
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:13,280	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And it worried me to see that in part because I could feel that
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:15,072	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And still feel bad happening
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:16,864	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	On a national level
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:17,888	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Dick the kind of
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:20,960	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Just completely black
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:23,776	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Conversation
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:24,800	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Around
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:25,824	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Shared
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:27,616	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Values or
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:28,896	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Compromise
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:31,712	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I've got a smoke more
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:32,480	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Drink more
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:35,296	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And one last time
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:36,064	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Okay
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:37,088	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Judith Brown
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:38,112	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	So
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:43,744	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Can I tell you what I want to hear
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:46,048	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Maybe the strongest argument for
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:48,096	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Keeping Seneca
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:49,120	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	But town on the books
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:52,448	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Is that then there was some sort of framework
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:55,264	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	To force those two
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:57,056	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Communities within the town
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:59,104	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	To be together and to think together
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:01,152	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And with that now gone
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:04,736	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	There is now no communication no compromise
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:10,624	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	None of those people had anything to do with us before accepted
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:13,440	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Continually criticized
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:14,208	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	We were
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:15,744	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	So
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:18,048	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	We couldn't compromise with
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:20,096	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	These people they were not rational
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:22,656	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	All rationality was gone by then
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:27,520	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And what's going to happen with this next election
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:33,920	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	What America is full of diverse opinions and it has managed to work and I guess if we take what happened
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:34,688	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Here
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:37,760	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And if we apply that model to the rest of the United States
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:40,064	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Like it's not a town then what
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:42,880	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	We have the county we have the state
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:45,952	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And the little town without those hateful people in it
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:48,000	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Is really quite lovely
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:51,072	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	But it's not a townhouse
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:53,120	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I don't know why you think that
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:55,168	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Officially right
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:28:58,496	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	But it is a tell
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:29:00,032	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Here we are
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:03,616	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	I'm going to leave here until I die and so is Rose

EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:10,272	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	So you would say that even though on the book Seneca no longer
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:10,784	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Exist
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:13,088	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	Seneca still exist
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:14,624	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	And we're still two tribes
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:23,328	| radiolab_podcast16senecanebraska |	2 tribes of turkeys that's how I usually put it
