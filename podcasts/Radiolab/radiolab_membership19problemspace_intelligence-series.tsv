EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:22,848	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	That end in episode one we told the story of a guy who was given an IQ test
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:23,616	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	When he was a boy
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:25,408	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And it changed the course
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:27,456	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Not for the better
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:29,248	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	His Name Was Daryl
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:31,296	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	But he came to be known as Larry.
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:34,624	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He took on that pseudonym when he became the center of a court case
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:38,208	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	That basically put the IQ test itself on trial
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:41,536	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	4 months lawyers presented evidence that the test
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:43,328	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Daryl took were racially biased
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:45,888	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And in 1979 a federal judge

EDL	00:03:54,496	00:04:00,896	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	It was just by pure accident I picked up a stupid paper that my husband brought home from work one day because he worked for the day
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:07,040	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Daily Review on a job delivering papers to local businesses
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:08,320	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Take one
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:09,856	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Mainly for the sport

EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:20,095	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Anyhow one-day Ricky comes in with us an extra papers Pam grabs a piece of it
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:21,631	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And she says
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:24,703	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Article just a little tiny thing about a quart
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:29,311	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Not the letter T case a different court case but it mentioned the Larry P case
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:34,175	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And it said black kids in California can not be given IQ test
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:38,527	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And I seen it and when I was reading it I was like
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:40,063	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Can't be true
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:41,343	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	In this day and age
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:43,135	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	She said she immediately thought of Nicholas
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:46,975	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Didn't look Caucasian out of my kids look Caucasian you can tell their biracial
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:49,279	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Is this going to affect him like
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:55,679	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Are people going to be making decisions about what test he can and can't have because of the color of his skin is spark me to call the school and find
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:56,959	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I doubt this is true
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:05:00,031	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And he told us it was a 1968
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:01,055	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Court ruling
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:02,847	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And it was true
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:11,039	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Now just for the record the case was decided in 79 not 68 but whatever at that point were you thinking
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:12,575	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I was dumbfounded
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:17,439	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	This ruling has lasted all these years he explained that like
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:24,607	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The ruling band tests that were found to be biased against African-American students
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:25,375	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I did not care
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:28,191	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	My son was going to have
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:29,727	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The same rights
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:32,543	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Any other child
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:34,335	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	My wife and I we
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:35,871	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I will just told him that's not right
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:39,967	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	After that first conversation Pam and Ricky ended up having a series of meetings with
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:40,735	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The school
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:45,855	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Some of which ended in yelling for I threatened I told him I'll go to his I'll sue you guys
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:48,415	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And eventually after a few of these meetings
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:50,975	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The school administrator came back to them and said
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:53,535	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Basically look we know you're upset
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:54,559	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Here's what we can do
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:57,119	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Do you do you remember
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:58,655	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The offer that was given to us
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:02,495	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Well you said that
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:07,359	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Our child would be able to take that test
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:11,455	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	If we just put them down as Caucasian
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:14,527	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	That ridiculous
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:17,599	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Offer if you Mark Nicholas down Caucasian
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:18,879	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He will get the test
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:20,927	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	But if you choose
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:23,743	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Tumarkin African-American
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:25,023	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And he will not

EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:48,831	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I was in a situation of really having to defend this ruling
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,879	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He says win10 Ricky got it

EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:23,647	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Would agree
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:26,207	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	You know it really doesn't make a lot of sense and I I was
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:30,815	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Totally pissed at this point I've had many friends tell me
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:32,607	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	That parents became irate

EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:39,775	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	In the California public
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:45,663	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I'm James hiramoto Panabaker and they confirmed for me that situations like what happened with Pam and Ricky

EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:48,479	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Sometimes
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:50,271	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	A reaction might be
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:51,807	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	What why not
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:58,207	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Or what if I say that it's okay like as a parent can I just like sign something to prove that it's okay that
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:58,975	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I don't care
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:02,815	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I know what happens if they check African American and Caucasian
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:05,887	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	If it's marked anywhere
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:10,239	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	There is there is no nothing at talks about

EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:16,383	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Where you thought like
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:23,295	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Well maybe they're African-American and so just to be safe I'm going to not use my IQ test
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,111	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I have
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:27,903	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I have

EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:30,975	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	It is

EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:46,591	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Back in the Larry P days when the band was put in place
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:49,151	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Not quite as much as I used to but they still use them at
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:50,431	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	So
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:52,735	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I'm more than a million kids a year

EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:57,855	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	IQ test that we talked about all of the last episode
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:09:00,671	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	This still the most widely used IQ test
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:02,719	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Since then
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:06,559	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Lots of other IQ tests have been made and released the Arthur point scale

EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:38,815	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Yeah well that question led me to
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:41,119	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Name Alan Kaufman

EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:52,639	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	, is driving he's a professor at the Yale medical school and he says the test
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,663	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Have changed
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:54,943	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And he would know
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:56,735	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Because he was one of the first people
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:57,503	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	To start changing
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:09:59,039	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Victorious

EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:21,311	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Really founder
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:25,407	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He was like this giant in the field
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:28,223	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And Allen this 20-something nobody
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:29,503	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	My assignment
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:31,039	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Whisker help him
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:32,831	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Revised
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:41,023	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Now this was happening right at the Larry Petri was getting started
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:44,607	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Local Department says the test company had pretty much accepted like
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:45,119	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	We need to change
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:47,423	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	But Wexler not too much
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:49,471	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Go to his apartment
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:52,031	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	East side of New York City
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:55,871	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And they would go question by question what is the color of Ruby
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:59,711	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Goffman argued that question is clearly biased
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:03,807	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I mean the correct answer on the test is rubies are red but a
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:06,623	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Your family had more money you will more likely
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:08,159	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	To know what a ruby was
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:12,767	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Andy Kaufman says Ruby was a popular name in the black community
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:16,351	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	So certain kids might think what he was referring to people
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:17,119	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Not gen
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:21,727	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	That item was eliminated but I understand it didn't always go. Either way with them
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:26,847	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	It was a little vain that he had him his
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:29,919	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	But I knew when you got upset
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:31,711	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	It would start
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:32,735	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Post a little
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:33,503	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And he was
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:35,039	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	So upset
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,063	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I thought it was going to
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:40,415	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He says they had knock-down-drag-out fight about questions
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:43,487	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	But many of the questions we talked about in the last episode
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:45,023	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Ended up being removed
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:51,167	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Bunch of Change by the end of this process how much of the test was different
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:54,239	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Probably 40% different
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:57,311	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Since that original revision
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:58,591	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The whiskey has been revived
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:11:59,103	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Three more time
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:00,127	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Hello Susie
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:06,271	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Yes this is Susie Rayford I'm the primary developer of the wechsler intelligence scale
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:12,671	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I write the questions designed the research plan and Susie says the test today is way different
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:13,439	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	But it was back in the saddle
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:17,279	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Facts about 10 years ago they replaced every question on the
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:18,303	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And then we also see
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:20,863	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Statistically analyze the items to see if
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:27,263	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	She says they're now able to do these assertive Advanced statistical comparisons where they can compare the
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:28,543	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Have responses of
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:31,103	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Black kids to rich white kids
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:33,663	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Poor black kids to poor white kids
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:38,527	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Go through that kind of scrutiny and one group performs differently on a question they'll get rid of
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:43,647	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	You you welcome mat because you don't want to put something out that's wrong or that's going to hurt people
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:47,487	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The biggest change though is the way the test is standardized
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:49,791	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Usually tries to be representative of the sensor
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:54,655	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	This is Brandon Campbell against the former school psychologist we heard from in the first episode

EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:07,967	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Given how much the test has
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:08,735	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Changed
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:12,319	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	How do you feel about the fact that the band
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:13,087	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Still
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:13,855	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Dislike

EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:50,719	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Yes can you hear me clearly
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:51,487	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I can
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:54,559	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Admit I didn't completely understand what Brandon meant
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:56,351	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Until I talk to this guy
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:59,423	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	My name is John Cato and I'm a dad
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:00,447	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Young man
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:03,775	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Who experienced a learning disability in his young life
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:07,359	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Johnson Counter with the letter P ban happened about 20 years
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:13,247	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Is living in Santa Monica California the time works and transportation he was running the bus system there
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:14,783	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And I his son just
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:15,807	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He was
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:22,207	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Hunting a complete seven or eight is in first grade and his teacher told John that Justin was having a really hard
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:23,231	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Hard time with reading
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:26,047	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Even if you gave him the simplest of things to read
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:28,863	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He couldn't grasp what you read
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:35,263	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The teacher wasn't really sure what was going on there wondering if this just a reading specific thing or is there
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:38,335	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Broader cognitive disability happening
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:42,943	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	So John decided to talk to a specialist and he recommended first that I get an IQ test
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:46,271	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And so I went to his Elementary School
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:48,319	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And requested that from his principal
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:51,135	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And she informed me that
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:53,951	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He could not have an IQ test because
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:59,839	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And the state of California was that legal and when the principal said that what went through your mind
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:03,423	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I thought it was crazy I said you know she was trying to explain to me
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:09,055	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Why it was not allowed she knew there was some court case has he got it
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:10,079	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Understood
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:13,663	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Remember 7 to take an IQ test when he was in his 20s
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:18,527	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Trying to get ahead and army. Officer on that test I never heard of
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:19,807	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Like Magento
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:22,623	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Why when you grow up in a very poor neighborhood
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:23,647	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Basic colors
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:24,671	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Blue red
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:26,463	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Purple yellow white
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:29,791	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Brown I didn't know what that question meant unless
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:31,327	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	When it came to his son
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:33,119	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	If taking a test
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:33,887	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Even if it was by
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:35,167	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Could help him
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:36,447	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Sobeit
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:40,543	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And I understand you know that the economic and environmental impact
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:42,335	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	About IQ test
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:43,615	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	But
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:46,687	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	My son needed one that accepting
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:49,247	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The argument because of his ethnicity
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:51,551	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	They were prohibited from giving him a task
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:53,855	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I first asked if I could wave it
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:54,879	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Is there anyway I can wave
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:56,927	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And I was told no
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:58,719	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	My honesty said well
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:01,279	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Okay then he's not African American
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:05,375	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	His mother is Caucasian and my history of my family
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:06,911	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	This mix race
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:09,727	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	So let's reclassify
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:12,799	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	She said I guess you can do that and then I said to her
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:14,335	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Look at the
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:15,103	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Certainty of that
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:19,455	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Ultimately Justin ended up getting IQ tested by that specialist
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:20,991	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Just outside the school system
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:23,039	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And in the end the test
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:25,855	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Hope revealed that Justin had a very
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:26,879	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Pacific problem
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:28,415	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	What was determined was
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:30,975	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Justin has his imagination
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:33,535	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	So when he was reading when he was younger
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:35,583	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He couldn't separate
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:37,375	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	John says Justin Woods
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:42,495	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Start to read a sentence but before he could get too far into it even just a few words
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:46,847	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He would start to imagine what was going on and just get lost in that universe
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:48,895	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He tried to read
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:50,687	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Go off and live it
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:55,039	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And you can't do that like he would just never get very far before his imagination we take
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:57,855	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And the IQ test help them figure that out
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:59,647	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	In a way yeah because
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:02,975	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Thing about an IQ test is it made up of all these sub test
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:07,327	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Into the psychologist with able to use it to figure out that Justin was fine with Matt
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:08,863	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	It memory was fine
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:12,191	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I had a good vocabulary processing speed and
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:15,263	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Puzzle solving abilities were fine
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:19,871	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	So they're able to rule all these things out and investigate the root of the problem
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:22,175	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Which turn out
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:26,015	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Beat his really active imagination it was a book
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:26,783	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	One poke
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:27,807	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I got Justin Reid
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,343	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Enemies Harry Potter
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:33,439	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He wouldn't put that book down
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:36,767	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He was step Layton tonight and stop breathing it
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:38,815	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	That was the end of his problem
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:39,327	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	A reading
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:48,031	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Brandon gamble cuz he's worked with hundreds of kids like just
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:51,615	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	When IQ test help to figure out what was going on
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:57,247	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The Bedford Brandon says like the Larry P band isn't necessary anymore
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:58,015	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He says
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:18:03,903	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The thing that keeps her to keep his eye on now when it comes to these tests isn't so much the racial bias question
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:05,695	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	But something kind of bigger
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:09,023	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The basic idea that an IQ test
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:11,071	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Could be used to
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:12,095	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Define kid
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:17,471	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	There's a. And I would say from like the 1930s all the way through the 80s
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:19,775	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	People would just give
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:21,823	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Biq or cognitive pet
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:24,127	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	This is what happened to Darrell from the first episode
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:27,967	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And of course the test was skewed against him because of racial bias
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:29,247	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	But Brendan says
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,271	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Even if it wasn't
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:33,087	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Even if there had been a white kid
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:38,463	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Making a decision any decision about his future by just using an IQ test
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:38,975	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Affordable
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:42,047	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	You really don't know that get it's only a snapshot
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:45,375	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Window of sitting down with this kid
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:46,911	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The bariatric Clinic
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:49,727	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I can't be the totality of who that child is
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:52,287	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	To really understand who your kid is
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:54,591	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And every psychologist I talked to said this
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:57,151	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	You have to spend a lot of time with
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:58,431	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Visiting the home
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:19:00,735	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Like observing a child in the classroom
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:06,879	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Like extensive interviews with their families especially if you're working cross-cultural there's some things that you may not
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:07,391	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Understand
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:11,487	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	It sounds like your perspective on the IQ test is that
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:12,255	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Like
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:13,791	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	If you can you can evaluate
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:15,839	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Students without.
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:19,423	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	IQ test if you can't do IQ testing there's 99 other things you can do
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:22,495	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Weight sedan
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:24,287	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Why do it at all
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:26,847	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I mean like I guess
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:27,359	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I get
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:29,151	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	That it can be helpful
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:31,455	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Will sometimes like in the case of the kid with Harry Potter
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:35,039	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Really what it was it help the kid was Harry Potter
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:38,111	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	That's what helps the neck Siri better so
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:43,743	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	If we're in a situation now where we have all of these other tools available
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:47,071	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	IQ test however
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:48,351	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Useful it can be
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:50,143	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	It also has some very bad mojo
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:51,679	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Historically
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:52,703	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Attached to it
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:55,263	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	What is it actually still worth keeping around
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:58,335	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Yeah I found myself thinking that a lot
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:20:00,639	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	You know just like from a cure

EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:45,600	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	First
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:47,136	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Let me do a quick digression
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:48,928	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Maybe take a step back

EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:53,280	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	In talking about the ups and downs of the IQ test
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:54,560	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Turns out
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:56,608	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	So much of it has to do with
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:57,632	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	How we talk about it
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:22:01,728	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	So I want to go back to an interview I did with

EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:17,600	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	One idea
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:18,112	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	About
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:19,392	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Language
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:22,464	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	One thing that we learned over and overalls from the history of Medicine
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:25,792	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Is that the way you define terms the way you define anything
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:27,840	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Makes an enormous difference
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:29,376	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	As to how you evaluate
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:30,656	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	At what values
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:31,424	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Society places on it
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:35,008	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I can give you a thousand examples from the history of cancer
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:37,568	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	One gave me. It was really interesting

EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:46,016	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Because it was meant to addressed
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:51,392	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The term route which apparently is what radical means of or pertaining to the root of something
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:53,184	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	That amore

EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:08,544	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	That would be the appropriate response
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:09,824	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Even if
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:10,592	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	It might not

EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:17,760	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	These words that we use in medicine and science are extraordinary important intelligence
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:19,552	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The thing you got to remember it right off the bat
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:21,856	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Is that the word
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:23,648	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Intelligence is a colloquial word
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:28,512	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I just cannot emphasize that enough
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:32,864	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Like the concept of intelligence we predates modern Western science
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:34,912	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Yes you can look at
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:41,312	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Ancient literature and you'll see that some people are are smarter than others like Odysseus is really smart intelligent

EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:55,392	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And for the history of human beings
EDL	00:23:55,392	00:23:57,184	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	We have found that perfectly acceptable
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:24:02,304	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Everybody understood that there are lots of different ways to be intelligent
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:06,144	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Be intelligent just meant to be able to understand
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:08,192	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Should be a million different things
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:10,496	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Until 1904
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:16,128	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Mitchell Spearman came along and said we have their flag on intelligence is defined as
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:17,152	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Your score
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:17,920	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	On this test
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:18,944	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The fact is
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:20,224	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	According to both of these guys
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:21,760	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	It might be a lot more complicated
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:23,552	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	There is something
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:26,112	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Captured in the IQ test called G
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:27,648	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I don't have a problem with g
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:29,696	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Maybe send a shiver down my spine
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:31,232	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Spine because of human history
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:34,304	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Problem with it fundamentally it's a fact
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:36,608	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	But I do have an argument
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:39,936	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Making a simple one-to-one translation
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:41,984	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Between that idea
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:44,032	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And the sting this word that carries
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:44,800	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	So much
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:45,824	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Value and meaning
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:47,104	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The word being
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:49,152	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Is there a better word
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:50,688	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Yeah well
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:55,040	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	We should have called it something like cold was it function I mean a lot of the researchers I talk
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:57,600	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Talk to psychologist even the test makers
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:25:03,232	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Steam to be using words like cognitive function or cognitive ability more when I saw
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:04,000	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	All I mean is
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:09,376	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He look I'm using word intelligence even though I said at the start of the movie
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:12,704	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Calling intelligence a lot
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:17,824	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Play Mukerji says like what an IQ test measures is your ability to navigate in problems
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:21,152	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Your ability to navigate in problems
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:26,272	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Yeah I don't really know what that means like I can picture problem space
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:27,296	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I can't be more
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:29,600	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Pacific done that because that is exactly what it is
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:32,672	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Sometimes in an analogy
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:33,184	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Switches
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:37,792	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	You meet a person who is a good General athlete

EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:54,176	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	They have a particular way of manipulating themselves through space because they understand

EDL	00:25:58,016	00:26:00,064	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	According to Mukerji problems faced
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:00,832	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Is
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:01,600	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I know like that
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:02,880	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Bite

EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:07,488	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Like how well can you move ideas pictures numbers around your head
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:09,792	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Your ability to navigate and problems

EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:14,912	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Deputy of space there cuz it's
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:15,936	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Boundary
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:17,216	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	It sounded
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:17,984	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	A substance
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:20,032	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Yeah. Everything is just a space
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:21,824	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	It a space and it leaves
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:23,872	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	A lot of stuff out exactly
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:25,408	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	But regardless of

EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:44,352	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Like if the IQ test has

EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:51,264	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	It is her like stepped up
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:54,080	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And saved a lot of the people that was designed to hurt
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:54,592	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Interest
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:55,872	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Okay
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:57,408	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Tell me more tell me more
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:26:59,456	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Okay
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:05,600	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	It's there early 1970s and the stories about this guy named herb needleman
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:09,440	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He was a needleman was pediatrician
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:14,048	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	In Philadelphia at 6 feet tall brown hair blue eyes intense
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:16,608	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Kind of arrogant guy very sure of himself
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:19,424	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Beth Lydia denworth I'm a science writer
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:25,824	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	She wrote a book about her he was really engaging
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:32,224	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Did that pointy was fighting the Vietnam War stuff you've gone to Vietnam and started a nonprofit or he would
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:33,248	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Bring injured
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:35,808	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Kids back to the US for treatment wow
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:36,576	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Dislike
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:40,160	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Students like hanging out with him in here in history of crazy stories
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:41,440	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Anyway
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:43,232	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	When needleman was
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:44,512	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Training to be a pediatrician
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:51,424	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I was referred a child who was very sick little girl that's hurting them in talking to Atmore a gun
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:52,448	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	On the NPR show.

EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:57,056	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Needleman actually passed away a few years ago and they were nice enough to let us
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:58,080	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Use clips from their interview
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:02,944	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	This little girl shows up little three-year-old girl and Hispanic girl
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:06,784	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	From the local neighborhood was a poor neighborhood where the hospital is located
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:09,600	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And this little girl was really in terrible shape
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:10,880	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	She was lethargic
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:11,648	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Couldn't talk
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:18,048	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	It was a cute lead poisoning diagnosis and
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:22,400	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I knew what to do because I've had a couple extras on it it was known that led to make
EDL	00:28:22,400	00:28:24,192	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	You sick but it was thought
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:27,776	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The conventional wisdom was it could only make you sick at really high.
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:34,688	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	When I started the conventional wisdom was that 60 micrograms per deciliter was a toxic dose
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:35,712	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	For comparison
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:36,480	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Today
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:38,784	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The CDC the Centers for Disease Control
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:40,576	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Have what color reference level
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:44,160	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Which is that anything over 5 micrograms per deciliter
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:44,672	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Is
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:46,464	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Control arm
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:50,560	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Planning fact we know now that there is no safe level of lead
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:54,656	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	In anybody's body but especially in children
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:56,960	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	This is an era when lead is all over
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:29:03,872	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Everywhere all the houses were painted with waitlist
EDL	00:29:03,872	00:29:06,688	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Standard instant payment the reason LED was put in paint
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:12,832	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Was that made the pink go on the wall more smoothly
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:19,744	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Sticky add Sprite and also when paint chips off and you get a big feast
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:26,144	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	It letting is actually quite Suites real little kids
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:27,680	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Sweet and crunchy
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:30,752	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Soap herbs are in Philadelphia
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:32,544	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Jesus kid with acute lead poisoning
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:34,336	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	After her
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:34,848	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He's another
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:36,384	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And another
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:37,920	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Another
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:39,456	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He knows
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:40,992	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	High levels of lead are toxic
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:42,784	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Restart the Wonder
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:43,808	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	What about low-level
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:48,160	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I decided I would pursue it question was
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:49,184	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	How so
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:51,744	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	People knew that lead
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:57,632	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	In the body went into bones and it went it mimics calcium in the body so it would be anywhere in the body
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:30:04,032	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	That calcium would be found the tissue to look at his bone which can't do that you can't stick needles and kids
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:07,360	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	You certainly can't go cutting out pieces of their bone
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:08,640	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He knew we couldn't get bone
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:14,528	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And then one day sitting there in his office at this community health clinic
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:16,832	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	In North Philadelphia
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:22,464	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He looked at children playing in the schoolyard of this Elementary School
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:24,512	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And he thought
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:27,840	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Are the answer
EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:33,216	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He Partners up with a dentist
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:36,032	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Annie at the dentist ask
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:37,568	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The parents to bring in their kids
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:38,592	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Baby teeth
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:40,896	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Right away the parents are like well we've got a little bit of a
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:42,688	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Have to Ferry problem here
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:44,480	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	You know the kids the kids are not just going to
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:46,016	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Give away their teeth I'm not going to
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:47,296	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Fund your research study
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:48,832	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	With my tooth fairy money
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:55,232	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	2 herb like Newman went out and he got all these silver dollars
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:59,840	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The dentist Drive the kids to give him the teeth he then tested the teeth Moser due to flood levels
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:02,400	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And brings in a bunch of the kids give him a series of tests
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:05,216	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Extensive battery of neuropsychological tests
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:05,984	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Including
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:10,592	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	IQ test
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:14,176	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And what he discovered the key thing he discover
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:17,248	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Is that if you get this a little bit more last in your body
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:21,344	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Like for every 10 micrograms per deciliter more lead in your blood
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:23,136	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Extremely small amount
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:25,440	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Your IQ score
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:25,952	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Balls
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:27,488	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Four Points
EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:30,304	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	So if you're
EDL	00:31:30,304	00:31:33,120	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Exposed to just a tiny bit more LED you get
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:34,912	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Four Points
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:36,960	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Go to court Dumber
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:38,240	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	On the IQ test
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:43,872	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Eventually yeah his Four Points a lot so that the thing about it is like
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:45,408	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The accused
EDL	00:31:45,408	00:31:46,432	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Test setup
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:48,224	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Takana put everybody on this bell curve
EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:48,992	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Where you at
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:49,760	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Most of
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:51,040	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Most everybody is in the middle
EDL	00:31:51,552	00:31:52,320	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And then you've got
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:53,856	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Assertive Tails rehab
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:54,624	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The people who are
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:57,184	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Score really high and the people who score
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:31:57,952	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Really low
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:32:00,768	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I would be around 1:30 low would be
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:01,536	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Tanner and 70
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:04,352	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Enter four points in the middle doesn't make that thing
EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:07,680	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	But if you think about it much larger
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:11,008	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	What we're actually talking about is Shifting and in Thai
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:12,032	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Higher population.
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:14,592	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	What that means is
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:17,152	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The top you end up with
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:19,712	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Half as many people were going to score above 130
EDL	00:32:20,224	00:32:21,248	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	But I feel like a lot
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:23,296	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Yeah and twice as many people
EDL	00:32:23,296	00:32:24,064	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Scoring below
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:29,696	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Wow when we published that in the New England Journal of Medicine
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:35,840	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	1979 it had a considerable impact
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:40,704	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	It made national news when he he had done it
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:41,984	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He had shown
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:44,800	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	That a long-term low-level lead exposure
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:46,592	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	With actually connected
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:47,872	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Tua kids
EDL	00:32:47,872	00:32:49,664	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Experience
EDL	00:32:49,664	00:32:51,456	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I am in life
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:56,064	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The study led the government to ban the use of lead in house paint
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:59,904	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Put limits on the amount of gasoline not too surprisingly
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:02,720	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The LED Industries
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:03,488	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	We're not happy
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:06,048	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And they tried to discredit
EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:06,816	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Permuda wynd
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:09,888	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Who's the nasty. In our lives
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:12,448	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The Houston of scientific misconduct
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:16,544	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Big fight over whether his 1979 Boston study
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:17,824	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Was accurate
EDL	00:33:17,824	00:33:19,360	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Long story short
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:21,408	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	They realized it multiple times
EDL	00:33:21,408	00:33:22,688	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And the numbers held up
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:23,712	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	So then would happen
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:29,856	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	In the mid-80s 1985 I arrived let have been reduced some
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:36,000	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Any environment but then there are no constraints on the human mind
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:40,352	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	No walls around the human Spirit except those we are ourselves erect
EDL	00:33:40,352	00:33:41,888	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And you decide
EDL	00:33:41,888	00:33:43,424	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Let's cut the industry of break
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:45,472	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	You know what loosen things back
EDL	00:33:45,472	00:33:46,240	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Back up again
EDL	00:33:46,240	00:33:52,384	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And there was a guy at EPA named Joel Schwartz who had been hired as an economic analyst there Joel Shore
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:56,224	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Is asked by his bosses in about 1985
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:33:58,016	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	To calculate
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:34:00,064	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	How much industry would save
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:00,832	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	If
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:03,392	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The regulations on letting gasoline work
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:06,976	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Lessons which was what the Reagan Administration wanted to do
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:08,512	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And he says
EDL	00:34:08,512	00:34:10,048	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	But what about the health
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:10,816	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Effects
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:13,120	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And he's told you know
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:14,656	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Just the way it is is what they want
EDL	00:34:15,168	00:34:18,240	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	So what he does so Joel Schwartz it was a clever guy
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:24,640	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He says okay I will do this job I will calculate how much industry will save if they don't have
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:26,176	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Regulate letting gasoline
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:28,480	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And that number was about a hundred million dollars
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:32,832	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	But then he did something else he did the first
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:34,368	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Major
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:35,648	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Cost benefit analysis
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:36,416	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Just that linked
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:37,440	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Health effects
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:38,720	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	An economics
EDL	00:34:38,720	00:34:40,000	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Never really
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:43,328	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Innovative thing that Joel Schwartz did
EDL	00:34:43,328	00:34:45,120	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Was to also calculate
EDL	00:34:45,120	00:34:48,704	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The cost to Society of leaving lead in the gasoline
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:51,008	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And the way he did that
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:52,800	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Was that he used those
EDL	00:34:52,800	00:34:54,080	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	4 IQ points
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:58,688	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	They did it and economic analysis where they were able to figure out that for each
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:34:59,200	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	1
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:01,504	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Point change in IQ
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:03,296	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	That equated
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:05,088	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	To 1% change in the wage rate
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:07,904	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Again on a population level
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:10,720	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	With every step down and IQ
EDL	00:35:10,720	00:35:13,792	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	There's a connection to how much money somebody can earn
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:18,144	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	You got lower levels of educational attainment and ultimately lower levels of learning
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:20,448	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	So when he did this calculus
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:23,776	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The industries could save $109 if they have lead
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:29,920	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Society if you count based on needleman's IQ for IQ points the cost
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:32,224	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Society of leaving lead in gasoline
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:33,760	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Was close to a billion dollars
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:35,808	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Well that's based on
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:38,624	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Lost education lost wages and increased health
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:41,952	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He write this report gives it to one of the
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:42,720	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Top officials at the
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:49,120	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	ETA this guy named Joseph Cannon who had pretty much made up his mind that he was not going to regulate the leather industry anymore
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:52,960	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Didn't need regulation there was no need from a regulation for apparently he looks at this report
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:55,008	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And he said you just cannot look away
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:35:58,592	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	You cannot look away
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:02,688	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	January 1st 1986
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:03,456	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The EPA
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:06,528	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Effectively banned LED from gasoline
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:08,576	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Over the next few decades
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:11,392	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The average blood level of Americans
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:13,696	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Dropped by 90%
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:21,120	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Blood lead levels around the world the end of forks today
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:22,144	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Was a pretty important fact
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:30,080	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The thing that sled Story made me realize is that
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:31,104	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The IQ test
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:34,176	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Certain thinking abilities
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:36,480	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Whatever you want to call it
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:38,016	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Intelligent
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:38,784	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Problem space
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:41,600	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And when you need to find out if
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:44,416	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Like an environmental toxin is affecting
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:45,696	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The wake
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:48,512	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I think having the standardized measurement of that
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:49,536	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Is really powerful
EDL	00:36:50,048	00:36:51,840	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Enter something like the IQ test
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:53,376	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Lets you
EDL	00:36:53,376	00:36:55,168	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	See these almost invisible
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:36:58,240	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Like subtle effects
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:36:59,264	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Sunmart groups
EDL	00:36:59,264	00:37:01,056	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Two people and after that led thing
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:07,200	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	There been many many many studies but you just you can go on PubMed and search like IQ test
EDL	00:37:07,200	00:37:10,272	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Environmental effects and you find all of these amazing
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:12,320	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Realities where people use IQ test
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:13,856	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	To look at the way
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:15,392	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Smog effects
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:17,440	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Kids thinking abilities or
EDL	00:37:17,440	00:37:19,488	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Or like violence in the neighborhood
EDL	00:37:20,512	00:37:23,328	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Reminds me of what the judge
EDL	00:37:23,328	00:37:26,656	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Said in the last episode in the in the ruling that
EDL	00:37:28,448	00:37:28,960	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Did essentially
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:33,568	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	IQ tester social evil masquerading as empiricism
EDL	00:37:33,568	00:37:34,592	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	This is kind of the universe
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:38,688	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And it's basically the same test I mean anything we don't stay in the web story
EDL	00:37:39,200	00:37:40,992	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Patricia dad or stay here
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:42,272	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Is that
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:43,296	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Herb needleman
EDL	00:37:43,808	00:37:45,344	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He did the studies
EDL	00:37:45,344	00:37:46,624	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Only white kid
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:49,696	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	People can say like oh the
EDL	00:37:49,696	00:37:51,744	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The poor kids are scoring lower because they're black
EDL	00:37:53,536	00:37:55,072	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	He did it only in Waco
EDL	00:37:55,072	00:37:58,144	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	You did it only on white kids because he was worried because
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:37:59,424	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	A lot of dick
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:03,264	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Cork it to her being affected by lead wear black and other minority kids
EDL	00:38:04,032	00:38:05,312	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And he was worried that if you took
EDL	00:38:05,824	00:38:06,336	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	A sample of
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:07,616	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	You know
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:08,896	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Affluent white kids
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:10,944	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Who had low light exposure
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:12,224	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And he took
EDL	00:38:12,992	00:38:14,016	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Group of poor kids
EDL	00:38:14,016	00:38:15,808	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Highlight exposure who also were
EDL	00:38:15,808	00:38:16,320	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Black
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:18,112	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The people would say oh the
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:19,648	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The poor kid
EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:21,696	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Squirrel or not because
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:23,744	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I've let exposure but because they're black
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:25,280	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	And black people are less intelligent than white
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:28,608	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Wow so he actually he actually segregated his
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:29,120	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Is sample
EDL	00:38:29,632	00:38:31,168	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Yeah so that he could avoid bias
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:32,448	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Their bias
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:32,960	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Exactly
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:36,544	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Yes so at the end of the day
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:37,312	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	I don't think
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:38,080	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	You can say that the
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:38,592	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	IQ test
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:42,176	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Or even the whole idea of measuring human intelligence
EDL	00:38:42,688	00:38:43,456	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	In this way
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:45,504	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Is anyone thing
EDL	00:38:46,016	00:38:50,112	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The test isn't inherently evil in this way they thought people
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:52,928	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	You know not psychologists early but regular people think
EDL	00:38:53,440	00:38:54,208	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	About it
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:54,976	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	But
EDL	00:38:54,976	00:38:56,000	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	It does have this
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:39:00,096	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	There's some power in it and it was designed to do a certain

EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:01,888	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Thing
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:02,912	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	But if you just go all the way back
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:04,192	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	The eugenic Roots
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:05,984	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	That's
EDL	00:39:05,984	00:39:06,752	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Like always
EDL	00:39:07,520	00:39:09,568	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	In there but it's not the only thing that's
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:11,360	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Sounds like agents

EDL	00:39:28,000	00:39:32,096	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	That was submitted for psychologists Brandon Gimbel throughout an interview he was
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:37,472	| radiolab_membership19problemspace_intelligence-series |	Talking about the IQ test but he was referring to this Marvel Comics organization called agents of
