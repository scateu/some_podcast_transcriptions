EDL	00:00:05,120	00:00:07,424	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	First the MailChimp challenge with a little while back
EDL	00:00:08,704	00:00:09,216	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	We did
EDL	00:00:09,984	00:00:10,496	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	You guys did it
EDL	00:00:11,264	00:00:13,824	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Media West if a certain number of you who became

EDL	00:00:19,456	00:00:19,968	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Thank you
EDL	00:00:20,480	00:00:21,248	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	We did it
EDL	00:00:21,760	00:00:22,528	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Hey number 2
EDL	00:00:23,040	00:00:25,856	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	I want Elena that toward the end of this podcast
EDL	00:00:25,856	00:00:26,368	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	About to happen
EDL	00:00:26,880	00:00:33,280	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Wait wait haven't been setup yet
EDL	00:00:33,280	00:00:35,328	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	You guys want to hang out until the
EDL	00:00:35,328	00:00:36,352	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	The Alice Echo
EDL	00:00:36,352	00:00:39,424	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Why why do we have to be at the end
EDL	00:00:39,424	00:00:40,704	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Can we just be up top
EDL	00:00:40,704	00:00:46,848	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	But that was the deal we talk this is my Rosa Parks moment and you know why we can say that is
EDL	00:00:46,848	00:00:47,360	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Because we are
EDL	00:00:48,128	00:00:54,528	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	You're putting me in a box here at the end of this podcast
EDL	00:00:54,528	00:01:00,672	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Come back and introduce you guys listening to two very funny people you just heard Phoebe Robinson Jessica Williams they're starting to pod

EDL	00:01:05,280	00:01:05,792	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	We'll talk about it
EDL	00:01:06,560	00:01:07,328	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	I see you got to hang out
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:09,888	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:01:10,912	00:01:11,680	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Are you awake
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:19,616	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Listening to Radiolab
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:24,480	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Radio WNYC
EDL	00:01:28,064	00:01:30,112	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Jad and Robert Radiolab
EDL	00:01:30,112	00:01:32,416	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	I'm going to just tell you the store
EDL	00:01:32,416	00:01:35,232	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Just very briefly I'm going to tell you the story of three
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:37,024	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Enormous mister
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:40,864	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Pistou but you know very well and one of which I bet you've never heard of ever
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:42,144	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Okay
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:43,424	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Mystery number one
EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:46,240	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	This is the one I know where the one I don't see the one you know
EDL	00:01:46,240	00:01:47,520	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	So about
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:48,800	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	4 billion years ago
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:51,104	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	The Earth is one
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:54,688	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Huge mostly ocean of lifeless chemical
EDL	00:01:55,200	00:02:01,600	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	And then for some reason we have never really been able to understand lifeless chemicals suddenly
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:02,880	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Per diem
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:04,160	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Opposed
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:05,440	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Can you get
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:08,256	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Life hello yes I was just arrived.

EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:14,144	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Nick Lane I'm a professor of evolutionary biochemistry
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:18,752	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	University College in London Nick is the main guy in the story I'm about to die
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:20,288	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	But just to continue this setup
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:22,592	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	If you're number one where does lice come from
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:23,360	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Next
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:25,408	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Mystery number 3
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:26,432	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	To make it morning
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:32,832	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Think what about the two who is going to be the subject of the story and more important the middle one is the Deep
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:36,160	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	I'm surprised because you've never heard of it so I thought I would skip over to
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:41,792	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	To remind you how familiar you are with one-in-three holler at fine go to 3 and then come back at 2
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:43,584	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Drake
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:44,096	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Conscious
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:46,144	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	For some reason
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:52,544	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	For some reason one animal on the planet and only one that we could always seems to spring into this
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:54,336	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Very elaborate sense
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:58,688	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Of self-awareness we don't know why it happened you don't know how it happened
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:02:59,968	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	It just did it right
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:06,624	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	I'm familiar with 1-2-3 if you are not here is number two that's the one that keeps Nick up at night because
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:12,512	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Does a kind of a gap a black hole with everything important in biology happened
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:14,816	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	We have very little insight into
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,608	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	What what it was
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:17,888	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Black hole in biology
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:20,448	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	If you want to know what it is this black hole
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:25,824	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Do you know you do
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:27,360	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Mystery number
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:31,968	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	They were a little bit past 1 move away before 3
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:36,832	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	4 billion years ago we got life is just floating around
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:38,624	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Blue specks in the ocean
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:40,672	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Are very simple cell
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:47,584	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Probably pretty much like code of a bacterium as we know them today this is very small. If you're looking at the
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:53,984	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Period at the end of a sentence a is it about that size or smaller
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:54,496	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	A couple of
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:56,800	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Thousands of a millimeter long
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:59,104	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	So tiny tiny things
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:03,968	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	They all look the same in this size and shape and they don't seem to be doing anything very interesting
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:09,344	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	They were having babies and they were using energy
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:12,416	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	But if you look inside one of these
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:13,184	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Things
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:14,208	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Not much going on
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:19,839	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Is race replays often described as a bag of chemicals there they're not complex they're not
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:22,143	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Complex simple simple as can be
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:25,215	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	And it goes on like this for millions of years and then
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:28,543	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	100
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:30,847	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	What ready to building is also
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:32,383	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	2 billion year
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:34,175	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	If not longer
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:36,223	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	You just have tiny tiny some
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:38,271	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Chinese symbol bobbing bobber
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:39,039	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Babysitting
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:39,807	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Something in the way
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:45,951	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Poppin Poppin Poppin Poppin nothing nothing nothing nothing wrong with it
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:47,487	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Three good reason there is
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:51,583	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	You should know there is no rule which says life has to get bigger
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:52,607	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	We could have stayed
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:53,887	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Infinitely small
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,191	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	100 billion years
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:05:00,799	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Really yes really but then said something
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:08,991	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	As they say about 2 billion years ago all of a sudden practically overnight
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:14,367	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	A new kind of Life shows
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:21,279	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	And it's huge
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:22,815	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	At least first one
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:29,215	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	The actual volume when our around about ten thousand times bigger massive increase in size
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:30,751	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Like we just jump from specs
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:36,895	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	The battleships and inside these things
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:39,967	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Massive pieces of complex machinery
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:41,247	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Becomes bigger
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:43,807	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Bigger and more complex It ultimately
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:44,831	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Leads to
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:46,111	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Jellyfish

EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:03,007	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Here's your second mystery
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:06,847	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	How did life for such an enormously long time safe
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:07,871	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	So simple
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:10,687	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	So dull and so tiny and then
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:12,735	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	You got these big life-forms
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:13,503	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	What happened
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:15,295	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	And why did it not
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:17,087	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Happen for such a long time
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:26,047	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Well I are you going to enlighten me with such as to answer is yes but I want you to remind you this is a few
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:28,607	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	When making a hypothesis
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:35,007	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Who knows really exactly what happened during we're never going to get whenever going to find life
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:36,287	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Found footage
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:37,823	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	That moment right
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:42,175	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	We can we can only imagine if we can only use the evidence we've got now
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:45,759	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	That is it young I'm a science writer at the Atlantic
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:48,831	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	It's the guy who introduced me to Nick Carlson X work and
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:51,391	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Experiential here's the important thing to
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:56,767	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	I'm not doing those two billion years when nothing much happened but life didn't get it
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:58,303	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	It it's that life
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:06:59,583	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Couldn't get caught
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:01,119	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	There is
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:03,423	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	A barrier there is an energetic
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:03,935	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Canyon
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:05,727	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	But simple cells
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:06,751	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Find themselves
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:09,823	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	What
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:12,383	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	It means that it's a huge deal
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:14,943	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Should try to get thinking about what it takes to get bigger
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:16,735	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Six-figure cell wall
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:17,503	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Fix my Surface
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:23,903	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	More openings let things in which they got more power in my moving parts and then to make the whole thing fit and work together you got to have
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:27,487	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	A bigger design planets or DNA so you're going to need more DNA
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:31,071	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	And all that DNA needs to be copied
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:35,935	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	You're going to need some DNA copy I need to read the information that's encoded within it
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:42,335	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Do you need to use that information to build proteins and some Builders I'm about lost but this is
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:43,103	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Especially costly
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:44,639	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	So you don't get bigger
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:47,199	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Free every new Step takes extra energy
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:53,599	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Just like if you were going to you know if you're going to increase the size of your company by a thousand times if you're going to have a
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:55,135	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	A thousand times more employees
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:56,415	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	You're going to need to pay them all
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:58,719	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Where you going to get the money
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:01,279	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	I mean you and I we might be able to go to a bank
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:04,607	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Little thing you don't have any place to
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:05,887	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	How do you get bigger
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:08,191	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	I mean can't you just eat
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:10,751	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	More food than you normally eat
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:13,311	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	So that you get more energy so that slowly over time to get bigger
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:15,615	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	I mean by you could do that
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:16,895	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	But suppose you don't have to
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,175	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Stomach to absorb
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:23,039	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	You make a stomach somehow
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:23,807	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	The stomach
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:25,343	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	You got to eat more food to build
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:32,255	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Eat more food you can have the stomach when you can't really have the stomach let you eat the food you can't eat the food what you have.
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:36,095	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	You just stuck in a hole kind of a catch-22
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:40,191	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Yeah you're sucking what what could cause a young and energetic
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:43,263	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	And climb over the walls of that Canyon and to start
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:45,567	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Experimenting with complex
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:49,151	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	You need something improbable
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:51,199	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	You need something very special
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:57,087	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	So special and so improbable that according to this Theory over the course of all of our planets has
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:09:00,159	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	That has only happened successfully
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:00,671	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Once
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:02,719	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	What what happened
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:03,487	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	But here's the thing
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:06,815	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	His life
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:08,863	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Bopping along it's boring boring
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:10,143	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Boring way everything is
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:10,911	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Very tiny
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:12,191	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Very simple and then one day
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:14,751	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Two single celled
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:15,519	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Creatures
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,079	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Start to drift
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:19,871	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Gorgeous women.
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:24,735	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	One of them is an archaean little Bob and one of them is a bacterium
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:25,759	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Under The Blob
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:32,671	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	They they belong to the two great houses of simple things in with the montagues and capulets
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:35,487	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Solve 2 billion BC
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:39,071	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	These two little cells start to get near each other slowly
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:45,983	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	It was he sell One Soul the other one has to offer Nick imagines that I don't know maybe the little one was
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:52,127	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Expelling some kind of chemical that lets a is some hydrogen gas just for the sake of an argument
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:57,247	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	That's what he wants and maybe the big one spits out
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:10:00,063	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	The nitrogen which is what the little one wants Olathe
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:02,111	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	China come together they smuggle
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:06,463	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Totally ordinary thing happens all the time with c
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:08,511	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	But in this case
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:11,839	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Stop smuggling gets closer and closer until somehow
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:13,887	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Those who sells meat
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:14,911	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	And
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:19,519	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	They much
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:21,823	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	They just squish together how they merge
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:27,711	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	You know membranes fuse cell walls don't always full maybe the big one it had a hole in its walls
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:31,807	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Fell through hole I don't really know what the mechanism is
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:33,343	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	But we do know if
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:37,183	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	The point is somehow this little guy jumps into the bacterium
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:39,487	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Find itself inside the arcade
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:41,023	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	That's the first thing I
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:43,327	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Guy gets inside another look
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:49,983	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Like I tell you this is this is this is extremely rare
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:55,103	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Cells don't get inside other cells when they do get inside of the cells for the most part
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:56,639	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Doesn't work out
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:11:02,271	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Because if you're this little guy on the inside now you're trapped you can't get the things you want to eat it's cut off
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:05,343	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	From the outside world and chances are it will die
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:09,183	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Which is what happens you know 99.999% of the
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:11,743	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Not this time
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:19,935	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	If it's a swallower is capable of of bringing in that outside world and feeding it
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:20,959	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Food and feeding it to it
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:23,007	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Swallow if you like then then it will work
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:29,407	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Maybe that's what happened to your sister maybe the big sale had some kind of mutation that allowed it to keep
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:30,943	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Eating the little salad spinner
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:31,711	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Eliza Doolittle sell survive
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:33,503	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	And thrives
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:35,551	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Because the second thing that happens here
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:36,831	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Is a little cell in the inside
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:41,183	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Struct device
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:45,023	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Excel with two cells inside it maybe then. I was inside it
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:47,327	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Which if you're a big cell
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:48,607	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Normally not a great
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:50,399	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Situation you find yourself with
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:57,567	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	We guessed inside you imagine having a house party and the gas won't go away
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:12:00,383	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	The cost of producing more guests
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:03,711	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	I was going to be a ride is going to be a mother or something
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:09,343	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	The point is his neck when you get to this point it really shouldn't work
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:10,879	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	But somehow
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:12,671	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	It did
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:14,463	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	But not only did one cell get eaten
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:18,047	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Will Survive even rear
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:24,447	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	And then divided without creating a right even rarer but then somehow this big sale finds ways over and over
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:25,471	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Taking care of moles
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:26,495	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Do new houseguest
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:32,895	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Amerileather they're all stages of that life cycle you got some old folk in there and you got some babies in that or not how you going
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:34,175	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Going to do it while you probably need to
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:38,527	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	I put in the Maternity Ward first of all to look after the baby's let's
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:44,159	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Yeah that's that's that's putting some kind of clinic for for end-of-life for the for the foot today for the geriatrics
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:45,183	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Sauna
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:49,535	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	This big Sal is able to construct all this new Machinery inside itself
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:53,375	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	To keep this extraordinarily various group of houseguests
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:54,399	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Happy
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:55,679	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Why
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:58,495	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Why would it bother I mean like what is the
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:02,335	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	What is the cell get in return and youth you said
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:06,431	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Said it didn't have enough energy to build itself bigger so how is it even doing this
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:09,503	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Well now you're getting to the real number of the store
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:14,367	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	The key here says Nick is those little house guests are living now in the Big South
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,647	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	They're not ordinary house
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:21,279	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Very very specific kind of bacteria that we now call mitochondria
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:25,887	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	And if you look at the descendants of those little guys who live in us right now they have
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:27,423	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	An amazingly strong
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:29,215	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Electrical charge
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:30,751	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Let's order
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:31,775	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Radiates
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:33,567	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Across the membrane
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:34,847	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	On their outside
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:36,383	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	An electrical charge
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:36,895	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Is
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:40,735	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	At least it's the tiny it's a hundred and fifty million
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:44,319	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	But if you shrink yourself down to
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:46,879	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	The size of a molecule
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:53,791	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	I'm feel the strength of the electric field right next to. Membrane is it exactly
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:14:00,191	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	230 million volts per meter which is equivalent to a bolt of lightning
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:05,567	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	This is what the big show gets back cuz it's return gift
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:11,711	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Lightning
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:22,975	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	And it's this new electricity that gets it
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:27,071	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	It helps it find all these new adventures in construction project
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:28,351	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Now they can
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:29,375	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Support
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:31,679	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Enormously large adenine so you can have
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:36,543	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Bad bacteria may have one or two copies of a gene you cannot have
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:42,687	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	20 or 30 maybe 50 there's no penalty for doing 7 what I want that gives you as a kind of a redundancy that allows
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:47,039	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Different genes to do slightly different job so to diverge to
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:50,623	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	No you do call the scope to experiment to try things out
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:57,023	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	So you have one group going off to become algae and plants in another group becoming animals in another group becoming the funky and
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:59,071	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	The Descendants did
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:14:59,839	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	So well
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:01,119	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	They've taken over the world
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:03,167	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	And they all came from that
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:04,447	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	One single
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:10,335	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Coming together and that one you knew yes it comes down to one merger between two cells
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:12,639	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	That made one cell
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:13,919	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	And then everything comes from
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:21,343	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Yume redwood tree of the hummingbird
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:22,367	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Fungus
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:24,415	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	He's about to be growing in a pond
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:27,743	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Every type of light that we can see with our Naked Eyes
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:30,047	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	And many that we caught
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:32,351	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	I'm coming from that single cell
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:40,543	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	And what does spawns says Nick is is this is how we get the great tree of life that we see all around us
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,311	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Hector
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:43,359	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Eons and eons of sameness
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:47,199	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Send me to get this Many-Splendored Thing That is nature
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:49,759	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	It starts right here but we're looking at
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:52,063	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Is truly the Second Genesis
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:56,671	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Play okay hold on a second hold on
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:15:59,999	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	How do we know any of this actually happen
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:05,631	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	All that that all of the life that we can see comes from one cell how would we possibly know that
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:07,679	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Well starting with us
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:12,799	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	If you if you go in and look at the genetic material inside ourselves
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:14,847	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	About half of all dreams
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:16,127	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Little bit less than half
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:19,455	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	We find them in bacteria or archaea
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:23,807	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Mixes you can see very clearly that the original DNA of those two cells
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:25,343	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Two cells are merged into one
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:27,135	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	They're inside us
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:29,951	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Stupid ass that sequence in the structure has remained
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:31,999	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Kind of almost intact
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:38,399	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	The two billion years and just the structure of yourselves alone provides an important clue if you look at the cells of old
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:40,959	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	All those things if you look it but take one of your cells
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:46,591	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	And one cell from that fungus so from the spruce so from the whale
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:48,639	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Unless you were
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:50,687	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Unless you are next Messi been trained in this
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:52,735	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	It would be very hard
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:54,015	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	To tell the difference
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:54,783	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Between those
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:57,087	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	In other words all of ourselves
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:58,111	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Lacrosse animal
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:17:00,159	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Plants
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:01,183	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Something like those original
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:08,095	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Very very similar they will have that nucleus that's internal skeleton they would have mitochondria those are the
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:08,863	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Lightning bolt
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:09,887	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Descendants of that first of all.
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:12,191	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	They got swallowed you know we have
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:18,335	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	40 trillion cells on each of those has got less a on average mm mitochondria so that they know that
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:21,919	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	A tremendous number of mitochondria in one human being
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:24,735	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	On the giant redwood tree has a lot more than that
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:27,039	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	And so does the worm I'm so
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:28,575	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	From that point of view just
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:30,879	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Biomass we are about 40%
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:31,903	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Mitochondria
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:33,695	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	So just from biomass
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:36,767	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	They are possibly the single most
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:38,559	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Prolific
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:41,119	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Life-form that ever existed
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:42,143	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Okay you got me
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:42,655	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	I do like this
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:47,263	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	I mean it is also like
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:48,287	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	You know it's a little bit like
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:52,127	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	It's a pretty certain we learn who chimed in as we were working on this
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:54,175	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Remember our guy what was
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:55,711	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	His name from the floppy ears
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:57,759	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Kind of witch
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:59,295	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Is that Richard Richard
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:01,087	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Consists of
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:01,855	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Finding energy
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:08,767	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	He had that thing about he wrote a book is all a long time ago but it was all about actually talk to him at the time human and such
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:11,071	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Pictures of going along doing their thing and they're eating
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:16,447	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Draw leaves in the forest same way that chimps do now but then once they learn to cook once you start cooking
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:18,495	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Does a terrific advantage
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:21,055	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Cooking would break things down and then once
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:25,407	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Then you don't have to break things down inside you which means that you're putting less
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:31,807	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Energy into your food but getting more out of it. Increases the amount of energy that you can get from your food by 25
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:34,111	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	3040 50% maybe more
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:35,391	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Mysterious but that
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:37,439	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	That is when we got smart
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:40,511	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Because we were in again an energy Canyon
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:41,279	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Where was just
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:47,679	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Given what was around you and how much work it took to break it down to the parts you need you couldn't do much until you light a fire
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:48,447	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Fire underneath it
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:51,007	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	And and you like a lightning bolt
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:57,407	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	And you break it down so that you don't have to do that work cuz now the fires doing that work when you put it in your tummy and you get all the goods
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:58,431	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Would have to work
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:18:58,943	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	And now
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:00,991	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Now you have time
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:03,039	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	An energy to make a brain
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:03,551	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	They can think about
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,087	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	That is when
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:06,879	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	The genus homo
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:08,415	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Humans
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:09,951	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	In the first
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:11,231	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Full flowering
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:12,767	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	All the sense of that word

EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:14,559	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Wow that's a
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:18,143	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	To the energy Canyon sleeping
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:19,679	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Theory might actually
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:23,775	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Touch on mystery number 3 to the conscience one
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:29,663	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Cooking is an act of intentional I mean it you know when you decide to light the fire and
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:31,711	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Put the meat then you're doing something that you and
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:32,223	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Intend to do
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:34,783	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	To me is when you go back
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:36,575	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	To the original
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:37,087	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Pairing
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:39,391	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Just pure xidan
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:41,695	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	I meant so much
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:42,719	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Blood flow from something
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:45,023	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Incompletely cosmically ask
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:45,535	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Occidental
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:47,327	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	That's that's
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:49,375	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Really really
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:55,007	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	That merger and the
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:58,079	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Harmonious continuance of that merger
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:20:00,127	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Was so breathtakingly improbable
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:02,943	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Only once today
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:05,759	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Nick says it only happened once
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:06,527	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	2 billion years
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:09,855	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	And there's no evidence to suggest that it is
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:10,623	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Happenstance
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:11,391	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	So there is no
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:13,183	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Trajectory
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:14,207	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Two Worlds
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:16,767	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Necessary complex life or university
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:21,631	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Pregnant with the idea reverse there's nothing about the way that he pollution has worked
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:23,167	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	On Earth
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:23,935	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Just suggested
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:25,727	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Complex life is
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:26,751	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Uninhabitable out
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:31,871	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	And if this hadn't happened with the Earth just be still rich with with little
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:34,431	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	I don't know life ones that are smaller than the
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:36,479	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	The grain of rice that's
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:37,247	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	All we'd ever got
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:42,111	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	I think that's a I did does that mean that you have to have this incident
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:44,415	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	On planet xandar
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:46,207	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	And Planet zantar 36
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:50,303	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	That's really interesting right I think when we think about
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:53,375	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Finding the prospect of finding alien life
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:54,143	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	If we think
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:56,959	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	The universe the universe is so vast
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:21:00,287	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	That we cannot be alone. That must be life on other way
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:02,591	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	I think what this
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:03,871	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Tells us is that
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:07,455	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	We will probably find life elsewhere but it will probably be microbes
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:10,015	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	It was in a did the offensive
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:12,319	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	The odds of finding
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:13,343	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Something
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:18,464	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Like the aliens that you would you expect right so do what they'll do Finding Your Star Wars Cantina
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:20,256	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	All significant
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:24,352	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Gilda finding like a bacterium somebody probably
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:24,864	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Reasonable
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:31,264	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	You might find life but maybe it's going to be
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:31,776	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Boring
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:34,848	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	We could leave it right there
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:39,712	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	But you know you probably won't get killed by the Monte Vista.
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:41,504	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	That's a good thing that's

EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:30,816	| radiolab_podcast16cellmates |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
