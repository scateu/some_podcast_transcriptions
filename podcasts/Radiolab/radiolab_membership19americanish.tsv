EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:05,952	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The first trip inspired another trip
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:12,864	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Let's start in Denver Colorado
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:14,144	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Where
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:15,680	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I wanted to speak to this
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:17,984	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Young man

EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:37,952	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:40,512	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I wanted to talk to him because there's this
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:44,096	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Particular chapter in his family history
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:44,864	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	That
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:48,704	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Presented this thorny question to the United States of America
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:52,800	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Do you feel like you're like a descendant of immigrants
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:53,568	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Sort of like
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:55,360	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Not all the way like
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:57,664	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You're in the car
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:02:59,456	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Carson immigrants
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:00,992	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Cuz
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:04,064	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	People from Puerto Rico back then like 19
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:06,112	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	98 I think
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:09,952	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Maybe it was actually 1898
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:16,096	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And what happened in 1898 was that the United States had gotten sort of gravity
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:18,656	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	We grabbed
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:20,192	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The Philippines we grabbed
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:21,472	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Guam and we grabbed
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:25,568	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Puerto Rico which is where John Carlos family was from and
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:29,152	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Just a few years after Puerto Rico became part of us
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:32,992	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Great grandmother it's either great great or grate
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:37,088	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Grandmother don't remember you it was his great
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:42,720	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Great grandmother and her name was Isabel Gonzalez
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:44,768	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	She was on a boat she was on like
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:47,584	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Like they used to be like both
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:52,448	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	From going from here she was traveling alone and pregnant from
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:54,752	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Puerto Rico to New York City
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:58,848	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	When the boat arrived in Ellis Island white men
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:03:59,616	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Wood
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:05,504	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Go out in like select like people like you can't go not allowed you can't go where's your spouse not allowed
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:10,880	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	She was stopped at Ellis Island because all women arriving
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:12,672	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	At Ellis Island who were pregnant
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:19,071	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	We're stopped and examined and some of them were turned away a little historical assistir from Christina Fonseca
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:25,471	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I'm a professor of law at Columbia she says when those guys tried to pull Isabella side
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:29,823	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Said you can't even stop me much less question me or get in my way at all
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:33,919	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I am coming from Puerto Rico which is part of the United States
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:35,711	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I'm an American citizen
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:42,623	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And citizens cannot be stopped at the border Christina says around this time a lot of people a lot of goods
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:47,999	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Like fruits and with a shipment of orange among other things started arriving in the US
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:51,071	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	From the newly acquired territory
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:53,631	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And all of these new arrivals
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:57,215	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Posed a sort of existential question to the US
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:58,495	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Are these
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:00,543	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	New colonies
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:01,055	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Part of us
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:02,847	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Or are they something else
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:05,663	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So a bunch of these cases like
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:09,247	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Isabel Gonzalez's case ended up in the Supreme Court
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:11,295	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And they eventually became known
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:12,575	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Collectively as
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:13,599	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The insular
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:15,391	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The insular cases
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:16,671	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	What does insular mean
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:17,439	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Miss contacts
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:21,023	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Insular actually means relating to an island it also means
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:23,071	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Parochial or
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:25,887	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Close minded at the time when the United States annexed
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:29,983	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Puerto Rico the Philippines and Guam it still have territories that had Oklahoma to Arizona
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,519	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But it had not yet become States
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:33,055	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So territories were not new
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,591	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	However
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:39,967	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	These territories seemed very different to the American public they had different
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:41,503	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Cultures different
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,527	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Races
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:44,063	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	They didn't seem
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:46,111	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	American enough
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:51,999	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So the judges are dealing with the fact that these new islands are now
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:52,767	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Part of the US
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:59,167	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But they also have this public opinion in their heads and they don't want to let these people all the way in so in the
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:05,311	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Case of Isabel Gonzalez they ended up saying we're not going to answer the question of whether Puerto Ricans are actually us
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:06,335	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Citizens
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:09,407	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	We're just going to say they're not immigrants
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:11,455	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And if that's not confusing enough
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:17,599	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	They went on to say that Puerto Rico Puerto Rico is foreign to the United States in a domestic sense
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:21,183	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	That sounds like nonsense
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:22,719	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The dissenters in the case
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:29,631	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	That it sounded like nonsense nobody understood exactly what that meant it's like almost textbook
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:32,191	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Doublethink right like it's like foreign but the mess
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:38,079	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Math textbook having it both ways
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:40,895	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Do you feel like you're Puerto Rican
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:44,479	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Gordo Vegas
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:45,247	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	If y'all
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:46,783	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	American
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:52,415	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Parsley just partially why
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:55,231	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Cuz I'm also
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:56,511	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Little bit
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:58,559	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Irish I think
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:00,351	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The Irish
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:02,911	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Well yeah on Dad side you know your friend
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:14,175	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Just backup go ahead and say so today on Radiolab we're continuing our thought that we had in the last episode
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:19,039	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So we did about citizenship about what it means to belong to a place or country
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:24,671	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The last episode we spend some time in Switzerland think about cowbells but this time we've got a story that
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:26,975	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	It's a little bit closer to home
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:29,279	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Yeah and
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:33,887	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	This next part is really what blew me away and actually inspired my second
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:39,519	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Shortly after the insular cases Congress stepped in and they pass the law to make it so that
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:42,847	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Anybody born in Puerto Rico is an automatic US citizen
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:43,615	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Congress
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:49,759	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Did the same thing for the other major territories I mean they can't vote for president they don't have a vote in Congress
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:53,855	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But at least the people born in those territories are automatically
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:54,879	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	US citizens
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:56,159	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Except
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:57,951	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	41 place
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:04,863	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	A cluster of tiny little Islands in that great blue expanse the Pacific Ocean between Hawaii
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:05,631	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	New Zealand
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:12,543	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Call American Samoa
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:14,847	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The only place in the world
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:18,943	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	That is US soil and people who are born here are not citizens
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:23,551	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So is it true yes
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:24,319	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Sissy
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:29,951	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Attention existing only place where the whole like my baby is born the u.s. Air Force
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:30,463	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Doesn't happen
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:31,743	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Cracked
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:33,023	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	They become what are they
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:38,399	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	In their passport they have a US passport but on the last page it says
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:40,447	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	This person is not a US citizen
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:41,215	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	.
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:42,495	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	US national
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:44,799	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	A child born in American Samoa
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:51,199	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Will not become an automatic citizen they have to go take the test they have to pay close to $800
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:56,831	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And you can't even like there's no immigration office in American Samoa so you have to go
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:58,367	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	To some other part of the states
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:00,159	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Stay there for a few months
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:02,463	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And apply in order to qualify
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:06,303	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So it's it's
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:09,119	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And it's not just weird I mean it
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:14,495	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	When I first looked into it it seems like this hold over from this
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:17,055	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Really racist time in our history
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:17,823	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:18,335	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Then
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:20,639	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I started making calls
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:22,687	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Two American Samoans
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:24,479	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Living in American Samoa
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:26,271	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	End
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,039	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I realized
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:28,831	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	There might be
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:31,647	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	A more complicated reason why
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,695	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	American Samoans
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:38,047	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Still are not US citizens after all these years
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:43,935	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So I decided to get on a plane
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:48,799	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	After a 25 hour trip
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:54,687	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I landed in the middle of the night
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:59,807	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Went through border security
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:01,599	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	That I walked out of the
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:05,439	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Of the airport which is really small
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:10,047	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Very nice to meet you and
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:11,583	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	People I had email
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:13,375	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Showed up to the airport
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:18,495	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	To greet me with lady with like flowers and
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:28,223	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And I appreciate that was just like the hotel picking me up but it was like this woman who I haven't even talked to you on the phone but you knew I was
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:29,503	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Coming from far away
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:38,207	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And then more and more people who I talk to you showed up
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:42,047	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Wait David So instantly it felt
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:43,583	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So welcoming
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:46,399	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Anyway I got to my hotel that night
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:48,447	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And then the next morning
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:53,055	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I stepped out of my hotel Ocean
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:55,359	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You and it was
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:55,871	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Josh
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:11:02,783	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Incredibly gorgeous, I saw the pictures of what no one told me
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:04,319	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Who is amazing
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:05,599	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Huge
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:06,111	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Lush
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:07,391	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Mountain
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:08,927	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Bright green mountains
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:12,255	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Only palm trees pastel colored
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:15,071	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Houses tucked into the side of these cliffs
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:16,095	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	American flag
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:18,655	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Flying high
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:19,679	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Just stunning
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:22,239	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	How big how big is American Samoa
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:23,007	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Well
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:26,079	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	It's a cluster of islands with the main island to Tukwila
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:30,175	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Is about 50 square miles with about 50000
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:32,479	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	2
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:33,759	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Lane Road
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:35,551	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Whiskey like the main route
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:37,343	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	There's just one main road
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:41,439	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	That you drive so if you if the oceans on your
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:43,487	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Right you're probably going east
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:45,279	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	If the oceans on your left you're probably going west
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:46,559	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Angie
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:51,423	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I spent 12 days there and it was just kind of like riding back and forth and back and forth
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,703	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	With different people
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:55,007	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	With who had different ideas of
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:57,823	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	What the island was about
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:12:00,383	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Which is really interesting seeing the same places
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:02,431	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Through different eyes
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:04,479	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I'm so
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:05,503	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	It is this
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:10,367	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The first stop I made was to meet with a guy named
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:12,415	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Hi
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:15,743	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Charles alive Lima
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:17,023	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Really smiley
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:21,631	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Silver hair thin Rim glasses wearing a floral shirt and flip-flops
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:25,215	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Almost everybody at the courthouse was wearing flip-flops
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:32,383	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	When I caught up with him he was actually meeting with a couple of Samoan men who were in the middle of a Landis
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:35,967	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Which is basically the rights of the Chiefs
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:38,015	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Coldest top of this mountain
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:44,415	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But the reason I wanted to talk
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:46,207	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Is that he has a case
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:48,255	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Right now pending before the federal courts
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:50,559	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	That's basically
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:52,863	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Isabel Gonzalez in 2019
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:54,655	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	He's arguing that
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:58,495	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Denying American Samoans Birthright citizenship
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:00,287	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Is unconstitutional
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:02,335	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So I believe that
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:04,127	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	When you were born in American Samoa
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:04,895	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You're American
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:12,319	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	An unusual American but you are still on now in Charles case he's with sometime ones call afakasi
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:13,599	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	My mother was born in
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:21,023	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Auburn New York mom is white and his dad is from Western Samoa which is not part of the US
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:23,071	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Is parents actually met in the states
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:25,119	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	His dad was in grad school in DC
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:26,655	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:29,215	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	My father and mother could not get married in Virginia
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:30,495	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Because of the
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:33,823	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Anti-miscegenation laws this was back in 19 over East
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:35,615	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Cuz I'm a mother kept trying to insist
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:36,639	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The Samoans are not
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:43,551	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Black they are something different because now he looks too. But they were actually able to get married
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:45,087	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Hayden Washington DC
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:48,671	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And they moved to American Samoa where Charlie was born
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:52,255	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And you think that Charlie would be an automatic US citizen
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:59,423	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And this is a child is born in the u.s. territory but she had to go cuz they had to register at the closest Embassy
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:03,775	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	His mom a US citizen actually had to register him in a foreign country
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:07,359	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The closest Embassy with all the way in New Zealand
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:09,663	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You know it doesn't make any sense in it
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:16,575	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And it's against the principles of the United States really says the fact that American Samoans are not autumn
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:21,183	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Ematic citizens by birth is hiding a lot of in justices that are going on
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:23,743	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Justices that could be remedied
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:27,071	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	If you didn't say oh well we are your National
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:29,887	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You can be treated differently
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:35,519	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Hiking boots
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:37,567	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Should I be here
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:42,431	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So I drove around with Charlie
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:43,455	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	For a while
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:44,479	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:52,927	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And everywhere I saw signs of threats of natural disaster
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:56,767	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Tsunamis typhoons earthquake
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:15:04,447	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You showed me the Town Center which is really just a cluster of
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:05,983	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Pastel colored buildings
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:10,335	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	These are all the Old Navy
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:18,015	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And the original US Naval Base which is really where this whole thing got started
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:23,647	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So the US Navy showed up in American Samoa in the late 1800s
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:25,183	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Samoa
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:31,583	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Extremely fractured Germany and the UK were hanging out there too and there were fights among Chiefs decor
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:33,887	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Bought the islands about who owned what turf
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:40,799	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And us may be offered the island of American Samoa protection in exchange for
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:47,199	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Congo Bongo Bay Harper
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:53,599	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Super barber in the South Seas possibly in all the Pacific
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:54,367	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Wanted that protects
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:55,903	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	American Samoans
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:58,463	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	They said that's great. It was a good deal
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:16:00,255	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	One of their High Chiefs his name is Moana
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:02,047	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	What's
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:04,351	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Basically telling everybody know it
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:06,399	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Have the Americans come in
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:08,191	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	End in 1900
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:09,215	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	They made it official
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:11,519	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Some Samoan Chiefs
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:14,079	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Signed what they called a deed of session
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:15,871	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The Handover sovereignty
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:16,639	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The United States
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:20,991	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And according to Charlie at the time that they did this
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:21,759	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	They thought
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:27,647	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	They had become US citizen of course thanks to the rulings in the insular cases they actually hadn't
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:28,927	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And then
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:31,487	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	1929 Congress
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:34,303	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Took up the question of whether American Samoans
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:36,095	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Should be US citizens
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:37,631	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And they just said
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:40,191	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	No and really some of
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:44,799	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Vile racist statements being made back their 1929 against it
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:46,591	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	We don't want any
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:47,615	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Of these

EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:59,967	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Bathing the footsteps of the US Supreme Court
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:04,063	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Lena says he just wanted the court to give some kind of explanation
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:07,391	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Why American Samoans have been treated
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:10,719	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Why why me why keep us the runaround
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:11,231	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:14,559	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	When it got to the supreme court date
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:15,583	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Declined tip
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:16,095	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Share the case
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:21,471	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	2016 they just refuse to make a decision on it
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:25,567	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Why are they so afraid to come out just nine of them
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:31,967	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Today Charlie and Neil have another case going with some American Samoans in Utah
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:34,527	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Hopefully this second time around

EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:40,927	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And so
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:43,743	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	At this point of my trip I was curious
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:44,511	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	How
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:46,303	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Other American Samoans
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:49,119	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Even ones who aren't in the states trying to get a job
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:52,191	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	How they felt about this case
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:53,471	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	In about citizenship
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:54,495	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I assumed that
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:56,799	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	They would be behind it because
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:58,591	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Who wants to live in this like
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:02,431	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Foreign but domestic put for in limbo space
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:08,319	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But public service announcement
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:11,647	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Then I talked to this guy
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:18,047	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	His name is Papa out anger

EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:25,983	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	He's on the radio reading from the American someone Constitution all the time which is kind of weird
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:30,079	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Radio reading from the Constitution
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:31,359	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Tatoosh allowed
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:35,967	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Cool weird
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:45,951	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And actually when he heard I was looking into the citizenship question he got a hold of me okay
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:49,279	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Okay go ahead
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:52,607	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So you'll be coming West on the main road

EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:05,407	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Got a little bit lost again
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:11,551	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Little familiarity where they don't need street signs
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:15,647	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You'll be alright
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:17,184	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But eventually I did find it.

EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:53,920	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And so there were some people who got caught
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:57,504	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I just have to stop
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:26:01,088	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Sitting there on the side of the road for 15 minutes until it's over
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:05,440	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	They don't force them to pray but they're just supposed to have quiet time
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:06,208	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Set for men
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:07,744	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	For 15 minutes
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:12,608	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	What happens if you don't do that anybody across these laws and everything for the old days
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:13,888	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You're very handsome
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:14,656	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Appendages
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:18,240	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Cheap my Ava told me that back in the old days like 1800s
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:21,312	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You would just immediately get kicked out of the village
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:28,736	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	We don't want to see them no more which means you had no food no protection
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:31,040	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Letgo
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:31,808	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Death penalty
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:33,088	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Those days
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:37,952	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You know but you know nowadays we don't have to do that we would do it like once
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:41,792	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	When I was talking to you for a puppy oppa he told me that
EDL	00:26:42,304	00:26:48,448	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	These days a pretty common punishment would be like making the person feed the whole village
EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:50,496	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Should I mean
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:51,776	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Picked a lot of food
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:57,408	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	50k pekin 50k turkey tail
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:59,200	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	50k star
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:27:00,480	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Wahoo
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:01,248	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	+ +
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:06,112	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But cheap might have a told me you know if you keep breaking the curfew over and over again
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:08,416	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You can still get kicked out of the village
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:12,000	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Which piscine happened a few times in his life so it's okay
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:18,400	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So so one of the arguments that is made is like this would not pass muster under the US Constitution
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:19,424	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Yeah
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:20,704	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But the thing is like
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:23,776	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	These guys aren't really the government
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:30,688	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	If you look at it one way it's kind of like a gated community or a country club you opt-in to living there
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:33,504	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And you opt into
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:34,272	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You know
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:35,040	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Living under these
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:36,576	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Rules
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:41,952	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But the fear is that if everyone born on the island were automatically granted citizenship
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:45,280	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Then a bunch of other us laws might
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:47,328	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Start getting applied here to
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:51,680	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And they wouldn't be able to do things like these curfews the reason why
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:59,104	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Such an existential threat to American Samoans to become US citizen
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:05,504	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Because the 14th Amendment also guarantees equal protection under laws American Samoa
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:07,040	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Become Birthright citizens
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:12,928	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	It's not long before everyone born on this island is given that equality under the law
EDL	00:28:12,928	00:28:14,976	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But that word equality
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:17,024	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Historically and even now
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:19,072	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	That's such a
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:22,400	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Difficult complicated word to get around
EDL	00:28:22,400	00:28:22,912	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Because
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:26,752	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	US citizenship is not something that's
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:29,056	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Applied in a pure
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:29,568	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Way
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:34,432	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	It's saying that historically mixed with a free market
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:38,784	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The ideal of equality it actually gets mixed in with other realities
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:40,320	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Capitalism and interest
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:44,672	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The people in power and the artificial population of lands that were
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:46,464	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	People by native peoples
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:52,096	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And the results have been time and time again that indigenous people have ended up losing their land
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:55,424	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Or cultural practice in someone's we have a saying
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:58,752	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Original know it is a Monday mandala
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:28:59,520	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Hello Panda

EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:08,480	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	That we
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:11,296	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Don't go after US citizenship
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:13,600	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And forget that we have so much to lose
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:16,160	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Arnett being our land and our natural resources
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:18,208	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	In our culture and our language
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:21,536	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Things that have been lost by so many other native peoples
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:27,168	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Are you a US citizen
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:28,960	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Yes

EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:43,552	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	If you are you a citizen why should everyone else become US citizen
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:46,880	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Feel as a US citizen do you feel like you've lost something
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:52,256	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I is it individual haven't lost something
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:55,328	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Because I am part of an extended family
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:56,864	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	That lives on family land
EDL	00:29:58,656	00:29:59,424	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So so
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:02,496	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Could they not live on family lands as US citizens
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:07,616	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Yes technically speaking here I am a US citizen there many of us who are US citizens
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:09,408	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	We could live on family land
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:11,968	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	We do live on family

EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:23,488	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Citizenship to even more
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:27,328	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And then he explained to me that
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:31,680	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	There's a law in American Samoa that says you have to be 50%
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:32,448	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Blood
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:33,472	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Samoan blood
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:39,360	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	To own land like even if someone person wanted to sell me or like
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:40,640	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Give me their land
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:41,920	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	They couldn't by law
EDL	00:30:41,920	00:30:42,432	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:45,504	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Someone from some country
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:46,272	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Say

EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:03,168	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The law says anyone born here is a US citic
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:04,960	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Okay
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:06,496	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So this person here
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:08,288	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I'm trying to let you know
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:11,616	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Build a business becomes a wealthy businessman
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:12,896	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	From China
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:14,688	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And one day he wants to buy land
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:16,736	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Endnote
EDL	00:31:17,504	00:31:20,064	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Lord say well no we can't sell you these lands
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:24,160	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Everybody says no I want to buy that land and I have the right to buy that
EDL	00:31:25,696	00:31:26,208	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Okay
EDL	00:31:27,232	00:31:28,256	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	That's what I'm talking
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:29,024	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	About that's the threat
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:35,936	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Finally he was like think about it like if everyone born here is a Birthright Citizen and everyone has equal rights
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:39,520	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Here it's not long before a Chinese person is born here
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:43,616	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The US citizen they have equal rights to the land as someone's to
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:45,408	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And then things
EDL	00:31:45,408	00:31:47,200	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	They could sue to make that
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:49,248	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Blood Simon law illegal
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:50,528	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:53,856	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Maybe not in one generation but in a couple Generations
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:56,416	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Blood someone with loser land
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:57,184	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	That's a threat
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:32:01,280	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I guess you have to imagine what would Hawaii be like
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:04,096	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	If they didn't lose all their lands the way that they had
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:07,424	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Siwik to us Hawaii is what we never want to become
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:12,032	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You know you land at the airport in Hawaii who do you see where are the Hawaiians
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:14,592	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You know for us to look at Hawaii
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:16,128	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You still look at a sad story
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:17,664	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You know
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:18,688	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:26,368	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But everything I say you have to also remember we're loyal and patriotic people
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:28,928	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	It's worth pointing out that
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:35,328	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	American Samoa has one of the highest rates of military enlistment of any US state or territory
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:41,728	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	They say the Pledge of Allegiance at school in the morning they learn US History learn about the US Constitution
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:43,520	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But this is still our home
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:45,312	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Right now we still have to protect

EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:30,496	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	My ear is 100% blood Samoan
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:34,336	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But she's not that culturally xiamen she doesn't speak the language very well she's
EDL	00:37:34,848	00:37:36,640	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Only spent a few years there
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:43,040	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Whereas Genevieve is very culturally someone has spent most of her life there speaks perfect someone but
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:49,440	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Because she and her sisters are only 25% Samoan blood because we're not 50% she can't
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:52,256	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Technically own land in American Samoa
EDL	00:37:52,256	00:37:58,656	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Her mom recently passed away and try to block we planned to her and her sisters even if it was written in
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:38:00,192	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Well that it was us

EDL	00:38:01,728	00:38:07,872	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	We can't get it because we're not 50% and this blood loss effects money
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:11,968	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Because of her son
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:16,064	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Samuel Pucci brought along in the car
EDL	00:38:17,856	00:38:20,416	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Maya took away video game and he

EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:32,960	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Drama
EDL	00:38:34,496	00:38:38,336	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Anyway it affects her son because his dad
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:43,456	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Is American without one drop of someone's blood
EDL	00:38:46,016	00:38:48,064	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Sol Samuels kids
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:53,184	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Will only be able to own land if he has them with a half or full blood sample
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:05,728	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Your testimony kids you can marry white girl
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:12,896	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Mom I got my glasses

EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:21,088	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And then another name that came up
EDL	00:39:21,088	00:39:21,856	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Is that
EDL	00:39:21,856	00:39:24,160	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Genevieve interestingly is
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:24,672	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	She loves you
EDL	00:39:25,440	00:39:28,512	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And she has a partner who she wants to marry
EDL	00:39:28,512	00:39:32,096	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	My first
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:39,008	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Are you planning on a second I don't know we'll see how good she is but seems like
EDL	00:39:39,008	00:39:41,056	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Marriage is not legal in American Samoa
EDL	00:39:41,056	00:39:42,336	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	We couldn't be
EDL	00:39:43,360	00:39:46,688	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Public affectionate with each other or
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:52,832	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Be a couple my mom still was like whatever you do need to do it inside the bedroom like we couldn't even be in
EDL	00:39:53,344	00:39:55,648	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	House in like give each other a hug or something
EDL	00:39:56,416	00:39:59,488	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Doesn't that we went through a couple years of really
EDL	00:39:59,488	00:40:00,256	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Rocky
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:02,304	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Relationship
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:03,840	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And then
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:07,680	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So here you got
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:13,056	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Genevieve and my two people who the Constitution applied here the way it does in the states
EDL	00:40:13,568	00:40:14,336	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	It seems like
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:15,872	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Their problems will be solved
EDL	00:40:15,872	00:40:21,248	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Genevieve would get her land and my son could have kids with whoever he wants to
EDL	00:40:21,248	00:40:24,832	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And maybe Genevieve down the road could marry whoever she wants to
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:26,624	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Do you wish you could
EDL	00:40:26,624	00:40:27,648	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Get married here
EDL	00:40:30,208	00:40:31,488	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Yes or no I mean
EDL	00:40:33,792	00:40:37,632	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I don't have the same views as other gay people like
EDL	00:40:38,400	00:40:40,704	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I'm a Republican and
EDL	00:40:40,704	00:40:45,312	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	People always ask me how can you be gay in a Republican and a female right
EDL	00:40:45,824	00:40:52,224	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I have certain views like I'd rather have Financial stability at the end of the day then be able to get married to someone you know I draw
EDL	00:40:52,224	00:40:54,272	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Try to be rich and with someone then
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:55,552	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Poor and Mary
EDL	00:40:55,552	00:40:58,368	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Because in the end we're going to divorce either way right
EDL	00:41:00,416	00:41:03,488	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	First time in American Samoa and I don't know like
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:05,792	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I don't know anything what do I know
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:07,328	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But but
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:09,120	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But I'm like trying to think about like
EDL	00:41:09,888	00:41:15,520	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Growing up on Michael being a US citizen like matters and it's like it comes with all these rights
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:18,336	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom of
EDL	00:41:18,336	00:41:21,664	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Equality under the law and stuff like that
EDL	00:41:24,224	00:41:26,784	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Are yours we have them with high system so
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:28,064	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	All that stuff is
EDL	00:41:28,576	00:41:29,600	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Does it matter
EDL	00:41:30,112	00:41:32,160	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Where is freedom of speech until they say
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:33,696	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I'm speaking
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:36,768	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Yunnan
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:38,816	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Go get coffee
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:43,168	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	She for everybody so that yeah that doesn't take place.
EDL	00:41:44,448	00:41:45,216	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Now
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:49,312	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Even though Birthright citizenship wouldn't necessarily change all that
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:53,919	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I still expected them to what Birthright citizenship for American Samoans
EDL	00:41:54,687	00:41:55,455	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But
EDL	00:41:55,455	00:41:56,735	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	They both told me
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:41:57,503	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	No
EDL	00:41:57,503	00:42:00,831	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Are you a US citizen are you
EDL	00:42:01,855	00:42:05,183	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Yay
EDL	00:42:05,183	00:42:11,583	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	We have learned that an American can I get what if
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:15,679	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Reserved
EDL	00:42:15,679	00:42:16,447	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Fundamental rights

EDL	00:42:25,407	00:42:27,455	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	People could sue in federal court
EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:28,479	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And enforce
EDL	00:42:28,991	00:42:29,503	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Yeah

EDL	00:43:15,839	00:43:16,607	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I think that
EDL	00:43:17,119	00:43:20,191	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And we we get to spend more time as a family
EDL	00:43:20,191	00:43:26,591	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You don't own our own are our own business we would never be able to do that in the states
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:29,919	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You don't people who buy a house in the states I called Man U
EDL	00:43:30,431	00:43:34,271	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You know you made it whatever you bought a house your homeowner
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:37,855	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I'm like no way that
EDL	00:43:37,855	00:43:40,159	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	We've learned that fax that was such
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:41,439	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Bulshit
EDL	00:43:41,439	00:43:47,839	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	We don't use credit anymore we don't use none of that f****** s*** that they have out there we don't we don't
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:49,119	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	We are not in debt
EDL	00:43:49,119	00:43:49,631	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	We are
EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:51,935	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Text but what we have
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:52,703	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Here
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:53,215	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	We're happy
EDL	00:43:58,079	00:43:59,359	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I was so blinded
EDL	00:44:01,407	00:44:02,687	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Life truly should
EDL	00:44:04,223	00:44:04,991	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Is Rip life
EDL	00:44:04,991	00:44:06,783	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	We live like everyday
EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:07,295	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I love it
EDL	00:44:08,319	00:44:08,831	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I love it
EDL	00:44:11,135	00:44:13,439	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	A lot of that isn't it a lot of that like
EDL	00:44:13,951	00:44:16,511	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The fact that you do have land like you own land
EDL	00:44:17,023	00:44:17,791	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Yep
EDL	00:44:17,791	00:44:18,303	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Off of it
EDL	00:44:18,815	00:44:20,351	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But at the same time
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:23,935	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	They did both agree that these land ownership laws about blood are
EDL	00:44:23,935	00:44:24,703	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Kind of messed up
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:30,335	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And Charlie a lalima the lawyer on that citizenship case we mentioned
EDL	00:44:30,335	00:44:33,663	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	That's what he thinks to
EDL	00:44:33,663	00:44:35,711	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	He's actually asked him to
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:37,503	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Help try to get her mom's land
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:40,319	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	That's this whole citizenship case again
EDL	00:44:41,087	00:44:43,647	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	It somehow you were special down here
EDL	00:44:43,647	00:44:47,487	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	That you're entitled and able to do a lot of these things that are Peyton Lee
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:53,375	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And even worse in my mind is
EDL	00:44:53,375	00:44:57,983	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Actually does want to preserve someone ownership of lands
EDL	00:44:57,983	00:45:02,079	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But just to do it in some other way because he thinks the blood rules are just
EDL	00:45:02,079	00:45:05,919	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Illegal and other basically a kind of Jim Crow law
EDL	00:45:05,919	00:45:08,735	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So there was a case actually two two years ago
EDL	00:45:08,735	00:45:11,807	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And I try to explain to Monty and Genevieve
EDL	00:45:11,807	00:45:16,415	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	That you could see the fight for citizenship as a fight against the insular cases
EDL	00:45:16,415	00:45:17,183	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	In which
EDL	00:45:17,183	00:45:21,023	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The Supreme Court Justices called territories like American Samoa
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:23,839	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Quote possessions inhabited by alien races
EDL	00:45:24,351	00:45:30,495	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And said they were unfit for Anglo-Saxon legal Traditions he thought it was very racist and he wanted that the US gov
EDL	00:45:34,079	00:45:36,895	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Yeah it's it's it's it's explained
EDL	00:45:36,895	00:45:37,919	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Like work.
EDL	00:45:37,919	00:45:38,687	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Because
EDL	00:45:38,687	00:45:41,247	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Is he feels like someone's are in a limbo a little bit
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:41,759	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Legally
EDL	00:45:42,271	00:45:48,415	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Well let's go back to the 1904 figure out what the
EDL	00:45:51,999	00:45:54,303	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Move on with your life right now
EDL	00:46:02,239	00:46:03,263	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And honestly
EDL	00:46:03,775	00:46:05,567	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Leaving the car with those two
EDL	00:46:05,567	00:46:07,359	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	It did make me wonder
EDL	00:46:08,383	00:46:11,455	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	How common is their perspective on the island
EDL	00:46:11,967	00:46:13,759	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So my name is Juliet
EDL	00:46:13,759	00:46:18,879	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I spent a bunch of time wandering around for the next couple days
EDL	00:46:18,879	00:46:22,975	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Taking a very informal poll
EDL	00:46:23,487	00:46:26,047	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Ask you a couple questions that okay
EDL	00:46:26,047	00:46:27,839	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	If it were put to a vote
EDL	00:46:27,839	00:46:28,863	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Would you make
EDL	00:46:28,863	00:46:32,191	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	American Samoans automatic citizen
EDL	00:46:32,191	00:46:33,471	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Becoming a US citizen
EDL	00:46:36,287	00:46:38,847	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	At first it seemed like it was just a lot of
EDL	00:46:39,615	00:46:41,407	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	No because I
EDL	00:46:41,919	00:46:48,063	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Always got to be mindful of what happened to blonde when he States took over Guam we're truly blessed in the sense that we were
EDL	00:46:49,087	00:46:54,719	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Keep a culture or land this one someone veteran
EDL	00:46:54,719	00:47:00,351	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	With a make America great again baseball cap
EDL	00:47:00,351	00:47:04,447	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I don't I don't want to be a US citizen to be US national
EDL	00:47:04,959	00:47:05,983	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I don't want to
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:07,519	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	A Japanese or Chinese
EDL	00:47:08,543	00:47:09,311	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And I'm up
EDL	00:47:10,079	00:47:11,615	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The same thing
EDL	00:47:11,615	00:47:12,383	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Us
EDL	00:47:12,383	00:47:14,431	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You know I rather be a some more you know
EDL	00:47:15,455	00:47:16,991	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	What did you order here
EDL	00:47:16,991	00:47:22,111	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Fish fillet and then interesting lie at McDonald's
EDL	00:47:23,391	00:47:24,671	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	What do you think of that idea
EDL	00:47:24,671	00:47:27,999	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I think that's a great idea idea because that's going to be out
EDL	00:47:27,999	00:47:29,791	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Fair I got only
EDL	00:47:29,791	00:47:32,863	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Yes be great because
EDL	00:47:32,863	00:47:36,447	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Gay marriage when buffini is there called what
EDL	00:47:36,447	00:47:38,751	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Men At Birth but end up
EDL	00:47:38,751	00:47:42,079	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Dressing like women here we do have partners
EDL	00:47:42,079	00:47:47,711	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	They do live with them but you are kind of accepted in society but they're just not allowed to marry who they want to marry
EDL	00:47:47,711	00:47:49,503	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	It's not recognized by law
EDL	00:47:49,503	00:47:50,271	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So
EDL	00:47:50,783	00:47:52,831	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But that's totally okay in the US
EDL	00:47:53,343	00:47:57,183	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And in particular when I talk to immigrants
EDL	00:47:57,183	00:48:00,767	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	From Korea China the Philippines Tonga
EDL	00:48:01,279	00:48:04,351	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Most of them wanted citizenship
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:05,631	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	In the city
EDL	00:48:05,631	00:48:06,655	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Automatically granted
EDL	00:48:07,935	00:48:09,983	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Of course why not
EDL	00:48:09,983	00:48:11,519	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I wish I wish I wish
EDL	00:48:11,519	00:48:13,823	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Maybe God help me
EDL	00:48:14,335	00:48:16,383	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	For the non American Nationals
EDL	00:48:16,383	00:48:18,943	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	That you don't pay property Hawaii that be great if
EDL	00:48:19,711	00:48:20,223	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Iffy
EDL	00:48:20,735	00:48:21,759	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	If they become citizen
EDL	00:48:21,759	00:48:25,343	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	This is something else that Charlie Auto Lima brought up with me
EDL	00:48:25,343	00:48:26,111	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I guess
EDL	00:48:26,111	00:48:28,415	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Do you have kind of started to talk about
EDL	00:48:28,415	00:48:29,695	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Injustice has
EDL	00:48:29,695	00:48:31,231	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Cheer that are kind of
EDL	00:48:31,231	00:48:33,023	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Swept under the rug without
EDL	00:48:33,023	00:48:33,791	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Citizenship
EDL	00:48:33,791	00:48:37,119	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I think mostly it is how immigration will be handled
EDL	00:48:37,631	00:48:39,679	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	American Samoa you told me
EDL	00:48:39,679	00:48:41,983	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You have immigrants coming to the island for work
EDL	00:48:42,751	00:48:46,079	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And because American Samoa controls its own borders
EDL	00:48:46,591	00:48:47,615	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And because
EDL	00:48:47,615	00:48:52,991	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	He says there's locks enforcement of immigration laws some people talked about corruption
EDL	00:48:52,991	00:48:57,087	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You have situations where immigrants end up here on questionable visas
EDL	00:48:57,599	00:49:00,927	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Stripped of their rights to wages and fair working conditions
EDL	00:49:01,951	00:49:02,975	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And in some cases
EDL	00:49:02,975	00:49:04,255	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	It hasn't been very
EDL	00:49:05,535	00:49:06,559	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Good you know
EDL	00:49:07,071	00:49:08,607	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	What some of the foreigners
EDL	00:49:08,607	00:49:09,375	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	It's a lot of abuse
EDL	00:49:10,143	00:49:12,703	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But if you do become a citizen then and if
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:14,751	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	US immigration
EDL	00:49:15,263	00:49:16,543	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Service comes on actually
EDL	00:49:17,311	00:49:18,079	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Just the laws
EDL	00:49:18,079	00:49:18,591	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Requirements
EDL	00:49:19,359	00:49:20,383	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Farmers coming
EDL	00:49:20,383	00:49:20,895	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Work here
EDL	00:49:22,431	00:49:23,199	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Daniel
EDL	00:49:23,199	00:49:23,967	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Probably see
EDL	00:49:24,479	00:49:24,991	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Change
EDL	00:49:28,063	00:49:30,879	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I am serious as you were doing these interviews how are you processing all this
EDL	00:49:32,671	00:49:33,439	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Kind of
EDL	00:49:33,439	00:49:37,279	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Making my way across the island and there were some people
EDL	00:49:37,279	00:49:39,071	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	From this was a really
EDL	00:49:39,071	00:49:45,215	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Personal thing other people had these high ideals of Rights of others no high ideals of Samoan culture
EDL	00:49:46,495	00:49:48,543	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But I did meet one person who
EDL	00:49:49,055	00:49:51,359	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Kind of held all of these
EDL	00:49:51,359	00:49:52,383	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Ideas
EDL	00:49:52,383	00:49:54,175	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	In her mind that once
EDL	00:49:54,175	00:49:59,295	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Thank you and her name is

EDL	00:50:40,767	00:50:41,535	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	It was
EDL	00:50:41,535	00:50:43,071	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Bursting with life
EDL	00:50:43,071	00:50:44,607	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	As for the pictures pin

EDL	00:50:51,519	00:50:54,079	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Picture of a little bit I've been wrong
EDL	00:50:54,847	00:51:00,223	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Just about many trails to see how far I get
EDL	00:51:00,223	00:51:01,247	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Hahahahaha
EDL	00:51:02,271	00:51:05,343	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	What where has the grab the trails of like taking you
EDL	00:51:05,343	00:51:06,879	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Taking me to
EDL	00:51:06,879	00:51:09,183	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Foreign line in on the West Coast
EDL	00:51:09,183	00:51:12,767	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	She has flags from different countries and states hanging up in her bar
EDL	00:51:13,279	00:51:19,679	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And she has a unique perspective on American Samoa I don't know why I just am so disappointed that the
EDL	00:51:19,679	00:51:21,471	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	That we ended up this way
EDL	00:51:21,471	00:51:23,775	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Was very content with what little we get
EDL	00:51:23,775	00:51:29,151	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And there's no waves bandana by the people don't know what their rights are people don't know they don't speak up
EDL	00:51:29,151	00:51:32,223	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I appreciate these guys speaking up about the citizenship
EDL	00:51:32,223	00:51:37,855	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Because at least that's a bold move showing that maybe somebody's thinking I have tendency to think
EDL	00:51:38,367	00:51:40,927	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	As you can hear in my voice my thumb
EDL	00:51:40,927	00:51:47,327	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Lisa told me she went to the US Mainland for the first time when she was 16 years old
EDL	00:51:47,327	00:51:49,119	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Looking for anything better I was just
EDL	00:51:49,119	00:51:53,727	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Curious about what the other boy the world really looks like coming from this tiny lower.
EDL	00:51:54,495	00:51:57,823	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So she went to live with her aunt in San Diego to go to high school there
EDL	00:51:58,591	00:52:04,991	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Noise 60 I ended up following the Black Panthers the Black Panther
EDL	00:52:04,991	00:52:07,551	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Had arrived in San Diego by that time I was curious
EDL	00:52:08,063	00:52:14,463	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Say okay what are these people cuz all I hear is bad stuff
EDL	00:52:14,463	00:52:17,023	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Solution I want to be the meetings of them
EDL	00:52:17,023	00:52:23,423	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Newspapers were passed out posters post where the black people were gathering and we plan to keep the faith
EDL	00:52:23,423	00:52:29,055	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The necessary to to liberate himself improve their lives
EDL	00:52:29,567	00:52:33,407	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And they were actually citydog encouraging all the kids
EDL	00:52:34,175	00:52:39,039	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Black kids blue kids whatever color kids to go including someone's like me
EDL	00:52:39,807	00:52:46,207	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You go to college and I did and she said she also sat in on meeting
EDL	00:52:46,207	00:52:50,559	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Things in the women's movement
EDL	00:52:50,559	00:52:56,959	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Still have a job to have respect not be viewed as a piece of meat my whole purpose of hanging around whenever these big
EDL	00:52:56,959	00:52:59,519	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Rally's and I listen I watch
EDL	00:52:59,519	00:53:00,799	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Just learn and
EDL	00:53:00,799	00:53:01,567	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Make a note
EDL	00:53:01,567	00:53:06,431	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Learn and make a note and sitting there in the back of those meetings
EDL	00:53:06,943	00:53:12,319	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Inevitably I keep thinking about how she begins to think
EDL	00:53:12,319	00:53:16,927	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Men control their wives their children their daughters have no right to speak up
EDL	00:53:16,927	00:53:18,719	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The way things work at home
EDL	00:53:19,231	00:53:20,255	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Just isn't
EDL	00:53:20,255	00:53:23,327	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Just so much Injustice year for women
EDL	00:53:23,327	00:53:25,119	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The fact that women were not cheap
EDL	00:53:25,119	00:53:26,911	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Women were abused
EDL	00:53:26,911	00:53:28,447	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And young girls
EDL	00:53:28,447	00:53:33,823	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Domestic abuse out of frustrations and this is why I love someone and they never want to come back here
EDL	00:53:34,335	00:53:37,919	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But Lisa and her 20s decided she would come back
EDL	00:53:37,919	00:53:41,759	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Yeah I never felt that California was my home I was just a student of California
EDL	00:53:42,527	00:53:44,063	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And I learned a lot
EDL	00:53:44,575	00:53:49,439	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I learned a lot about my rights as a woman and I'll earn my right to speak up
EDL	00:53:49,951	00:53:52,255	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And she brought those lessons back home
EDL	00:53:52,255	00:53:53,279	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	When I came back I was
EDL	00:53:53,791	00:53:55,071	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Very vocal
EDL	00:53:55,071	00:53:57,119	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I spoke out I never back up
EDL	00:53:58,399	00:53:59,679	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	From any man
EDL	00:54:00,447	00:54:06,847	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And so when my when I ran for governor so she ran for office we have our campaigning for political
EDL	00:54:06,847	00:54:07,615	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Office
EDL	00:54:07,615	00:54:10,431	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The song One Way you don't speak out against anybody
EDL	00:54:10,431	00:54:11,455	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	As we still don't
EDL	00:54:11,967	00:54:13,247	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But I went against all that
EDL	00:54:14,271	00:54:16,831	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Am I spoke up I spoke about rights
EDL	00:54:16,831	00:54:18,367	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You have these rights that you can
EDL	00:54:18,879	00:54:20,159	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Advocate for
EDL	00:54:20,159	00:54:23,743	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But no one would do it because people were free and the Chiefs
EDL	00:54:23,743	00:54:24,511	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	My Dad's cousin
EDL	00:54:25,023	00:54:29,631	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	That he was a governor and he brought all the planning a big Who's Who the big
EDL	00:54:29,631	00:54:30,911	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Cheap the big boys
EDL	00:54:31,423	00:54:32,447	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	They came to Dad
EDL	00:54:32,959	00:54:34,239	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	An acid
EDL	00:54:34,751	00:54:38,335	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Ask him if you will please tell your daughter not to run for governor
EDL	00:54:38,847	00:54:39,615	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Because that
EDL	00:54:39,615	00:54:40,639	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	That's what cheese do
EDL	00:54:42,431	00:54:43,967	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And my father told me
EDL	00:54:43,967	00:54:45,759	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Well she's so own person
EDL	00:54:45,759	00:54:50,367	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	She's going to do whatever she wants and she can do that she has those right
EDL	00:54:50,367	00:54:51,647	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And I'm not going to tell her no
EDL	00:54:52,671	00:54:56,255	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I love them forever for that but he didn't like me because I was
EDL	00:54:57,023	00:54:58,559	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Because I was not the daughter
EDL	00:54:59,327	00:55:01,631	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	That I was supposed to be I was very vocal
EDL	00:55:02,399	00:55:04,703	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Tara Strong voices I hear me
EDL	00:55:06,495	00:55:07,007	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Did you win
EDL	00:55:07,519	00:55:10,079	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Oh no I just serious I would never win
EDL	00:55:10,591	00:55:12,127	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But I was very vocal
EDL	00:55:12,127	00:55:18,015	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I was just out there I did not care I wanted because I learned from America you have the right to speak
EDL	00:55:18,015	00:55:19,807	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And that was very big for me
EDL	00:55:19,807	00:55:22,623	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And so she believe she's like the one reason why I am
EDL	00:55:22,623	00:55:24,415	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Proud to be an American
EDL	00:55:24,415	00:55:25,183	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Is that
EDL	00:55:25,695	00:55:26,207	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	We have rights
EDL	00:55:26,719	00:55:27,487	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Does
EDL	00:55:27,487	00:55:30,047	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Some part of the Constitution protect our rights
EDL	00:55:31,583	00:55:35,935	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So again here we have a person who you think would absolutely support
EDL	00:55:35,935	00:55:39,263	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Charlie's fight to get American Samoans US citizenship
EDL	00:55:40,287	00:55:40,799	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But
EDL	00:55:41,823	00:55:42,335	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	No
EDL	00:55:43,359	00:55:45,151	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I hope not it's not a good idea
EDL	00:55:45,663	00:55:48,479	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Yeah I know today is still the wrong thing to address
EDL	00:55:49,247	00:55:50,271	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	She said it's not worth it
EDL	00:55:51,039	00:55:52,063	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Wow
EDL	00:55:53,087	00:55:58,207	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	No way it's not worth it because
EDL	00:55:58,207	00:55:59,743	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	For when she thinks
EDL	00:55:59,743	00:56:02,047	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You know American Samoans are already
EDL	00:56:02,047	00:56:03,839	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Running off to the US
EDL	00:56:03,839	00:56:10,239	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	To bind like what they think is going to be a better life and US citizenship would probably make that drain
EDL	00:56:10,239	00:56:11,263	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Rain on the island even worse
EDL	00:56:11,775	00:56:12,543	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And then
EDL	00:56:12,543	00:56:17,663	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	For life on the island culture I need to protect
EDL	00:56:18,431	00:56:21,503	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And it always my need to be a US citizen
EDL	00:56:22,271	00:56:28,415	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	It's not about me at all it's about my island is about my people it's about my family's about my Village
EDL	00:56:28,927	00:56:33,535	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	It's about this wonderful community so I will never go up and try to
EDL	00:56:33,535	00:56:37,375	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Change anything if they're not with me I've learned that the hard way
EDL	00:56:38,655	00:56:40,703	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I've learned that and I'm humbled by it
EDL	00:56:41,727	00:56:42,495	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Because
EDL	00:56:42,495	00:56:44,799	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Well communal system out your system
EDL	00:56:44,799	00:56:51,199	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	It's a very system that's keeping us alive and together I guess I'm wondering like what what about the communal system do you
EDL	00:56:51,199	00:56:52,991	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You think would would definitely go away
EDL	00:56:59,391	00:57:04,767	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	No like what what is it about the communal system like that is completely incompatible with being a citizen
EDL	00:57:06,303	00:57:12,703	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The Western ways is individualism it's about individuals rights mine my real estate mile
EDL	00:57:12,703	00:57:16,287	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But for us it's about protecting all of us
EDL	00:57:16,287	00:57:17,567	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I'll communal rights
EDL	00:57:17,567	00:57:19,103	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So is complete opposite
EDL	00:57:19,871	00:57:21,407	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Of the American system
EDL	00:57:21,407	00:57:26,527	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	If you bring in a whole bunch of immigrants is going to disrupt that Village it's already doing that
EDL	00:57:27,295	00:57:28,063	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Why
EDL	00:57:28,063	00:57:33,183	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	People who move in and cite their rights I have the right I have my
EDL	00:57:33,695	00:57:34,719	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Freedom to do this
EDL	00:57:35,743	00:57:37,023	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	That's not what it's about
EDL	00:57:37,023	00:57:43,423	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	In the evening we have a bell for everybody to enter their home and do the meditation to these people come in and look at us
EDL	00:57:43,423	00:57:49,823	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Everything foreign us last already with us but but I mean like the people
EDL	00:57:49,823	00:57:51,103	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	People who are coming
EDL	00:57:51,103	00:57:57,247	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I like they're already popping right and they're already having kids here we're becoming Nationals right like maybe that ship has
EDL	00:58:05,183	00:58:06,975	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Yeah but if the land was still preserved
EDL	00:58:09,279	00:58:15,679	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	It's a joke I've seen all the land has been reserved the government turned them over and sell and make profit
EDL	00:58:15,679	00:58:16,703	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Improve it
EDL	00:58:20,799	00:58:25,407	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	All right
EDL	00:58:27,967	00:58:28,479	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Wow
EDL	00:58:29,759	00:58:32,575	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	She spent time with the Black Panthers ran for office
EDL	00:58:33,343	00:58:35,391	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Still feels somehow
EDL	00:58:36,159	00:58:36,927	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The
EDL	00:58:37,695	00:58:39,743	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Existential threat to the Island's culture
EDL	00:58:40,255	00:58:41,535	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Overrules those

EDL	00:58:43,071	00:58:43,583	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I don't know it
EDL	00:58:44,863	00:58:46,911	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I mean it's the calculation in her head
EDL	00:58:47,935	00:58:48,447	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	But
EDL	00:58:48,959	00:58:52,031	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I remember sitting there on the beach NJ
EDL	00:58:52,799	00:58:54,847	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Not being able to wrap my head around it
EDL	00:59:05,599	00:59:08,159	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I spent two Sundays in American Samoa
EDL	00:59:08,671	00:59:09,951	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I went to church services
EDL	00:59:10,463	00:59:15,071	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Not everybody goes to church but the island is about 98% Christian
EDL	00:59:15,071	00:59:16,607	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Many people
EDL	00:59:16,607	00:59:17,375	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Hold me
EDL	00:59:17,375	00:59:19,167	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The center of faasamoa
EDL	00:59:19,935	00:59:21,983	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I'm sitting in those pews
EDL	00:59:22,495	00:59:24,543	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Watching people of all ages
EDL	00:59:25,055	00:59:28,383	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Sing and interact with each other they all know each other
EDL	00:59:28,895	00:59:30,431	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Looking out for each other
EDL	00:59:30,943	00:59:32,223	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Is a feeling of
EDL	00:59:32,991	00:59:33,759	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Belonging
EDL	00:59:35,807	00:59:37,343	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Citizenship
EDL	00:59:37,343	00:59:38,623	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Is about belonging
EDL	00:59:39,391	00:59:43,743	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Belonging to the US tends to come with its own set of
EDL	00:59:44,255	00:59:45,023	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Right
EDL	00:59:45,023	00:59:46,559	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And responsibilities
EDL	00:59:47,583	00:59:48,351	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	End
EDL	00:59:48,351	00:59:49,375	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	It struck me that
EDL	00:59:50,655	00:59:54,239	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The set of ideals which I hold so dear so many of us hold so dear
EDL	00:59:54,751	00:59:56,031	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	That people here
EDL	00:59:57,055	00:59:58,591	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Would see them as a threat
EDL	00:59:59,871	01:00:00,383	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	2
EDL	01:00:01,663	01:00:02,943	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	To their survival
EDL	01:00:10,879	01:00:13,951	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So I went back to Charlie Ally Lima
EDL	01:00:13,951	01:00:15,743	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	So I would actually talk to Dad
EDL	01:00:15,743	01:00:17,791	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Fandango

EDL	01:00:22,399	01:00:27,775	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I told him what Pisa had told me and then I got told me
EDL	01:00:28,287	01:00:31,615	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Basically like Hawaii is a cautionary tale like
EDL	01:00:32,383	01:00:34,943	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Why is it considered retail
EDL	01:00:34,943	01:00:36,223	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	It's interesting because
EDL	01:00:39,551	01:00:41,599	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	What do you mean saying is I don't trust America
EDL	01:00:42,623	01:00:44,159	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	That's that's what that means
EDL	01:00:44,927	01:00:46,207	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	And he told me
EDL	01:00:46,975	01:00:49,535	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	He doesn't think that this community would
EDL	01:00:49,535	01:00:51,327	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Necessarily have to change
EDL	01:00:51,327	01:00:52,607	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Cautionary Tale
EDL	01:00:53,119	01:00:54,143	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	History that happened
EDL	01:00:54,911	01:00:57,215	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Hundred year hundred and ten years ago
EDL	01:00:57,215	01:00:59,263	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Okay that was a hundred and ten years ago America
EDL	01:00:59,263	01:00:59,775	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I would like that
EDL	01:01:00,543	01:01:01,055	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Have they change
EDL	01:01:06,943	01:01:10,271	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Jim Crow around any more of the ideas you know
EDL	01:01:10,271	01:01:10,783	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	You know
EDL	01:01:13,087	01:01:17,439	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	The real question is do you trust the US government
EDL	01:01:19,231	01:01:20,255	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	To do the right thing
EDL	01:01:20,255	01:01:21,023	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Custer Federal
EDL	01:01:21,791	01:01:22,559	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	To do the right thing
EDL	01:01:22,559	01:01:26,399	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I personally believe that
EDL	01:01:27,167	01:01:32,543	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	If you don't trust the government get out of that government
EDL	01:01:33,055	01:01:37,151	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	He was like so we Samoans need to make a decision about Who We Are
EDL	01:01:37,663	01:01:39,711	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	If we want to be part of the us or not
EDL	01:01:40,223	01:01:46,623	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	There shouldn't be this in between
EDL	01:01:46,623	01:01:50,207	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Constitution is a document that
EDL	01:01:50,207	01:01:56,607	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Something that we should all aspire to we may not reach that but we always
EDL	01:01:56,607	01:02:02,239	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	That's why we still believe in it and I still have faith in you can go to the courts and
EDL	01:02:02,751	01:02:05,055	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	Get any problems rectified but
EDL	01:02:05,823	01:02:07,359	| radiolab_membership19americanish |	I lose that face and I'm just
