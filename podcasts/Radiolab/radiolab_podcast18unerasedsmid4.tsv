EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:47,264	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Well, almost 700,000 people
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:52,384	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	In the 1970's and 80's in Swan or also recently

EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:51,264	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	In certain communities America
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:56,640	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	It said that was part of the whole reason to do this project is that there's this thing happening that we're not really looking at and
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:58,176	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	History to it

EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:17,151	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Many people told us before we came
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:19,199	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Don't forget this is a guy
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:21,759	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Who ran a program

EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:28,415	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	In some cases
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:36,351	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And now that he's out himself and married to a man and vehement Lee opposed to the whole idea of conversion therapy
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:40,447	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	It does beg the question what do we do with that passed
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:44,543	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	How should we think about it
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:48,639	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Is he allowed to just move on
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:52,479	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Would you grow up

EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:09,887	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	All the moms walked up and down the street in their Shirtwaist dresses and had coffee with each other I mean it was a stereo
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:10,655	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Typical

EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:17,055	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And I remember
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:23,967	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Feeling at 5 I remember sitting back in our backyard on a summer morning
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:24,991	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	School's Out
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:28,063	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Sitting in the play sandbox
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:29,855	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And feeling the warm sun
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:31,647	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And I remember just feeling
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:32,671	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Life's good
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:37,023	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I was so at peace
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:42,399	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	This is one moment of calm he says
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:44,703	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Or he didn't have to worry about who he was
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:50,847	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Know the story as it goes from here
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:53,407	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Of John becoming
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:54,943	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And then Unbecoming the
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:56,991	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Elvis of the ex-gay movement
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:59,295	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Is complicated to say the least
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:02,367	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	You could start the story in the 4th grade
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:05,695	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I remember in fourth grade
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:07,999	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Having an emotional affair
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:12,095	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	With Steve I wanted to carry his books he had a broken arm
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:14,911	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I wanted to hold his hand cause I was a gay boy
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:20,799	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	But I didn't know how to work that through or what is a little boy in that situation say to myself I didn't have words
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:22,079	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Then there was fifth grade
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:25,407	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	For the first time in school gets a male teacher all my teachers were females
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:27,199	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And all of a sudden this male teacher
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:27,967	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Remember just
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:29,247	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I just
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:30,015	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Fantasizing
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:35,135	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Just looking at him being drawn to him being attracted to his maleness
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:37,183	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Not knowing what to do with that
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:39,999	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Jumping forward a bit dated
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:43,583	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Several girls in high school end up marrying a girl named Chris

EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:58,175	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And then you get to the first in a series of
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:59,711	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Violent shifts
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:00,991	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	In John Smith's life

EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:14,303	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I just want to share a little bit about my personal story so you know who I am and where I'm coming from

EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:59,103	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Well my head strategically placed himself at a bar right across the street from where I live
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:01,151	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And I found out later that
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:07,039	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	He was already surmising what I was looking for what I was curious about where I was headed in his mine
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:10,623	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I want to cross the street that evening ended up in a very
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:12,927	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Mutually seductive homosexual encounter
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:15,743	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I came home from that
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:21,119	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	4 in the morning which is again something I never did I never ever went out and stayed out
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:22,911	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Of course my wife wasn't
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:24,191	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Stupid she knew that
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:26,495	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Why was he out so late what was going on
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:30,591	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	So she began to ask me questions what went on and immediately went to her and I said
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:32,127	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Chris I'ma
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:32,639	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I'm gay
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:36,479	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	You see how quick that identity got stuck
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:38,783	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I had one sexual encounter
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:40,319	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	1
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:42,111	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Outside of
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:46,463	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Marital sex which was the only other experience I've ever had sexually
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:47,743	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	One sexual encounter
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:49,023	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And I'm Signed Sealed Delivered
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:51,839	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I'm gay and I want a divorce
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:54,143	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	What what do you think when you hear that now
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:56,959	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	My first thought was my verbage
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:59,775	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And the way I described that story
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:02,847	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And the way I would describe it if today would be so violently different
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:08,479	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Those terms for inflammatory I mean I I filtered that story
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:10,015	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Through
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,551	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	My
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:13,599	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Theology at that time
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:18,719	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I walked away from that marriage abandon my children in homosexual adultery
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:20,767	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And drove into headlong
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:21,791	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Full force
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:23,071	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	The homosexual subculture
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:26,655	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I live in an apartment building free for the gay businesses
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:31,775	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Anyone who wasn't familiar with or didn't like my homosexuality
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:33,311	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I just crossed him off the list
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:39,455	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	In a later TV interview John would say that during this. He even became the guy
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:43,295	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	That young gay men who are new in town would call
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:44,063	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Assertive
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:50,463	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Get initiate I had taken people to the gay bars for their first time I was instrumental in helping people involve
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:55,839	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Call themselves for years I lived in that lifestyle four years of active Pursuit and all along
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:58,399	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Thinking in my head I'm looking for monogamy
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:01,983	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I'm looking for a life partner
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:06,079	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I'm looking for that one person that can satisfy all my needs and never let me down
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:08,895	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	What makes John's backstory
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:09,663	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	So
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:12,223	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Interesting and also difficult to wrap your head around
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:14,783	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Are these wildly different polls
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:21,183	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	He travels between in one life I mean he starts off living the sort of 50s American Suburban dream wife two kids
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:23,999	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Swings into the gay subculture as he calls it
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:25,535	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And then
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:28,863	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	As he puts it what happened was he started to get his heart broke
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:32,191	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	A lot the first guy that I lived with
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:34,239	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I mean I just
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:37,823	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I just really loved him as a 20-something year old.can
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:43,199	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	He came home one day and he says I can't be with you I'm a size queen and you don't measure up
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:49,087	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Galaxy told him you're not enough of a man down there for me that was a shocking
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:52,159	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Deeply deeply wounding moment
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:54,719	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	He said he struggled with his confidence
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:56,511	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And he got into a series of
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:59,583	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	A very bad dysfunctional relationships
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:02,399	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Began to feel like something was wrong with him
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:04,191	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And it was at that point
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:05,471	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	With this
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:08,287	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	4 year experience in the gay culture
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:10,335	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Where a girl I worked with
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:12,639	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	The time he was working for the railroad as a clerk
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:14,175	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	She was an Evangelical Christian
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:17,503	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Started talking with me about Jesus in the Bible
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:22,623	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And she was very open about her own struggles very vulnerable with me in
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:24,159	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	She invited me to church
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:27,999	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And kept inviting me to church then eventually I went
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:39,519	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	It was a Christian Revival is church services the kind where people speak in tongues talk about the devil a lot
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:45,407	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	So I went and sure enough I was sitting in a few and this guy was speaking and I don't know what the heck was talking about
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:47,967	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Because God was too busy speaking to me personally
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:51,551	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I was sitting back in this. I'll never forget God said
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:52,063	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	John
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:58,975	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	You don't have to live this way any longer
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:03,071	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Who was attempted mean
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:08,191	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	This is always the last John like what
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:12,031	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	How does explain that moment now
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:17,407	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Because I mean that follows really flows from that moment it is honest as I can be about it
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:18,943	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Because I
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:21,247	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I don't really understand it myself either but
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:25,343	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	As much as I can process it it was built on
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:26,879	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	The hope of
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:28,927	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Not the
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:29,439	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Spirits of
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:31,999	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	He told me later that no
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:34,815	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	The conversion of it that God's voice in his head that he can't
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:35,327	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Explain but
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:39,167	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	All the moments after suddenly having this whole new belief system
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:40,959	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Reframed everything
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:43,263	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	First of all he was Reborn
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:47,871	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	To literally everything before that point was no longer important it was only about what comes after
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:50,431	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And also he now had this book
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:53,247	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Which seemed to say that the way he just was with a sin
EDL	00:16:53,759	00:16:54,783	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Wish you would think
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:56,319	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Would want to hear but
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:58,879	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	He said it was actually a relief to hear that
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:02,463	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Cuz he can now take all of those really
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:08,863	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Hard questions about himself and who he was a man and he can now put it into a box called sin
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:10,143	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And say to himself oh
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:12,703	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	That's why I was feeling so bad
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:15,263	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Because I was committing sin
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:16,799	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	It was
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:21,407	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	What I was doing it's not necessarily who I am it was my behavior and that
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:22,431	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Can change
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:24,223	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Believe
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:26,783	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	That all this pain
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:27,551	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Jesus
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:28,575	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Could heal
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:33,695	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And he could bring meaning and sense and comfort and peace
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,463	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Into my life
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:37,535	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And so in another violent shift
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:39,583	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	John Smith becomes
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:43,679	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Really only one of two people I've ever heard of to come out of the closet
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:44,447	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Then go back in
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:50,335	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	That's going to the church regularly I felt free iFit liberated

EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:12,863	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Because I was high I was underneath the clouds of life in the rain
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:16,447	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And my had a trick umbrella that when I would shake it it would fall
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:22,591	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And it put it down in the rainbow would come out the promises of God's future it was my testimony kind of a story
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:25,663	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Of how I came out from under the rain clouds and found the Sun
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:32,319	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I made all the wigs for the clowns and I made the props and it was really a significant
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:33,343	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Two and a half years
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:36,927	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Of my life when I didn't have any outside pressures
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:42,047	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Said it was a little bit like that moment when he was 4 he was totally at peace super happy but then
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:44,863	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Starts getting lonely
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:45,887	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I needed a companion
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:51,007	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Side dated a couple of girls and those things didn't succeed and finally I met Valene
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:53,311	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And we started kind of dating and I fell
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:56,895	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	He said initially things were going well and he felt like I'll maybe I can change
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:57,663	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Maybe I have
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:59,967	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	But then as he describes it
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:01,247	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	That funk return
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:10,719	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	What does old feelings but even more unspoken than that this is the kind of panic would come up and I started feeling
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:11,999	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I'm really really scared
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:18,143	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	While I was in that place
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:21,215	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Today on family talk I heard

EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:15,231	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And to make a long story short he ends up getting connected with
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:19,583	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	The guy who many people sort of believed to be the father
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:21,631	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	The spiritual Godfather of the X game with

EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:27,519	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	We talked about it a bit in episode 1 like John
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:31,103	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Frank Worthen was a guy who had been in the closet

EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:41,087	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	They went back in the closet 1973
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:45,183	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Right in the middle of
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:46,463	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Jesus movement
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:50,559	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Frank starts going to church and after service one day after church
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:52,607	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Three young men came to visit me
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:54,143	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And they were all gay
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:57,471	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And they said that I heard you made a recommitment
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:21:01,823	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Price that you're leaving the gay lifestyle and we would like to leave at 2

EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:17,184	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Well the members named at love and action we did feel that it was
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:22,560	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	God's answer to the APA saying homosexuality is normal
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:24,608	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And God is saying
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:27,168	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Not really
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:33,568	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	What is referring to their is sort of the beginning of the scientific Community washing their hands of the whole idea
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:37,408	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Deification which we talked about in the last episode but we're not Christian they don't know what they're saying

EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:15,520	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Morphs into something quite different
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:16,544	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Something much bigger
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:18,848	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Any darker than just one man's
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:20,128	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Journey towards

EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:24,736	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	The moment he showed up
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:25,760	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Love and action
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:32,160	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Car wind

EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:35,232	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Which is insane
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:36,256	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Start appearing on
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:37,280	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Fairies talk shows
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:42,144	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Homosexuality from my experience that stand out of a need to know I was okay as a man
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:44,704	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And he very quickly realized his story
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:48,800	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Was like Rocket Fuel I had a phenomenal
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:49,824	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Miraculous
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:50,336	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Testimony
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:54,176	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	What's the name of that phone interview I mean I was one of those people
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:56,992	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Who had a dramatic trance
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:26:01,600	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Information from where I was one day I'm sleeping with my gay partner
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:07,232	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And the next day I'm 100% sold out to God committed baseball so people
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:08,512	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Saw my life
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:09,280	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	As
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:13,632	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	The dark vs the light it was almost like Saint Paul on the road to Damascus
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:17,984	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	He said people would come up to me Christian conference isn't and say that they were actually jealous of
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:20,800	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I want to see all the power in his own story
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:24,384	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	We became much more extroverted as a minister
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:25,408	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Perhaps as a result
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:28,224	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Love and action started to gain Converse
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:33,344	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	By the week to the point where they could no longer fit in the small Church in San Rafael and so
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:36,672	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	1994
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:38,720	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	They go off in search of a bigger Church
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:45,120	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	We got to Memphis Memphis Tennessee
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:51,520	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Big church large community they hire staff at this point John is flying high and love an action
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:57,920	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Who was advertising this is daggering success rates was something they heard from Garrard Conley
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:27:04,320	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	7% success rate of conversion from gay to straight I internally
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:07,392	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Underneath It All while I couldn't verbalize it
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:13,024	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I had to admit somewhere in me that we were not seeing success
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:13,792	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	We were not winning
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:16,864	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	They were successful why they were in the program
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:18,656	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	As soon as they leave bone
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:19,424	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Bad Fallen
EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:26,336	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I knew it wasn't working but I couldn't admit that so the only way I could have knowledge that would be to
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:28,384	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	. something new that might work better
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:32,480	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	So when he got to Memphis he decided to go a totally different route
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:35,808	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	He figured if people were quote relapsing
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:39,648	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Which they were let me draw inspiration from other modality
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:43,488	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	They also have to deal with the problem of people relapsing
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:44,256	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And so
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:45,792	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	He ended up visiting a
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:47,328	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Local drug and Rehab Center
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:48,608	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	It's called second chance
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:51,168	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	It's a drug and alcohol rehab for teenagers
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:58,080	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Wonderful success rate so we all talked about it as a staff and we sat down and we said we really think they have something.
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:28:01,152	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Valuable we adopted their philosophy
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:06,272	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	They decided they would Define homosexuality sexuality
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:12,416	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And maybe they can just treat it with something like 12 step the 12-step seemingly were they the best way
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:15,232	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	To rid people of drug and alcohol abuse and had
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:16,000	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	A track record
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:20,864	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And I'm thinking well maybe that'll if if homosexuality is an addiction
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:23,424	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	We need to remove the homosexual
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:24,192	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Drug
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:27,776	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Long enough for these people to detox
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:28,800	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	From it
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:36,992	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	It's so starting in 1994 and going through his whole 14-year stint at the Memphis Clinic John basically
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:42,880	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Implemented this system where young men women would come in anything that they had
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:45,696	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	That could be remotely construed as
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:48,512	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Which we call deaf eyes Falls images
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:50,048	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	There homosexual
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:50,816	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Look
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:55,936	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	There homosexual books there homosexual Concepts friends people associations
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:29:00,288	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Drug and alcohol recovery centers have seen these things as contraband
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:02,592	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And it has to be removed
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:04,384	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	You big can't come here with that
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:07,200	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	They have to be separated from its so they can
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:08,224	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Think without it
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:10,016	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Because it's their coping mechanisms
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:11,552	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	It's their addiction
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:14,112	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	After they were then separated from their
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:17,184	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Homosexual paraphernalia or what have you
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:18,720	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Clients within go through
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:20,768	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	You know endless rounds of
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:22,304	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Pseudo-scientific
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:23,328	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Talk therapy
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:29,728	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And so it became this elaborate 12-step program where we had to write down
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:30,496	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Every week
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:34,848	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Three different sexual experiences that we had
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:35,872	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	In Our Lifetime
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:38,432	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And do a moral inventory about it
EDL	00:29:38,944	00:29:39,456	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Each one
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:45,856	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Mrs Peterson Toscano we heard of it from him in episode 1 he did to stencil of a notch
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:46,624	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Would be
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:47,648	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Well beyond just
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:50,976	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Physically having sex with someone but a fantasy
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:53,792	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	An obsession over someone a romantic
EDL	00:29:54,304	00:29:56,096	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Crush that you had
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:30:02,496	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	An encounter you may have had with an inanimate object this very varied like
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:08,640	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Strange language to talk about the stuff and some of it was like we talking about and they were like you know

EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:19,392	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	You're writing about these
EDL	00:30:19,392	00:30:23,744	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Really intense sexual encounters and it becomes like a butterfly
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:31,168	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Can vinegar Patrice played out in your analyzing at and dissecting it and tearing it apart
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:34,752	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Peterson also told us that there were times when this these kind of techniques
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:36,032	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Tipton to just
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:36,800	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Abject
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:37,312	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Cruelty
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:40,128	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Sometimes they would be asked to confess
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:42,688	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Some of these stories directly to
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:44,736	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Two parents on friends and family night
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:46,016	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	He told us about a mock

EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:57,792	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Pretty traumatic things that I didn't ever really want to
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:30:59,072	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Bring back to the light
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:02,656	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	This is Erin because I'm up he says he is okay talking about it now

EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:47,200	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	They made this up
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:50,784	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And he said you should do that he said the reason we're doing this is because
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:51,808	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	This man
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:53,856	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Has had a pattern of

EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:29,184	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	But we were chastised for it
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:32,000	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And we would internally say
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:36,864	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	We are not doing anything different than the local successful drug rehab
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:39,168	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	John says he knew
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:43,008	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	That some of these techniques were confrontational maybe even traumatic but it's a
EDL	00:32:43,008	00:32:43,520	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Time
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:46,080	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I believe that the time

EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:52,736	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Is worth it

EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:16,864	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	In some levels of this process I have to
EDL	00:35:17,888	00:35:18,912	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Use some denial
EDL	00:35:20,960	00:35:21,984	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I have to
EDL	00:35:21,984	00:35:23,776	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I don't mean denial it didn't happen
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:26,336	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Denial of my feelings
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:29,408	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	There been many times
EDL	00:35:30,432	00:35:32,992	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Through life experience where I have perceived
EDL	00:35:33,504	00:35:34,784	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	If I truly
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:36,832	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Felt everything that there is in there
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:38,624	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I would die
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:48,352	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And I also
EDL	00:35:50,656	00:35:52,192	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I also have to release
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:53,472	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	People
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:56,032	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	To their own process
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:35:57,824	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And I cannot
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:35:59,872	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Take responsibility for their process
EDL	00:36:01,920	00:36:02,432	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I can't
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:07,296	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	All I can do is acknowledge
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:09,600	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And release the rest
EDL	00:36:17,792	00:36:19,328	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Jonathan told me something that
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:21,888	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Kutztown defensive
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:24,448	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Actually I think is a truth that needs to be acknowledged
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:26,752	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	The idea that he
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:31,616	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Was selling it love an action or perhaps that he bought into
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:34,688	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Ultimately goes Way Beyond him
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:39,552	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	The sources of all that shame are as much the families
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:40,320	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Of those kids
EDL	00:36:41,088	00:36:41,856	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Peer groups
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:43,904	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	The schools were they went to this early the churches
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:48,256	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	The society at large that creates the conditions for love and action to exist
EDL	00:36:50,048	00:36:52,096	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	He says he cannot take responsibility for all that
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:54,912	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I think that's right
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:36:59,008	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	This
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:37:00,800	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Is an album that

EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:06,432	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And it has pictures

EDL	00:41:59,551	00:42:05,951	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	From the protest I started entering into an absolute days just just a cloud
EDL	00:42:05,951	00:42:12,351	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I I I don't even know the protest lasted for eight solid weeks International media started
EDL	00:42:12,351	00:42:18,751	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Coming in there's so much attention that the state of Tennessee actually started cracking down performing in space
EDL	00:42:18,751	00:42:25,151	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Directions John Schmitt ends of counter suing the state I was so desperate to make this work and he says now looking back with the maze
EDL	00:42:25,151	00:42:27,711	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	How long it took him to wake up how
EDL	00:42:27,711	00:42:34,111	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	All throughout his mind with contorted self to push away doubt I'd I would drive through the protesters
EDL	00:42:34,111	00:42:40,511	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And I remember them saying we love you we love you to meet he says amazingly he interpreter
EDL	00:42:40,511	00:42:45,119	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Did that in that moment as God speaking to him I know you're here and I knew you were here
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:46,655	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And I didn't want you to hide
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:49,215	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I wanted to celebrate you being here
EDL	00:42:49,215	00:42:50,751	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And I did it through these protesters
EDL	00:42:51,519	00:42:54,847	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	That's the way I interpreted it has some mental gymnastics
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:55,359	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Yes
EDL	00:42:56,383	00:42:56,895	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	It is
EDL	00:42:58,943	00:43:01,759	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	The honest truth is what brought John into the light
EDL	00:43:02,271	00:43:04,319	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	What needed to happen before he
EDL	00:43:04,319	00:43:05,599	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	BLC light
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:07,135	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Is it his organization collapse
EDL	00:43:08,159	00:43:11,487	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Protesters created division in a staff one of his managers tried to
EDL	00:43:11,487	00:43:13,535	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Force Mount you didn't know what to do eventually
EDL	00:43:14,047	00:43:14,815	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	He resigns
EDL	00:43:14,815	00:43:16,095	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And so when I resigned
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:18,399	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I sat in my
EDL	00:43:18,399	00:43:19,935	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Newly designed home office
EDL	00:43:20,959	00:43:21,983	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And I said God
EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:25,567	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I have no idea what you have in store for me for the
EDL	00:43:26,847	00:43:27,359	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Surprise me
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:29,919	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	From that point forward
EDL	00:43:29,919	00:43:31,455	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	He says it was like
EDL	00:43:31,455	00:43:34,783	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Slowly sobering up after you've been drunk for 25 years
EDL	00:43:35,551	00:43:37,599	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	This time it wasn't a violent shift
EDL	00:43:37,599	00:43:38,367	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Is the series of
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:39,391	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Tiny micros
EDL	00:43:39,903	00:43:42,207	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Like one day he's sitting in his computer and decides
EDL	00:43:43,231	00:43:44,255	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Click on gay p***

EDL	00:43:52,447	00:43:53,471	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	But anything's
EDL	00:43:53,471	00:43:54,239	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	No
EDL	00:43:54,239	00:43:55,007	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Not going to tell her
EDL	00:43:55,775	00:43:57,055	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	A short while after that
EDL	00:43:57,823	00:43:59,103	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Is it a Christian Conference
EDL	00:43:59,103	00:44:00,127	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Any announces

EDL	00:44:04,479	00:44:06,015	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Was in fact not cured
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:07,807	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Vocally said I'm a gay man
EDL	00:44:08,575	00:44:09,343	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I'm a gay man
EDL	00:44:09,855	00:44:10,623	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And
EDL	00:44:10,623	00:44:11,903	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I'm in a mixed-orientation marriage
EDL	00:44:12,671	00:44:16,767	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Mixed-orientation by the way means a marriage between a homosexual and heterosexual
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:19,071	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I told term you sometimes here in this world
EDL	00:44:19,071	00:44:22,655	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	But that process that slow gradual Awakening
EDL	00:44:22,655	00:44:26,751	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	John says it is still happening yes the whole creative
EDL	00:44:26,751	00:44:33,151	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	In the car he told us even about the shoes he was wearing it so that brought it up I have bright blue tennis shoes on today
EDL	00:44:33,151	00:44:36,223	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I bought those a month ago
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:42,623	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I love bright colors I've always loved bright colors I stood in the store for 20 minutes
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:45,951	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Looking at gray or turquoise blue shoes are identical
EDL	00:44:46,463	00:44:52,863	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And I made the decision the conscious decision and I feel very emotional about this crazy
EDL	00:44:52,863	00:44:59,263	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Table tennis shoes but I had to make the decision to buy the blue tennis shoes because I love turquoise
EDL	00:44:59,263	00:45:05,663	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Blue and it's that it's it's still, I'm still coming out I'm still having to open my
EDL	00:45:05,663	00:45:06,175	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Self up
EDL	00:45:06,687	00:45:09,247	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	To the reality
EDL	00:45:09,247	00:45:13,855	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Of who I am and who I was wired to be from the moment I was born
EDL	00:45:13,855	00:45:20,255	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	It just there's his constant battle within me to deny to push away to surgically cut
EDL	00:45:20,255	00:45:26,655	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	A major component of who I am and so even though I was a I was an ex-gay leader
EDL	00:45:26,655	00:45:31,519	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And one of the one of the instruments of abuse
EDL	00:45:31,519	00:45:37,407	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I'm also a person it was subjected to ex-gay Ministry for 25 years
EDL	00:45:37,407	00:45:43,807	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And so I have the same kinds of anger in the same kinds of wounds the same kind of pain
EDL	00:45:43,807	00:45:45,855	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And that complicated this about John Smith
EDL	00:45:45,855	00:45:47,903	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	He is both the instrument of abuse
EDL	00:45:47,903	00:45:48,927	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And also
EDL	00:45:48,927	00:45:54,047	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	A subject himself of that same abuse it might color how you see the Final Chapter
EDL	00:45:54,559	00:45:55,839	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	In his journey

EDL	00:46:31,423	00:46:32,447	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	My life alone
EDL	00:46:32,959	00:46:33,727	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And
EDL	00:46:35,007	00:46:37,823	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	In fact I had come to the point where I was crying myself
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:40,383	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Because I was so lonely
EDL	00:46:41,151	00:46:45,759	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And that's what I actually led me to say look Larry you know

EDL	00:47:21,599	00:47:23,135	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	What I'm feeling with you

EDL	00:47:27,487	00:47:29,535	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Any sitting by the way we're sleeping in separate beds
EDL	00:47:30,303	00:47:32,607	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Next morning Larry walks into John's room
EDL	00:47:32,607	00:47:34,399	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Lays down beside me on the bed
EDL	00:47:34,399	00:47:40,799	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Puts his arm around and he just put his arms around me and I was reading an email he had his arms around me and I
EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:42,591	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Just started to sob uncontrollably
EDL	00:47:43,103	00:47:46,943	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	You know I had never in my life ever cried with another human being
EDL	00:47:46,943	00:47:48,223	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	It for me
EDL	00:47:48,223	00:47:51,807	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	It was like almost a physical sensation inside me
EDL	00:47:52,575	00:47:53,087	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	That
EDL	00:47:53,599	00:47:55,135	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	As if there were cogs
EDL	00:47:56,159	00:47:58,463	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	That never were quite aligned proper
EDL	00:47:59,487	00:48:01,535	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	But that weekend I felt
EDL	00:48:02,559	00:48:03,583	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Within my body
EDL	00:48:04,095	00:48:06,655	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	These cogs coming into place and click
EDL	00:48:07,423	00:48:08,703	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And I felt whole for the first
EDL	00:48:09,471	00:48:11,007	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I was Larry's first kiss
EDL	00:48:12,031	00:48:12,799	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Wow
EDL	00:48:13,823	00:48:14,847	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	52 years old
EDL	00:48:22,015	00:48:28,415	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	A few months after that weekend John got a divorce from his second wife Bolin
EDL	00:48:28,415	00:48:34,303	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	John Larry got married in 2014 and these days they sing in their church choir
EDL	00:48:34,303	00:48:36,863	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Is the only openly gay couple in their Church
EDL	00:48:36,863	00:48:38,655	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And they continue to nudge to church
EDL	00:48:38,655	00:48:39,679	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Urgently
EDL	00:48:39,679	00:48:40,959	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	To take a stand
EDL	00:48:40,959	00:48:41,727	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Support of gay marriage
EDL	00:48:42,239	00:48:46,591	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	The end of the day it's still difficult to know how to reconcile John Smith's past with his present
EDL	00:48:46,591	00:48:50,175	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Whether he's taken enough responsibility for his actions or not
EDL	00:48:50,175	00:48:52,479	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	We spoke to people who are all over the map on that question
EDL	00:48:53,503	00:48:54,527	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	John would say
EDL	00:48:54,527	00:48:55,295	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	How do you feel
EDL	00:48:56,319	00:48:57,855	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	The lesson from his life is that
EDL	00:48:58,879	00:49:01,439	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Recently people can change humans are teachable
EDL	00:49:01,951	00:49:03,999	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Human mind is infinite
EDL	00:49:17,311	00:49:20,895	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Robert I wanted to offer once I know to the story
EDL	00:49:21,663	00:49:22,943	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	In the time
EDL	00:49:22,943	00:49:26,783	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	That we were working on this series like something like four states
EDL	00:49:27,551	00:49:33,183	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	I mean that number wrong outlawed conversion therapy for minors and if you looked us or more broadly in the last
EDL	00:49:33,695	00:49:34,463	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Few years
EDL	00:49:35,231	00:49:41,119	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	There's been this wave of legislation is trying to stamp this out yeah on what theory
EDL	00:49:41,119	00:49:45,215	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	That's cool I mean that special your talk about offering to minors
EDL	00:49:45,215	00:49:45,983	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	So I think
EDL	00:49:46,751	00:49:53,151	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Something like 37 municipalities in the last few years have have outlawed conversion therapy for minors
EDL	00:49:53,151	00:49:59,551	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And at the same time you have a lot of debate about the sort of expanding idea of religious freedom
EDL	00:49:59,551	00:50:02,111	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Back protection that's written into the First Amendment
EDL	00:50:02,111	00:50:05,951	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	And a lot of these groups are arguing successfully * that
EDL	00:50:05,951	00:50:07,231	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	They have the Conn
EDL	00:50:07,231	00:50:08,255	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	Institutional right
EDL	00:50:08,255	00:50:09,279	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	To offer these broke
EDL	00:50:10,047	00:50:16,191	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	It's a really interesting and confusing moment right now
EDL	00:50:25,663	00:50:28,223	| radiolab_podcast18unerasedsmid4 |	This episode of Radiolab was drawn from unerased
