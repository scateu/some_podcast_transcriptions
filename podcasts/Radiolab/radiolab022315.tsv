EDL	00:01:10,656	00:01:12,192	| radiolab022315 |	The awesome thing about wrestling is
EDL	00:01:12,704	00:01:16,288	| radiolab022315 |	Is that there are these random things that are a little bit real
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:18,592	| radiolab022315 |	And sometimes those moments realistic and
EDL	00:01:24,736	00:01:31,136	| radiolab022315 |	They can change everything now if you're like me and you grew up in the 80s
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:34,464	| radiolab022315 |	Might remember wrestling is like you know Hulk Hogan versus Andre the Giant
EDL	00:01:34,464	00:01:34,976	| radiolab022315 |	Epic
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:38,816	| radiolab022315 |	Matchups are kind of great but also sort of ridiculous
EDL	00:01:38,816	00:01:39,328	| radiolab022315 |	Cartoonish
EDL	00:01:39,840	00:01:41,632	| radiolab022315 |	According to Peter Rosenberg
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:45,216	| radiolab022315 |	There was a moment where wrestling started to sort of Tinker
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:47,264	| radiolab022315 |	With reality in a much more nuanced
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:48,544	| radiolab022315 |	And
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:51,872	| radiolab022315 |	Fascinating what you could argue
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:55,712	| radiolab022315 |	That pro wrestling became a real estate Association of the Baroque movement of the 16th
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:57,504	| radiolab022315 |	CenturyLink postmodern
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:01:58,784	| radiolab022315 |	I know people that would

EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:06,208	| radiolab022315 |	According to Peter this
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:06,720	| radiolab022315 |	Whole thing's
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:08,256	| radiolab022315 |	This whole thing
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:13,376	| radiolab022315 |	Goes back to this moment called the Montreal screwjob the Montreal screwjob was
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:18,240	| radiolab022315 |	Above anything else that ever happened there that will ever probably ever happen again because it was
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:21,312	| radiolab022315 |	Order reality transpiring right there in the
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:25,920	| radiolab022315 |	I mean it was real life just came in for whole
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:29,248	| radiolab022315 |	In the fiction
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:39,232	| radiolab022315 |	That guy just heard is David Shoemaker I write about professional wrestling for Grantland and the guy you're about to hear is journalist
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:40,000	| radiolab022315 |	Simon Adler
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:40,768	| radiolab022315 |	He will take the story for
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:46,656	| radiolab022315 |	Okay so the moment in question really centers around this one guy name
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:51,264	| radiolab022315 |	Brett Bret The Hitman
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:58,432	| radiolab022315 |	Bret Hart is seen by many to be the greatest in-ring performer of all time
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:03:04,832	| radiolab022315 |	She was one of the good guys the best there is the best there was
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:07,648	| radiolab022315 |	In the business they call him a Babyface
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:08,928	| radiolab022315 |	Is that what you call the good guys
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:10,208	| radiolab022315 |	A good guy in wrestling as a baby
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:16,864	| radiolab022315 |	He was my favorite wrestlers a kid I didn't understand why at the time but now I do
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:19,424	| radiolab022315 |	It's because he did everything so well
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:21,216	| radiolab022315 |	And in that era
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:23,520	| radiolab022315 |	The mid-to-late eighties when I fell in love with him
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:27,616	| radiolab022315 |	So many guys would miss big and Hawking in a little bit clumsy
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:30,944	| radiolab022315 |	But Brett did the kind of work that you could show to someone who's
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:32,736	| radiolab022315 |	Who's never watch wrestling
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:34,272	| radiolab022315 |	I think they could see the art
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:36,064	| radiolab022315 |	And I think they could see how it's
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:37,088	| radiolab022315 |	It's like ballet
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:41,440	| radiolab022315 |	Or a million other art forms
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:44,000	| radiolab022315 |	What do you mean Zin
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:51,424	| radiolab022315 |	You can kind of see this when you watch old Bret Hart matches on YouTube
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:53,216	| radiolab022315 |	Gliding through the air
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:57,312	| radiolab022315 |	Bouncing off the mat off the ropes keep tell stories brilliantly
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,592	| radiolab022315 |	Within the way he
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:04,224	| radiolab022315 |	Executes a match the wrestling is scripted but there's a lot of improv going on there the set beads
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:06,272	| radiolab022315 |	She knew how to take those moments in
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:07,552	| radiolab022315 |	In that Improv
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:08,576	| radiolab022315 |	Make you
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:14,976	| radiolab022315 |	Think so shoot he's about to lose and then
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:18,047	| radiolab022315 |	He was a natural-born wrestler
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:23,423	| radiolab022315 |	You know that his father was up with the legendary wrestler of his brother Owen
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:24,447	| radiolab022315 |	Legendary wrestler

EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:58,239	| radiolab022315 |	He would pull on these old Bowie tights
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:04:59,007	| radiolab022315 |	And that he would
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:00,031	| radiolab022315 |	Wrestle with these guys
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:02,591	| radiolab022315 |	He would literally

EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:19,487	| radiolab022315 |	It screams of terrifying I'll be upstairs in the room above it and as I got older I would go down and actually Venture into the room and sit on the bench
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:20,767	| radiolab022315 |	And watch
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:24,095	| radiolab022315 |	He would sometimes these wrestlers would run out

EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:43,551	| radiolab022315 |	The bear that lived in their backyard during Summers
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:45,343	| radiolab022315 |	Because at the time
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:50,207	| radiolab022315 |	Wrestling a bear was a thing that would actually happen from time to time no really
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:50,975	| radiolab022315 |	And
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:52,511	| radiolab022315 |	Brett tells a story in his
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:53,023	| radiolab022315 |	Is book
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:57,887	| radiolab022315 |	About you're just sitting there and letting the Bear lick his toes
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:06:01,215	| radiolab022315 |	Something like this is this is a life that they that he lived and he was
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:03,519	| radiolab022315 |	He was so in so ingrained in him
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:09,151	| radiolab022315 |	In the early 80s Brett was working for his dad's company
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:14,015	| radiolab022315 |	And well that's going on in Canada there's this guy Vince McMahon
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:17,343	| radiolab022315 |	Back in the US who is building kind of Des wrestling Empire
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:20,415	| radiolab022315 |	It basically he's buying up all of these small promoters
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:21,695	| radiolab022315 |	Acrostic
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:23,743	| radiolab022315 |	Country and eventually goes up into Canada
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:28,351	| radiolab022315 |	Advise out Brett's dad's company I bought it 1984
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:30,655	| radiolab022315 |	They paid him a certain amount of money to stop running
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:32,447	| radiolab022315 |	Can I go out of business
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:34,751	| radiolab022315 |	And then they took on
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:36,031	| radiolab022315 |	Is better wrestlers
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:37,311	| radiolab022315 |	At the time which

EDL	00:06:57,279	00:07:00,095	| radiolab022315 |	Steroid abuse in the World Wrestling Federation so there's a
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:01,887	| radiolab022315 |	Steroid crisis Vince
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:06,495	| radiolab022315 |	Have to deal with all of this litigation and he kind of needs to Rebrand

EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:16,223	| radiolab022315 |	For a couple of weeks
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:18,783	| radiolab022315 |	According to David Shoemake one
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:20,319	| radiolab022315 |	Is that he's a traditionalist
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:22,367	| radiolab022315 |	Sort of a throwback to an earlier time
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:22,879	| radiolab022315 |	2
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:25,951	| radiolab022315 |	You got that big so when you see him you don't think
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:27,999	| radiolab022315 |	Sterilite. Definitely have road rage
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:30,047	| radiolab022315 |	And so he saw that and Bret Hart
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:31,071	| radiolab022315 |	During the 90s
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:37,983	| radiolab022315 |	Vince makes Brett a really big star
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:41,567	| radiolab022315 |	The new face of the company I mean he was on The Simpsons
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:47,711	| radiolab022315 |	He was a really really big stock you know they're people who criticize Brett for saying he wasn't that fun or took himself too seriously
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:54,111	| radiolab022315 |	But he was a serious worker he took wrestling very seriously myself really fighting hard to
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:59,231	| radiolab022315 |	Actually surviving come out of it can actually come out of the wrestling profession someday soon
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:03,327	| radiolab022315 |	A wrestling tragedy
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:06,399	| radiolab022315 |	Which is what so many of them turn out
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:11,519	| radiolab022315 |	Okay so fast forward to night
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:12,543	| radiolab022315 |	95-99
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:18,175	| radiolab022315 |	6 at the time a major rivalry was starting between the WWF Vince McMahon
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:19,455	| radiolab022315 |	And the WC.
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:22,015	| radiolab022315 |	Which was Ted Turner's
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:28,415	| radiolab022315 |	What company head-turner multi-millionaire and one of his big tactics is I'm just going to start buying all of
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:29,183	| radiolab022315 |	All the wrestlers
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:30,463	| radiolab022315 |	From the WWF
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:32,767	| radiolab022315 |	From Vince McMahon's organization so he's offering them
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:33,791	| radiolab022315 |	More money use offer
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:35,583	| radiolab022315 |	Bring them longer contracts music
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:40,703	| radiolab022315 |	It's like flooding it with money to steal all the stars from WWF and then in late 1996
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:41,983	| radiolab022315 |	Brett got an offer
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:44,031	| radiolab022315 |	Turn it really went in for the kill
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:46,591	| radiolab022315 |	From WCW that was huge
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:48,127	| radiolab022315 |	2.8 million dollars
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:52,735	| radiolab022315 |	We have to show some common sense me on first or UPS in this right for your family
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:54,527	| radiolab022315 |	But I mean how much money do you need sometime
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:09:00,159	| radiolab022315 |	I found myself torn between trying to do the right thing for my family and at the same time
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:01,183	| radiolab022315 |	Show my loyalty
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:05,279	| radiolab022315 |	That the clip of Brett talking in a documentary that was being filmed at the time
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:10,399	| radiolab022315 |	Call wrestling with shadows which is fantastic filmmaker Paul J was nice enough to let us play some
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:11,679	| radiolab022315 |	Connecticut
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:13,215	| radiolab022315 |	Brett gets this offer
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:14,239	| radiolab022315 |	He's got kind of this
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:15,007	| radiolab022315 |	Terrible decisions
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:16,287	| radiolab022315 |	Because
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:22,687	| radiolab022315 |	Vince gave him a lot you know you really gave him his life and initially Beretta side there's no way
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:23,455	| radiolab022315 |	I'm going to leave
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:24,991	| radiolab022315 |	Not like my relationship with
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:28,063	| radiolab022315 |	With Vince McMahon was always sort of like a father
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:30,367	| radiolab022315 |	And I sort of Saw myself if I left
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:33,183	| radiolab022315 |	It would have been a little bit like leaving my dad
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:34,975	| radiolab022315 |	Especially when the chips are down
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:37,279	| radiolab022315 |	He really did see
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:38,559	| radiolab022315 |	Vince as a father
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:40,607	| radiolab022315 |	Sabrett goes to Vincent
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:47,007	| radiolab022315 |	Basically says convince me to stay it went back and forth conversation about him signing a long-term deal at 1
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:48,287	| radiolab022315 |	Your deal with WWF
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:50,335	| radiolab022315 |	Not for as much money but for guarantee
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:50,847	| radiolab022315 |	Security
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:52,127	| radiolab022315 |	Vince
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:52,895	| radiolab022315 |	Said
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:55,199	| radiolab022315 |	I can't afford to pay you that
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:56,735	| radiolab022315 |	Stock events
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:10:01,855	| radiolab022315 |	In the documentary Brett and his wife there sitting at the kitchen table
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:02,623	| radiolab022315 |	Received
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:07,231	| radiolab022315 |	Because nobody wants Bret Hart more than
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:10,559	| radiolab022315 |	NYC letting you go
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:12,095	| radiolab022315 |	Compete with turn
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:14,655	| radiolab022315 |	Turner's hell-bent on trying to put them out of business
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:16,959	| radiolab022315 |	I got to think about everything
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:20,287	| radiolab022315 |	I got to think about everything
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:23,871	| radiolab022315 |	Color
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:27,711	| radiolab022315 |	Shut this off now for a little while
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:30,783	| radiolab022315 |	Ultimately
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:34,623	| radiolab022315 |	It became clear that Brett would have to go
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:35,135	| radiolab022315 |	Take the money
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,927	| radiolab022315 |	I can't help it feel really
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:41,279	| radiolab022315 |	And disappointed that dumb
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,607	| radiolab022315 |	Did I left this company
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:51,007	| radiolab022315 |	So this really gets to the heart of
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:52,287	| radiolab022315 |	Once
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:53,311	| radiolab022315 |	Brett decides he's going to
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:56,383	| radiolab022315 |	They have to figure out how
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:57,663	| radiolab022315 |	How
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:58,943	| radiolab022315 |	Are they going to make
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:02,015	| radiolab022315 |	This is really the pivotal question
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:03,551	| radiolab022315 |	Behind all of this
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:07,647	| radiolab022315 |	Get yo it's a very very delicate situation
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:13,535	| radiolab022315 |	That's Vince Russo and this was sort of his problem to solve because he work for Vincent
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:16,863	| radiolab022315 |	And you could say I was his right-hand man because I was writing the show
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:19,935	| radiolab022315 |	She was part of the team that scripted who would win who would lose
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:24,287	| radiolab022315 |	How would happen you know I mean I was literally putting the show on paper
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:25,311	| radiolab022315 |	Oh yeah once a week
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:30,175	| radiolab022315 |	Weight-wise it's a hard question I mean can you just pick up and leave because he's the champion
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:31,455	| radiolab022315 |	He has the belt
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:35,039	| radiolab022315 |	The physical belt the giant golden black belt buckle thing
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:37,343	| radiolab022315 |	And that belt is the symbol of the company
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:43,231	| radiolab022315 |	And everybody in it that everybody working behind the scenes everybody was trying to support their family
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:46,559	| radiolab022315 |	That belt was a representation of
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:52,191	| radiolab022315 |	All that the worst thing that can happen is your Champion walking away with the belt to the new company
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:54,495	| radiolab022315 |	Holding up the championship from The Old Company
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:56,031	| radiolab022315 |	Where they can just defile it
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:56,799	| radiolab022315 |	If they wanted to
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:58,591	| radiolab022315 |	That was not an option for Vince McMahon
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:02,943	| radiolab022315 |	This is an imperfect comparison but the closest thing I come up to in my mind
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:05,503	| radiolab022315 |	Is it would be like LeBron James
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:07,295	| radiolab022315 |	Quitting
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,575	| radiolab022315 |	His contract with Nike
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:10,879	| radiolab022315 |	And then showing up
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:12,415	| radiolab022315 |	In Adidas commercial
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:13,695	| radiolab022315 |	And taking a piss
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:14,463	| radiolab022315 |	Into a pair of Nike
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:20,095	| radiolab022315 |	So you know Vince at the end of the day he just had to get that belt off of bread
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:22,143	| radiolab022315 |	So their initial thought their first plan
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:24,447	| radiolab022315 |	Was probably the simplest.
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:28,799	| radiolab022315 |	There was a match coming up this big event a Pay-Per-View event
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:29,823	| radiolab022315 |	In Montreal
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:31,615	| radiolab022315 |	Bread being the champion of the company
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:33,151	| radiolab022315 |	He just lose to the number two guy
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:34,687	| radiolab022315 |	Shawn Michaels
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:35,199	| radiolab022315 |	Vince
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:36,735	| radiolab022315 |	Love Sean
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:39,807	| radiolab022315 |	I mean really thought Sean was a Megastar what you was right about
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:41,343	| radiolab022315 |	Clearly Sean was next in line
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:43,647	| radiolab022315 |	So they pitched this idea of breath
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:45,695	| radiolab022315 |	And Brett was like I can do that
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:48,255	| radiolab022315 |	For 1
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:49,791	| radiolab022315 |	Keeping Sean's an idiot
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:52,351	| radiolab022315 |	Shut this Primadonna personality
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:54,143	| radiolab022315 |	He's better than everyone else
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:56,447	| radiolab022315 |	There's something very arrogant and obnoxious the bottom
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:58,751	| radiolab022315 |	Because he was he was a showman he would hump
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:12:59,263	| radiolab022315 |	The ring
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:04,127	| radiolab022315 |	Just like do ridiculous things in like to Bret Shawn with the Triumph of
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:04,895	| radiolab022315 |	Style over substance
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:06,175	| radiolab022315 |	Also
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:07,199	| radiolab022315 |	You're asking bread
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:09,759	| radiolab022315 |	The wrap up his career in the WWE
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:12,063	| radiolab022315 |	With a loss in Montreal
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:12,831	| radiolab022315 |	In Canada
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:14,367	| radiolab022315 |	Where he is a national hero
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:16,159	| radiolab022315 |	Describe the events I just assumed
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:17,183	| radiolab022315 |	Blow my brains out
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:18,719	| radiolab022315 |	The same
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:19,487	| radiolab022315 |	What you're asking
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:20,767	| radiolab022315 |	To do from
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:22,303	| radiolab022315 |	Character standpoint that's what I would
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:24,351	| radiolab022315 |	Bret the Hitman Hart with bullets
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:25,375	| radiolab022315 |	Makeup
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:28,447	| radiolab022315 |	The whole thing's
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:39,199	| radiolab022315 |	Day of the match
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:42,783	| radiolab022315 |	Still nothing has been decided as to how the match is going to end
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:44,831	| radiolab022315 |	Brett is backstage in
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:46,623	| radiolab022315 |	Eventually he goes to Vince
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:48,671	| radiolab022315 |	Have a conversation
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:51,487	| radiolab022315 |	The documentary crew filming all of this
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:55,839	| radiolab022315 |	And at this point then says no I don't want any cameras in here get those out of here
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:58,911	| radiolab022315 |	Red actually end up wearing a wire
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:01,471	| radiolab022315 |	To document the conversation that's about to happen
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:07,871	| radiolab022315 |	I never ever want to leave here with any kind of bad feeling good this week has been a bad week for me I feel kind of betrayed a little bit
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:14,271	| radiolab022315 |	Well I do to a little bit and again while we're talking about really is Ted Turner between you and me
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:20,671	| radiolab022315 |	Appreciative I will always pay for everything you've done I didn't want to leave
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:27,071	| radiolab022315 |	It all has no other choice but to go the way this whole thing is been depicted it's really hard for me that you're
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:30,143	| radiolab022315 |	Come up short this weekend
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:36,543	| radiolab022315 |	What would you want to do today then I'm up and I think what I'd like to do is get through today I think tomorrow I should just
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:37,567	| radiolab022315 |	When do mice
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:39,871	| radiolab022315 |	Sabrett suggest that the send
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:41,151	| radiolab022315 |	Lynda
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:44,223	| radiolab022315 |	Usually what that means something called Ashmont
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:51,391	| radiolab022315 |	Typically in a small the ring is just flooded with a bunch of wrestlers and Chaos ensues
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:54,975	| radiolab022315 |	The referee usually is thrown out of the ring and ends in some sort of draw
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:59,071	| radiolab022315 |	Brett would that appear on Monday Night Raw the next day
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:14:59,839	| radiolab022315 |	Introverted
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:02,143	| radiolab022315 |	That is what he planned on doing
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:04,959	| radiolab022315 |	So that way you could turn over the belt but not lose exactly
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:06,495	| radiolab022315 |	Eventually events
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:08,799	| radiolab022315 |	Okay fine
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:17,247	| radiolab022315 |	Coming up

EDL	00:15:58,463	00:15:59,487	| radiolab022315 |	Brilliance
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:01,535	| radiolab022315 |	Basically I want to hear about this
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:04,095	| radiolab022315 |	Times when a kid you know did something
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:06,655	| radiolab022315 |	It just means you lean back and say
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:07,423	| radiolab022315 |	Wow
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:08,191	| radiolab022315 |	How did they do that
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:10,239	| radiolab022315 |	Maybe it was the moment that I
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:13,311	| radiolab022315 |	Kids started reading back
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:14,079	| radiolab022315 |	To you
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:16,383	| radiolab022315 |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:20,479	| radiolab022315 |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:25,343	| radiolab022315 |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:31,743	| radiolab022315 |	We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:33,279	| radiolab022315 |	But it doesn't have anything to do with the test

EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:24,127	| radiolab022315 |	And before the match
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:30,527	| radiolab022315 |	Even officially begin
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:36,927	| radiolab022315 |	Sean flies at bread and just started wailing
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:43,071	| radiolab022315 |	Sean and Brett they're going at each other with a sort of like real for real
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:45,119	| radiolab022315 |	Pretty quick there outside the
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:51,519	| radiolab022315 |	Ring picks up
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:53,311	| radiolab022315 |	Sean checks him over the sea
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:54,335	| radiolab022315 |	Security railings
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:19:00,735	| radiolab022315 |	Then there's this
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:07,135	| radiolab022315 |	Read Pick Sean up to that Sean's legs are straight up in the air and then Brett
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:13,535	| radiolab022315 |	Just slam them on his back
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:15,071	| radiolab022315 |	In all of this is scripted
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:17,631	| radiolab022315 |	Everything I know about it is like
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:21,983	| radiolab022315 |	They're following the The Narrative art but like they know okay we're going to fight
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:24,031	| radiolab022315 |	Outside the ring for a while and then
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:25,567	| radiolab022315 |	XYZ will happen
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:27,103	| radiolab022315 |	And So eventually
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:33,503	| radiolab022315 |	Retro Sean back into the ring and then you get
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:35,807	| radiolab022315 |	Make appointment the mattress feels very early in the match
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:36,575	| radiolab022315 |	Where Brett
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:38,111	| radiolab022315 |	Climbs onto the turnbuckle
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:39,903	| radiolab022315 |	Which is the corner post of the Ring
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:43,743	| radiolab022315 |	Get up on top of that catapults himself off the turnbuckle
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:45,535	| radiolab022315 |	Through the air
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:46,815	| radiolab022315 |	Chords
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:47,327	| radiolab022315 |	Shawn Michaels
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:50,143	| radiolab022315 |	Super dramatic is kind of floating in the air there for a moment
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:58,847	| radiolab022315 |	And then what Sean does ripe
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:20:01,663	| radiolab022315 |	Before bread is about to come and hit him he pulls the referee
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:03,711	| radiolab022315 |	In between bread
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:04,479	| radiolab022315 |	And Sean
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,503	| radiolab022315 |	A human shield
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:09,855	| radiolab022315 |	Hit the referee the referee hit Sean and all three men
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:10,879	| radiolab022315 |	Are lying
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:11,391	| radiolab022315 |	On the map
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:14,463	| radiolab022315 |	Is that a disqualification
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:21,119	| radiolab022315 |	Here we are right this could this could be the moment
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:23,423	| radiolab022315 |	But no
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:25,983	| radiolab022315 |	Before the referee can get up
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:26,751	| radiolab022315 |	Sean
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:28,799	| radiolab022315 |	Whatever the brat
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:30,847	| radiolab022315 |	And then
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:35,199	| radiolab022315 |	Shawn puts rat in the Sharpshooter
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:41,599	| radiolab022315 |	Which is Brett's signature finishing move
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:47,999	| radiolab022315 |	Basically xian pretzels up Brett's legs and sit and within seconds
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:48,767	| radiolab022315 |	The bell rings
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:54,399	| radiolab022315 |	Sean slides out of the rain grab the belt
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:56,447	| radiolab022315 |	Runs to the back takes off
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:59,007	| radiolab022315 |	Things work a certain way in wrestling match
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:20:59,775	| radiolab022315 |	Is right like
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:02,591	| radiolab022315 |	No one gets the first pick in the second match starts
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:08,991	| radiolab022315 |	And no one put someone in submission hold and they instantly submit a special agent did not appear like the time the mattress opposed
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:10,783	| radiolab022315 |	The crowd is kind of
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:11,295	| radiolab022315 |	Shocked
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:14,623	| radiolab022315 |	It's strangely quiet
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:16,928	| radiolab022315 |	And
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:22,048	| radiolab022315 |	There's just one moment where the camera Zooms in on Brett face while he's lying
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:23,328	| radiolab022315 |	Shut down
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:24,352	| radiolab022315 |	On the map looking up
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:27,680	| radiolab022315 |	And there is just as bizarre
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:28,960	| radiolab022315 |	Amazing looking
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:30,752	| radiolab022315 |	Confusion
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:33,312	| radiolab022315 |	Is an emotion that almost never exist in pro wrestling
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:40,480	| radiolab022315 |	There's a cartoon confusion of like everything's crazy in your arms are going like wild your eyeballs pop out of your head
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:44,320	| radiolab022315 |	The real confusion is one of the most compelling emotions of all
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:47,904	| radiolab022315 |	That's what you see on his face in its most
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:48,672	| radiolab022315 |	Pure form
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:57,376	| radiolab022315 |	Genuine confusion
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:22:03,520	| radiolab022315 |	And then a Brett gets up puts his arms on the Rope looks down sees Vince McMahon
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:04,800	| radiolab022315 |	And
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:06,080	| radiolab022315 |	Spits right in Vince's face
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:09,920	| radiolab022315 |	Event proceeds to get out of the ring
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:12,736	| radiolab022315 |	And basically destroy everything in
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:15,296	| radiolab022315 |	Because over the announcers table starts ripping it
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:18,368	| radiolab022315 |	He destroys the monitors

EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:24,768	| radiolab022315 |	And maybe the moment
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:25,792	| radiolab022315 |	That truly
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:27,328	| radiolab022315 |	Made you go what is happy
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:29,632	| radiolab022315 |	Brett gets back into the ring

EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:33,472	| radiolab022315 |	And draws with his finger

EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:18,272	| radiolab022315 |	Vince has a black eye
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:22,112	| radiolab022315 |	And the fourth wall has just been torn down and they need to figure out
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:25,184	| radiolab022315 |	How or if they're going to build it back up
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:26,208	| radiolab022315 |	And dumb
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:27,744	| radiolab022315 |	The next day
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:29,792	| radiolab022315 |	This again with the head writer at the time Vince
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:36,192	| radiolab022315 |	We had a television taping right after that you know you have Roar on Monday you know you do you have paper
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:37,984	| radiolab022315 |	Review on Sunday you have Roar on Monday
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:40,544	| radiolab022315 |	They all had a little room to discuss their off
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:43,104	| radiolab022315 |	And Vince says that everybody in that
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:50,016	| radiolab022315 |	The first knee-jerk reaction is what we going to sweep this under the rug and not even talk about it I mean that that was almost
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:54,880	| radiolab022315 |	Just assumed because you have to understand there's this old principal in wrestling called Casey
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:56,416	| radiolab022315 |	And basically what this
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:57,696	| radiolab022315 |	Is is this loss
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:00,000	| radiolab022315 |	Of the wrestling god passed down
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:01,024	| radiolab022315 |	Since time eternal
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:01,792	| radiolab022315 |	That says
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:03,840	| radiolab022315 |	You don't talk about the fact
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:04,864	| radiolab022315 |	That it's fake
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:06,144	| radiolab022315 |	Everyone knows
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:07,680	| radiolab022315 |	That is scripted and that it's fake
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:09,984	| radiolab022315 |	But you damn well better not mention
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:13,824	| radiolab022315 |	Because everybody has a better time
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:16,128	| radiolab022315 |	When everyone is under the spell of it
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:18,688	| radiolab022315 |	And I was like wait a minute
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:24,064	| radiolab022315 |	Vince is walking around with a black eye
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:28,160	| radiolab022315 |	The boss has a black eye and one of the boys punch them in the face
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:33,536	| radiolab022315 |	Russo is saying I understand kayfabe but we have to address that we can't not acknowledged
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:36,352	| radiolab022315 |	And that doesn't have to be a problem
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:38,400	| radiolab022315 |	I can be an opportunity for
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:40,960	| radiolab022315 |	I mean it like I hate to say this but
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:46,080	| radiolab022315 |	Like it doesn't get any better than this Rousseau says this discussion got very
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:46,592	| radiolab022315 |	It was
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:48,384	| radiolab022315 |	Passion-filled
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:49,152	| radiolab022315 |	And
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:49,920	| radiolab022315 |	Indian
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:52,480	| radiolab022315 |	Nobody really knew what Vince McMahon was going to do
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:58,880	| radiolab022315 |	By the time Bret Hart steps Center Stage for his match up with Sean Monday mentally
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:24:59,904	| radiolab022315 |	Vince McMahon decide
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:01,696	| radiolab022315 |	I'm going to break with caffe
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:03,488	| radiolab022315 |	Now keep in mind
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:06,048	| radiolab022315 |	He's always been the owner of the organization but
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:07,584	| radiolab022315 |	Very few people actually knew that
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:10,144	| radiolab022315 |	Fans of professional wrestling
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:11,680	| radiolab022315 |	He was just in an ounce
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:12,960	| radiolab022315 |	That night
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:17,824	| radiolab022315 |	On his own TV show he comes out not as Vince McMahon the ringside announcer but
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:18,848	| radiolab022315 |	Is Vince McMahon
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:20,896	| radiolab022315 |	The owner of the company
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:22,176	| radiolab022315 |	Let's get right to the chase
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:24,224	| radiolab022315 |	7 days ago at the Survivor series
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:26,528	| radiolab022315 |	Did you or did you not
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:27,808	| radiolab022315 |	Screw
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:28,832	| radiolab022315 |	Bret Hart
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:30,112	| radiolab022315 |	Some would say
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:31,648	| radiolab022315 |	I screwed Bret Hart
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:32,160	| radiolab022315 |	Bret Hart
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:33,696	| radiolab022315 |	But definitely tell you
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:34,208	| radiolab022315 |	Ice
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:37,280	| radiolab022315 |	I'll look at it from a different standpoint
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:38,816	| radiolab022315 |	I'll look at it
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:39,584	| radiolab022315 |	From the standpoint of
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:41,376	| radiolab022315 |	The referee did not screw Bret Hart
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:43,168	| radiolab022315 |	Shawn Michael certainly did not screw Bret Hart
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:45,216	| radiolab022315 |	Nor did Vince McMahon
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:49,056	| radiolab022315 |	I truly believe that Bret Hart
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:50,848	| radiolab022315 |	Screwed
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:51,360	| radiolab022315 |	Bret Hart
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:52,896	| radiolab022315 |	You can look in the mirror
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:54,176	| radiolab022315 |	And know that
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:58,784	| radiolab022315 |	I'm sure in some parts of country right now there's a collective groan that you orchestrated
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:25:59,296	| radiolab022315 |	The situation
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:03,648	| radiolab022315 |	And the fact that people are not going to understand
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:05,952	| radiolab022315 |	What you mean by Bret Hart
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:07,232	| radiolab022315 |	Screwed Bret Hart so
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:09,024	| radiolab022315 |	What do you mean by that
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:10,304	| radiolab022315 |	There's a time-honored tradition
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:11,328	| radiolab022315 |	In the wrestling
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:13,888	| radiolab022315 |	Someone is
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:14,400	| radiolab022315 |	Leaving
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:16,960	| radiolab022315 |	They show the right amount of
EDL	00:26:16,960	00:26:17,472	| radiolab022315 |	Respect
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:20,288	| radiolab022315 |	To the WWF superstars in this case
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:21,824	| radiolab022315 |	Who helped make you
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:22,848	| radiolab022315 |	That's super
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:26,176	| radiolab022315 |	You show the proper respect to the organization
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:27,968	| radiolab022315 |	Help you
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:28,992	| radiolab022315 |	Become
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:30,272	| radiolab022315 |	Who you are today
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:32,320	| radiolab022315 |	Time-honored tradition
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:33,856	| radiolab022315 |	And Bret Hart
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:35,392	| radiolab022315 |	Didn't want to honor
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:36,416	| radiolab022315 |	Mapreduce
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:38,464	| radiolab022315 |	I know that's that was breast
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:38,976	| radiolab022315 |	Decision
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:40,768	| radiolab022315 |	Brett
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:41,280	| radiolab022315 |	Screwed
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:43,840	| radiolab022315 |	And
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:46,656	| radiolab022315 |	Everything changed from that point on
EDL	00:26:46,656	00:26:50,496	| radiolab022315 |	And according to Peter
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:54,080	| radiolab022315 |	After the Montreal screwjob and after this speech
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:55,872	| radiolab022315 |	The writers of the WWF
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:59,200	| radiolab022315 |	Started blurring the line on a different level
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:27:03,296	| radiolab022315 |	Vince McMahon the chairman of the WWE
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:08,416	| radiolab022315 |	He became mr. McMahon
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:11,232	| radiolab022315 |	The character the number one villain
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:12,256	| radiolab022315 |	In the company
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:18,656	| radiolab022315 |	There were no more ridiculous you know
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:24,032	| radiolab022315 |	Stupid unbelievable childish ignorant immature characters
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:27,360	| radiolab022315 |	Every character we had was basically
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:33,760	| radiolab022315 |	An extension of themselves
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:36,576	| radiolab022315 |	Cold Steve Austin was Steve Austin
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:42,976	| radiolab022315 |	1000 times magnified you know The Rock was Rocky made
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:44,768	| radiolab022315 |	My BF 100
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:50,912	| radiolab022315 |	X magnified and as a result that was the beginning
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:54,496	| radiolab022315 |	Of the biggest boom in the history of the wrestling business
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:56,288	| radiolab022315 |	As far as business goes this was
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:58,592	| radiolab022315 |	Huge for the WWF and Vince McMahon
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:02,688	| radiolab022315 |	They came roaring back in the ratings were they destroyed
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:04,480	| radiolab022315 |	Ted Turner in the WCW
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:05,248	| radiolab022315 |	The one
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:06,784	| radiolab022315 |	And if you ask Vince Russo
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:10,112	| radiolab022315 |	Tell why this approach this new aesthetic was so
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:11,392	| radiolab022315 |	Successful
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:12,416	| radiolab022315 |	He said simply
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:13,184	| radiolab022315 |	The truth
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:15,744	| radiolab022315 |	That was great TV
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:16,768	| radiolab022315 |	Plain and simple
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:20,096	| radiolab022315 |	The fans just want something true just tell the fans
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:20,864	| radiolab022315 |	What
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:21,632	| radiolab022315 |	Happen
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:22,400	| radiolab022315 |	But Peter says
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:24,960	| radiolab022315 |	Things one and it's way more complicated
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:25,984	| radiolab022315 |	That is not just about
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:28,032	| radiolab022315 |	You still have
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:31,616	| radiolab022315 |	These writers who are scripting the show and wrestlers who are getting that
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:32,640	| radiolab022315 |	And following it
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:34,176	| radiolab022315 |	So it's not like
EDL	00:28:34,176	00:28:35,968	| radiolab022315 |	It's now a true world
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:38,272	| radiolab022315 |	I think it's something more like
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:41,600	| radiolab022315 |	There are these tiny injections of Truth
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:42,368	| radiolab022315 |	Into this world
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:44,160	| radiolab022315 |	In really unexpected Moana
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:46,208	| radiolab022315 |	What that does
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:48,768	| radiolab022315 |	Is it put everyone on high alert all the time
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:49,280	| radiolab022315 |	For those milk
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:53,632	| radiolab022315 |	And when everyone is on high alert for this moment all the time
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:55,680	| radiolab022315 |	Every moment has the potential to be
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:56,448	| radiolab022315 |	True
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:28:59,520	| radiolab022315 |	Has the potential to have a little bit of an injection into it
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:02,080	| radiolab022315 |	And when you are watching for those injections
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:05,664	| radiolab022315 |	It completely changes how you are engaging
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:07,456	| radiolab022315 |	With the Arts
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:08,736	| radiolab022315 |	With the entertainment
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:11,552	| radiolab022315 |	And that creates an entirely new type of fan
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:12,832	| radiolab022315 |	What they call a smart fan
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:15,392	| radiolab022315 |	A smart Marcus Mark as they're known
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:17,184	| radiolab022315 |	People who love the
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:20,256	| radiolab022315 |	Wrestling business but really love the behind the scenes of the business
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:23,584	| radiolab022315 |	Smart bar
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:25,888	| radiolab022315 |	Here's where you can get a little lingo
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:32,288	| radiolab022315 |	The lingo part of wrestling is a huge huge part of it and a mark is someone
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:34,336	| radiolab022315 |	Who doesn't know that wrestling is fake
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:35,872	| radiolab022315 |	Or
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:36,384	| radiolab022315 |	Using other
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:38,944	| radiolab022315 |	Piece of jogging here that it is a war
EDL	00:29:38,944	00:29:43,808	| radiolab022315 |	Yes of work is anything that's not real okay as opposed to a shoot
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:45,344	| radiolab022315 |	Which is something that's real
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:47,136	| radiolab022315 |	Like the Montreal screwjob yes
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:48,416	| radiolab022315 |	Deschutes
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:48,928	| radiolab022315 |	By Def
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:53,536	| radiolab022315 |	In the ring
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:54,816	| radiolab022315 |	Oh shoot you never happened
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:56,864	| radiolab022315 |	But
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:30:00,192	| radiolab022315 |	Then there's something called of course I'll work shoot
EDL	00:30:02,752	00:30:06,592	| radiolab022315 |	Emmett something that does happen once that where you
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:08,128	| radiolab022315 |	Scripted to seem like a
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:09,152	| radiolab022315 |	It's totally unscripted
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:12,224	| radiolab022315 |	And it may even be real life they're injecting into it but it was plan
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:14,784	| radiolab022315 |	Rosedale all discuss that this is what would happen
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:17,600	| radiolab022315 |	And so watching wrestling becomes this game
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:19,392	| radiolab022315 |	Of hunting for the truth
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:20,928	| radiolab022315 |	According to David Schumer
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:24,000	| radiolab022315 |	Any truth but the authentic
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:27,584	| radiolab022315 |	Even if you know that it's fake
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:30,400	| radiolab022315 |	There's some point where the guys are really going at it in the ring
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:31,168	| radiolab022315 |	That you're just like
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:32,448	| radiolab022315 |	Well maybe
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:33,472	| radiolab022315 |	It's real just that right there
EDL	00:30:34,240	00:30:35,008	| radiolab022315 |	And that's
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:36,800	| radiolab022315 |	What makes wrestling so powerful
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:39,104	| radiolab022315 |	What's the NeverEnding search for the reality
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:40,896	| radiolab022315 |	Within.
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:44,736	| radiolab022315 |	The fact that we get to blend these things together I mean
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:47,040	| radiolab022315 |	Another example that just fantastic
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:50,368	| radiolab022315 |	In the early 2000s
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:51,648	| radiolab022315 |	The edge
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:52,416	| radiolab022315 |	Matt Hardy
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:53,440	| radiolab022315 |	And a girl named Lolita
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:54,976	| radiolab022315 |	Lita
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:56,000	| radiolab022315 |	And Matt Hardy
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:57,792	| radiolab022315 |	Were legitimately in love
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:30:59,072	| radiolab022315 |	Dating for years
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:01,376	| radiolab022315 |	Edge and Matt Hardy were legitimately best for
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:08,288	| radiolab022315 |	And then
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:09,568	| radiolab022315 |	Ended up with weed
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:13,152	| radiolab022315 |	Took his Best Friend's Girl
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:14,688	| radiolab022315 |	Something that unfortunately
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:16,224	| radiolab022315 |	Happens in life sometimes
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:17,504	| radiolab022315 |	Lego WWE
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:22,880	| radiolab022315 |	And it was turned into a storyline
EDL	00:31:22,880	00:31:29,280	| radiolab022315 |	Manifold over women since the beginning of time and we haven't got to see an epic battle over one right now I find
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:30,560	| radiolab022315 |	Credible
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:31,584	| radiolab022315 |	That you could
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:36,192	| radiolab022315 |	Go out into the rank and pretend
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:37,728	| radiolab022315 |	To beat the hell
EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:41,056	| radiolab022315 |	Out of someone you want to beat the hell out
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:42,848	| radiolab022315 |	To know that you have to go out there
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:47,200	| radiolab022315 |	Work really hard against someone you legitimately hate
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:49,504	| radiolab022315 |	And also absolutely have to protect
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:52,064	| radiolab022315 |	How can we not find that fast again
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:55,136	| radiolab022315 |	That's awesome that incredipets like watching Fleetwood Mac Go on tour
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:56,416	| radiolab022315 |	Exactly
EDL	00:31:56,928	00:31:58,208	| radiolab022315 |	That's what I was going to say next
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:31:58,976	| radiolab022315 |	That's Andrew Marantz
EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:05,888	| radiolab022315 |	The New Yorker and play all their songs cuz all their songs they all had these love quadrangles they all were married in
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:11,008	| radiolab022315 |	Left each other and wrote songs about I'm so pissed off at you because you left me for the guy to standing right there
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:12,288	| radiolab022315 |	And they go out on tour
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:16,128	| radiolab022315 |	And Lindsey Buckingham is standing right next to Stevie Nicks playing the song that he wrote
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:17,920	| radiolab022315 |	About you betrayed me I hate you so much
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:19,200	| radiolab022315 |	Crazy
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:20,224	| radiolab022315 |	It right after 9
EDL	00:32:20,224	00:32:21,248	| radiolab022315 |	Super fascinating
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:23,296	| radiolab022315 |	Yeah I just think there's a part of the
EDL	00:32:23,296	00:32:24,832	| radiolab022315 |	Human brain that wants
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:25,600	| radiolab022315 |	To be
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:26,624	| radiolab022315 |	Confused
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:28,672	| radiolab022315 |	Between those boundaries that wants to be
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:32,768	| radiolab022315 |	Slipping in between what's real what's fake to feel that confusion
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:37,632	| radiolab022315 |	I feel like that's why Jimmy Fallon was so successful on Saturday Night Live now because he was the greatest
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:40,192	| radiolab022315 |	Sketch comedian that because he broke
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:43,520	| radiolab022315 |	A lot and you eat you can't do that in wrestling cuz those moments are the best
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:45,056	| radiolab022315 |	You have to save them
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:45,824	| radiolab022315 |	You have to say it
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:47,616	| radiolab022315 |	When people acknowledge a moment
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:51,712	| radiolab022315 |	And you can tell they look around at the crowd and their knowledge in like this is
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:53,760	| radiolab022315 |	Or someone says one line
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:56,064	| radiolab022315 |	That everyone kind of knows like whoa
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:57,344	| radiolab022315 |	Well that's kind of real
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:32:58,624	| radiolab022315 |	Those moments are special
EDL	00:32:58,624	00:32:59,904	| radiolab022315 |	And you have to save them
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:02,464	| radiolab022315 |	Hey what's up
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:05,536	| radiolab022315 |	He's on the way I'll be leaving
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:07,840	| radiolab022315 |	Sargazo Usher awake
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:20,384	| radiolab022315 |	Well that's where the interesting thing is that after the Montreal screwjob
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:23,712	| radiolab022315 |	I'm a few weeks later Brett showed up on WCW television
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:26,784	| radiolab022315 |	And never really worked out for bread
EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:29,856	| radiolab022315 |	In 1999
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:32,672	| radiolab022315 |	Just two years into his contract with WCW
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:35,232	| radiolab022315 |	During a match he got kicked in the head
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:36,768	| radiolab022315 |	And suffered a severe
EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:39,584	| radiolab022315 |	And it was the beginning of the end
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:41,888	| radiolab022315 |	That same year
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:46,240	| radiolab022315 |	Ladies and gentlemen something has gone terribly wrong
EDL	00:33:46,240	00:33:47,264	| radiolab022315 |	Brett's brother
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:48,032	| radiolab022315 |	Owen Hart
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:49,056	| radiolab022315 |	Who was
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:50,848	| radiolab022315 |	Wrestling for the WWF
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:53,408	| radiolab022315 |	During one of his entrances
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:53,920	| radiolab022315 |	To the match
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:55,968	| radiolab022315 |	Entering from the ceiling
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:56,736	| radiolab022315 |	And
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:33:59,040	| radiolab022315 |	Something with the stunt went terribly wrong
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:33:59,808	| radiolab022315 |	And he
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:00,320	| radiolab022315 |	She fell
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:01,856	| radiolab022315 |	50 ft
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:02,624	| radiolab022315 |	Into the ring
EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:04,416	| radiolab022315 |	And then he died
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:06,976	| radiolab022315 |	This is not a part of the show
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:07,744	| radiolab022315 |	This is real life
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:11,328	| radiolab022315 |	Owen Hart is being attended to right now by host
EDL	00:34:12,096	00:34:12,864	| radiolab022315 |	I went through
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:14,912	| radiolab022315 |	Right away I said I could
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:16,704	| radiolab022315 |	I don't think I can ever go bad
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:23,616	| radiolab022315 |	Bret Hart spoke with Terry Gross about a year after this incident single all these sort of contrived storylines of the
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:24,128	| radiolab022315 |	Maven wrestling
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:26,688	| radiolab022315 |	You know this guy's going to come in and going to do that
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:29,248	| radiolab022315 |	He's going to say this about you earlier
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:32,064	| radiolab022315 |	I just thought everything you can possibly imagine is so
EDL	00:34:32,064	00:34:33,856	| radiolab022315 |	Ethically meaningless when you relate to
EDL	00:34:33,856	00:34:35,648	| radiolab022315 |	To the the real life horror would happen
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:36,672	| radiolab022315 |	My brother
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:38,464	| radiolab022315 |	He would retire

EDL	00:45:49,951	00:45:56,351	| radiolab022315 |	During the romantic. And and well into the early 20th century people were less interested in all these narrative layers
EDL	00:45:56,351	00:45:56,863	| radiolab022315 |	They were more just
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:46:03,775	| radiolab022315 |	Thrilled by the Romantic Don Quixote or the dreamer Don Quixote this generation of which we belong
EDL	00:46:03,775	00:46:06,079	| radiolab022315 |	Has become very interested in this
EDL	00:46:06,079	00:46:08,127	| radiolab022315 |	Terrain that Cervantes charted a long time ago
EDL	00:46:09,151	00:46:15,551	| radiolab022315 |	See it in the cinema of the late 90s kid movies like The Matrix and then later at a patient about inception
EDL	00:46:15,551	00:46:17,599	| radiolab022315 |	Exploring the concept of a dream
EDL	00:46:21,695	00:46:23,487	| radiolab022315 |	See it in Seinfeld
EDL	00:46:24,767	00:46:26,303	| radiolab022315 |	Who's going to be on TV the following
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:31,423	| radiolab022315 |	Is this comedian Jerry Seinfeld who's playing a character that happens to be called Jerry Seinfeld
EDL	00:46:31,423	00:46:32,703	| radiolab022315 |	Who's making a show
EDL	00:46:32,703	00:46:33,727	| radiolab022315 |	Within the show
EDL	00:46:33,727	00:46:34,495	| radiolab022315 |	Black octopus
EDL	00:46:35,007	00:46:36,799	| radiolab022315 |	Who's Jerry Seinfeld answer you have
EDL	00:46:37,311	00:46:38,079	| radiolab022315 |	Reality nest
EDL	00:46:38,079	00:46:39,103	| radiolab022315 |	3 *
EDL	00:46:39,103	00:46:41,919	| radiolab022315 |	But I guess I'm interested in this idea of why is
EDL	00:46:42,431	00:46:44,223	| radiolab022315 |	How is this happening again and why is it happy
EDL	00:46:44,991	00:46:46,527	| radiolab022315 |	But my sense of things is
EDL	00:46:47,295	00:46:48,063	| radiolab022315 |	That
EDL	00:46:48,063	00:46:50,623	| radiolab022315 |	Both of these moments are moments of intellectual crisis
EDL	00:46:51,135	00:46:52,671	| radiolab022315 |	Back in Cervantes time
EDL	00:46:52,671	00:46:54,463	| radiolab022315 |	Coming out of the Renaissance
EDL	00:46:54,463	00:46:56,255	| radiolab022315 |	You have all this new scientific knowledge
EDL	00:46:56,767	00:46:59,839	| radiolab022315 |	That is calling into question the foundation
EDL	00:46:59,839	00:47:01,375	| radiolab022315 |	That everybody was building their life
EDL	00:47:02,143	00:47:04,959	| radiolab022315 |	Suddenly the Earth is no longer the center of the universe
EDL	00:47:04,959	00:47:08,287	| radiolab022315 |	It's now just one planet among several orbiting the Sun
EDL	00:47:08,799	00:47:11,359	| radiolab022315 |	So you have people coming to terms with
EDL	00:47:12,127	00:47:14,175	| radiolab022315 |	A worldview that they can no longer sustain
EDL	00:47:14,175	00:47:16,991	| radiolab022315 |	An astronaut's now in the last hundred years
EDL	00:47:16,991	00:47:20,831	| radiolab022315 |	You have Darwinism you have relativity you have quantum physics
EDL	00:47:20,831	00:47:24,159	| radiolab022315 |	Any cognitive scientists are telling us that we have no free will because they cancel
EDL	00:47:24,159	00:47:24,927	| radiolab022315 |	Chart
EDL	00:47:24,927	00:47:27,487	| radiolab022315 |	The chemical reaction that happens milliseconds
EDL	00:47:27,487	00:47:29,535	| radiolab022315 |	Before we we think we decide to do something
EDL	00:47:30,047	00:47:33,631	| radiolab022315 |	All of these things tell us that the world that we think we see is not what it is
EDL	00:47:34,143	00:47:37,471	| radiolab022315 |	And I think that inspires people to then start asking these questions
EDL	00:47:37,471	00:47:39,775	| radiolab022315 |	If what I'm seeing is not real
EDL	00:47:39,775	00:47:40,287	| radiolab022315 |	What is
EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:42,079	| radiolab022315 |	I who am I
EDL	00:47:42,847	00:47:45,151	| radiolab022315 |	An enticing to a great extended its
EDL	00:47:45,151	00:47:47,711	| radiolab022315 |	It's a reaction to a moment of intellectual crime
EDL	00:47:48,223	00:47:51,551	| radiolab022315 |	Wait but okay let's say that I like professional wrestling a lot
EDL	00:47:51,551	00:47:57,951	| radiolab022315 |	I don't know anything about any of the research you're telling me about why the hell do I like professional wrestling in why did I lie
EDL	00:47:57,951	00:47:59,743	| radiolab022315 |	Like it more when they started blurring these lines
EDL	00:48:01,023	00:48:02,303	| radiolab022315 |	Hard question
EDL	00:48:03,327	00:48:04,351	| radiolab022315 |	Well I would say
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:05,375	| radiolab022315 |	Humans
EDL	00:48:05,375	00:48:07,935	| radiolab022315 |	Are humans and one of the things that we do is
EDL	00:48:07,935	00:48:12,287	| radiolab022315 |	Is it as opposed to as far as we know what other animals on this planet do is
EDL	00:48:12,287	00:48:14,591	| radiolab022315 |	We are aware of our own contingency
EDL	00:48:14,591	00:48:16,383	| radiolab022315 |	Meaning we can imagine
EDL	00:48:16,383	00:48:20,735	| radiolab022315 |	Radically different possibilities we can imagine a world where we don't exist
EDL	00:48:20,735	00:48:26,111	| radiolab022315 |	Or maybe we only think we exist I can remember being a child's 4 and 5 years old
EDL	00:48:26,623	00:48:27,391	| radiolab022315 |	And
EDL	00:48:27,391	00:48:33,791	| radiolab022315 |	Going to a fabric store with my mother and there were two mirrors set against opposite walls and I was just fascinated
EDL	00:48:33,791	00:48:36,351	| radiolab022315 |	Standing in between them and watching the infinite regress
EDL	00:48:36,863	00:48:37,887	| radiolab022315 |	Go in each Direction
EDL	00:48:39,167	00:48:42,239	| radiolab022315 |	You know when I have not even started kindergarten yet so I think
EDL	00:48:42,239	00:48:43,775	| radiolab022315 |	I think humans have this
EDL	00:48:43,775	00:48:49,407	| radiolab022315 |	Fascination with infinite regress and with embeddedness and with the questions that it forces you to consider
EDL	00:48:50,431	00:48:51,967	| radiolab022315 |	Like weird is everything
EDL	00:48:51,967	00:48:52,735	| radiolab022315 |	Begin Again
EDL	00:48:53,503	00:48:54,527	| radiolab022315 |	Where does it all come from
EDL	00:48:55,295	00:48:57,087	| radiolab022315 |	Me the question at the heart of
EDL	00:48:57,087	00:49:00,671	| radiolab022315 |	Donkey xote realizing that he's a character in a novel is
EDL	00:49:00,671	00:49:01,695	| radiolab022315 |	Who stands above you
EDL	00:49:02,463	00:49:02,975	| radiolab022315 |	The author
EDL	00:49:03,487	00:49:07,839	| radiolab022315 |	Stands above you until that author has a kind of Godlike relationship to you
EDL	00:49:08,351	00:49:10,399	| radiolab022315 |	But that very question starts
EDL	00:49:10,911	00:49:13,215	| radiolab022315 |	To make you ask who stands above that author
EDL	00:49:13,983	00:49:18,079	| radiolab022315 |	And if you start asking that question it goes on forever in every direction
EDL	00:49:53,151	00:49:59,551	| radiolab022315 |	Thank you to Rupert Boyd for coming and playing the Spanish
