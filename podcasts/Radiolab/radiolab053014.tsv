EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:38,143	| radiolab053014 |	So this is what I would suggest as I have some clips
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:39,679	| radiolab053014 |	Short clips
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:45,823	| radiolab053014 |	And I'd like to sort of weed the clips together sort of get maybe throw it out that way rather than telling you about them
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:52,479	| radiolab053014 |	Why don't we why don't we try I see we're dealing with a storyteller

EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:19,871	| radiolab053014 |	Halo in a center
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:21,151	| radiolab053014 |	Light yellow
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:22,943	| radiolab053014 |	Something someone might eat
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:25,759	| radiolab053014 |	Someone might eat it I
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:26,783	| radiolab053014 |	I've not eaten it
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:27,295	| radiolab053014 |	Hi
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:30,879	| radiolab053014 |	I saved it since 1971.
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:31,391	| radiolab053014 |	Just getting to say
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:38,303	| radiolab053014 |	619 what is an Edible Egg this isn't an edible
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:40,351	| radiolab053014 |	If you kept it from 1970
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:45,215	| radiolab053014 |	It looks remarkably Good Samaritan dissolved in under the weight of time and it
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:51,871	| radiolab053014 |	And apparently it's a well it is pristine I've seen it I had a sugar egg
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:52,639	| radiolab053014 |	What is that
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:55,455	| radiolab053014 |	Only it's a half of an egg it's
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:10:01,855	| radiolab053014 |	Halo it's made out of sugar and you would put things like jelly beans and if you seal the edges with
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:07,999	| radiolab053014 |	Frosting and then you decorate the outside of it there must have been some reason why he
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:09,023	| radiolab053014 |	He has
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:10,559	| radiolab053014 |	Memorialized
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:16,959	| radiolab053014 |	I'm glad you mention it I just happen to have another clip 2
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:20,543	| radiolab053014 |	Day that we were to leave
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:26,175	| radiolab053014 |	I'm sorry. I didn't set it up because I'm going to have to say about Rick was when he was a kid
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:29,247	| radiolab053014 |	His family moved around a lot
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:35,647	| radiolab053014 |	There lyrics dad did a lot of work for the government so almost every year he would find himself in a totally different town and to make things worse
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:37,695	| radiolab053014 |	Worse he was very shy
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:38,463	| radiolab053014 |	Kid
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:41,023	| radiolab053014 |	Kept himself a lot for Rick friendship
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:42,815	| radiolab053014 |	But just often seemed
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:44,095	| radiolab053014 |	Impossible
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:46,399	| radiolab053014 |	But then says there was this one moment
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:49,727	| radiolab053014 |	When he was eight that they lived in Washington State
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:51,263	| radiolab053014 |	Only four-year and
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:56,383	| radiolab053014 |	He found himself in the drama because he had finally made a friend
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:58,431	| radiolab053014 |	And his friend David
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:01,503	| radiolab053014 |	Invited him to a birthday party
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:02,783	| radiolab053014 |	But it happened to be
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:06,879	| radiolab053014 |	That his birthday party was scheduled the very day
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:08,671	| radiolab053014 |	That we were to move
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:09,695	| radiolab053014 |	Again
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:16,095	| radiolab053014 |	So my father was once once again transferred this time from Washington back to Idaho and my parents are
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:16,863	| radiolab053014 |	Decided that it
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:19,167	| radiolab053014 |	I couldn't attend the birthday party because there wasn't time
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:20,447	| radiolab053014 |	So
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:26,847	| radiolab053014 |	The moving van was sitting there everybody was ready to go and I don't think I even asked my parents I don't think they know
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:27,871	| radiolab053014 |	That I left
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:29,663	| radiolab053014 |	But I took off
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:31,967	| radiolab053014 |	And I ran up the street to David's house
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:38,623	| radiolab053014 |	I I still can't picture this moment I ate his house with a brick house and he had a
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:42,975	| radiolab053014 |	Large porch that was completely empty and I know that I paused there
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:44,767	| radiolab053014 |	Even though I was
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:45,279	| radiolab053014 |	Only eight
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:46,559	| radiolab053014 |	I must have known
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:52,703	| radiolab053014 |	That our friendship really wasn't at the point where it demanded a goodbye especially
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:54,239	| radiolab053014 |	If that meant that I had to interrupt
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:56,799	| radiolab053014 |	What is birthday party but I rang the doorbell
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:58,847	| radiolab053014 |	And his mother answered the door
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:11:59,615	| radiolab053014 |	And
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:01,151	| radiolab053014 |	I remember seeing
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:03,455	| radiolab053014 |	Basically from her knees down
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:06,527	| radiolab053014 |	And Beyond her into the back of the house which was bright
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:08,575	| radiolab053014 |	And Loud where the party was going on
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:15,487	| radiolab053014 |	A few seconds later David showed up he and I was kind of behind her and I don't
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:16,255	| radiolab053014 |	Never seen a word
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:23,167	| radiolab053014 |	You just standing I would just Frozen and standing there completely embarrassed and not knowing why I had done this
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:24,447	| radiolab053014 |	And
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:26,239	| radiolab053014 |	I was about to leave
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:27,263	| radiolab053014 |	When
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:28,543	| radiolab053014 |	David's mom
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:31,359	| radiolab053014 |	Apparently asked him to go get something and he left
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:35,199	| radiolab053014 |	A few seconds later returned and handed me
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:36,991	| radiolab053014 |	This yellow
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:37,759	| radiolab053014 |	Sugar egg
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:46,719	| radiolab053014 |	The very same here in your box yes I
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:49,791	| radiolab053014 |	Walks back to my parents house
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:52,351	| radiolab053014 |	We were loaded into the back of
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:53,631	| radiolab053014 |	Their station wagon
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:13:00,031	| radiolab053014 |	And we drove from there to Idaho and I know that I held this in my hand the entire way
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:03,359	| radiolab053014 |	Did let go of it
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:09,503	| radiolab053014 |	I put it in a drawer and it has lived in various places for all these years
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:13,087	| radiolab053014 |	Why
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:17,439	| radiolab053014 |	Is it begs the question doesn't hit
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:18,463	| radiolab053014 |	You know the truth is
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:24,863	| radiolab053014 |	I knew its importance immediately and it hasn't changed I looked at this egg
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:26,655	| radiolab053014 |	And it was proof
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:32,543	| radiolab053014 |	Physical proof that I have been invited to a birthday party
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:34,847	| radiolab053014 |	And there was a hope of making a friendship
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:35,871	| radiolab053014 |	And
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:40,479	| radiolab053014 |	I held onto it because I needed that proof
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:54,047	| radiolab053014 |	That's actually very wonderful
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:14:00,447	| radiolab053014 |	The tree we need to we need entry of the heck I'm all about
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:06,847	| radiolab053014 |	I'm swept into the egg know I'm bring it together and I'll bring the narrative threads together a little more egg
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:09,151	| radiolab053014 |	Give me more
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:15,551	| radiolab053014 |	The tree so my parents bought a home in Idaho this is right
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:21,951	| radiolab053014 |	Left the egg incident in the Snake River Valley in Idaho it's it's very flat it's very we
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:28,351	| radiolab053014 |	Why their new backyard was a Barren landscape
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:34,751	| radiolab053014 |	Trees pine trees cherry and amongst them was a maple tree
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:41,151	| radiolab053014 |	The groove very quickly and it enveloped to house in a certain way in the breeze sound like
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:47,039	| radiolab053014 |	Suede rub together just Amplified by
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:53,439	| radiolab053014 |	It was beautiful
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:59,839	| radiolab053014 |	Live there with his family for 10 years until College I moved to Boston and Byler
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:06,239	| radiolab053014 |	Learned that my father decided that the tree was planted too close to the house and it would it would damage the foundation
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:10,847	| radiolab053014 |	And he dropped it down
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:14,943	| radiolab053014 |	It was a massacre it was it was brutal and
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:17,759	| radiolab053014 |	I was very upset
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:24,159	| radiolab053014 |	It's my mother knowing that she mailed me a package and I opened it to find that she had place
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:30,559	| radiolab053014 |	Christian it some small sprouted seedlings from the original maple tree
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:36,959	| radiolab053014 |	Backyard and plopped it in the ground behind the garage and it's arrived
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:40,543	| radiolab053014 |	And within a number of years it has grown to be a 30-foot tree
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:43,871	| radiolab053014 |	Remind me obviously of the tree that I
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:45,663	| radiolab053014 |	Had loved and lost
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:46,687	| radiolab053014 |	In Idaho
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:47,455	| radiolab053014 |	And
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:49,247	| radiolab053014 |	It became
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:55,647	| radiolab053014 |	So large unfortunately that also caught the attention of my landlord
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:56,927	| radiolab053014 |	Tragically
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:16:00,767	| radiolab053014 |	One night I got back from work to discover that he had chop down
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:07,167	| radiolab053014 |	The maple tree
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:10,239	| radiolab053014 |	I went out into the yard that night
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:11,775	| radiolab053014 |	And I
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:14,335	| radiolab053014 |	Salvaged these sections of the tree
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:20,735	| radiolab053014 |	Rick gave the wood to a friend of furniture maker in Gloucester Massachusetts turned it into a box
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:21,759	| radiolab053014 |	This box
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:23,039	| radiolab053014 |	One right here
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:27,135	| radiolab053014 |	Made from the maple That Grew From You know the story
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:29,183	| radiolab053014 |	Wow there's discontinuity
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:30,719	| radiolab053014 |	I find such a comfort from that
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:36,095	| radiolab053014 |	So it intern holds all these objects that have their own individual stories and their own meaning
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:38,911	| radiolab053014 |	One of them is this yellow
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:39,679	| radiolab053014 |	Sugar egg
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:43,007	| radiolab053014 |	The exit 3 in the Box
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:49,151	| radiolab053014 |	Yeah that's nice that's really nice I've been very nice you want to smack a little bit and be like
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:55,551	| radiolab053014 |	Well now you know
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:17:01,951	| radiolab053014 |	No not me we can put the Box in a house we made from the teeth of his dog with the thing
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:05,535	| radiolab053014 |	Thing I would say okay just keep multiplying
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:13,727	| radiolab053014 |	Oh how I wish we left it there like you can't
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:18,591	| radiolab053014 |	Really experience them unless you touch them and interact with them like that's how you
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:20,895	| radiolab053014 |	Get the essence of what's in there
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:27,295	| radiolab053014 |	But at a certain point are producers in Levy really produce this show had this great idea for an experiment that we could do
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:33,695	| radiolab053014 |	Where we would make 3D printed versions of the objects in the stories and then public exhibit where
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:40,095	| radiolab053014 |	People can come and see them while they listen to the audio or even if they have access to a 3D printer they could just print a verb
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:46,495	| radiolab053014 |	Persian wherever they are so we asked if we could scan the egg

EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:05,951	| radiolab053014 |	And here's what happened Rick
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:09,791	| radiolab053014 |	Drop the egg off Frisk and egg that have been cherishing for over 40 years
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:14,911	| radiolab053014 |	I had to leave it for a couple hours shortly after he does he gets a call
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:16,703	| radiolab053014 |	From the scanning technician who

EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:18,495	| radiolab053014 |	Something
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:20,543	| radiolab053014 |	Here she said
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:22,079	| radiolab053014 |	The bottom line is
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:24,895	| radiolab053014 |	Yeah
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:27,455	| radiolab053014 |	The egg is broke

EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:33,855	| radiolab053014 |	I hope it wasn't a family heirloom
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:39,487	| radiolab053014 |	Finn met up with Rick as he was just getting back from the print shop with his bag
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:42,559	| radiolab053014 |	Egg pieces I close the stuff that the

EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:52,287	| radiolab053014 |	Looks like it's
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:54,079	| radiolab053014 |	In about
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:55,615	| radiolab053014 |	7 pieces

EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:18,655	| radiolab053014 |	Radiolab Jad Hi how are you doing I I just need to say that we are so
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:21,983	| radiolab053014 |	So so so sorry about
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:25,311	| radiolab053014 |	What happened I never had my heart
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:27,103	| radiolab053014 |	Think in that way
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:30,431	| radiolab053014 |	From any emails I've ever opened
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:31,455	| radiolab053014 |	Thank you
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:33,503	| radiolab053014 |	Thank you it was such
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:34,783	| radiolab053014 |	It was such a strange
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:36,575	| radiolab053014 |	Clash
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:40,415	| radiolab053014 |	To walk into this store that is devoted to the Future
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:44,255	| radiolab053014 |	And all these machines sitting around that are turning out
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:46,559	| radiolab053014 |	Almost magically
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:50,655	| radiolab053014 |	These new things and I on the other hand and standing there
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,191	| radiolab053014 |	To collect
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:56,287	| radiolab053014 |	The shards of a sugar egg that I've held onto
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:59,615	| radiolab053014 |	440 + years and
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:02,175	| radiolab053014 |	Just felt
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:04,223	| radiolab053014 |	Dullness
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:06,271	| radiolab053014 |	Kind of heavy like everything was just a little bit
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:07,807	| radiolab053014 |	Muddied
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:08,319	| radiolab053014 |	4
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:10,111	| radiolab053014 |	A while
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:13,951	| radiolab053014 |	It took a little while for that to wear off
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:15,487	| radiolab053014 |	And
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:18,047	| radiolab053014 |	And it did with an amazing
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:18,559	| radiolab053014 |	Clarity
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:27,007	| radiolab053014 |	When worrying I think it was two days after the egg has been broken
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:29,311	| radiolab053014 |	He says he woke up and
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:30,847	| radiolab053014 |	And idea came to me
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:32,639	| radiolab053014 |	Thought I should call Max
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:34,431	| radiolab053014 |	Sedition a
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:36,991	| radiolab053014 |	Max is the son of a friend of his who lives down the street
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:40,063	| radiolab053014 |	We do one
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:40,575	| radiolab053014 |	Tablespoons in
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:43,391	| radiolab053014 |	He's eight
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:46,719	| radiolab053014 |	Exactly the same age that I was when I got the first egg
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:54,143	| radiolab053014 |	Of Yellowstone
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:57,727	| radiolab053014 |	And so I asked him if he would help me

EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:31,264	| radiolab053014 |	I was
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:33,312	| radiolab053014 |	Exactly your age
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:35,872	| radiolab053014 |	Exactly
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:46,880	| radiolab053014 |	Special thanks to Vin Liotta Who provided us with much of
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:47,904	| radiolab053014 |	The tape you just heard
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:50,464	| radiolab053014 |	Rickon and will FEMA
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:56,864	| radiolab053014 |	The whole thing yeah he has doing a documentary what you guys got all that stuff about people who attach do everyday things O and A
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:21:58,656	| radiolab053014 |	And in terms of the
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:22:01,472	| radiolab053014 |	Did the egg breaking
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:06,592	| radiolab053014 |	We we actually we have we found somebody who doesn't like restoration
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:07,360	| radiolab053014 |	Free movie stuff
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:08,896	| radiolab053014 |	And we've offered
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:15,296	| radiolab053014 |	Ric to to have that person fix the egg with epoxy or whatever an offer he agreed to accept
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:16,320	| radiolab053014 |	I'm happy to say
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:17,600	| radiolab053014 |	And also interestingly enough
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:21,440	| radiolab053014 |	Myths can hear the scan that broke the Agnew
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:22,464	| radiolab053014 |	Actually
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:23,488	| radiolab053014 |	We have that scan
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:26,560	| radiolab053014 |	Is the skin skinny when she was actually running
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:28,096	| radiolab053014 |	Very moment when the egg
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:28,864	| radiolab053014 |	Broke
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:30,144	| radiolab053014 |	So we actually have
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:32,448	| radiolab053014 |	A scan of the millisecond when it fell apart
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:33,728	| radiolab053014 |	Radiolab.

EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:23,904	| radiolab053014 |	And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:26,976	| radiolab053014 |	We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:32,608	| radiolab053014 |	Childhood Brilliance basically I want to hear about this
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:39,008	| radiolab053014 |	It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that maybe it was the moment that a kid
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:42,592	| radiolab053014 |	You've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:48,992	| radiolab053014 |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:54,112	| radiolab053014 |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:24:00,512	| radiolab053014 |	We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:04,608	| radiolab053014 |	It doesn't have anything to do with the test if you have a story please share it with us

EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:45,056	| radiolab053014 |	Fights this is Alison gopnik she's a professor of psychology and philosophy at the University of California at Berkeley and the

EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:55,808	| radiolab053014 |	Truthfully after the egg situation we Broken Egg to make this program and get food if you're just joining us
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:56,832	| radiolab053014 |	Just happened with Phil really
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:59,392	| radiolab053014 |	Crappy about it frankly but
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:01,440	| radiolab053014 |	Got us thinking about the fragility of
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:03,744	| radiolab053014 |	Of objects in for me that cult mind
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:05,280	| radiolab053014 |	And I do that I've always been thinking about
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:09,888	| radiolab053014 |	You have any father to young kids about object permanence
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:16,032	| radiolab053014 |	Which is this whole idea in child psychology that when babies are really young
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:17,312	| radiolab053014 |	When an object
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:19,104	| radiolab053014 |	Disappears from their View
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:21,408	| radiolab053014 |	They think it's gone forever
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:27,296	| radiolab053014 |	Sutherlands Topeka active you're gone forever
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:37,024	| radiolab053014 |	So I thought this would be a cool idea for us to explore about how like from the very beginning we're born with
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:39,328	| radiolab053014 |	No concept that objects that stick around but
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:42,400	| radiolab053014 |	Let me talk with Alison gopnik the first thing she told us
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:44,192	| radiolab053014 |	What's with that well it's
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:44,960	| radiolab053014 |	It's
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:46,496	| radiolab053014 |	It's a little more complicated than that
EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:49,056	| radiolab053014 |	Of course
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:55,200	| radiolab053014 |	Lawrence Wright that's science until we got to a conversation and some strange directions but she began by telling us about
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:26:00,320	| radiolab053014 |	Some new research which shows it actually babies do have an idea that objects
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:01,088	| radiolab053014 |	Stick around
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:05,184	| radiolab053014 |	Yo if you do the experiments were you show him an object by the screen in The Matrix
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:06,720	| radiolab053014 |	Pier
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:11,328	| radiolab053014 |	Where did it go it should be there exactly
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:17,728	| radiolab053014 |	You know the well because babies look much longer at things that they don't expect it or surprising
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:18,240	| radiolab053014 |	You're saying you know
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:19,520	| radiolab053014 |	What's up
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:24,384	| radiolab053014 |	Very rarely finish that expression though
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:25,664	| radiolab053014 |	Alright so I was wrong
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:27,968	| radiolab053014 |	Here's the really surprising
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:29,248	| radiolab053014 |	Now suppose what happens is
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:31,552	| radiolab053014 |	Yellow duck goes behind the
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:34,368	| radiolab053014 |	Screen moving left right and then out the other side
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:35,392	| radiolab053014 |	Dead of the yellow duck
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:37,184	| radiolab053014 |	There's a little blue bunny
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:39,232	| radiolab053014 |	No most adults if they saw this would be like
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:40,256	| radiolab053014 |	What's up
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:43,072	| radiolab053014 |	But the babies are totally blase about that
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:51,264	| radiolab053014 |	A yellow duck goes in one side of the screen and then magically the Blue Duck appears on the other side of the screen
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:54,848	| radiolab053014 |	Until they're about a year old babies don't seem to be
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:56,128	| radiolab053014 |	Changed by that
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:58,688	| radiolab053014 |	And she suspects that the reason for that is that
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:27:02,016	| radiolab053014 |	The most important thing about the duck to the babies is not
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:06,112	| radiolab053014 |	That is yellow or round or duck like in any way it was
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:09,952	| radiolab053014 |	Its trajectory story what did in the past what its history is
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:14,304	| radiolab053014 |	Like this is an object that was moving left right and when it emerged from the screen
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:20,192	| radiolab053014 |	It was still an object moving left to right and there are experiments with adults that are kind of amazing
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:22,496	| radiolab053014 |	Do you sort of see the same thing
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:24,800	| radiolab053014 |	Room full of students
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:28,128	| radiolab053014 |	Divide them in half you say okay everybody on the left half
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:28,896	| radiolab053014 |	The room
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:33,504	| radiolab053014 |	Is now going to get a univ University of California at Berkeley mug
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:35,296	| radiolab053014 |	Then you say to them all right
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:38,624	| radiolab053014 |	Oh you got to have a mug how much would you sell your mug for
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:39,648	| radiolab053014 |	And then you ask
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:44,768	| radiolab053014 |	The people on the other side of the class how much would you pay to buy that mug can you get people to write it down on a piece
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:49,120	| radiolab053014 |	Will it rain at the people who actually already have them on their desk
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:54,240	| radiolab053014 |	Think that it's much more valuable than the people on the other side
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:56,288	| radiolab053014 |	They would demand much more
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,824	| radiolab053014 |	For their mug
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:59,872	| radiolab053014 |	Keep in mind they only spent one minute with
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:03,968	| radiolab053014 |	This mug but somehow over that minute she says the mug gets imbued with something
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:05,504	| radiolab053014 |	Some kind of
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:13,184	| radiolab053014 |	There's something and again you can see this even with children there's something about - there's something about possession about
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:16,000	| radiolab053014 |	A relationship that I have to be objects that I care about
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:20,352	| radiolab053014 |	It goes beyond just what their superficial features
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:21,888	| radiolab053014 |	That makes sense
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:23,424	| radiolab053014 |	Deeply obvious inst
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:26,240	| radiolab053014 |	I'm surprised that it was even a discovery
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:28,544	| radiolab053014 |	If I have a relationship with a thing
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:29,824	| radiolab053014 |	Like I
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:33,152	| radiolab053014 |	I'm going to see my girlfriend and the
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:34,688	| radiolab053014 |	Railroad man gives me the ticket
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:36,224	| radiolab053014 |	And it turns out to be
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:37,248	| radiolab053014 |	Fabulous date
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:41,344	| radiolab053014 |	Can I put the ticket in my pocket and I saved it to get 40 years
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:43,904	| radiolab053014 |	Anytime I want to go back
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:46,464	| radiolab053014 |	To the day that I have the great date
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:47,232	| radiolab053014 |	I just touched
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:47,744	| radiolab053014 |	The ticket
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:53,632	| radiolab053014 |	Yeah I don't have that at all don't have it at all I have a little bit but now I
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:54,400	| radiolab053014 |	I throw that
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:55,680	| radiolab053014 |	You throw it away
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:56,448	| radiolab053014 |	I throw them away
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:28:58,240	| radiolab053014 |	The Purge man
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:29:00,800	| radiolab053014 |	If some of us are more sentimental about
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:02,592	| radiolab053014 |	About objects then
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:04,896	| radiolab053014 |	Then others are and what you says
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:07,712	| radiolab053014 |	For those weirdos like you Robert
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:10,272	| radiolab053014 |	Who gets super romantic about their
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:11,040	| radiolab053014 |	Things
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:13,856	| radiolab053014 |	There might be a deep evolutionary reason for it
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:17,184	| radiolab053014 |	Now yours to take these evolutionary reasons with a grain of salt but
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:18,976	| radiolab053014 |	She says if you look at
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:20,256	| radiolab053014 |	Patterns of
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:26,656	| radiolab053014 |	Cashing for example is what it's called in biology you have like the squirrel hides his nuts the squirrels keep really
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:30,240	| radiolab053014 |	Good track of which nuts they have and what their histories are
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:32,544	| radiolab053014 |	And one possibility is that some of our
EDL	00:29:32,544	00:29:35,104	| radiolab053014 |	Relationship about at least physical objects
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:36,384	| radiolab053014 |	Stems from
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:37,152	| radiolab053014 |	This
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:38,176	| radiolab053014 |	The history of
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:44,576	| radiolab053014 |	History of being mammal to keep track of what we got and what we don't have
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:51,488	| radiolab053014 |	Yeah we do talk about people swirling things away is there something that's got this kind of deeper evolutionary background and
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:53,536	| radiolab053014 |	I think there is some evidence that
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:56,352	| radiolab053014 |	But it's also like a counter squirrel Instinct I mean like
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:30:01,984	| radiolab053014 |	There's that famous thing with observation that young male baboons when they get to a certain age
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:04,800	| radiolab053014 |	Gripped by Wanderlust and then just wander away from the truth
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:06,592	| radiolab053014 |	And which is good
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:09,408	| radiolab053014 |	Prevent inbreeding
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:13,504	| radiolab053014 |	Is actually reason to think that we all live on this kind of
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:15,296	| radiolab053014 |	Emotional bungee cord
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:18,112	| radiolab053014 |	Yeah boy in between the score on the baboon and she says it
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:20,416	| radiolab053014 |	Interesting to think about like what's going to happen to her
EDL	00:30:21,184	00:30:21,952	| radiolab053014 |	Bongino
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:24,256	| radiolab053014 |	Now that we're entering a world where objects are
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:24,768	| radiolab053014 |	Becoming
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:26,560	| radiolab053014 |	Just information
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:28,864	| radiolab053014 |	What will happen when we have
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:29,888	| radiolab053014 |	3D printers
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:32,192	| radiolab053014 |	That are going to be like the replicators on Star Trek
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:33,472	| radiolab053014 |	They can
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:34,752	| radiolab053014 |	Just keep producing
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:36,032	| radiolab053014 |	Replicas of
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:36,800	| radiolab053014 |	About you
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:40,896	| radiolab053014 |	Might actually mess with some of our most Basic Instinct philosophy
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:42,944	| radiolab053014 |	Great about having wonderful crazy
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:44,736	| radiolab053014 |	Thought experiment
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:45,504	| radiolab053014 |	What's the trade-in damaged
EDL	00:30:46,272	00:30:47,040	| radiolab053014 |	So one of them
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:53,952	| radiolab053014 |	The Swamp Man famous thought experiment
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:31:00,352	| radiolab053014 |	Mother got a man but here's the story of the Swamp Man matching you're standing next to swamp near you
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:06,752	| radiolab053014 |	I've been swamped a bunch of
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:13,152	| radiolab053014 |	Whatever you just standing there but that a bolt of lightning comes out of the sky
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:19,552	| radiolab053014 |	Kills another one comes out of the sky hits the swamp
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:22,880	| radiolab053014 |	Catalyzing all that chemistry in overdrive and somehow miraculously
EDL	00:31:22,880	00:31:27,744	| radiolab053014 |	For just a moment the reactions come together and just the right way to form
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:28,256	| radiolab053014 |	Robert
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:32,096	| radiolab053014 |	Completely identical to you Robert
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:35,168	| radiolab053014 |	A brand new you if you took
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:38,240	| radiolab053014 |	Every single molecule in the swamp man's body
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:39,264	| radiolab053014 |	It would be
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:42,336	| radiolab053014 |	Exactly like you were at this very moment so here's the question
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:43,616	| radiolab053014 |	Does swamp rabbit
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:45,152	| radiolab053014 |	Remember that date
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:46,688	| radiolab053014 |	Or does
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:47,456	| radiolab053014 |	Swamp rabbit
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:48,224	| radiolab053014 |	Care about the ticket
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:50,528	| radiolab053014 |	Your son is swamp gas Robert
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:56,416	| radiolab053014 |	Is molecule for molecule Adam4Adam
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:59,744	| radiolab053014 |	So you're saying are the memories and experiences of his life suddenly
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:01,792	| radiolab053014 |	Contained in that facsimile
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:03,328	| radiolab053014 |	That's the question
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:05,632	| radiolab053014 |	And most people's intuition is
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:06,400	| radiolab053014 |	No
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:08,960	| radiolab053014 |	Absolutely absolutely not
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:11,776	| radiolab053014 |	I'm not even hesitated why not
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:12,800	| radiolab053014 |	I believe
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:14,592	| radiolab053014 |	That my
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:16,128	| radiolab053014 |	Date and the ticket
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:17,408	| radiolab053014 |	It took me to that date
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:19,456	| radiolab053014 |	They belong to me and not to Adam
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:24,320	| radiolab053014 |	And I don't know if you ask me what's the difference between me and my Adam's I don't know
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:25,856	| radiolab053014 |	But I know it's there
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:27,136	| radiolab053014 |	Because the atoms
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:28,928	| radiolab053014 |	Have you sitting right there
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:30,208	| radiolab053014 |	Actually went on that day
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:32,768	| radiolab053014 |	Where's the atoms of swamp gas Robert
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:36,608	| radiolab053014 |	Weren't there I think you got it exactly right that it's something about the history
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:41,984	| radiolab053014 |	Robert Adams really were in that place they really were there with that
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:42,752	| radiolab053014 |	Person and
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:47,360	| radiolab053014 |	Although I could I could tell a version of the swamp gas Robert that weird
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:48,128	| radiolab053014 |	Solve this problem
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:49,920	| radiolab053014 |	Is Robert this Robert
EDL	00:32:49,920	00:32:51,968	| radiolab053014 |	Set lighting you just got into the swamp
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:57,344	| radiolab053014 |	Submerged himself commingled his atoms with the swamp gas Adams
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:32:58,880	| radiolab053014 |	How many got out when tons weigh
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:01,696	| radiolab053014 |	If then later even like years later
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:03,232	| radiolab053014 |	The swamp
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:04,000	| radiolab053014 |	I brought her
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:05,024	| radiolab053014 |	About a copy
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:07,840	| radiolab053014 |	The fact that the real Robert was there to begin with
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:09,888	| radiolab053014 |	And that the copy somehow
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:10,656	| radiolab053014 |	Hatched
EDL	00:33:10,656	00:33:16,544	| radiolab053014 |	I almost like a baton passing I could see that the date would be in the copy link
EDL	00:33:17,056	00:33:20,896	| radiolab053014 |	I think I might explain it to my
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:21,664	| radiolab053014 |	Self
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:23,200	| radiolab053014 |	With fewest shenzhen
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:24,480	| radiolab053014 |	Touch that is
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:26,528	| radiolab053014 |	My wife is very different you this to me
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:32,416	| radiolab053014 |	I one day while sitting around the office get a letter unbidden from the first man on the Moon
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:33,696	| radiolab053014 |	From the alarm
EDL	00:33:33,696	00:33:37,024	| radiolab053014 |	Just write something that I've written so that you do that it says
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:38,048	| radiolab053014 |	Commander Neil Armstrong
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:38,560	| radiolab053014 |	Flattering
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:40,352	| radiolab053014 |	And if you could come
EDL	00:33:40,864	00:33:42,912	| radiolab053014 |	In any other form but my email
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:44,192	| radiolab053014 |	I would have
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:48,032	| radiolab053014 |	Framed it I would have given it a special place of honor
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:49,568	| radiolab053014 |	But since it arrived
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:56,480	| radiolab053014 |	From the machine to my machine and then out of the machine to another machine to a flat piece of paper
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:58,528	| radiolab053014 |	I can't give it that time can't give it to
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:33:59,552	| radiolab053014 |	The tickets
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:00,064	| radiolab053014 |	To the date
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:02,368	| radiolab053014 |	That's weird
EDL	00:34:02,880	00:34:05,696	| radiolab053014 |	Why because Neil Armstrong never touched
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:13,888	| radiolab053014 |	Yeah but you and I are old Robert so maybe that stuff
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:15,680	| radiolab053014 |	When was the moment you said I thought
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:16,448	| radiolab053014 |	I wish I was
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:20,544	| radiolab053014 |	Constructing an image in my mind of Neil Armstrong at a computer touching the keyboard
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:22,336	| radiolab053014 |	And
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:23,616	| radiolab053014 |	There is an
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:25,664	| radiolab053014 |	Unbridgeable Gulf
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:26,432	| radiolab053014 |	Between
EDL	00:34:26,432	00:34:27,200	| radiolab053014 |	His fingers
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:29,504	| radiolab053014 |	That paper you're older
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:30,272	| radiolab053014 |	I never actually touched
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:35,648	| radiolab053014 |	I mean if you think about is touch then you're right I got to see that he's now dead or not I think if
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:37,952	| radiolab053014 |	Just touching the paper he would
EDL	00:34:37,952	00:34:39,232	| radiolab053014 |	He would just be a little
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:41,280	| radiolab053014 |	I don't know
EDL	00:34:43,328	00:34:43,840	| radiolab053014 |	Closer
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:47,936	| radiolab053014 |	Well it's a funny tension I think because
EDL	00:34:47,936	00:34:48,704	| radiolab053014 |	You know what
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:54,848	| radiolab053014 |	Both science and at least some philosophical and even religious Traditions tell us is that
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:57,664	| radiolab053014 |	The world is impermanent nothing in it stays
EDL	00:34:57,664	00:35:00,992	| radiolab053014 |	The same RR we don't stay the same our bodies don't stay the same
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:04,320	| radiolab053014 |	The people that we love in the things we love don't stay the same that's just
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:09,440	| radiolab053014 |	The truth of the matter is if there's this constant impermanence in this constant flux and some
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:11,488	| radiolab053014 |	Philosophers have argued over the years
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:12,256	| radiolab053014 |	We should just
EDL	00:35:12,256	00:35:14,560	| radiolab053014 |	Embrace that we would be Freer if we didn't
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:15,584	| radiolab053014 |	If we didn't
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:18,144	| radiolab053014 |	Try to hold that
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:18,912	| radiolab053014 |	Flux for a moment
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:21,472	| radiolab053014 |	I have to say my feeling about it is
EDL	00:35:21,984	00:35:23,008	| radiolab053014 |	Part of what makes
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:26,592	| radiolab053014 |	Everything so precious to us is exactly the fact that
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:27,872	| radiolab053014 |	We know it's going to do
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:30,176	| radiolab053014 |	Disappear we know it's impermanent we know it won't last
EDL	00:35:30,688	00:35:36,832	| radiolab053014 |	What we love is this thing now we love our for me the most dramatic example of this is our relationship
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:38,624	| radiolab053014 |	Schizo
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:44,768	| radiolab053014 |	We know they're going to go we know that in 20 years from now if we they treat us with affectionate contempt will be doing really well
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:47,328	| radiolab053014 |	But that doesn't
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:50,144	| radiolab053014 |	Change the fact that right now
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:53,984	| radiolab053014 |	It's this child and not any other child in the universe
EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:59,104	| radiolab053014 |	Just this one and I think that's there's something really deep and profound about our human lives that
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:03,968	| radiolab053014 |	The fact that we can do both of those things will be recognizing permanents but that we
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:04,992	| radiolab053014 |	Filoli
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:06,016	| radiolab053014 |	Attachments that
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:07,808	| radiolab053014 |	That seems to me to give our life at
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:09,344	| radiolab053014 |	It's very special texture
EDL	00:36:09,856	00:36:10,368	| radiolab053014 |	Wow
EDL	00:36:10,880	00:36:11,392	| radiolab053014 |	Exactly
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:13,696	| radiolab053014 |	I could just put that whole thing you just said in the
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:16,512	| radiolab053014 |	The frame like this Bow Down
EDL	00:36:17,024	00:36:19,584	| radiolab053014 |	People don't about you soon my friend because the next segment
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:21,888	| radiolab053014 |	It's going to
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:23,680	| radiolab053014 |	It's going to hurt
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:27,520	| radiolab053014 |	And it is at a more wind is blowing that's all I'll say
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:43,392	| radiolab053014 |	And I'm calling right before going to bed and Des Moines Iowa Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred p

EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:01,568	| radiolab053014 |	As it is day today
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:04,128	| radiolab053014 |	And then you just have these moments
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:13,856	| radiolab053014 |	Open it up and do something
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:16,416	| radiolab053014 |	Much more complex and Rich
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:17,440	| radiolab053014 |	Where is it
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:25,120	| radiolab053014 |	Hey I'm Jared Radiolab today
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:28,192	| radiolab053014 |	Things are next-door involves one thing
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:28,960	| radiolab053014 |	3 people
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:30,496	| radiolab053014 |	Craig on Craig Childs
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:31,264	| radiolab053014 |	Sweetest heart
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:34,336	| radiolab053014 |	I'm a writer and traveler from Western Colorado
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:39,712	| radiolab053014 |	Reagan I'm making toy I'm an artist and a mother and an educator
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:40,480	| radiolab053014 |	Know each other
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:42,016	| radiolab053014 |	Oh yeah we're married
EDL	00:37:43,552	00:37:44,576	| radiolab053014 |	And finally
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:52,000	| radiolab053014 |	Dirk Dirk Von I was a street cop in the mostly Denver Craigslist unlikely best buddy
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:56,608	| radiolab053014 |	Give me the booty Bandit school together I would have just beat the crap out of him in the playground you know
EDL	00:37:56,608	00:38:03,008	| radiolab053014 |	Yeah we drive each other mad but in the end we can we can still scramble around just fine hard of what joined us is
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:05,568	| radiolab053014 |	Is where we were in love with with wilderness
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:11,968	| radiolab053014 |	For years they would take these trips together out into the Wilderness of Colorado or Utah no Maps
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:14,528	| radiolab053014 |	No GPS Snow Trails
EDL	00:38:15,040	00:38:16,064	| radiolab053014 |	No campfires
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:22,208	| radiolab053014 |	Dirk and I would go off for weeks in the desert together I think the longest trip we took was a month
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:24,768	| radiolab053014 |	Just just wondering looking for routes
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:27,840	| radiolab053014 |	Add was on one of these trips that they made a discovery
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:30,400	| radiolab053014 |	I think it's fair to say still haunts them today
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:31,424	| radiolab053014 |	Recently
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:33,472	| radiolab053014 |	Almost killed one of our producers
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:42,176	| radiolab053014 |	So we've been out for a couple of days on this particular occasion the three of them are together and there a couple days into a hike
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:43,712	| radiolab053014 |	Yeah Utah
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:45,248	| radiolab053014 |	Pink desert
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:46,016	| radiolab053014 |	But Rocky
EDL	00:38:46,016	00:38:46,784	| radiolab053014 |	Slick Rock
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:48,320	| radiolab053014 |	Sandstone cliffs
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:49,088	| radiolab053014 |	Canyonlands
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:52,672	| radiolab053014 |	Tell her I can do all these canyons and then we actually we split up
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:59,072	| radiolab053014 |	Reagan said she wanted to set her own camp and so she stayed in one canyon and Dirk and I popped over into the next Canyon
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:39:00,608	| radiolab053014 |	Never really would you just
EDL	00:39:00,608	00:39:04,192	| radiolab053014 |	Send it to the normal thing or you guys fighting know it's normal
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:07,776	| radiolab053014 |	We weren't fighting at all it's one of the great things about being out together
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:12,640	| radiolab053014 |	That there's an he's with that soda separating is part of the deal and I think
EDL	00:39:12,640	00:39:13,920	| radiolab053014 |	Reagan was looking at
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:16,992	| radiolab053014 |	Derek and me and saying you guys are
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:23,904	| radiolab053014 |	Are going to go scrambling and get weird I'm going to stay over here I don't know if that was
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:29,024	| radiolab053014 |	What part of it was just that I was at least 5 months
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:35,424	| radiolab053014 |	Pregnant and I was just starting to have a really hard time tightening my backpack so that the weight wasn't all on my shoulders
EDL	00:39:35,424	00:39:38,496	| radiolab053014 |	And she says while she was hiking the pregnancy hormones work
EDL	00:39:38,496	00:39:41,312	| radiolab053014 |	Giving her bouts of vertigo it when it was just starting to hit early
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:43,616	| radiolab053014 |	Wow in a couple of months things going to be
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:46,432	| radiolab053014 |	So she needed some alone time
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:47,456	| radiolab053014 |	She said around camp
EDL	00:39:47,456	00:39:49,248	| radiolab053014 |	Durkin Craig meanwhile
EDL	00:39:49,248	00:39:52,064	| radiolab053014 |	Scale-up is Cliff face to get to the next Canyon over
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:53,600	| radiolab053014 |	And when we get to the
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:56,928	| radiolab053014 |	Very close to the top and there's a little flat area
EDL	00:39:56,928	00:39:58,976	| radiolab053014 |	Balcony of rock overlooking the
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:00,000	| radiolab053014 |	The canyon below
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:05,120	| radiolab053014 |	This little ledge so we said well okay let's just sit here have some lunch break out the pipe
EDL	00:40:05,120	00:40:06,400	| radiolab053014 |	That's exactly
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:08,960	| radiolab053014 |	So we sit down and and
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:17,920	| radiolab053014 |	And we literally both have like the first
EDL	00:40:18,688	00:40:19,968	| radiolab053014 |	Lungful
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:22,016	| radiolab053014 |	When Craig decides to take his backpack off
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:25,856	| radiolab053014 |	And he leans over and I notice I'm bending over
EDL	00:40:26,368	00:40:27,904	| radiolab053014 |	A round object
EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:30,208	| radiolab053014 |	Underneath the edge of a boulder
EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:33,792	| radiolab053014 |	Back under the Shadow and you said
EDL	00:40:34,304	00:40:34,816	| radiolab053014 |	Hey
EDL	00:40:36,096	00:40:41,984	| radiolab053014 |	There's a pot under the street
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:48,896	| radiolab053014 |	And then I I dropped to my knees and looked into this Shadow and there was this beautiful
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:50,688	| radiolab053014 |	Red
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:52,736	| radiolab053014 |	Jar low and flat
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:55,808	| radiolab053014 |	Covered Maybe 700-800
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:40:58,368	| radiolab053014 |	Maybe a thousand years of dust
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:41:00,416	| radiolab053014 |	Kind of skull the sea jar with Justice
EDL	00:41:00,416	00:41:02,976	| radiolab053014 |	Narrow mouth on the top and it had black paint
EDL	00:41:03,488	00:41:04,512	| radiolab053014 |	Design around the
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:05,536	| radiolab053014 |	Around the mouth
EDL	00:41:06,304	00:41:07,840	| radiolab053014 |	We're talking about
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:11,680	| radiolab053014 |	Early Pueblo people cliff dwellers
EDL	00:41:11,680	00:41:14,240	| radiolab053014 |	People who lived out in that desert 1000 years ago
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:17,312	| radiolab053014 |	And he looked closer he could see that this particular job
EDL	00:41:17,312	00:41:18,848	| radiolab053014 |	It had a crack down the front of it
EDL	00:41:19,616	00:41:23,456	| radiolab053014 |	And that two holes drilled around the crack and then a piece of
EDL	00:41:23,456	00:41:25,504	| radiolab053014 |	Yucca twine have been used
EDL	00:41:25,504	00:41:31,904	| radiolab053014 |	Hide holes together she was precious to somebody so they might have left it there maybe it was during migration thinking they
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:38,304	| radiolab053014 |	They would return it sometime maybe they were on the Run maybe someone was hiding it from other people you don't know who
EDL	00:41:38,304	00:41:39,584	| radiolab053014 |	It was if it was Mahler
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:41,888	| radiolab053014 |	Gmail or what Clan or
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:47,264	| radiolab053014 |	And any of those stories but you know it was a human being in the same position that you're in right there
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:53,151	| radiolab053014 |	Doing the same thing the same gesture
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:42:01,599	| radiolab053014 |	You can see the hand reaching out and placing the object
EDL	00:42:03,647	00:42:09,791	| radiolab053014 |	You can imagine the hands and the feet and the people in the sounds that they would make
EDL	00:42:12,863	00:42:15,167	| radiolab053014 |	They stared at it for about an hour not really saying much
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:17,471	| radiolab053014 |	Vincent latest hits dirt
EDL	00:42:19,775	00:42:26,175	| radiolab053014 |	Wait a second we got to move this thing somebody else was going to find this just felt like if we can just
EDL	00:42:26,175	00:42:32,575	| radiolab053014 |	Just kind of luck into it what's to stop some four-wheel drive in bipedal Pillager doing the same cuz it's a
EDL	00:42:32,575	00:42:38,975	| radiolab053014 |	Nexus route I don't know I felt sort of protective of it cuz you know we're all over the Southwest looting dicks
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:45,375	| radiolab053014 |	Sites in that jar will be worth a lot of money tunes of thousands of dollars at least
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:51,519	| radiolab053014 |	Hands on this end so I thought well let's hide it grab his leg
EDL	00:42:52,031	00:42:56,895	| radiolab053014 |	The moment we touch that jar is no longer is part of that story it's now part of our store
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:43:00,223	| radiolab053014 |	He's a purist we we do not move this thing
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:05,599	| radiolab053014 |	Not moving protected that's covered like I wanted to build a Corral of stone around it
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:09,439	| radiolab053014 |	Camouflage that's exactly what I be looking for in fact
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:10,975	| radiolab053014 |	I wouldn't notice the
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:13,023	| radiolab053014 |	The Siege are I'd notice the Rock
EDL	00:43:13,023	00:43:15,839	| radiolab053014 |	Can I use somebody's hiding something
EDL	00:43:15,839	00:43:18,399	| radiolab053014 |	Yeah right that's looking at me going
EDL	00:43:18,911	00:43:20,959	| radiolab053014 |	You and your Yoda crap
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:23,775	| radiolab053014 |	Damn and he says we could give this another
EDL	00:43:23,775	00:43:25,567	| radiolab053014 |	700 years of life
EDL	00:43:25,567	00:43:30,175	| radiolab053014 |	Helmeted been there probably a thousand years or so how do you resolve said you know will come back
EDL	00:43:30,175	00:43:31,199	| radiolab053014 |	Tomorrow we'll just
EDL	00:43:31,199	00:43:32,223	| radiolab053014 |	Leave it for now
EDL	00:43:32,735	00:43:34,527	| radiolab053014 |	How's the you left you left in a draw
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:37,087	| radiolab053014 |	We left in a draw and we actually
EDL	00:43:37,087	00:43:40,415	| radiolab053014 |	Hop back over the canyon to find Reagan
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:42,207	| radiolab053014 |	Badass samurai chick
EDL	00:43:42,719	00:43:44,255	| radiolab053014 |	I thought y all yeah I can
EDL	00:43:44,255	00:43:50,655	| radiolab053014 |	I'm be able to draft Reagan over to my side is it a hike back up in that ledge yelled out for her and the next day she
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:53,215	| radiolab053014 |	Icon over to where they were I remember
EDL	00:43:53,215	00:43:55,007	| radiolab053014 |	Her hitching up her pants
EDL	00:43:55,519	00:43:57,055	| radiolab053014 |	Pregnancy style and connect
EDL	00:43:57,055	00:44:00,639	| radiolab053014 |	Squatting down to get in there I was your first thought when you saw it
EDL	00:44:03,967	00:44:04,479	| radiolab053014 |	Focus
EDL	00:44:09,343	00:44:12,415	| radiolab053014 |	And just being right there completely consumed in that moment
EDL	00:44:12,415	00:44:18,815	| radiolab053014 |	And I think it went on for a long time cuz it was like so
EDL	00:44:18,815	00:44:23,167	| radiolab053014 |	The truth what we should do
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:29,567	| radiolab053014 |	Oh you guys argue back and forth for at least an hour and a half and I just ignored you for most of it cuz I was just looking at the siege art I wasn't
EDL	00:44:29,567	00:44:34,687	| radiolab053014 |	I'm really thinking to be in the position of arbiter but I just got fed up and like that's enough you guys leave it alone
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:37,247	| radiolab053014 |	It's part of an ongoing story like
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:39,039	| radiolab053014 |	Give it up leave it alone
EDL	00:44:39,807	00:44:44,159	| radiolab053014 |	And so so she take some pictures and we
EDL	00:44:45,695	00:44:46,463	| radiolab053014 |	And we walk away
EDL	00:44:51,071	00:44:52,863	| radiolab053014 |	And within a year of that moment
EDL	00:44:52,863	00:44:54,143	| radiolab053014 |	Everything just like
EDL	00:44:54,655	00:44:55,423	| radiolab053014 |	When twirling
EDL	00:44:56,191	00:44:57,471	| radiolab053014 |	Reagan and Craig had a baby
EDL	00:44:57,983	00:44:58,751	| radiolab053014 |	Craigslist
EDL	00:44:58,751	00:45:01,311	| radiolab053014 |	Become a writer who writes a book becomes a bestseller
EDL	00:45:01,311	00:45:05,407	| radiolab053014 |	I quit the business and got divorced and everything changed
EDL	00:45:08,991	00:45:10,271	| radiolab053014 |	But even on that day
EDL	00:45:11,039	00:45:11,807	| radiolab053014 |	They knew
EDL	00:45:11,807	00:45:17,951	| radiolab053014 |	With this will be the center of things we talked about for the rest of our lives than the seed jar yeah the day we found the sea jar
EDL	00:45:20,511	00:45:21,535	| radiolab053014 |	Do you think it's still there
EDL	00:45:22,559	00:45:23,583	| radiolab053014 |	I think it's still there
EDL	00:45:24,095	00:45:24,863	| radiolab053014 |	I think it is
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:30,495	| radiolab053014 |	The routes pretty complicated with that particular location
EDL	00:45:30,495	00:45:32,031	| radiolab053014 |	I'd say 50/50
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:33,567	| radiolab053014 |	Tops
EDL	00:45:38,943	00:45:40,223	| radiolab053014 |	Again if only
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:42,783	| radiolab053014 |	That were the end of the
EDL	00:45:47,647	00:45:52,511	| radiolab053014 |	We could have done the saying where you're just like Oh The Narrative power of objects meta blah blah
EDL	00:45:53,791	00:45:55,583	| radiolab053014 |	It is a damn thing there
EDL	00:45:56,095	00:45:57,375	| radiolab053014 |	Where did someone take it
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:46:02,751	| radiolab053014 |	We got so curious about this so we convinced Craig Reagan and Dirk to go back now they're here
EDL	00:46:03,263	00:46:07,103	| radiolab053014 |	Check we sent our producer Molly Webster along for the ride
EDL	00:46:08,127	00:46:14,527	| radiolab053014 |	Happy campers just arrived I didn't realize when they were like give me
EDL	00:46:14,527	00:46:20,927	| radiolab053014 |	Each other hug the first night of camp and I was there with my recorder but like
EDL	00:46:20,927	00:46:24,511	| radiolab053014 |	Actually like a big moment I guess this is a reason you're tripping
EDL	00:46:24,511	00:46:30,911	| radiolab053014 |	Reagan had said that one of the last times now that people have kids and family one of the last times we were together
EDL	00:46:30,911	00:46:34,239	| radiolab053014 |	What's besieger
EDL	00:46:36,287	00:46:41,919	| radiolab053014 |	Yay we still have a pretty clear and today we're really really really excited to like be together
EDL	00:46:41,919	00:46:44,991	| radiolab053014 |	How long ago was it when they found the thing
EDL	00:46:44,991	00:46:47,551	| radiolab053014 |	This was 11 years ago the kids were
EDL	00:46:48,063	00:46:53,183	| radiolab053014 |	Reagan was 5 months pregnant and the kids she was pregnant with his Jasper
EDL	00:46:53,695	00:46:58,047	| radiolab053014 |	Come say hi had his 11th birthday
EDL	00:46:58,047	00:47:00,095	| radiolab053014 |	Close the door and come say hi
EDL	00:47:00,607	00:47:02,143	| radiolab053014 |	Hi Humana Molly
EDL	00:47:02,655	00:47:04,447	| radiolab053014 |	Dirk
EDL	00:47:04,959	00:47:09,823	| radiolab053014 |	There could never met their kids but the last time you said Jasper Jasper was a baby
EDL	00:47:09,823	00:47:12,383	| radiolab053014 |	The other thing is
EDL	00:47:12,895	00:47:14,175	| radiolab053014 |	I'm just going to say
EDL	00:47:14,175	00:47:17,247	| radiolab053014 |	Craig and Dirk are like
EDL	00:47:17,247	00:47:20,319	| radiolab053014 |	Brothers from another mother
EDL	00:47:20,831	00:47:24,927	| radiolab053014 |	Like they are like the bestest bromance
EDL	00:47:24,927	00:47:27,999	| radiolab053014 |	They love each other
EDL	00:47:27,999	00:47:28,767	| radiolab053014 |	So much
EDL	00:47:28,767	00:47:30,303	| radiolab053014 |	Send me to eat so we
EDL	00:47:30,303	00:47:32,351	| radiolab053014 |	Get there we like drop our bags we go to sleep
EDL	00:47:33,119	00:47:34,655	| radiolab053014 |	And I
EDL	00:47:34,655	00:47:39,519	| radiolab053014 |	Woke up four-wheel drove for dries I don't have to know how to cook
EDL	00:47:39,519	00:47:45,663	| radiolab053014 |	Out into the maysa park the cars and then we hiked a mile and a half to the edge of the Mesa
EDL	00:47:47,199	00:47:53,599	| radiolab053014 |	Basically the entire landscape felt like they had just put me in a bonanza set
EDL	00:47:53,599	00:47:56,159	| radiolab053014 |	Gnarled wharfie trees
EDL	00:47:56,159	00:47:58,207	| radiolab053014 |	Red red Sandy
EDL	00:47:58,207	00:47:59,231	| radiolab053014 |	Sandstone
EDL	00:47:59,231	00:48:04,351	| radiolab053014 |	They're you're on this Mesa and then it falls off into this Canyon and then there's like another Mesa
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:10,751	| radiolab053014 |	And then that falls off into a canyon there's another Mason than that and it's just this like unending landscape
EDL	00:48:10,751	00:48:12,287	| radiolab053014 |	We're floating up here now
EDL	00:48:12,287	00:48:13,823	| radiolab053014 |	Yeah
EDL	00:48:13,823	00:48:20,223	| radiolab053014 |	And their s*** is it just like
EDL	00:48:20,223	00:48:26,623	| radiolab053014 |	There's no sound card has no sounds no nothing
EDL	00:48:26,623	00:48:33,023	| radiolab053014 |	Internet
EDL	00:48:33,023	00:48:39,423	| radiolab053014 |	Off the top and across we went back to get Rig and basically our objective
EDL	00:48:39,423	00:48:45,823	| radiolab053014 |	Was to go somewhere into this like Canyonlands
EDL	00:48:45,823	00:48:48,895	| radiolab053014 |	And somehow find a a tiny little seed jar
EDL	00:48:48,895	00:48:55,295	| radiolab053014 |	We're to go back because I like to think of it like this is going to change things if it's if it's not there
EDL	00:48:55,295	00:49:01,695	| radiolab053014 |	I'm going to be so mad I like to be out in the world and just think about it to go okay there's there's a
EDL	00:49:01,695	00:49:08,095	| radiolab053014 |	Message are sitting there on her Boulder right now and I will be there for the longest time and it's just quiet
EDL	00:49:08,095	00:49:14,495	| radiolab053014 |	And I can imagine that the wind going around it and and some more sand
EDL	00:49:14,495	00:49:17,567	| radiolab053014 |	Building up and and it's just this really nice thought of
EDL	00:49:18,079	00:49:24,223	| radiolab053014 |	Isolation in perpetuity
EDL	00:49:27,039	00:49:28,831	| radiolab053014 |	I kind of want to hear it Echo
EDL	00:49:29,343	00:49:32,415	| radiolab053014 |	So we set up camp on the edge of a Mesa
EDL	00:49:32,927	00:49:33,951	| radiolab053014 |	And then
EDL	00:49:33,951	00:49:34,719	| radiolab053014 |	We all went to sleep
EDL	00:49:35,231	00:49:37,279	| radiolab053014 |	What's a futon
EDL	00:49:37,791	00:49:43,935	| radiolab053014 |	Eric Craig apparently has a flute in his bag boy
EDL	00:49:44,959	00:49:51,103	| radiolab053014 |	Cinnamon sweet so we we wake up like first lies today the day guys
EDL	00:49:51,103	00:49:57,503	| radiolab053014 |	Today's the day we go find out if if the egg is still there in the nest
EDL	00:49:57,503	00:50:03,903	| radiolab053014 |	A game to go down this 800 foot descent
EDL	00:50:03,903	00:50:07,743	| radiolab053014 |	No femurs are broken
EDL	00:50:07,743	00:50:11,071	| radiolab053014 |	The Anasazi were some tough
EDL	00:50:11,583	00:50:12,607	| radiolab053014 |	People
EDL	00:50:12,607	00:50:19,007	| radiolab053014 |	Big wind around this Canyon Drew saddle
EDL	00:50:19,007	00:50:20,031	| radiolab053014 |	Another Canyon
EDL	00:50:22,847	00:50:29,247	| radiolab053014 |	How long is the psych take to get out there and probably took six maybe seven hours
EDL	00:50:29,247	00:50:35,647	| radiolab053014 |	We're going pretty slow the kids were amazing but also slow
EDL	00:50:35,647	00:50:42,047	| radiolab053014 |	It was starting to like this turn to bug Dirk I think it's the way to say it
EDL	00:50:42,047	00:50:44,095	| radiolab053014 |	Really hot
EDL	00:50:44,607	00:50:47,423	| radiolab053014 |	Sun straight overhead oven going
EDL	00:50:47,423	00:50:48,191	| radiolab053014 |	Park the kids
EDL	00:50:48,703	00:50:49,471	| radiolab053014 |	Somewhere
EDL	00:50:50,495	00:50:52,287	| radiolab053014 |	Sure enough at the end of the 6 hour hike
EDL	00:50:52,287	00:50:54,335	| radiolab053014 |	Leave your pack for the big guy
EDL	00:50:54,335	00:50:55,359	| radiolab053014 |	Extra water and
EDL	00:50:55,359	00:50:57,407	| radiolab053014 |	The kids need to break
EDL	00:50:57,407	00:51:02,015	| radiolab053014 |	And so assertive believe them in an Alcove on the side of the canyon
EDL	00:51:02,015	00:51:04,063	| radiolab053014 |	Mobile scramble
EDL	00:51:05,343	00:51:06,623	| radiolab053014 |	Play I brought my book
EDL	00:51:07,391	00:51:08,415	| radiolab053014 |	Okay bye guys
EDL	00:51:09,695	00:51:15,839	| radiolab053014 |	In Reagan's boys you have your emergency whistles remember 3 times but no joking
EDL	00:51:16,351	00:51:17,375	| radiolab053014 |	Final ascent
EDL	00:51:18,143	00:51:22,495	| radiolab053014 |	You know we went up that Anglewood up that diagonal there I remember it really
EDL	00:51:22,495	00:51:28,127	| radiolab053014 |	Really clearly I'm all behind you so there's this we were slammed up against his canyonwall we needed to get over it
EDL	00:51:28,639	00:51:31,199	| radiolab053014 |	And the only way to do that was that there was
EDL	00:51:31,199	00:51:34,527	| radiolab053014 |	Boulder sort of out in front of the canyon wall and it created this
EDL	00:51:34,527	00:51:38,879	| radiolab053014 |	Skinny Little Chute and we had a wedge ourselves into the Chute and like
EDL	00:51:39,391	00:51:43,487	| radiolab053014 |	Go off at 60 ft
EDL	00:51:47,839	00:51:50,143	| radiolab053014 |	I'd like to get off

EDL	00:53:22,047	00:53:22,559	| radiolab053014 |	This is it
EDL	00:53:25,375	00:53:27,167	| radiolab053014 |	11 years
EDL	00:53:27,167	00:53:28,959	| radiolab053014 |	Yeah but I just I know this is
EDL	00:53:29,471	00:53:30,751	| radiolab053014 |	I know it
EDL	00:53:33,055	00:53:34,335	| radiolab053014 |	Don't seed
EDL	00:53:34,335	00:53:35,103	| radiolab053014 |	Spot
EDL	00:53:38,687	00:53:41,503	| radiolab053014 |	Are like just going like really confused

EDL	00:53:52,767	00:53:57,631	| radiolab053014 |	And it all like looks the same but everything looks the same to an untrained eye right
EDL	00:53:57,631	00:54:03,519	| radiolab053014 |	It's like where's Waldo land and we're trying to find
EDL	00:54:03,519	00:54:05,055	| radiolab053014 |	His thoughts
EDL	00:54:05,567	00:54:07,359	| radiolab053014 |	I finally see Craig kind of
EDL	00:54:07,871	00:54:09,919	| radiolab053014 |	Bar off down the canyon standing by himself
EDL	00:54:10,687	00:54:11,967	| radiolab053014 |	Just staring at the ground
EDL	00:54:12,991	00:54:15,295	| radiolab053014 |	Okay like okay
EDL	00:54:15,295	00:54:16,063	| radiolab053014 |	Any luck

EDL	00:54:17,087	00:54:18,111	| radiolab053014 |	Look at what would be
EDL	00:54:18,111	00:54:19,391	| radiolab053014 |	Has been are likely rata
EDL	00:54:19,391	00:54:19,903	| radiolab053014 |	Yeah
EDL	00:54:21,183	00:54:25,791	| radiolab053014 |	Which is right up through here and he points to the ground like right where we're standing
EDL	00:54:25,791	00:54:26,559	| radiolab053014 |	And he says
EDL	00:54:26,559	00:54:28,351	| radiolab053014 |	I think it's like right
EDL	00:54:28,351	00:54:29,119	| radiolab053014 |	Here
EDL	00:54:29,119	00:54:30,399	| radiolab053014 |	I think like this
EDL	00:54:31,167	00:54:32,191	| radiolab053014 |	Was the place
EDL	00:54:34,751	00:54:36,543	| radiolab053014 |	I don't want to think about this
EDL	00:54:36,543	00:54:37,823	| radiolab053014 |	Particular possibility
EDL	00:54:37,823	00:54:39,871	| radiolab053014 |	See all that stuff I just walked across
EDL	00:54:40,639	00:54:41,407	| radiolab053014 |	Yeah
EDL	00:54:41,407	00:54:42,687	| radiolab053014 |	That's all fresh
EDL	00:54:43,711	00:54:44,223	| radiolab053014 |	Oh series
EDL	00:54:44,735	00:54:45,503	| radiolab053014 |	Yeah
EDL	00:54:46,271	00:54:47,039	| radiolab053014 |	Play words that mean fresh
EDL	00:54:47,551	00:54:51,135	| radiolab053014 |	What we were standing on this pile really sharp
EDL	00:54:51,135	00:54:54,207	| radiolab053014 |	Rock it was just all of these Scharf
EDL	00:54:54,207	00:54:54,975	| radiolab053014 |	Little
EDL	00:54:54,975	00:54:55,999	| radiolab053014 |	Dragon knives
EDL	00:54:55,999	00:54:59,583	| radiolab053014 |	I'm not sure didn't look like any of the other areas we had been in
EDL	00:55:01,375	00:55:02,399	| radiolab053014 |	It's
EDL	00:55:02,399	00:55:03,167	| radiolab053014 |	Possible at the
EDL	00:55:04,191	00:55:05,215	| radiolab053014 |	Cliff has fallen here
EDL	00:55:06,495	00:55:07,775	| radiolab053014 |	And covered everything
EDL	00:55:09,823	00:55:10,335	| radiolab053014 |	Top of that
EDL	00:55:11,615	00:55:13,663	| radiolab053014 |	Cliff if you looked above us
EDL	00:55:13,663	00:55:18,783	| radiolab053014 |	To the top of the cliff was like so many to take in a meat cleaver to it was just like sliced off
EDL	00:55:18,783	00:55:19,551	| radiolab053014 |	Whole thing
EDL	00:55:19,551	00:55:20,063	| radiolab053014 |	Brokaw
EDL	00:55:21,343	00:55:24,415	| radiolab053014 |	The entire Cliff face had fallen off
EDL	00:55:25,695	00:55:27,999	| radiolab053014 |	And annihilated
EDL	00:55:27,999	00:55:33,375	| radiolab053014 |	Everything hundreds of feet in either direction it's been totally destroyed
EDL	00:55:34,143	00:55:36,191	| radiolab053014 |	Yeah I mean they wouldn't survive
EDL	00:55:36,959	00:55:40,799	| radiolab053014 |	Even the giant boulder protecting it has been wiped
EDL	00:55:40,799	00:55:41,311	| radiolab053014 |	Clean
EDL	00:55:43,359	00:55:45,407	| radiolab053014 |	It reminded me of like an iceberg
EDL	00:55:45,407	00:55:46,431	| radiolab053014 |	Uncapping
EDL	00:55:46,431	00:55:52,831	| radiolab053014 |	You see all those videos of like the front of the iceberg just all the sudden Cleaves off that's exactly what happened on this clue
EDL	00:55:52,831	00:55:57,439	| radiolab053014 |	That's all you're talking like 10,000 tons of rock falling here
EDL	00:55:57,951	00:55:58,463	| radiolab053014 |	Just
EDL	00:56:06,143	00:56:06,655	| radiolab053014 |	Yeah
EDL	00:56:09,983	00:56:10,751	| radiolab053014 |	I mean
EDL	00:56:14,847	00:56:16,127	| radiolab053014 |	That's not what I was thinking
EDL	00:56:16,895	00:56:17,407	| radiolab053014 |	Responsibility
EDL	00:56:24,831	00:56:25,855	| radiolab053014 |	I'm not swallowing it
EDL	00:56:25,855	00:56:26,367	| radiolab053014 |	Just yet
EDL	00:56:27,135	00:56:31,743	| radiolab053014 |	She calls and Reagan come toward us and then dirt comes wandering over
EDL	00:56:32,511	00:56:34,303	| radiolab053014 |	It does kind of make sense I guess
EDL	00:56:36,607	00:56:39,167	| radiolab053014 |	Pots been here for 700 years it does
EDL	00:56:39,167	00:56:40,703	| radiolab053014 |	Make sense at all
EDL	00:56:45,567	00:56:46,847	| radiolab053014 |	It's not looking right
EDL	00:56:47,359	00:56:49,151	| radiolab053014 |	I can hear it was right
EDL	00:56:49,151	00:56:51,199	| radiolab053014 |	I know it was here
EDL	00:56:51,711	00:56:52,479	| radiolab053014 |	No
EDL	00:56:52,991	00:56:54,271	| radiolab053014 |	No no no
EDL	00:56:55,551	00:56:56,063	| radiolab053014 |	My God
EDL	00:57:00,159	00:57:02,207	| radiolab053014 |	Craig's like leaning against the wall
EDL	00:57:03,487	00:57:06,047	| radiolab053014 |	Dirk was like wow man I guess
EDL	00:57:07,583	00:57:08,351	| radiolab053014 |	This must be it
EDL	00:57:10,399	00:57:11,935	| radiolab053014 |	And it was this real like
EDL	00:57:12,703	00:57:15,263	| radiolab053014 |	They were grappling with something and it was like
EDL	00:57:15,263	00:57:17,567	| radiolab053014 |	Trying to figure out like what they were grappling with
EDL	00:57:18,079	00:57:23,967	| radiolab053014 |	And cried just kept talking to me like not actually about The Siege our bit about the place this is where
EDL	00:57:24,479	00:57:25,503	| radiolab053014 |	I remember
EDL	00:57:25,503	00:57:27,295	| radiolab053014 |	Reagan hoisting up her pants
EDL	00:57:28,319	00:57:28,831	| radiolab053014 |	Pregnant
EDL	00:57:29,343	00:57:30,367	| radiolab053014 |	Squatting
EDL	00:57:31,135	00:57:33,439	| radiolab053014 |	And Derek and Me On Our Knees
EDL	00:57:34,207	00:57:35,487	| radiolab053014 |	Looking in on this thing for
EDL	00:57:35,487	00:57:36,767	| radiolab053014 |	For the longest time
EDL	00:57:36,767	00:57:39,327	| radiolab053014 |	You know it was very clear in my mind
EDL	00:57:42,399	00:57:44,703	| radiolab053014 |	The have the place itself gone
EDL	00:57:45,727	00:57:47,263	| radiolab053014 |	It's a damn fine
EDL	00:57:47,263	00:57:49,567	| radiolab053014 |	It's beautiful it's wonderful but but Jesus
EDL	00:57:49,567	00:57:52,639	| radiolab053014 |	This is a different kind of sadness and I wasn't quite though

EDL	00:57:55,967	00:57:56,479	| radiolab053014 |	Yeah
