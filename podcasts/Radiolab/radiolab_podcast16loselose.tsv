EDL	00:01:29,856	00:01:33,184	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	And his record-setting quest in the hundred would be huge
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:37,536	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Brewery
EDL	00:01:38,816	00:01:39,328	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	But

EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:04,416	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	This somewhat obscure Sport and it morphed it into this Bizzaro thotics
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:05,696	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	About
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:07,232	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Competition
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:08,512	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Integrity and
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:11,072	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	What it means to win quotes
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:12,352	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Mostly
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:13,376	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	I think that
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:14,656	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Although to be fair
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:15,424	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Mike
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:17,216	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	He jumped on the story for
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:23,616	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Very personal recent as a New Yorker I say a lot of words and their mispronouncing the NPR audience
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:27,200	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Jump on them but I always can say the n in badminton and get a lot of
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:33,088	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Claudette so I'm attracted to badminton badminton
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:35,392	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Into some
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:39,744	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Hand wear at wintertime chastising a playful cat
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:43,328	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	And then also
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:46,656	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	You know you probably think of badminton as this
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,424	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Backyard
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:48,704	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Fun
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:49,984	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Silly games but
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:54,848	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	According to Mike no this is anything but
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:58,432	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	It has nothing to do with the badminton you play in your backyard
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:03:03,296	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	It's much faster than you think it would possibly look
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:08,160	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Flying all over the court stretching reaches diving
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:11,232	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	On a scale of the competitors is you know
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:17,632	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Readily apparent
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:22,496	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	And perhaps not as impressive a thing as a tennis ball but it looks a lot like tennis
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:23,264	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	And there's a lot of
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:25,824	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Tension
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:29,408	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Severe pressure and there's a lot of grunting
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:35,552	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	I need totally seems like every bit of our legitimate and highly-skilled
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:36,064	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Sports
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:41,184	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Okay so

EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:06,784	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	It is not a metal round it's in the group place
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:07,552	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Staged
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:09,088	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	The huge crowd are like the
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:10,112	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Place is packed

EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:29,823	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	And what's
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:31,615	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Task if I had here
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:36,479	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Alright so here we go game on this is the first sir
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:39,807	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Rampant Korean serve
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:41,599	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	So the Korean player
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:43,135	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Flicks her wrist
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:45,695	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	DeFalco's over the net
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:47,999	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	China returns
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:50,303	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Right into the net that was the whole thing
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:53,375	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Cuz I was just
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:53,887	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Second serve
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:58,239	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Chinese return
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:04,127	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	So that service is turned over now the Chinese are so
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:07,967	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	China Korea China
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:16,671	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	What does not exactly single and I've got to tell you
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:17,183	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	This next
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:21,023	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	The Korean player serves it
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:21,791	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Yeah
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:26,655	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	It's sales over the net and then it goes goes goes goes goes and the
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:28,447	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Chinese player
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:30,495	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Clearly he's right there he has it
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:33,055	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	She then whines up justice
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:38,431	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	White big like you could see it's like she has this deep ingrained muscle memory from years of doing it
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:40,991	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	She wants up she's about to hit it and then she stopped
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:44,063	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	And the shocks
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:45,599	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Trunks under the floor
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:46,623	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Inbounds
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:47,647	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Queen Taqueria
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:48,671	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	And then
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:49,183	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Tellingly
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:50,207	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	She looks
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:52,511	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Back corner of the
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:53,535	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	The court where coach
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:56,095	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	They both are
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:57,887	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	This is a fix
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,423	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Spell fixing this
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:00,447	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Like this is
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:05,311	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	But different plenty of occasions were one side wants to lose and then hard to lose
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:10,175	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Any more important thing is it ain't hard to get away with it usually you wouldn't even
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:10,943	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Notice
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:13,503	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	You know it's a difference between a couple serves
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:17,087	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	I over the line a couple balls into the net
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:20,671	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	In this case as the match goes on you start to realize
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:27,327	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Seemed to be trying to lose to
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:35,775	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Well it's actually a strategy
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:39,871	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Because the wizard tournament is laid out both these teams
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:41,919	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Are going to be moving on to the metal ramp
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:43,199	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	But
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:44,479	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Whoever wins
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:50,879	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	This game is going to have to play another Chinese team a really strong team icing
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:55,999	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	And whoever loses is going to play a way easier Danish.
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:57,023	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	So boots
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:57,791	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Teams
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:06:59,071	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Are hoping
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:06:59,839	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Toulouse
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:02,399	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Yeah and it is the rare instance
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:03,679	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Where you at Boost
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:05,983	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Sides incentivised to lose
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:09,823	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	That you get something that should be scored by Spike Jones
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:12,383	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	A little bit of a prisoner's dilemma right
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:15,711	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	At either side could lose but when both want to lose it because this
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:18,271	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Surreal waiting game
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:20,063	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Right now who's going to crack first
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:22,623	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	And squirrel point and so
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:25,951	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	You got the best players in the world
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:32,095	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Start hitting the shuttlecock out of bounds that's on purpose
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:39,519	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Hitting the shuttlecock into the net
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:50,783	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	They're hitting it straight into the ground all by tripping over their own shoelaces purposefully until what you get
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:55,903	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Is up all into the net
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:08:02,303	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Durable badminton and it just devolves into this absurd repetitive
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:04,863	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Crazy making
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:05,631	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Louis Vuitton
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:08,959	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Is not sleeping spice
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:11,007	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	So obvious
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:12,287	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	I mean this
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:13,311	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Not this
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:17,407	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Is not sport this is kind of a sport because
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:18,943	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	And this is why I really love it
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:23,807	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	At a certain point these two teams have to start competing with each other
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:25,087	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Toulouse
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:27,135	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Let me play you this point
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:28,415	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Tilt
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:33,023	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	China serves at Korea it back but it's going way out of bounds
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:38,655	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Now in a normal World China would obviously let that fall so that they can take a point but they lunge
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:40,191	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Save it
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:41,727	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Right there getting it back
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:48,127	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	North Korea then they are like no no you know what we're pretty sure we wanted in the opposite direction
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:49,919	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Even further out of bounds
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:56,319	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Tenille Traina goes to save it once again but they don't get there in time so the point goes to China which China actual

EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:37,791	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Chosen that they were
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:38,815	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Not playing seriously
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:45,471	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	And they will making a very serious mistake and that they played stupid and set now who playing with Ryan

EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:27,711	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	We're trying to lose at least During certain moments in the game
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:33,343	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	But when the crowd started to do
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:37,695	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Her partner Kim ha-na said that's how a surprise in

EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:40,063	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	But then as the points kept coming you started to notice like they were playing very slowly.
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:46,463	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	They were not getting the poor very hot
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:48,511	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Shelby said that booth

EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:59,007	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	How to say is exactly what it looks like when you watch it
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:00,287	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	It's for the rest of the match
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:03,615	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	You get a bunch of these points were like we're just built

EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:29,471	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Because it's like we've entered a whole third iteration of this game where it's like they're not just trying to lose
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:30,495	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	They're trying to
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:34,847	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Cover up that you're trying to lose but you're kind of look like you're trying to win
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:40,991	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	I don't think you're seeing anybody here
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:45,855	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	So finally after 20 long minutes
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:46,879	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Of this

EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:32,511	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Basically I want to hear about this
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:35,071	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Times when a kid you know did something
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:37,119	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	It just means you lean back and say
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:38,143	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Well
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:41,215	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Maybe it was the moment that I
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:44,287	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Kids started reading back
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:45,055	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Do you
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:47,359	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:48,895	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:54,783	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Or maybe the kids in math class you notice their writing used
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:56,063	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Stick in the margin of their geometry
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:58,879	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	We're interested in the
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:02,207	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Epic moments where a kid does something super smart
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:03,999	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	It doesn't have anything to do with it
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:05,791	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	If you have a story

EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:40,095	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Korean and Chinese women's badminton team had just been disqualified
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:41,375	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Kicked out of the Olympics
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:43,423	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	So what so then what happened to the
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:46,751	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Play The Players like root what happened to all four of them did
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:49,311	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Keep playing badminton professionally after this
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:53,663	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Jung kyung Hoon from Korea even went on to win the bronze in Rio
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:55,199	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	But at the time this
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:56,223	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Was a
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:57,759	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Brutal punishment
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:58,783	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	For all of them
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:00,575	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Well but you know later
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:03,135	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	They did something wrong just wasn't right
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:06,463	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	You know I don't even I question whether it's
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:07,231	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Even on acid
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:09,023	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	I think it's ethical
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:10,047	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	It away what they did
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:13,631	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	How so
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:18,495	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Is the definition of ethics in Sports 2
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:19,519	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Twin Shore
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:20,543	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Without using yes
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:23,871	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Does that mean to win every
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:24,639	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Point
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:31,039	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	No not necessarily you know in baseball there's a thing called the intentional water in football
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:33,087	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Call a team will take a safety
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:33,855	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Instead of
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:36,415	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Pumping and letting the other team score a touchdown
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:38,463	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	What is a calculation where
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:39,231	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Appoint
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:43,071	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Cure there is not as important as the whole in the whole is the game
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:46,399	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Pan out a little more
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:50,751	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	I think an individual game is off and we're not going to put our good starter here
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:52,543	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	We're going to manage the lineup
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:55,103	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	50 goal is to win the championship
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:57,663	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Anything to remember about these players is
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:59,455	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	If what we want
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:00,735	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Is players who are
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:03,551	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Hypercompetitive them actually want to win at all costs
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:05,855	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	That's exactly why they were losing so badly
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:10,463	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Because they wanted to win the overall championship at all cost
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:17,119	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	At the badminton Federation had a set of rules that open guarantee that this would happen
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:19,167	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Stupid to have an event
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:21,727	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	What people are trying to lose to get that event is a sporting event
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:24,031	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	It's a especially at the Apex
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:31,967	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Near the only time people care about Badness it seems really Chuck Klosterman we called him in
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:35,039	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Because he writes a lot about sports and also because
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:38,111	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	He wrote the ethicist column for the New York Times magazine
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:40,159	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	No is this a
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:42,463	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Some kind of tragedy well it's not
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:46,559	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	I guess unless badminton is really important to you than it probably is
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:47,839	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	In this case I think
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:50,143	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	The thing that people got really upset about is this
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:53,727	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Is this idea of the Olympic ideal
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:58,079	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Athletes
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:04,735	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Gloria the song
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:07,807	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	To transcend the it in the way that Isaac
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:13,183	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Super Bass what you're sending your Humanity but then also as like this representative of your country and
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:15,487	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	I think it did poke a lot of
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:17,791	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	People like a lot of people did seemingly get
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:19,839	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Kind of upset about
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:20,863	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Yeah I mean
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:22,655	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	For some reason it is disturbing to
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:23,423	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	To see
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:24,447	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Athens Family camper
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:26,495	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Adjusted
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:27,519	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	It seems to
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:29,055	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Kind of like
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:30,335	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Happened some
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:32,383	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Like I somehow
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:36,223	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Yes
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:38,015	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Like like like I don't know if
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:42,623	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Not trying in a sporting event is moral question but it feels that way when you see it happen
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:49,023	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Chicken what do you think about sports is that we watch these adults
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:50,559	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Playing multimillion-dollar games
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:52,863	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Same games that
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:54,143	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	With a 6 year old and 7 year old place
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:56,191	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	So when you have a 7 year old kid
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:57,471	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	You would say
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:21:00,031	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	It doesn't matter if you win or lose doesn't matter what happens
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:01,055	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Just play hard
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:02,591	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	You don't have to succeed
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:03,871	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	It's the trying that matters
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:06,943	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	So when you see people at the highest level not trying
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:09,247	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	There's it's almost
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:10,015	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	It's sort of
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:16,159	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Rex the entire idea of why we play sports at all you know why if you're at a playground in two kids racing
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:19,488	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	The playground to see who can get to the swing faster whatever like
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:23,328	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Biological thing maybe we are biologically driven to compete
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:28,448	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	So that's the Baseline expectation of what we have of these badminton players that they will try to compete
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:32,800	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	But it seems to me there's an opportunity here for True athleticism in a kind of
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:37,664	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Topsy Turvy website and reverse it and see if you can do that as well as you do the other one
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:38,688	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	I mean
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:42,784	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Sports only work one way though they don't work both ways
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:46,880	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	I mean it would be it would be like going to your wife
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:49,184	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	I'm saying like Okay you say you really love me
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:50,720	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Prove it
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:57,120	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	By hating me in a creative way
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:21:57,632	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Piano
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:22:00,448	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Bang your fist against the keys
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:03,008	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	In a way that I will be
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:08,640	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	You know I will be sickened by matters of the heart put it back on the field
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:10,944	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	What would be the most radical
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:11,968	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Solution that you could be mad
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:14,272	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	If your desire was
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:17,600	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Vincent Lee and astonishingly athletically
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:23,744	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	I suppose if they were both trying to do it in the most convincing way it would be
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:30,912	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	That was not really the case here they never confronted how do you lose on purpose if the other side's all
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,448	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Also trying to lose on purpose
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:38,592	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	I'm trying to think there are some sports oh in football licey in American football with they both sides one
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:46,016	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	You can't make the other team score but you can score a safety on yourself
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:50,112	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Do the quarterback would get the ball and start running towards his own end zone
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:51,904	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	And then there be a jailbreak
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:56,768	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	By the defense to tackle the quarterback
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:58,304	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	You could hit the batter
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:23:04,448	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	That would be that would be an interesting game what about darts better aiming at the dartboard to turn around Amy at europol
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:15,968	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Think about the implications
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:21,600	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Will Ferrell movie I guess that's what I've been thinking
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:24,416	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	This is what we need you got to go out there a little
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:25,184	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Other team
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:42,080	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	You can hear more of Mike Pesca on his podcast
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:43,872	| radiolab_podcast16loselose |	Just more of Chuck Klosterman
