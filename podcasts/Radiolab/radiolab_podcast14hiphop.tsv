EDL	00:01:20,640	00:01:21,408	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	The category
EDL	00:01:21,408	00:01:23,968	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	That's what it's about who we talkin about this though
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:27,296	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Well because I've been wanting to explore this in story form
EDL	00:01:27,296	00:01:28,576	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Forever
EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:32,416	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Could you never have a story so that's like a you never find a store but I got one now

EDL	00:01:34,976	00:01:41,376	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	About this
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:43,168	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	What is the weather
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:44,192	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Let me explain
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:51,872	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	So I met this guy Andrew Marantz I work at the New Yorker as an editor and I
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:52,896	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Right Stuff
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:59,296	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Occasionally 100 in here one day by mistake I think Super interesting guy Gregory Porter and he end up talking with us
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:01,344	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	About this story was reporting for the New Yorker
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:03,136	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	But they're all
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:03,648	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Kinds of rappers
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:06,976	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	And how hip-hop might be changing
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:09,792	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	As we all know this was a genre of music that began
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:11,328	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Really specific time and place
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:12,608	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Bronx
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:14,400	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	70s black and Latino kids
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:16,960	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	But it's since expanded
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:17,728	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	So much
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:20,288	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	It is inevitable questions pop
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:22,592	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	You know what to really simplify it
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:24,128	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	The more white people come to the party
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:25,408	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	The
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:28,736	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	More you kind of start going okay at what point is it
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:33,344	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	It's clearly a it can clearly it's really okay if everyone in the room is black
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:38,208	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	And it's okay if everyone is black except for one guy you know if ya if Rick rubin's at the party
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:40,000	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	But it's still
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:41,280	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	You know black people at the tunnel
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:44,352	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	In 1989 or whatever it's still okay
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:45,888	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	But
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:49,984	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	At what point okay with its 50% white if it's 75% wife
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:52,800	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	If all the people who own the record labels are white if
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:56,384	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	A majority of the popular rappers are white like at what point
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:03:02,784	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Yeah then there's also that sonically the way it sounds there's the way the production is going to merge with other forms of music
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:04,320	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	So then all the sudden you're at a point where
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:07,392	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	You get the sense that there's somehow inherently
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:10,464	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	That there's something being replaced
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:13,024	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	We're taking over you start to have this
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:13,792	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Dilemma
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:14,560	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Which is
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:16,864	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	You know who owns the music now and
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:19,168	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	The Dilemma is obviously heightened by the fact that
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:21,216	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Everyone knew this was coming
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:24,288	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Like if there's never been a form of American popular music
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:28,384	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	As far as I know that wasn't invented by black people and co-opted by white people
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:30,688	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	And Andrew in his peace
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:33,760	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	I need the story of focuses on a guy who sits right
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:35,040	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Part of that
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:38,624	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	One of the most influential DJs in hip-hop today
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:40,416	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Peter Rosenberg
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:43,232	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	So tell me tell me how you came to him I mean the first
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:43,744	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Thing was
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:46,816	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Torn hip hop radio station
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:48,352	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Listening to
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,144	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	That part 97
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:52,704	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Because I
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:54,240	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Like crap and I want to know
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:56,032	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	What is popular
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:57,312	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	And I was
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:04:01,920	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Listening and I heard this guy who they kept calling Rosenberg
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:05,760	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	And I was like is that Rosenberg is that like Whoopi Goldberg
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:07,808	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Rosenberg like what does that mean
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:09,088	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	And then I looked
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:10,880	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Him up and I was like nah
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:11,648	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	The guy

EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:48,767	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	At that point 1987-88 here in New York they were the only two people playing hip hop
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:54,911	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Late at night I didn't consider myself a music person
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,191	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	I just obsessed with sports
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:57,727	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	And then at some point
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:58,495	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	I was like oh no

EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:25,375	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	It is very much something that was a badge of honor for
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:26,655	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	For both of us that we really

EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:39,359	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Item friend in elementary school we would talk about rap a little bit but quickly I exceeded them
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:45,759	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	And then I got to high school and I really took C

EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:25,695	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Okay so Peter goes off to college mid-90s to College radio hip hop show
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:28,255	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Then as he gets out decides he wants to do this for real
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:31,327	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	He secretly Mina wanted to be a hip-hop DJ but
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:34,399	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	People would not take him seriously you know why kid from the suburbs
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:37,983	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Didn't compute couldn't get on what was then called Urban radio
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:43,103	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Signs of doing a year on the Howard Stern station Eastern like talk radio you know
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:44,895	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Whatever kind of radio
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:45,919	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	So he
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:52,831	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Kept calling Hot 97 and the program director then was a white guy from Utah
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:54,879	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	I was like I'm super passionate about Hip Hop
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:56,415	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	I'm super honest
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:59,231	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	I don't think there's ever been someone
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:01,791	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Who looks like me and is from my background
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:05,375	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Who has is honest and louder voices me I really think I'll be something
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:07,423	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Any business that I don't doubt you
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:08,703	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	But
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,727	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	We talked about
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:10,495	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	I mean they had
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:12,799	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Token white people on various shows
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:19,199	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	But it was either your super white like Lisa G she was on the morning show for a little while after that she was super white
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:20,223	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	And that was kind of a joke
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:21,759	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Or you were Bobby konders
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:28,927	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Who does the Sunday Night Radio reggae show who you would never know he's wife
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:30,975	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Joppa Flats
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:35,071	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Because he just talks like he's Jamaican and the only place to make music The only things out Jamaican people
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:37,375	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	So you had to be one of those
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:40,447	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Two things where you denied your whiteness or are you just
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:42,751	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Extra like I'm going to I'm going to be the butt of the joke
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:46,079	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	White bosses have often been like you're really talented
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:49,407	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	But I don't know what people really like you like we don't
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:52,479	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	They talk to me the way you were talking right now
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:54,271	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	NSYNC if I'm able to relate
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:57,343	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Why would our audience relate to you
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:09:03,743	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	If I say yes then why would my audience say yes with me because because they assume Their audience is so different than
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:04,255	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Send them

EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:23,711	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	The hip-hop it changed it's no longer so small and simple and provincial
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:26,271	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	So we can go on pretending this is only a black and white

EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:42,463	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	One handy is the Suburban white kid from Maryland because it's going to be anything but
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:49,375	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	But on the other hand meme a big part of rosenberg's job is to go to shows and blogs and get tips from people in find

EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:05,919	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Everything I ever dreamed a hip-hop concert experience would be

EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:35,103	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	This was a weird moment for him
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:38,175	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	I just repeated it for hip hop in general like the early 90s
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:39,711	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	This is the moment when you had
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:42,783	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Stations like Hot 97 converting to AllHipHop formats
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:43,551	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Playing
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:46,111	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	You know NWA Public Enemy Tribe Called Quest

EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:51,487	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Yet if you listen to their lyrics
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:53,279	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Everybody
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:58,911	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	They were about stuff those fans could have never experienced
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:00,447	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Struggle depression
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:03,519	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Lack of opportunities in the ghetto
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:04,543	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	The fact that
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:07,615	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	You have young black teenagers
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:08,639	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Who
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:10,175	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Or living in
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:12,223	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	A society where
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:14,271	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	They're told that they will never amount
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:16,319	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	And that their lives
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:17,599	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Have no value
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:18,111	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	No worth
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:19,903	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	That to me
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:20,415	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Becomes the
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:22,719	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	The Angst in the frustration in a rage
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:23,999	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Which

EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:39,871	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	And Hip-Hop is definitely that
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:40,383	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	From the beginning
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:41,919	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	It was initially

EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:56,159	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	The year before it all happened
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:59,231	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	2011 I pulled her aside at Summer Jam

EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:22,015	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	She had all this

EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:26,623	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	And then how did you spend that credit well she started making
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:28,415	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Popular and popular record
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:30,719	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Culminating in the following song

EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:33,535	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	You've not been able to get out of your head

EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:40,703	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	She made this song called Starship
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:46,079	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Let's go to the beach each let's go
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:47,871	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Starships is a blatant pop
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:50,943	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Lowest common denominators I didn't I didn't like
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:54,271	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	The song you listen to that song and you cannot tell that it's not
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:56,063	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	A song by
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:17:02,207	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Katy Perry or pink or it could be anyone
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:08,607	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	So all of a sudden who is the underground crab
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:11,167	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Cop
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:13,983	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	But Peter Rosenberg
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:18,847	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Sometimes I got several mornings for his segment called the realness
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:22,175	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	He would get on there and play I play a clip of Starship
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:33,439	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Hardcore hip-hop
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:42,911	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Stop it
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:47,007	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	There is a real question being asked at the center of this which is
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:47,775	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	What is this music
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:49,823	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Where the boundaries are
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:53,407	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	And also is this where hip hop is going
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:56,223	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Is it just let me cash in and just
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:18:01,855	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Follow the trends of what white music is doing it like you felt betrayed as it as a music
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:06,463	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Yeah I felt like, and we just sent in the moment it felt like
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:11,583	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	You're at your hip hop star why would you why would you do this this is and this is not for us
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:14,143	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Encore hip hop artists
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:15,679	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Make pop song
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:19,007	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	It upsets me because
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:22,335	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	It's a bacon be a moment that blurs and messes up
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:23,359	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Hip Hop
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:26,175	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	This song right here Stars
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:27,711	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Is literally
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:29,503	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	One of the most sellout song
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:30,783	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	In the Papas
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:36,671	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Just put that comment in a tiny bit more context vs
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:38,975	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	No mention of course the history right
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:45,887	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	That's so many forms of popular music have been invented by black people co-opted by white people jazz blues rock
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:46,399	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	We all know the story
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:48,447	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	According to Franny Kelly
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:53,055	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	One of the hosts of a podcast called microphone check
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:59,455	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Podcast from NPR music 2013 was the first year that no black artist had a number one song
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:00,991	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Since 1958
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:07,391	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Since they started the Hot 100 charts this the first year where no black artist makes a number 1 at this may be a blip
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:08,415	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	May not be
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:10,463	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	What's clear is that there is a new force in town
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:14,303	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	A style of music called EDM.
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:16,351	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Is a meaningless
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:18,655	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Acronym that stands for electronic dance music
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:24,799	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	And it's like you know then
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:31,455	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	It's sort of amalgam of Cindy Dancy techno a Euro poppy stuff and
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:32,479	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	It is taking over
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:35,295	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	What happened with EDM was just so glaring and
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:36,063	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Fast
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:42,463	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	And then to see that sort of start to creep into hip-hop with Gary for people
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:43,231	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	The idiom is
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:46,815	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	The style of music that's meant to work on any dance floor with any crap
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:48,607	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	So that way it's like a music without history
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:51,935	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	On purpose a lot of the criticism of like EDM is that
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:56,031	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	It is all about my it is the corporatization of
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:57,311	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Play genre with along
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:20:01,919	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	History so in some ways I think the root of the protest
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:02,431	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Is
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:03,711	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Don't
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:04,223	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Dell

EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:13,951	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	In hip hop history
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:20,095	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	After Peter trash talks Nicki Minaj Starships

EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:31,871	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	But outside the stadium in the parking lot
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:36,223	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Earlier in the day there's the festival stage which is where the underground backpack kids Hangout

EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:11,104	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Not only was his name getting out there but it was getting out there as I'm the GateKeeper
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:13,920	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	I'm the defender and the defender of the real

EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:16,992	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	I couldn't appreciate it
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:23,136	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	At first because I didn't know if I was maybe going to get fired for messing up Summer Jam because Nikki's and beefing with the station
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:25,696	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Come on your state or even say something
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:29,280	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	She's calling in you no matter the station
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:30,560	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Papa John's

EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:40,032	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	It becomes a months-long process
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:40,800	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Nut
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:42,848	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	If they say unanimous
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:45,152	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Sleep know you were wrong about that song this is
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:46,944	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Is our song We included in our
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:48,736	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Map of what's going on
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:51,296	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Stop trying to draw the map
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:54,368	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	What do you say that in your inside you
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:56,416	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	I think my gut reaction
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:24:00,512	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	You know nothing you don't draw the map
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:02,304	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	You need people like us
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:03,328	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	To draw the map
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:04,352	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Or there's nothing
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:05,888	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	What is that
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:09,216	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	If if we don't get to determine certain things
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:15,360	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Who does we should leave that to the crazed thirteen-year-old who may not even like this artist in 2 years
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:17,408	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Other Woman
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:18,944	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Hearing that
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:21,248	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Sprained ankle again this idea that
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:23,296	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Young girls with your Starships
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:24,576	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	And say oh
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:25,856	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	That's Hip Hop
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:30,464	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	That's what I want to hear that's what I'm to judge everything against you wildly unfair
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:33,280	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	To the intelligence of young girls
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:37,376	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Freddy says they can figure out the difference between hip hop and pop they don't need help
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:40,960	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	And furthermore when he chose Starships to single out
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:42,496	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	It felt
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:44,288	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Revealing of another
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:45,824	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Layer to this debate that
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:46,336	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	People want
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:47,616	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Out loud
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:51,456	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Which is it when people refer to things as quote real hip hop
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:53,248	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Usually code for aggressive
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:54,016	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Street
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:55,552	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Masculine
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:56,832	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Where is when they say pop
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:58,624	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	That's usually code for
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:24:59,392	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Feminine
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:00,672	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Which is a perversion of
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:01,184	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	What's the music
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:04,256	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	And so there is this idea that
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:05,024	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	You know people make
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:07,072	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Songs for the ladies
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:11,424	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Which implies that all the rest of them are songs that we can't hear or God forbid understand
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:14,240	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Okay so all of this
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:20,384	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Swirling around months go by and then fast forward to the week before the next Summer Jam this is 2014
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:22,432	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	2013 - 2013
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:24,736	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Feud is still going to year later
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:27,296	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	But Grenadier Nikki decide
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:27,808	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	It's time to settle
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:30,368	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Maybe because she wanted to perform at that you
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:31,648	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Your summer Jan are so
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:32,160	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Nicki Minaj
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:33,696	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Radio station
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:38,304	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	She come to the station
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:39,584	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Before
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:41,632	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Summer Jam to make herpes
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:48,032	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	And they do this whole interview with Rosenberg and Nicki Minaj and Ebro the boss is moderating
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:50,080	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	On the air on the rosenbergs
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:52,896	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Where would you like this interview to go
EDL	00:25:54,432	00:25:57,760	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	I don't know I'm excited I'm excited to see Nikki because
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:03,648	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	It's very odd to have some of that you don't know very well who's become like such a fixture in your life like
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:07,488	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	I've always wondered I was always like I wonder if Nikki knows that she's come up
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:09,024	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Everyday of my life
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:11,584	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	For 350 days like
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:16,704	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Point that where Starship got played on my wedding and it was like the biggest deal at my wedding
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:17,728	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Starship playing at my way
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:20,032	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	After some opening remarks
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:20,544	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Peter basic
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:24,128	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	I am sorry that things went as left as they did
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:26,944	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	I never had ill feelings about you as a human being ever
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:30,528	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Mac says I have nothing against you as a person be on my
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:32,064	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Sort of distaste for that song
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:33,344	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	That's cool
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:35,392	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	As water under the bridge
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:36,416	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Do you mean that
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:37,696	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Yeah
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:40,000	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	She then goes out of her way to apologize to

EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:17,856	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	You better do something and the amazing thing was she wanted to ask me an opinion.
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:20,928	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Something and it makes me feel ultimately super special
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:23,744	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	So we asked Peter like so what does that mean like if you are now a gay
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:25,536	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Are you white guy from

EDL	00:30:39,104	00:30:39,616	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Started
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:40,896	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Doing this
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:42,432	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	I would break it down on paper
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:45,248	| radiolab_podcast14hiphop |	Let me tell you where we were when I started my underground show in 2000's
