EDL	00:00:25,344	00:00:26,112	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Hello
EDL	00:00:26,112	00:00:32,512	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Robert hi mist of classical music
EDL	00:00:32,512	00:00:35,840	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Play the public radio interrupted by
EDL	00:00:35,840	00:00:42,240	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Science journalist and author David, are we all here now now we're all here and you are Jennifer
EDL	00:00:42,240	00:00:43,008	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Radiolab
EDL	00:00:43,008	00:00:46,848	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Actually what happened here so I called David because he has just published a book
EDL	00:00:47,360	00:00:48,128	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Which
EDL	00:00:48,128	00:00:52,224	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Contains an idea that I found so surprised I had not
EDL	00:00:52,224	00:00:52,736	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	No no
EDL	00:00:53,760	00:00:55,296	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	It's kind of a
EDL	00:00:55,296	00:00:57,088	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Smack in the face
EDL	00:00:57,088	00:00:59,392	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	To Charles Darwin's theory of evolution
EDL	00:00:59,904	00:01:03,488	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Yes there have been a number of excellent at Google that have been
EDL	00:01:03,488	00:01:04,768	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Added to Darwin
EDL	00:01:04,768	00:01:06,304	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Theory over the last
EDL	00:01:06,304	00:01:06,816	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	100
EDL	00:01:07,328	00:01:09,376	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	50 years or so since he published it but
EDL	00:01:09,888	00:01:12,960	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	This is this is more than that this is a big freaking asterisk
EDL	00:01:13,472	00:01:17,568	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And that means David told me a story
EDL	00:01:17,568	00:01:18,336	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	About a moth
EDL	00:01:21,408	00:01:23,968	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Yes the peppered moth
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:26,016	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	It lives in forest
EDL	00:01:26,016	00:01:30,368	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	SubCentral England among other places in during the 19th century
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:33,952	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	This moth was white with little flecks of black on it
EDL	00:01:33,952	00:01:35,488	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And please moths
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:38,048	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Sometimes rooster on the trunks of trees
EDL	00:01:38,560	00:01:42,144	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	In the trunks of trees surrounding Manchester England restorative light color
EDL	00:01:43,680	00:01:46,240	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Roosted on the trees they were pretty well camouflage
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:47,520	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Alight
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:50,848	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Slightly peppered moth on a light slightly pepper tree trunk
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:52,896	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	So they were protected against
EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:54,432	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Predation by birds
EDL	00:01:55,200	00:01:55,968	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And then
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:01:58,784	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	The tree trunk
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:00,576	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Changed why do the tree trunks chain
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:04,928	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Because of the Industrial Revolution
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:06,464	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Because of smoke stacks
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:08,000	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Of Manchester
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:10,048	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Returning out a lot of
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:13,888	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Cool smoke they were burning cold for all their industrial processes
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:15,424	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And there was a
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:21,568	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Good coaster that coming out and it was blanketing the trees in the nearby Forest so the tree trunk
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:22,592	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Turn
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:24,128	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Black
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:26,688	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:27,712	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	The mall
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:34,112	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	We're no longer camouflage cuz I'm always wear white you wouldn't want to be a white moth sitting against the cold black tree because
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:37,184	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Cuz then you are you're married but know exactly where you are
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:38,208	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Right
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:40,768	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	What happened
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:41,280	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	The Moth
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:42,816	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Turned black
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:49,984	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Oh yeah sure this is the this is the classic sort of evolution story
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:50,752	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	That
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:56,128	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Story was told it was a became a textbook example of darwinian evolutionary change
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:03:02,528	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	In in real time and the way that happens what we were told is it once the trees turn dark them off
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:08,928	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Change by incremental mutation again oh thanks to some tiny little mistake and some more
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:10,720	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	G the black
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:16,608	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Spackling got bigger on certain moths and knows we're a little bit more protected and then the spackling got a little bit bigger
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:17,632	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Tomorrow's got a little
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:24,032	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Gray hair and then very very slowly over generation after generation after generation of moth
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:25,312	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	They get a little bit.
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,592	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Darker still
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:29,664	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	To end up eventually with a population of Martha turn
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:31,456	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Completely
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:32,736	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	That's the classic
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:34,016	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Story
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:36,576	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Except except that we now know
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:39,904	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	That's wrong it turns out it wasn't slow
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:42,464	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	It didn't take Generations in generation
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:45,280	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Sequencing of the moth genome has revealed
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:47,072	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Stretch of DNA
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:50,912	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	22000 letters of the DNA code
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:52,704	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	That suddenly jump
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:53,984	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Into these moths
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:55,776	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	From somewhere
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,312	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And in a Flash
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,592	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	The moths changed
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:03:59,872	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	From
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:04,224	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	White to black pretty much in one day really a white
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:06,016	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Peppered moth mom
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,040	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	All of a sudden
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:09,600	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Producers in all black
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:10,112	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Baby
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:11,392	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Wait so how did that
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:12,928	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	How did that happen
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:15,744	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	It's a whole pack of jeans just got shoved in
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:17,280	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	To this new
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:20,863	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	From where did come from David says it probably
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:21,631	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Jumped
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:24,703	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	One part of the moth genome to a completely new part different part
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:26,239	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	But what
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:28,543	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	That means a question that living things
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:31,103	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Turns out can change way faster than we thought
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:35,967	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And therefore Evolution can happen much faster than we thought and on top of that David says
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:37,759	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Scientists have now discovered
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:40,319	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Is even stranger kind of super fast train
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:41,599	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	That
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:42,879	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Cakes
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:49,023	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Things about parents and Offspring individual species things we've counted on for years and just throws the whole mix into the
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:51,327	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Yes infective heredity
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:54,399	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Effective heredity
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:56,191	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	What is what is that
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:59,263	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	I don't even have to explain this to you I have to go back
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:04,127	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Hello I'm Jah Devil Run and I'm Robert Bill Winston's Radiolab for tattoo in earlier version of
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:10,783	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Because it was 11 years ago I think that we made a show called show called V
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:11,551	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Not as we
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:15,391	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Oh God that's Joanne in that show who dealt with
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:18,463	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Early sort of more primitive version of this very question
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:24,863	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Can I play you a few minutes of that other earlier show
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:25,631	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	World of living things
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:29,983	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	I say look at there's a cat and that's that is a dog and a new tree
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:30,751	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	You notice
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:31,519	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	List of those things of course
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:32,799	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Are different
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:35,103	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Yes and later we go to school
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:36,127	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	We learn about
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:41,247	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Phylum's in categories like kingdoms and stops breathing but the nature of those differences and then you're taught
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:42,527	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	About struggle
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:48,671	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Competition Darwin species and there is a new Siri
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:51,999	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	It's being talked about that all of that on it
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:53,791	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	I heard it first
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:06:00,191	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	I'm Steve strogatz I'm an applied mathematician at Cornell and the story he told me which is based on analysis
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:01,983	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	TNA injury tiny Oregon
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:02,751	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Micro
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:04,031	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Is it once upon a time he says
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:08,383	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Life began with a very primitive very simple collection of cells
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:09,407	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Diesel
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:15,039	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	These cells life
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:18,367	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	It appears that magic when you go back far enough there's a kind of
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:23,487	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Rampant sharing of molecule it's a kind of orgy in which
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:26,559	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	There are no well-defined species are organisms and
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:32,191	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	I can give you my jeans and you can pass what were a communist
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:33,471	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Totally room recording that
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:39,871	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	But that Kumbaya singing that certainly was there at the start he produced this piece years ago yes I think it was just
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:41,151	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	The office
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:44,223	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	It was a Communist economy
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:50,367	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	What do you mean what is it mean I know what it means in the 60s. Love since that what is it really mean what I what cells are
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:51,647	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Exchanging is chemical
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:52,927	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Chemicals that give them talents
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:54,975	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Here's what
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:58,303	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	I did this with Steve
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:07:00,607	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Huddle in Darwin public life might have begun in
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:01,119	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Warm
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:04,447	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Let's say that you and I are both cell
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:07,775	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	The once upon a time there was you in the puddle and I'm in the same family as you
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:10,591	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And if it gets a little colder in the puddle
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:12,639	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Also we should all get sick but you don't get sick

EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:30,047	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Maybe a little bit porous
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:36,447	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And maybe okay we're not talking
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:42,591	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Desiccated organism maybe your poor is too and I'll well you just absorb some of those jeans
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:48,991	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	So now we both have this we both got any both Gene now I can survive

EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:10,879	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Did we really use Bill Gates's is standing for like selfishness time he was the ultimate
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:12,671	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	It's horrible that we did that
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:19,071	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Actually going over to the to the light side instead
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:20,095	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Go to the dark side
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:23,679	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	That is a c strogatz I ended up calling mug
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:25,983	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Get to Chatham through some of the stuff and he told me
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:29,823	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	That he actually heard this whole idea from a lecture by physicists
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:36,223	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Freeman Dyson Dyson adjust a great writer in a great speaker and he had this memorable line in their least memorable to me when he start
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:36,991	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Talkin about
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:43,647	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Let me rephrase the whole thing in terms of sharing which may be why in that previous episode we had that come by awesome singing
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:51,839	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	But that wasn't my doing by the way I know know that I was
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:58,239	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Primitive bacterium anticipating Bill Gates by 3 billion years refused to share its DNA and then
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:13:04,639	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	That was that was Freeman Dyson that was his only way was I was sitting there in this lecture we started mentioning assert
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:09,503	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Biologist Carlos and he talked about him in such glowing terms as one of the Great
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:11,039	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Microbiologist
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:12,063	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Love our time
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:18,207	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And see you after you hadn't heard of Carl was I had to before though I had not the reason I was asking
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:22,303	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	I think in the shower actually mentioned probably because I remember
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:24,607	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	You know I don't know if you guys know this or not but
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:27,935	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	So that was 11 years ago right I was actually an intern
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:29,727	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	At the time I just showed up
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:36,127	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And I was tasked with tracking down Carlos who's the guy that we mentioned as or like the grandfather this idea
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,919	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And he was like a huge
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:41,247	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Huge deal in science he discovered this whole other
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:47,391	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Branch on the tree of life the archaea he's Mister archaea
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:49,951	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Whole nother Kingdom
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:54,559	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Front page of the New York Times and I had to track him down and turned out
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:55,839	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Use like the
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:57,631	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Just the Classic
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,911	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Curmudgeonly
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:13:59,679	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Scientist
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:02,239	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	It took me
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:03,519	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	20 emails
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:06,591	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	To get him to even like just let us talk to his
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:09,919	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Collaborator Nigel goldenfeld who we talked to in the show
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:12,735	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	But whatever is a very strange he was a very
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:14,015	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Curmudgeonly man
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:19,135	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	But you know like he came to like me and I actually spend some time with him his office and we
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:21,951	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	I can do the curmudgeon anything if I need to know
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:23,743	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Cherokee
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:30,655	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Yeah I could we got some curmudgeonly jokes back and forth and
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:33,471	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Anyway after he heard the peace
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:34,751	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Hiromi
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:42,175	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	The most seizing skating email about nothing there was nothing in it about like you got this
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:44,735	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Wrong it was just like you made a cartoon of my work
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:46,783	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Which honestly now listening Bash
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:50,879	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	I agree with a little more than I did at the time
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:55,999	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	But he was like I'm a serious person and you made this into like a dog and pony show
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:15:01,887	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And I was like I was brand new I was and it hurt any like I was I felt really
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:04,959	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Really bad he's like you've disrespected Nigel
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:12,127	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And so I wrote I wrote this hour called up Steve maybe and said man you know this happened in Steve was like a
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:15,967	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Forget them don't worry about it
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:17,247	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Yeah I don't know I
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:22,879	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	I'd it sounds like something I might have said to you but you remember having that honestly don't remember having that conversation
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:30,303	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	I needed that so bad at that moment my career for someone like with Steve stature to like balance it out in that way
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:31,839	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Yeah I think
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:33,631	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Venus orbit funny that he would
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:40,543	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Tell me a little surprising that he wouldn't have gotten what you were trying to do what we were trying to do I think our play
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:43,103	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Playfulness in an attempt to be clear and to communicate
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:49,503	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	In to attract people who might not otherwise listen to a story about something called horizontal Gene transfer
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:51,807	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	He should have gotten that because
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:54,367	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	He himself in his writing was very playful
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:59,743	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	He was very fun to talk to I mean he was absolutely Carlos was very playful
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:02,303	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And irascible and grouchy and
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:07,679	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Farming but he would certainly tell you what he thought yeah yeah this guy is a great character
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:14,079	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	David quammen turns out in his new book talks a lot a lot a lot about Carl woes and this Revel
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:19,967	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Pollution in our thinking about the evolution of life for the end of his life he started to think that he was more important
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:24,063	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And more profound and Darwin he got a very negative attitude toward
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:30,975	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Charles Darwin Darwin's birthday he should be a day of Rage
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:37,119	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	That's right cuz he did that but I guess I'm wondering is now that you spent a book
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:40,447	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Attention on him do you feel that he has
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:41,215	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Some
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:42,751	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Right to say
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:46,591	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	That's the picture we have of how life changes needs
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:48,383	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Serious amending or is she just

EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,199	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Because he's a Barker
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:53,503	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	No he is
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:54,783	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	He was entitled
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:58,879	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Not to think that he was greater than Darwin but to think that
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:00,415	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	What he discovered was
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:03,999	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Very very damn important to understanding
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:05,791	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	The full history of evolution

EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:16,447	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Basically I want to hear about this
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:18,495	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	When a kid you know did something
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:20,799	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	It just means you lean back and say
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:22,079	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Well
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:22,591	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	How do they do that
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:24,639	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Maybe it was the moment that I
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:28,223	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:30,783	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Or maybe the kid was a piano
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:34,879	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:36,927	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Or maybe the kids in math class
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:39,743	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:41,279	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	We're interested in the

EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:26,591	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	These leaping jeans these transfers of

EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:28,383	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	That create
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:30,687	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	New genetic possibilities
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:31,711	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	In a blink
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:38,111	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Turns out David told us that the swapping of genes but we talked about in the early history of life that's still happening
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:38,879	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Today correct
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:42,719	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Yes bacteria all around us those bugs
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:46,303	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Are trading jean jeans are jumping sideways
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:47,071	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	From one kind of
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:48,607	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Bacteria
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:51,679	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	To another Even in our bellies Even in our guts
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:55,519	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	So let's say that you go to France
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:57,055	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Vacation
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:19:59,103	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And then you lick your finger
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:02,175	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Are you eat something
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:03,455	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	New bacteria
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:08,831	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	European food has been into your stomach and now not only do you have some new bugs in you
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:14,207	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	But they can start trading their Gene with bugs that are already in you
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:19,327	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	What would that mean like physically like what it would look like without the cell wall and then
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:21,887	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	They found that there were several different mechanism
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:22,655	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	For this
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:25,727	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Two bacteria would create a little pipe
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:27,775	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	A little sort of penis like thing
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:30,335	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Between them and genes would be transferred
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:33,151	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	The jeans were moving sideways under other circumstances

EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:20,768	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	So you got somebody sitting in a hospital with
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:22,560	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	A a staphylococcus infection
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:25,120	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Some of the bugs inside her figure it out
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:28,192	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	How to resist penicillin
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:29,728	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Bugs in comes out of
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:34,848	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	That human and it gets left on a table in the hospital and somebody else gets infected by it
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:37,664	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Then they will also have
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:44,064	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	An infection that is resistant to penicillin in the hospital sick with something
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:47,392	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Show me different they have a different kind of harmful bacteria do in trouble giving them trouble
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:52,512	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And those old bacteria in them can learn in a Flash on the new bacteria
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:54,816	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Now everybody's penicillin-resistant
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:56,096	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And that's why
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:21:58,144	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	That's what I antibiotic resistance
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:22:00,192	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Is spreading around the world
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:01,216	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	So lickety-split
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:03,776	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	That is really important that's a
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:05,312	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	That's a global Health crisis

EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:13,760	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Are dying from Netflix really important

EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:17,088	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	The most important part of this

EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:19,904	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Practical
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:21,696	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	It's a matter of understanding
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:24,512	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Understanding the history of life
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:25,792	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Understanding
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:27,072	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Who We Are
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:32,960	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Literally because according to David the way we are the humans are has been affected by

EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:50,624	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	It's like you're sitting around enough virus gets into your bloodstream
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:52,672	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And it travels into one of yourself
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:55,744	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And when it's in there and drop some of its DNA
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:57,280	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Enjoy your day
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:23:04,192	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And if it gets new Dory sellers principal then it will be passed along 8% of our genome has come to us that
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:05,216	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	That way from these viruses
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:06,752	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Some of that
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:08,288	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Is just
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:09,312	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Gobbledygook
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:10,592	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	In our genome
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:11,360	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Some of it
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:13,920	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Is instructions not with jeans
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:15,456	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	That are still performing functions
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:16,992	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And one of those
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:19,296	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Create boundary layer between
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:21,344	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Human placenta in the fetus
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:23,648	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	An absolutely necessary
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:24,160	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Sensual
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:25,696	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Boundary layer
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:26,720	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Now this is
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:30,048	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	He was totally shocked to me because after all the thing that's
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:33,376	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Really special about mammals is that female mammals
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:35,680	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Or at least placental mammals
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:38,496	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Carrie young around inside
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:44,896	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	The body in the history of life this was a completely new development I mean you think about fish you think about reptiles like the dinosaur
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:46,176	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	The birds
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:47,456	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	What are they doing to him
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:50,016	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	If they lay eggs but now we get a creature
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:53,856	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	The comes along and figures out how to keep the baby growing inside it
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:57,440	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Question what does that have to make sure that it gets immune system.
EDL	00:23:58,464	00:24:00,256	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And the baby has to be able to
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:03,072	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Poop and stuff like that get things out of that to be some kind of
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:04,608	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Boundary
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:06,400	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And how did we get that good idea
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:08,192	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	We got that good idea from a virus
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:13,568	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Long long ago some ancient mammal ancestor got a virus got infected by a virus and not virus
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:15,360	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Introduced a new Gene
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:17,920	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Is the original virus it created an envelope a rapping
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:19,712	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Around the virus
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:20,992	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	But
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:21,760	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	It has been
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:23,808	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Adapted
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:25,856	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	To create a different kind of rapping
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:26,880	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	The rapping that goes
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:29,952	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Around fetus and inside the placenta
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:31,488	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	So it carries nutrients
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:36,864	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	In it protects the fetus from the mother's immune system and it is allowing waste products
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:38,144	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	From
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:39,936	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Fetus to be carried away
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:45,824	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And disposed of by the mother I mean is this potentially the origin of mammals and woods
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:49,664	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	This being the without which if we hadn't gotten this Talent from viruses
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:51,712	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	We wouldn't have gotten
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:55,296	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	The kinds of mammals we have now that layer
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:58,624	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Could not exist and does not function
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:24:59,392	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Without this
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:00,160	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Viral Gene
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:01,440	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Telling it
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:02,464	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	What to do
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:05,792	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Without this little bit of a virus DNA
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:07,072	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Yeah you can't be a mammal
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:10,656	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	You can't be my mother mammal and you can't be a child
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:19,104	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	In light of the stuff in in
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:20,896	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	For me and light of five years of
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:22,176	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Studying
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:24,736	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	I'm following it in interviewing people about it
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:28,320	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	The categories that we apply to the world
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:30,624	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Categories like
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:32,160	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Individual
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:32,928	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:33,696	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Species
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:35,744	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Now appear more blurry
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:36,768	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	The edges
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:37,536	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Are fuzzy
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:41,632	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Is there such a thing as a human individual or is it
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:43,680	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	A human a composite
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:45,472	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Of other forms of life
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:48,288	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And what this says is that we are composite
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:49,312	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	We are mosaics
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:52,896	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Sis humbling and it's
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:54,688	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Bennett's fascinating
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:56,992	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Just think of yourself that way
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:26:01,600	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Like for me David so it turns out that David is not just the descendant of
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:04,672	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	A Norwegian father and a German Irish mother
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:05,696	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	But he's also
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:08,256	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Viral and bacterial
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:09,792	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	And who knows what else
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:10,560	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	End
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:11,584	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	I find that

EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:46,656	| radiolab_podcast18infectiveheredity |	Book is called the Tangled tree and it's a gorgeous book so thanks to them and takes all of you
