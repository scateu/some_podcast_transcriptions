EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:16,800	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	One morning I think it was about 5 a.m.
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:18,848	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Like still dark Marty woke up and he was just

EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:12,608	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Flung myself to the end of the bed and I grabbed Marty in one arm and started
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:16,192	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Frantically searching the label which was filled with words like

EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:32,639	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Marty Wade

EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:40,831	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Then the guy did a little mental math and said
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:41,855	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Your child's going to be fun
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:45,183	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Totally fine this will probably not a big deal at all was really common

EDL	00:04:57,983	00:05:00,287	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	But for the rest of the day I just kept thinking
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:06,431	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	What the hell is Poison Control I honestly didn't think we still live in a world where you can just call a hotline like
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:12,319	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Get on the telephone and talk to a live Human who somehow knows everything about this one specific brand of diaper ointment
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:16,671	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And then bam like 45 seconds later this full-blown crisis in my mind was just
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:17,183	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Thoughts
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:18,975	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And then you know
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:21,791	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	I just was having this weird moment of like
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:25,631	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	There's this invisible network out there that was just
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:27,423	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Kind of primed and waiting
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:28,447	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	To help

EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:57,151	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Go back to the beginning of that dance
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:00,223	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	You'll find that like with so many things it starts
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:01,247	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	With murder
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:04,831	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Because we humans first got really interested in poisons
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:06,623	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	When you realize we could use them
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:11,231	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Kill each other and one of my favorite examples is actually arsenic
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:17,119	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Which in early nineteenth-century Europe was by all accounts the perfect, decided poisoned it was tasteless
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:21,983	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	It was odorless you could put it into vanilla pudding or oatmeal natural illness

EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:30,687	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	The time we had no way of detecting it literally only comments in the 19th century
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:35,039	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Science has not figured out a way to detect a single poison in a quart

EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:41,439	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Perfect well there was a chemist in Britain named James Marshall

EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:55,263	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Adding some acid and heating it up and Distilling it and then
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:57,823	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Is this Vapor comes out

EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:02,687	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And if there was any arsenic in the original

EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:17,791	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Was actually the first

EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:33,663	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Because if you see the rise of industrial chemistry and and our ability to synthesize Cyanide and

EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:57,951	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	It was 1940

EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:19,455	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	To get very serious
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:22,527	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	The pharmacy was directly across
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:23,807	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Saul from the emergence

EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:26,367	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	What's are happening is
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:27,647	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	You don't even notice this trend
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:32,511	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	I just about got this is the 1940s and doctors are totally winning against infectious diseases
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:36,095	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And what that meant was that as far as the public was concerned
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:38,655	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Keeping your family healthy and germ-free
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:39,679	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Is a big deal
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:41,983	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And that meant keeping your home

EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:53,503	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And at the same time there's just this explosion of new cleaning products coming into the market
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:58,879	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Than any other

EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:24,479	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And getting back to Lewis what he began to notice was that
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:30,623	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	More and more these doctors were coming across the hall of his Pharmacy the first one and then more and more and you know they're saying the k
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:32,927	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	We got this kid over in the ER Heat

EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:39,839	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	So the interns and residents and they emerge
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:42,143	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	PC room with naturally come across the hall to
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:49,823	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And Lou help them find out what the child is taken for example if a child has swallowed a jacks
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:53,407	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	That meant he'd actually eaten
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:57,503	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Sodium carbonate and sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:17:59,807	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Wicked mean Dodger diarrhea
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:01,343	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Or vomiting and Lewis
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:03,135	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	To keep cards on every
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:07,487	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Product that was brought into the emergency room
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:09,535	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Lloyd Wright Avenue card white sail bleach
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:11,327	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Sodium hypochlorite
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:12,095	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Chest pain vomiting
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:14,911	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Safety gulou decided this was a
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:18,239	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	It was very needed because of the 1950's
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:23,103	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	3 / 250,000 different trade name substances on the market
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:25,151	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	The doctors they just couldn't keep up
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:29,759	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And so loose stack of cards it grew taller and taller and taller and pretty soon
EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:30,783	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Workout
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:34,879	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Dog across the country would hear that there's this guy in Chicago who gives out help on poisoning
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:42,047	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	So many calls are coming in at all hours of the day and night eventually could only just started telling the switchboard operator they could go ahead and transfer the call
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:43,327	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	She was home
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:47,423	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	We would get calls from all the different little love
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:52,031	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Emergency rooms in the hospitals in the state and what was what was it like
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:54,335	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Once you're doing this then
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:57,151	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	It seems to me that you don't really have normal hours
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:59,967	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Because emergencies will take place whenever they take place
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:01,247	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	So yes
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:05,343	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	How did what was he going to be on call 24 hours a day
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:07,391	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	You leave yet
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:08,927	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Yes he was
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:12,767	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Bleyblades get calls in the middle of the night
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:16,095	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	It already even during dinner time
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:18,655	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	So what happens if you know he's in the tub
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:20,447	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And you're cooking dinner
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:23,007	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And the phone rings
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:24,799	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	I would take the phone to him
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:28,895	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	A tender
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:30,175	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	That's the way it started
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:31,455	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Eventually
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:35,807	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Little operation became the first Poison Control Center in the United States

EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:59,488	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	I mean honestly just selfishly thinking about myself as a mom
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:03,840	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Coming out of the trip to poison control I remember writing down
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:04,864	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Miss feeling of like

EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:11,776	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Like what like kind of thinking like
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:13,824	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	What would Poison Control do you like I just
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:15,104	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	It felt like
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:17,920	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Such a relief to be experiencing
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:19,456	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Phenobarbital
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:20,224	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	64.89
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:25,856	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And how much does she weigh is super rational place because just completely rational
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:26,880	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And when did it happen
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:27,904	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	How long ago
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:30,976	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	We have this data we're going to
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:31,744	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	What's the name of The Prado
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:33,280	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Take these questions from you
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:35,840	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Let me see if this is even going to be a pro
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:37,120	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And then we're going to
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:38,400	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Tell you
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:40,704	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	This is what we think is going to happen
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:41,216	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Back pain nausea
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:46,336	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And they'll let you make a decision or they'll tell you like straight up don't worry about it
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:47,104	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	She's going to be a okay
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:50,176	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	I'm here on out and then take it again but you will be okay
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:51,712	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Okay
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:52,992	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	It just felt like it's it's
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:54,784	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Stripped Away a lot of the
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:25:01,696	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Like the guild and the anxiety and the like should I do this and politics and all those other things that have often swear
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:02,976	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Around even seemingly
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:05,024	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Tumi inocuos questions about
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:08,608	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	How do I keep this person with little person safe and healthy
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:11,424	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	There's all the stuff swirling around it and they just
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:13,472	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	We didn't have to get into any of that
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:16,288	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	The iso range for me the most interesting part of this is that
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:19,872	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	The idea that we're supposed to know things like
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:22,176	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	You know I talked about this with my dad I mean
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:24,992	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	There was this time in medicine when
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:27,040	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	It was all about the doctor
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:28,320	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	In the white coat is
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:29,088	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Paternalistic
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:30,368	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Doctor knows best
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:36,256	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And no one wants to go back there about that that there was something emotionally clean about that
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:38,048	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Where is now
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:41,632	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	We have all the information it's right there is
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:42,400	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Hand in hand
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:43,936	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	With the rise of the internet
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:45,216	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	It's so increasingly
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:46,240	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	We're expected
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:48,032	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	To be our own
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:48,544	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Experts
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:51,104	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And it's usually presented as
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:53,920	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	This sort of simple idea that information is power
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:58,016	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And it isn't power I mean it is but it's also paralysis
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:25:59,296	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Yeah
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:02,624	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Actually had a rule where I wouldn't I would only let Nick look things up
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:06,976	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Cuz I couldn't like I was not certain I was pregnant I like but have a panic attack
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:11,328	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Is there so many different things and like always the top searches are the ones that like you're going to die
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:15,168	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Oh yeah and he's really eat you like you get to the comments field
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:17,216	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Right
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:19,520	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	I mean there's something about when you look at an answer on a
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:24,128	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Screen and you just one click away from an exact opposite answer
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:27,968	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And then when you're on the phone with someone it's just you and that person
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:30,016	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Like there is no other.
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:31,040	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Traction
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:33,600	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	I guess something built into the technology
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:34,368	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	The crates
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:36,416	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Exactly the kind of connection you need it that much
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:39,744	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Little people when they call you it's emergency there there
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:42,304	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	They're panicking and I think half the battle is getting them
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:43,840	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Settle down
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:49,216	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	So this is Tony Berta the know everything I we mentioned earlier
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:53,568	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	81 then that calm voice for 30 years
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:56,896	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And while he was in pharmacy school he had an accident
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:59,200	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	I actually started pharmacy school
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:26:59,968	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	As excited
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:01,760	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Person but I finished as a blind
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:02,272	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Individual
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:03,808	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	What what happened
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:05,344	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	He didn't want to say
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:09,952	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	But sitting there
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:16,352	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Scene of doing all of this math and spitting out these numbers receptor sites and half lives and volumes of distribution
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:18,656	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Totally incomprehensible to me
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:22,240	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	But he told me that he also look pretty quickly and too
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:25,056	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Discovered early on that there was this whole other
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:26,336	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Part of doing this job
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:28,640	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Since September of 82

EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:30,944	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Probably head like a year-and-a-half
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:32,992	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Experience at that time
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:34,016	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	I remember I was

EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:12,832	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	An interesting thing about
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:13,600	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	This case
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:17,184	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Is that in every single one of these calls that was coming in
EDL	00:29:18,208	00:29:19,488	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Provides almost panicked
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:22,304	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	But they weren't actually in any danger
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:28,448	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	If anyone has taken
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:34,336	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	So in some way this moment if you think about it it it really kind of
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:35,616	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	High like this thing that
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:36,896	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	It is really at the heart of poison
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:38,176	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	The Specialist
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:44,832	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Not only were, but they hate their job was to just reassure like they were letting people know it was going to be okay
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:47,648	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	But if you flash forward to now that's changing it
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:52,000	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	They're getting more calls that are more serious I getting calls from hospitals
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:57,376	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Again calls from people who've taken multiple drugs and so does that mean that they're getting less calls from like
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:29:58,144	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Normal
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:30:02,496	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	People and parents and I are going down and that end my calls overall
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:05,312	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Sense like that in the past decade there been fewer calls
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:06,336	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	The Poison Control
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:07,104	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Do you know why
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:08,384	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	My son
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:13,760	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	We don't like to make phone calls anymore but people don't there that you know the internet is there
EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:15,808	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And that's what we're used to and that's easy
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:18,880	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Until they are they just launched this new
EDL	00:30:19,392	00:30:23,744	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	But instead of calling you can go to the website and plug-in answers to the questions
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:25,024	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	That they roll through
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:27,328	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And it will give you the same answer based on
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:29,376	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Hopefully the same knowledge but then
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:30,656	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	As a person who's lived
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:34,752	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Through it I'm like oh my God please don't take away that phone call cuz it
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:41,152	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	When you're in that Panic the thought of having to sit and type an answer out while you're holding your kid and like wondering if you real
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:41,664	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Really screwed up
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:46,272	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And it's like you're taking away something really valuable that maybe
EDL	00:30:46,272	00:30:47,808	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	We're not valuing here
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:49,856	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	I did have this one event
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:51,904	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	When my older son I've got
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:52,672	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Tucson
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:55,488	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	It was very little we were living in Sacramento
EDL	00:30:55,488	00:30:58,816	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	That by the way is author Deborah Blum again and
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:31:00,608	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	They didn't have fluoridated water
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:01,888	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	So
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:03,936	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Doc gave them
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:04,704	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Honey Mead
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:08,032	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Cute they were really cute fruit flavored fluoride pills
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:09,824	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	What kind of thing you could get a toddler to take
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:14,432	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	I don't know that we were doing but somehow we
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:19,296	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Have you given him his daily fluoride pill and then like idiots left it on the kitchen counter
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:23,136	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And he grabbed it and pretty much inhaled the whole bottle
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:25,184	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And I was
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:26,976	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Really
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:34,144	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	I just didn't know how poisonous that was going to be like oh poison control
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:37,728	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Am I supposed to know what I wanted to know was whether I should pan
EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:39,008	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Right I mean
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:43,104	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	He seemed fine it wasn't like he was getting sick and anyway
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:45,920	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	And they were completely non freaked out about
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:51,552	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Yeah you remember here
EDL	00:31:51,552	00:31:53,600	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Did you hear their words or did you hear their tone
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:55,648	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	It was the tone
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:31:58,464	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	They were so calm
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:31:59,232	| radiolab_podcast18poisoncontrol |	Add
