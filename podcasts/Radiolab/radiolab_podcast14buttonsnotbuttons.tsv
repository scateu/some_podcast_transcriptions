EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:33,760	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Is the Genesis
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:39,648	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	The insults begins and it is an insult because what is about to happen
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:41,696	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Cuz he's about to tell us that we are
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:45,280	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Googles and have no power in the world in which we inhabit
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:47,072	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	He does that by pointing to the
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:49,888	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Close door button you push in the bush.
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:51,168	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	He says
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:52,704	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Just says matter-of-factly
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:54,240	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	About 80% of the van on function
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:56,288	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Oh wow
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:04:00,896	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Because they are broken and on fix them because they wasn't never wire

EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:04,992	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	What's the time we going to do it
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,296	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	But 80%
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:08,832	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	I just assumed they don't work
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:14,720	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	You assume they don't lie so yeah I sweat no no no no no
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:21,119	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Know what I cannot be right we make cannot be right have you ever board close button that yeah that has had any
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:27,519	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Psychological tool for you you need me button to go back up there something but that's not too but he said also
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:28,799	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	He had also a very
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:29,567	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Fan series
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:30,591	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Most expensive
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:32,383	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	They're extremely intelligent
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:35,711	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Yellow is actually remember what happens everyday
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:39,039	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	So the elevator system knows that
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:39,551	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Between
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:42,111	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	855 + 9
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:43,647	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Wechat 373
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:44,671	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	People in an average morning come
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:48,511	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	So we're going to return to cars to the main floor as soon as
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:49,023	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	We possibly can
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:50,303	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	We're not going to park anything up
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:52,607	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	But it knows that
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:53,375	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	At 4:45
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:05:00,287	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Because 650 people leaving the building you get three wheelchairs to get to old people that and so we programmed
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:02,591	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Timing of the elevator to accommodate the whole
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:08,991	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	All you doing is screwing up our timing by touching that thing I mean you have thousands and thousands of people
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:15,135	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Anxiously trying to urge the machine to do their will watching people just stupid
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:18,975	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	This is cruel I have to tell you
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:24,607	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	His idea that we would somehow have the authority or the power to close the door with a pencil
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:26,399	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Am I building they work
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:31,775	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	I'm sympathetic to that Viewpoint to be sympathetic
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:35,103	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	The crazy ass vertical stack of humanity
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:36,639	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	How is that going to work if not for
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:37,663	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Beautifully designed

EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:21,087	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Valuable
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:23,903	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	I button
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:25,183	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Exactly it's
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:27,487	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	The he was a guy and his name was
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:28,767	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Button Gwinnett
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:31,583	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	What is it
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:34,143	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Button Gwinnett button
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:36,191	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Is that his real name that's his real name
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:39,775	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	That's Bobby Livingston from R&R auction house in Boston
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:41,311	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Button Gwinnett
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:45,407	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Button Gwinnett is one of two signers of the Declaration of Independence that
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:48,991	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	We're born in England and moved to the United States were moved to the colonies
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:53,599	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	He is a founding fathers founding fathers signature thousands of times
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:58,463	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And anything about that signature gets interesting in a minute
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:02,559	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Button Gwinnett was born in England in the early seventies
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:04,095	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	890 moved
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:04,863	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Did George Anthony
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:06,911	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	55 Bar and Island and
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:08,191	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	I believe he began
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:10,495	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	A import
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:16,895	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	St. Catherines Island
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:19,967	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Debtor actually and everybody
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:21,503	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	He don't have anybody money
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:23,807	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	He failed in his business
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:30,207	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	He became a radicalized revolutionary and he joined Georgia politics late in the
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:30,975	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	17 six
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:34,303	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And when it got to be 1776
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:37,631	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	In Philadelphia he was in Independence Hall
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:38,655	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And he sang
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:39,679	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	The
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:41,727	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Really it's the left
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:42,495	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And below
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:43,263	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	John Hancock
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:46,335	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	But then he goes home to Georgia
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:50,687	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And gets in a duel with his political rival and it killed in 1777
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:51,199	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:52,479	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Then
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:55,295	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	I believe in 1780
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:56,319	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	His wife passed
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:57,599	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Is away leaving only his daughter
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:08:59,647	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And then by 18.
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:02,207	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	His daughter passes away in his lineage
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:03,487	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Is disappeared
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:06,047	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	So listen to history
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:06,559	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Yes
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:11,167	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	But his signature is on that
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:12,959	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Very important piece of paper
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:14,751	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	True which becomes important
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:17,311	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Because around the 1820s the last
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:20,895	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Of the signers of Declaration of Independence were dying
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:23,711	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	So there was a nostalgia
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:29,855	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Who are the founding fathers and that's when people began collecting signatures that replaced on that document
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:32,415	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	So people collect the Jefferson
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:32,927	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Adams
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,207	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Hancock
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:40,351	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And they started thinking okay I want a whole set of the 56 men that sign that document people want
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:43,167	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	That they want the separate American
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:45,727	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	I don't think there was any more important signature than them
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:47,263	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Signatures that replaced on that.
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:49,055	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Get them all
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:50,079	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	In a problem
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:50,847	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	A rose
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:58,271	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Button Gwinnett signature they were almost impossible to find a hundred and some-odd years later
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:10:02,111	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	I went to see his collection and get a beautiful house in Florida
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:05,439	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Overlooking the bay I won't tell you which Bae but

EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:24,127	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	I could see in the middle of my eye goes right to it the unmistakable signature
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:28,991	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Button Gwinnett is like the centerpiece of a secret walk

EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:07,199	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	This is the most
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:07,967	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Extravagant
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:13,855	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Seals on it like red wax seals
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:19,231	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	So for me that the impulse impulse I'm having right here is not
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:24,095	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Just putting it in my pocket running away like a damn plus I'm having and I'm being totally Frank here
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:27,423	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Is that is the same impulse I have like you know when you want to pull the

EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:30,751	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Kind of
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:33,311	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	I just wanted to
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:35,359	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Take all of these papers
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:36,383	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	That we're honest

EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:45,087	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And then the guy really looked alarmed but I really don't really want to
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:52,511	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	It's so arbitrarily valuable like

EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:14,431	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	It just means you lean back and say whoa
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:15,199	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	How do they do that
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:20,319	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:21,087	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	To you
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:23,391	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:27,487	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of the musical score
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:32,351	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:39,263	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:17,151	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	This sort of
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:17,919	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Once we

EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:23,295	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Serta presented itself because it is V most high stakes
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:24,319	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Button

EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:28,927	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Yeah Mr President we have a crisis situation
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:35,327	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	One of our missiles silencer a thermonuclear button
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:41,727	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Is it a boy
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:44,543	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	I mean that's what we want everyone in Hollywood
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:49,151	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	We just figured okay let's go find the button
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:50,431	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	That
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:51,199	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Destroys the world
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:55,295	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	We brought in a friend of mine Alex wellerstein
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:57,343	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	All things
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:58,623	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Nuclear weapon related
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:17:00,159	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	He sat down in
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:00,671	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	The first thing he
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:02,463	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	With that
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:03,999	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	No button
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:06,815	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	There has never been a single
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:09,887	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	But when you get to like 1950
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:10,911	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	T2 1950
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:11,679	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	T3
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:15,775	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	In ordinary parlance people say where the president has his finger on the button
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:18,847	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And I don't know where that phrase comes from the butt
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:21,407	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	It's older it's much older than the bomb
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:24,479	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Real so 1910s is when all of the stuff
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:25,503	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	HG Wells
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:29,087	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	The famous but there's there's all this literature about
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:33,951	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	The crazy scientist who invented a new form of gas that can like Kill Everybody
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:35,487	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And he has a button
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:38,047	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	I need a red button I don't know if they say read
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:39,071	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	But it's definitely a button
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:44,447	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	According to Alex by the time we develop nuclear weapons existing imagery about
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:46,495	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	The scientist can blow up the world using their button
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:49,311	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Transfers to the president can blow up the world use
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:50,591	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	In his butt
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:52,127	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	I meant Alex told us something that we
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:53,919	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Surprises
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:58,783	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	He said when the US government dropped the first bombs on Japan so
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:04,159	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	The bomb that they dropped on Hiroshima and they didn't take off with the bomb armed
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:04,927	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	They took off
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:06,207	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	What's a bomb missing a piece
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:08,511	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And the missing piece is except
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:09,791	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	It's a chunk of uranium
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:14,399	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And then one of the scientists who was also a military guy
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:15,935	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Crawled into the back of the
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:17,727	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Displaying while it was in route
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:19,263	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Opened up the bomb
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:24,895	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Put the missing piece back into it and then close the back up again and turned on all the electrical switches
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:25,663	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Zedd
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:31,807	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	If we drop you off a plane you're going to have to detonate it will explode when it's a certain number of feet off the ground so presh
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:35,391	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And as for finger on the button
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:39,743	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	The finger which belong to Harry Truman president of states
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:42,047	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	With 11 time zones removed
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:44,607	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And frankly unaware of the app
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,655	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Truman
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:48,959	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	He didn't issue an order himself he started
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:49,727	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Approved
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:55,615	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	An order that was already being issued from the Secretary of War to the Commander's out there and it said
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:58,175	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	You have two of these special bombs
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:18:59,967	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Special bombs
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:02,015	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And here are your four targets you can drop them off
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:05,599	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	You could drop them on Hiroshima Nagasaki
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:07,391	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Quora and you could drop them on niigata
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:09,183	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Any day after August
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:10,207	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Third eye drops
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:11,487	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	What
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:14,047	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	He said here's a
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:19,423	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	A couple of different options choose choose for some days
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:20,191	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Go for it
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:26,591	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	No way. The only considerations are operational so the bombing order says you have
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:28,127	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Have to be able to see the target before you draw
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:29,919	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And that's it
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:32,735	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	One of the interesting thing is that I
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:35,551	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	I cannot later there was it a town called
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:36,575	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Okura
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:37,855	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And that was the
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:39,135	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Plan B
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:39,903	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Town
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:42,975	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Far city rather for her Oshima
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:46,047	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	But the weather that they happened to be good in Russian
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:46,559	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	So they dropped it there
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:47,839	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And then
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:51,167	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	The next time it was I was actually the plan a city
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:53,727	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	For Nagasaki but the weather was bad there
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:56,543	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Incidentally the bomb Nagasaki
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:59,615	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	The city of Corrigan got speared twice like you
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:01,151	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	It was so close
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:02,943	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And so true and doesn't even know
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:05,503	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	He he gets hold oh by the way we dropped
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:06,271	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	The bomb yesterday
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:12,671	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Give me when the bomb dropped on Hiroshima he had no idea if he didn't know what day
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:14,975	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	The second bomb he seems to have been caught off guard
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:19,071	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And he actually issues this is his only way of getting involved issues
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:20,607	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	An order with says
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:22,399	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Stop dropping atomic bombs
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:23,423	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Until I tell you to
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:28,543	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	I feel like if you're if you're a president and you're going to do that to that many people
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:33,407	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	I feel like you should be directly responsible should not be an arbitrary decision
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:36,479	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Like I kind of want to but in this case no
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:38,271	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	No no no
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:39,807	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	You wouldn't actually want there to be a bug
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:41,855	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	You can bump up
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:43,647	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Make a button to easy
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:48,511	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Right you don't want to be easy enough that you set your coffee down on the Oval Office table and like
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:51,839	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Kill the world right like obviously nobody wants to do that nobody wants tonight
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:55,679	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	I think it's you know I have to admit when you first
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:56,191	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Bitching about
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:57,727	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Where are they going to go
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:01,311	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And the more I was thinking about
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:04,895	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	It's a deep concert right it's about the ease in which
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:05,919	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	You could actually
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:08,735	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Destroy all of civilization
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:09,759	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Because of the technology
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:15,647	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	What you could not do in the 19 century you could not do with Genghis Khan you could do a lot of damage
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:16,672	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	But he could not kill
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:17,952	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	You know
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:18,976	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	All the people in the
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:25,888	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	The button is the symbol of how easy that is and the reason this becomes kind of crew
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:32,288	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	I'm moving to the 50s into the 60s
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:38,688	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Are vulnerable early 60s the United States is in a face-to-face with with over
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:45,088	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Cuban missiles
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:51,488	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Really really close to Annihilation that works at this time is it the president has an assistant
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:54,560	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Who has all the nuclear codes
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:55,328	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	In a briefcase
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:56,608	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Handcuffs
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:57,632	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	To the assistant
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:22:03,776	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	I'm your system if the president is in the bathroom the assistant is outside the door in the Carter if this present is at a ballgame
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:08,384	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	The suitcase is called the football and I believe the
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:11,712	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Page with the nuclear launch codes on it is called the biscuit
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:15,808	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Why
EDL	00:22:16,576	00:22:18,624	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	I have no idea where it got the name
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:25,024	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	So it's the sixties and things between the US and Soviet Union are very tense and there are generals on The Joint Chiefs Curtis
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:31,424	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Bombs away Lemay all troubled by the possibility that this would be
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:37,824	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	They would use and they advocated very specifically in very specific case there are no buttons and there are
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:43,712	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	These code people are still worried at the time about just how easy it would be for the president to launch a nuke
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:47,808	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Types of in one guy in particular guy Roger Fisher
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:49,856	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Academic policy
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:52,928	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	He's a Harvard Law School Professor he advised secretary
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:53,952	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Update on.
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:59,328	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Iran hostage crisis on the israel-egypt peace Accord he he definitely had the ear of the
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:01,120	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	He
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:03,168	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Trouble by this idea that
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:04,448	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	The president could
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:05,984	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Prairie dispassionately
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:08,032	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Start nuclear war
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:09,312	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Italy proposes
EDL	00:23:10,080	00:23:14,688	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	I'll jump in the ocean comes from his long interest in reducing the risk of War
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:17,504	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Roger Fisher passed away but we were able to talk to him
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:24,416	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Amelia Fisher I'm a professor at Dartmouth and I'm Peter Fisher I'm a senior fellow at the tuck School of Business at Dartmouth
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:24,928	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	His
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:29,280	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Solution to this by the way this would be just in the case of a
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:30,048	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	WS
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:30,560	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Surprise attacks
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:31,840	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Call the first strike
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:32,608	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Was
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:35,424	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	2 instead of having all the codes be just a suitcase
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:38,496	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	This idea was together volunteer who have the codes
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:40,544	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Put under their heart
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:42,080	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	You embed the codes
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:43,872	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And some sort of caps you all in the guy's heart
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:47,456	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Surgically any carry around a briefcase with a knife in it
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:48,480	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Butcher knife
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:51,808	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And if the president ever felt the urge
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:55,392	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	The fire off the missiles he has to go to the guy and say
EDL	00:23:55,392	00:23:56,672	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Well now it's time
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:57,696	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Give me the knife
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:23:59,488	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And then you have to take the nightstand
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:03,584	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Drive it into the guy's chest
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:04,608	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	The president has to
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:05,376	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Chop out
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:06,400	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Xcode from the sky
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:10,240	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Parked where they don't have to kill someone and pull the code out of their body
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:12,544	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Then he would have to first kill one person
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:16,640	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	In order to get at the codes that would let him kill millions of people
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:19,200	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	You have to look at someone and realize what death is
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:22,016	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	What an innocent death is
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:23,552	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Blood on the White House
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:24,064	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Carpet
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:26,368	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	It's reality brought home
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:29,952	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Fisherman says that he suggested this to friends in the Pentagon and their reply was
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:30,720	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	My God
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:34,560	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	That's terrible having to kill someone to distort the president's judgment
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:37,632	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	He might never push the button
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:39,680	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Big strongest objection is it might work
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:42,240	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	But even now I think you know
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:43,264	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Gosh
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:47,616	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Not a crazy idea at all to have the president be
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:50,432	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	If they're going to pull the trigger and blow the world
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:51,968	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Kill one person
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:54,784	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Cuz you're just about to kill tens of Millions
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:56,576	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Mostly innocent people
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:59,392	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And the button is just too easy
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:00,672	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	So what does make it harder
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:02,720	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Buttons too easy
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:04,512	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Yeah
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:09,120	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	The butcher knife
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:10,912	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Is the ultimate anti button
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:17,056	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	But how you can find a guy to put
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:20,384	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Codes inside his heart I would volunteer I would volunteer to be
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:21,920	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Really what

EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:29,088	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	Stabbed in the Heart by the president of the United
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:32,928	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	And you know what I would do I would be best friends
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:39,072	| radiolab_podcast14buttonsnotbuttons |	The president we would take walks we would go swimming together fuel be great we would be best friends
