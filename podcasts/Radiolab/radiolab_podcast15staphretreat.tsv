EDL	00:00:42,496	00:00:47,104	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	So the way the story goes it starts in 1928
EDL	00:00:47,104	00:00:48,896	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	1928
EDL	00:00:48,896	00:00:55,040	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Alexander Fleming The Story Goes who knows if it's apocryphal or not is growing stuff staphylococcus

EDL	00:01:02,720	00:01:04,000	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Especially like
EDL	00:01:04,512	00:01:06,048	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Parts of the body that are

EDL	00:01:19,360	00:01:21,920	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Hot and makes its way inside our bodies

EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:28,832	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Goes from being as benign companion to being potentially deadly
EDL	00:01:28,832	00:01:30,624	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Anyway

EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:37,280	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	And
EDL	00:01:38,816	00:01:39,840	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Was a slob
EDL	00:01:39,840	00:01:40,608	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Basically
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:41,376	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	And

EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:15,168	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Nice furry

EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:25,408	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	But on one of the places they pick up they realize that
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:30,272	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	It's almost polka dot it's got a little dead zone
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:34,368	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	All over it little patches where the staff is
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:35,648	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Dead

EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:48,704	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	He sees that at the center of these
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:49,472	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	You know
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:50,752	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Staff dead zone
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:53,056	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	There's a tiny Speck

EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:57,408	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	They realize that that mold is a
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:58,688	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Expressing a compound
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:02:59,712	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Killing the staff
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:00,480	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Around it
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:05,088	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	It's like emanating rays of death for the compound that compound is called
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:09,696	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	The first
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:14,560	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	True antibiotic infectious diseases that have been killing people for as long as we had been people
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:16,352	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Suddenly could be stopped
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:21,472	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	It just blew in through the window that is the that is the story that's always been told
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:23,520	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	However it got there it was
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:24,544	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	It was amazing
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:27,104	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	It was a miracle it was called the miracle drug
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:31,200	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	It was just it was really was a moment when the world changed when Fleming was
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:35,808	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Put on the cover of Time Magazine this is 1944 height of World War II
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:38,624	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	It was a picture of his face and the
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:40,160	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Banner on the cover said
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:42,976	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	His penicillin will save
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:44,512	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	More lives
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:46,304	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Then War can spend
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:55,264	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	And this is
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:56,800	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	I had no idea about this
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:04:02,176	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Virtually at the exact same time when Fleming's face is on the cover of Time Magazine like 2 months later
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:05,248	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Stanford researcher

EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:07,808	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Five different
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:08,832	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Strains of
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:09,344	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Stop
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:11,392	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	The do not respond
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:11,904	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	2 pennies
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:13,440	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Really
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:14,720	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Yeah this is happening
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:16,000	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	While he's on the cover
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:18,559	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Virtually the exact same moment and it's the first
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:19,327	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Fine
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:20,095	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	That
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:20,863	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Stuff
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:25,215	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Has responded to the penicillin in the world by developing resist
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:26,751	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Doma flag
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:32,383	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Set producer Stone wheeler the era of penicillin was over before it began
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:34,943	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Before it's even released to the General Public
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:35,967	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Wow.
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:37,503	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Penicillin
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:38,783	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Resistant staph
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:41,343	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Moves across the globe
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:46,719	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	End in 1957 in Cleveland some scientist gather together and they are in a panic
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:50,559	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	They have no idea why they've lost the antibiotic miracle
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:51,327	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	So quickly
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:56,703	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	The scientists across the globe for their brains together and try to come up with a new drug next amazing
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:59,519	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Edit 1960 they get methicillin
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:03,615	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	And it works for about
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:04,127	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	11 months
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:06,431	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	11 month
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:09,247	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	And so we started this
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,015	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Armstrong
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:11,295	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	There was a bug
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:12,575	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	And then there was a drunk
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:16,159	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	They took care of it and then there was a better bug
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:17,695	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Ashley found this list
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:19,231	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	You want to hear it
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:25,631	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Streptomycin 1943 resistance 1948 methicillin 1960

EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:52,767	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Drug development was doing really well for a really long time for a cylinder introduced 1980
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:59,167	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Resistance 1981
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:05:59,679	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Their best interest
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:03,775	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	The end I have on this list is
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:11,199	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	When is OLED which is introduced mm resistance mm into a few more but you get the idea
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:11,967	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Antibiotics
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:13,759	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	The entry of new drugs

EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:15,807	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Fell off a cliff
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:21,183	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Why it takes 10 years in a billion dollars to get to the point where the drug is Market
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:23,999	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	But as soon as you get the drug on the market the resistance clock
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:25,279	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Is running
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:26,303	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	So you
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:27,839	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Probably won't make your money back
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:31,167	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	And as you probably heard we now have these
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:37,311	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Situations a warning from the Centers for Disease Control about the spread of a string of germs

EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:43,199	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Are now turning up in hospitals and the patient dies
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:46,527	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	There are now bugs that can resist all of our
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:48,063	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	I've seen
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:54,207	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Physicians breakdown weeping over this it's not the way that medicine is supposed to fail anymore
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:07:00,095	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	I know that that possibly the
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:01,375	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	The origin story of penicillin
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:02,399	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Apocryphal
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:06,495	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	It's all a little suspect but you know just to enjoy imagining
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:10,591	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	For a moment like it just seems like if that happened was just open up a bunch more windows
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:12,383	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Something out of blow in
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:14,431	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	So we could wait a long time

EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:48,639	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Maybe it was the moment that I
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:52,223	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:54,783	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Or maybe the kid was a piano
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:58,879	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:00,927	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Or maybe the kids in math class
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:03,743	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,279	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	We're interested in the

EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:06,143	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	What was the best medicine for
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:07,679	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	So
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:14,079	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Said it was for a lump in the eye that occur when

EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:57,599	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Wouldn't it be nice to have a basis first time another couple hundred quid to buy the ingredients and just
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:58,367	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Skip this guy
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:02,207	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Let's give it a try and I white why the hell not
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:03,743	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	And matter fact
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:05,535	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Look at this place
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:07,583	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	We thought that too
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:08,607	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Studio
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:11,167	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Recently produced and I went to
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:12,703	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	To my tiny apartment
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:14,239	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	In the city and all right
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:15,775	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	We try to hook it up to
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:16,287	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Are you ready to cook
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:17,311	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Oh I'm ready to go
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:21,151	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Behave
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:26,015	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Okay it goes like this
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:32,159	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Wow that's the first line of the recipe and right off the bat
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:38,559	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	That first ingredient would strongly urge
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:42,143	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Nobody quite knows in a water test but luckily just a couple words over
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:44,191	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Ungodly hour
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:46,239	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Second ingredient garlic
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:48,543	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Which sum is an allium species
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:53,151	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Cropley at me know this was another alley on top of the dictionary of Old English
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:55,711	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	I'm tells us that I figured probably what they were dealing with
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:56,735	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Onion
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:18:02,879	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Carly could we didn't know which one so he's okay which one that has onion and one that has a leak
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:07,231	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	But we did it anyway
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:08,767	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Peel the onion
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:09,791	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Chop it up
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:16,447	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Disable a garlic recipe that doesn't tell you how much
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:19,519	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	So you take out the measuring cups do you measure at equal amount
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:23,103	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Is a pestle
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:24,127	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	And then after that
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:24,895	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	It says
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:26,687	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Big Canoe wild well
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:30,015	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Pounded well together
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:30,527	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Okay
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:42,815	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Lots of lots of time with the Voltron Paso muscles built up from wielding a sword for pounding the ingredients
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:43,839	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Starting me more
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:50,495	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Third ingredient you wouldn't have nothing around your kitchen
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:53,055	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Oak School
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:55,871	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Skull face
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:19:01,247	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	What are you going to kill the cow and go Reach Out And Touch the extended ingredient in microbiology labs
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:02,783	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Ox bile
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:04,319	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Today in 2015 you can buy
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:04,831	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Should not just buy them
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:11,487	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Here we go here we go added to the onion and garlic ingredients
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:19,679	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Red wine white wine with
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:24,799	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Choose and we don't know who really did they have red wine that they have white wine what was the alcohol content
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:29,663	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	But I just figured out that the monastery
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:31,455	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Wealthy
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:32,479	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	She figured out where they're Vineyard
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:35,551	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	I'm just down the road that's is more than organic formula
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:36,319	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	So they use that one
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:38,623	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Dave Coulier
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:41,183	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Just want to point out how different
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:44,767	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Italian
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:46,047	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Soolantra doll
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:48,607	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Once you get all that stuff
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:49,375	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Together
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:50,143	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Yuan to the final
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:55,007	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Specifically told that you have to mix
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:58,591	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	These ingredients together in a brass or bronze pot
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:04,991	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	I don't have one so we had to divide 2 pieces of a have a couple that would have been invited
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:08,063	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Time do we have to do some research but they figured out that the
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:11,647	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Hopper of today that is most like the copper of a millennium ago
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:16,767	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Was actually cartridge brass which is what's used to stand it in plumbing fittings
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:17,535	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	A few pennies
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:18,303	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	We actually
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:22,399	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	World War
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:29,311	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	It looks and smells like quite a nice quiet a noisy Soma suit
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:32,639	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Clearly we
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:36,223	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Botch this whole thing
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:36,991	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Honda mowers
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:39,039	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	And finally
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:43,391	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Directions say we have to let the whole thing sit for a while
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:45,951	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Has to be stored for 9 days and nights
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:51,583	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	One day goes by
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:52,351	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	My two days
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:53,119	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Before
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:55,423	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Six seven eight nine
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:57,727	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Later
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:00,031	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	You ready
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:07,199	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	On the modified
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:08,735	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Arena through class
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:10,783	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Then you have to strain it too
EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:16,928	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	The liquid that comes off you apply to the person's eye with liquid
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:20,000	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Don't matter
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:22,048	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Say bets the lock the door
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:25,376	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Now clearly we didn't have any staff.
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:26,400	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Try this out on but
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:27,424	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Freya in her lab
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:28,960	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Jimmy D's mock wounds
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:35,104	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Swifty's little plugs of a collagen says it like jelly
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:39,200	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Made to become like a flesh wound infected wounds with bacteria
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:42,784	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Then he put his thousand-year-old recipe that has been standing there for nine days
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:44,064	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	They put it
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:45,088	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	On the back
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:46,624	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Material that was in the fake one
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:49,184	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	We obviously where we didn't think this
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:55,584	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	This is going to work no we saw in I've given the ingredients we might see some small killing effects on the bacteria
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:58,400	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	. but it won't be anything to write home about
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:22:01,984	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	10% and 20% of the bacteria when they came back
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:02,496	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Next day
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:05,568	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	That was a stuff masicka
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:06,848	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Went on a rampage
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:08,640	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	It went on a staff
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:09,152	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Ramp
EDL	00:22:09,664	00:22:14,272	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	It was killing you know 99.9999 9%
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:19,904	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Cereal so yeah first we thought we made some sort of mistake
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:25,536	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	And this is some kind of sleep you know we accidentally mixed up our plates Obits label something so
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:28,608	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	They would run the entire experiment again
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:30,144	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	The grad ingredients Mash'Em up
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:30,912	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Put on somebody
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,704	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Serie A
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:35,776	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	She's absolutely wiped out the bacteria and have them Daddy
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:40,128	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Any third time at 4th and 5th and it works every time
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:42,944	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	And I suspect this is just telling you you really don't
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:46,016	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	See in your trigger some hiker playlist
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:49,856	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	And eventually they escalated from just regular staff
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:51,392	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	To the mercy
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:54,976	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Methicillin-resistant
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:57,024	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	And this is one of the bad one
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:57,792	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	A superbug
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:23:00,352	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	New government data estimate that about
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:03,424	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	2000 people are dying of community-based
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:04,704	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Every year
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:08,032	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	So Christina and Freya they sent
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:09,056	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Some of bald
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:09,824	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Brew
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:11,616	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	To one of their collaborate
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:16,992	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	State-operated Kendra rumbling in Lubbock in Texas
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:18,784	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Put it on some MRSA bacteria
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:20,576	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	And then a week later
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:21,344	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Scent-free in
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:22,368	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Christine an email
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:25,696	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	I think it was actually three would respond so I said I think she just simply said
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:33,120	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Bald best medicine had just
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:33,888	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Greek
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:36,448	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Havoc on the mercy
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:38,496	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	If she stays beyond the walls
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:39,776	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Streams
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:45,920	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Free and Christina made very clear that this is not yet a miracle drug I mean it's not even being tested in Hume
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:48,224	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	So absolutely
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:49,504	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Do not
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:52,064	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Do this they don't even know
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:58,464	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	It might be that you don't do it in exactly the way we did nasty fungus could grow in it give you a question
EDL	00:23:58,464	00:24:00,256	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Infection so
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:00,768	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	We should not have
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:03,584	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	American Eyewear
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:08,448	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Domtar Ashdown
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:12,032	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	But the thing about this whole story that is
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:14,592	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	So intriguing and so cool to me
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:15,872	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Is this
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:16,384	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Time travel
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:19,456	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Which is so strange like it's like
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:20,480	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	The ideas
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:22,528	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Something
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:24,064	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Thousand years ago
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:26,880	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Like a bullet Forge
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:28,160	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	1000 years ago
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:28,928	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	We could
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:31,744	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	We could use it now and then it could work
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:32,256	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	That that
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:34,816	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	The time-travel dimension of that is
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:35,328	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	So weird
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:43,008	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	It kind of makes you think differently about
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:45,568	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	I don't know program
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:47,104	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Song without you
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:51,456	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Harrison
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:56,832	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	For example
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:58,112	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Just a few weeks ago
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:25:01,184	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Bria and Christina got off in front of
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:03,488	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	The Royal Society of
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:04,768	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Thank you very much
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:06,816	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Pleasure
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:08,864	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Bahia hotel confort
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:10,912	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Prince room hundred or so people
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:12,704	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Apri actually got up
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:18,080	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	None
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:18,592	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Scientist
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:19,616	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Makeup look like
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:21,920	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	The results
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:22,688	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Ingredients
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:26,528	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Cooking demo and then at some point
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:28,064	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Tina said something really interests
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:31,136	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	She was like okay sure we want to write this off
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:32,160	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Because it has demons
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:32,928	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Dragons
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:33,440	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Bealls
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:34,976	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	But are we
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:37,792	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Sure that we know what they meant
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:38,816	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	By those words
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:40,096	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Like for example
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:42,144	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	There are remedies which ask you
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:44,192	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Sing For Ava Maria
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:46,240	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	And we would say all that so
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:49,312	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Distichous this is all in their heads But there again
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:52,384	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	We should also remember this is a. When people do not
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:53,152	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Watches
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:54,944	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	You do not have your nuts you know so that's
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:56,736	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Everybody knows
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:58,016	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	The Ava Maria
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:26:00,064	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Everybody knows the length of an Ava Maria
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:01,344	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	So maybe it's
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:04,160	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Maybe it's take this medicine and weight 20 minutes
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:08,000	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	And I know how to standardize 20 minutes which is
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:11,584	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Full album
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:16,192	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Appear one way and its it impact could be a totally different way
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:16,960	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Suggest
EDL	00:26:16,960	00:26:19,008	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Stat the in order to time travel
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:21,568	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	He have to some out
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:22,848	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Got it so you don't even have to
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:26,176	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	The language people understand what they were doing
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:27,200	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	There's a phrase
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:28,736	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	That the past is a foreign country
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:32,832	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	We need to learn the language of
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:33,600	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	The doctor's office
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:35,392	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Stop time we need to kind of
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:36,160	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Be a little bit
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:40,000	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Dismissive
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:42,048	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Lindsey Morgan
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:42,560	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	From them
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:43,840	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Island of Italy
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:47,424	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	But you were some reason why this is
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:48,704	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Dokkan
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:49,472	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	USA map
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:52,288	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	1100 years

EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:54,848	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Breezy long time

EDL	00:26:56,128	00:27:02,528	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	And for bacteria that's like a exponentially crazy long time
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:05,856	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	That something that this man bald
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:06,368	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Was
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:08,160	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Doing to these back
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:09,696	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Terrier then
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:11,744	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Like like it's not even the same back
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:14,048	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Yeah how could that even work
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:18,400	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	That's it that's an awesome question so you said one thing we put to think about is
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:20,448	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	But why do these medicines drop high with you
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:23,264	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	A maybe it's because when they were used
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:25,312	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	The bacteria evolve resistance
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:27,360	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	But no
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:29,152	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	1000 years later
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:32,736	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	When these medicines is not amused you would expect that resistance
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:35,040	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	This is something that
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:37,088	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Maryn McKenna mention disorganized
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:40,672	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Sometimes when you take a drug out of circulation
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:41,440	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Sometimes
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:44,000	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Resistance will decline
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:45,536	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	That doesn't always work
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:47,840	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	But sometimes resistance does the climb
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:50,656	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	So if we have been using this compound
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:51,936	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	True the ensuing
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:54,240	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Thousand years then maybe it wouldn't work
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:56,800	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Steam Discovery there like
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:58,592	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	At what worked once
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:00,128	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	And then would resist
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:01,920	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	You give it a rest
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:03,200	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	I can work again
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:04,480	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	I will be resisted
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:06,016	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Can you put it to rest
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:06,528	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	If you had enough
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:07,808	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Different
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:09,600	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	You could go to different places
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:10,880	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	The different path
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:12,928	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	Did you go to China with a now got all these two
EDL	00:28:12,928	00:28:14,208	| radiolab_podcast15staphretreat |	People studying Chinese
