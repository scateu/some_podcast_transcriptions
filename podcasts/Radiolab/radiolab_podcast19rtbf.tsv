EDL	00:00:33,024	00:00:35,072	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	But he took some of his life
EDL	00:00:35,584	00:00:36,352	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	With a gun
EDL	00:00:37,120	00:00:38,400	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Heat his position
EDL	00:00:39,936	00:00:46,336	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Hey I'm Jared I'm Rod this is Radiolab and we're going to start off today with a conversation that happened in a conference room
EDL	00:00:46,336	00:00:47,360	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Somewhere in Ohio
EDL	00:00:47,360	00:00:53,760	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Let's see so just how I got to clean comes to us
EDL	00:00:53,760	00:00:59,136	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I reported Molly Webster September we were looking around for stories
EDL	00:00:59,136	00:01:05,536	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	For something one of our challenges like bears are bad news breaking things and so
EDL	00:01:05,536	00:01:11,936	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I don't know if I've ever mentioned it but I'm from Ohio
EDL	00:01:11,936	00:01:18,336	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And so I thought I'll pull the Ohio card right now I'm going to look at this online
EDL	00:01:18,336	00:01:20,896	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	News site cleveland.com
EDL	00:01:21,664	00:01:24,736	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	But there's nothing in the story that is like
EDL	00:01:24,736	00:01:27,296	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I mean yeah it says he shot someone but he did shoot someone
EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:34,208	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I think I saw a headline on their homepage about
EDL	00:01:34,208	00:01:35,744	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The right to be forgotten
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:37,024	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:39,328	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The information about the case
EDL	00:01:39,328	00:01:40,096	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Is Preserve
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:43,168	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	It's just when you search his name
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:43,936	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	It doesn't come up
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:50,080	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Wait time at this is a room full of people trying to figure out if someone has the right to be forgotten
EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:52,640	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I didn't actually know so I just
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:58,272	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Email the guy hello written about the experiment with Chris
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:59,040	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Chris Quinn
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:05,184	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I am the editor of cleveland.com basically the head honcho I started at the plain dealer in 1990s
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:11,840	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	As a reporter Chris's story is he started out at the print newspaper the Cleveland Plain Dealer
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:16,960	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And he did he was a reporter. He did that for about five years and he moved on to
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:23,360	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Become an editor in 2013 that created an entirely new Newsroom that they asked me
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:23,872	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Me too
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:25,408	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Weed
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:30,016	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The he basically became the editor-in-chief of their online paper cleveland.com
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:36,160	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And what we really were trying to do was figure out what kind of content does the digital audience want
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:40,768	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Once he moved online was like the audience was different the format was different this
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:47,168	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Feed which they had to put up stories was different now but there was one part of the online price
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:49,472	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Kind of stuck out to him
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:55,872	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And it had to do with time and memories actually it began I think
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:57,920	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I was in 2014 when I first wrote about it
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:03:03,808	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Back in the day if you did something stupid got arrested and ended up in the paper
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:06,624	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	As it was for decades
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:08,672	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	It is printed in the paper
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:15,072	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	People would read it in the morning and then they throw it out drops out of sight it's not easy to find me nurse
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:16,352	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Some newspapers that
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:22,496	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	They kept indexes that would be at the library but even with those you have to go to the library know there was an index
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:24,800	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Look up a person's name and get to it
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:28,128	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	If someone really wanted to find it
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:31,712	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	They probably have to spend hours or days just
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:35,040	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Rolling through microfiche slides
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:37,600	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	To finally

EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:26,527	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So one of the first things that happened was that they started getting in these arguments about
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:31,903	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	How much value in article had and whether or not it was serving a public good that's the
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:33,183	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	That's the use
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:34,719	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	That journalist point
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:41,119	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	We do need names we need to put names to these arrests because it's part of the public record
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:43,679	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Kelly McBride she's an ethicist at the pointer in
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:50,079	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I did have this experience where my kid was on a soccer team and there was this coach you seemed really
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:53,407	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Questionable to me in the his behavior and the
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:55,455	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The way that he acted around the kids
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:10:01,343	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And you know sure enough on the mugshot site in my local hometown
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:04,159	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	This guy showed up for domestic violence
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:05,951	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:11,327	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I will let you know so I went to the athletic director and I was like Hey the sky can't be
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:13,375	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Working for us
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:15,423	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And that's the that's the use
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:17,215	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	That journalist point
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:19,007	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Is that
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:25,407	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You should be able to find out the bad information about somebody because you might be considering employee
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,943	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Famous person around your children
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:28,223	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	4
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:30,015	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Really employing them at all
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:35,647	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And back in the room you know the whole sense of like if I'm one of his customers
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:42,047	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I would probably want to know that there was a lot of debate is this thing the lawyer did bad enough that all of us
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:42,815	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Need to know about
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:43,327	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	But
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:46,655	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	License to practice law alright
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:47,167	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I mean
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:52,799	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I need the bar here I mean they're pretty thorough about
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:56,895	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You know looking at this stuff and deciding whether somebody is fit to Pratt
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:58,431	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You know I mean
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:10:59,711	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The bar didn't do anything
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:03,039	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So one of the big questions is
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:04,831	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	How do we make that judgment
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:06,367	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Should we follow the courts
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:11,487	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You can hear them putting a lot of weight on whether or not a court has sealed or
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:12,511	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Expunged record
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:18,143	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Which is basically the court making this decision to remove the case from its own record
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:20,703	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	This is silver lining on a cord
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:23,263	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	It said yes you've done your time
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:25,055	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You can have it sealed
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:26,847	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	We would need a very strong argument
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:27,871	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You're not to do that
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:32,223	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	How to make your argument stronger why
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:33,759	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I mean
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:37,599	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	No I guess
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:40,415	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Anybody want to make a strong argument here
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:50,399	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	In the end they decided that this lawyer dude I had the right to be forgotten and so they just sort of like
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:53,983	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	From the article
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:57,055	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And that was one of the simpler ones like
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:12:01,663	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	That thing's definitely got tougher because some of the cases they talked about where
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:02,943	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So complicated like
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:04,735	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Someone who killed somebody
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:07,039	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And then it was
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:09,343	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Legal self-defense
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:15,487	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And I was like well that's is I mean it's not murder murder but that's like still killing someone like does that person have the right to be forgotten
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:18,815	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And then one of the hardest cases
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:21,631	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Alright on the fourth one he did have it expunged
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:24,191	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Actually a cop his record was sealed
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:24,703	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	But
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:27,263	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You know it is a police officer
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:31,359	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	It's fast enough over the course of a few years
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:34,431	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Light on his timesheet and walked away with
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:35,967	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Thousands of dollars
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:36,735	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	We've said
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:38,527	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	On the front end of this
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:40,063	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Sex crimes
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:42,623	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Violence crimes in corruption
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:45,951	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Were were much less likely did to do this
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:46,719	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:49,023	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I guess this comes down to
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:54,399	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Would you view this as corruption or do you view this more as a guy who was
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:56,191	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Afton office kind of thing
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:12:57,215	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The cop
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:58,495	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	In his email
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:01,311	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Plea to the group he said basically
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:03,615	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Look I've been on the force for many years
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:05,151	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I've never had an issue
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:08,479	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I should have done this I know that but this was just one mistake
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:09,759	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You know this was not
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:12,063	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Some elected official this
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:12,575	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	It was not
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:13,855	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Use of force
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,647	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I mean this guy
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:17,951	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Skimming over time
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:18,463	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You know what I think
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:21,535	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The firefighters
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:23,071	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	We're having
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:25,375	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Time stuff to I mean that was a big problem
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:26,143	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:26,911	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	It's
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:29,471	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	But this is one guy doing one thing is
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:32,287	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Like I'm so back and forth on this one
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:33,823	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Authorities enough
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:35,871	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	He stole from his employer
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:37,407	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I mean this is like any other theft
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:40,991	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I hold him to a higher
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:41,503	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Standard
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:46,623	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	It was interesting to see people's just like opinion shift
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:51,487	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	It's not a momentary lapse in judgement this went on for like
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:53,791	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	It's only been
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:55,583	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Pearson
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:56,863	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The story ran
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:58,911	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And so
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:03,519	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I know that means something to me like this was an ongoing thing about what he had going
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:05,055	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Taken
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:05,823	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I need extra money
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:08,383	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And I'm with Mark bike the the public Trust
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:09,407	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Issue here
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:10,431	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You know this isn't some
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:11,711	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You know
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:14,783	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Water department guy skimming copper off the
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:16,319	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You know some job site
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:18,367	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	This is a police officer
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:20,671	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Stealing overtime over
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:22,207	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The corset
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:22,719	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I mean that's
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:24,511	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	A veteran
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,047	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Describe himself
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:28,351	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	But I think that it's
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:31,423	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Yeah I mean I guess I see that
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:32,447	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I don't know I first read that
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:33,471	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	But yes I think
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:36,287	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	He said let him be forgotten but now
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:38,335	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I'm kind of on the other side like
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:42,943	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And it's not a ton of money is not a public threat
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:43,967	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	People but
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:45,503	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Because he is in a
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:48,319	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Position of trust in a public position
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:49,599	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Tax.
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:50,367	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Taxpayer money
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:51,903	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I think
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:53,439	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You got the right when you're saying
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,719	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	He should be held to a higher
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:59,583	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Get back to our central question is the value of having his name there
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:01,887	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Greater than the pain it's causing him for being there
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:07,519	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Again and again Chris just steer the conversation back to that question
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:08,287	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Which is
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:12,383	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Does the value of having this article up
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:15,199	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Outweigh the harm it's causing someone
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:18,015	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	But the trip was that question is
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:20,575	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	How do you know what information will be valuable
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:22,879	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	In the future I mean if we
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:29,279	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Put the story behind a wall and other police departments don't see it what stops them from going to be
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:33,375	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	To get a job if he gets it sealed and the story goes away
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:35,935	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Other than other offices might not be
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:37,471	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I wonder if you lost it
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:41,055	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	We should look that up
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:43,615	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	We should do the research cuz if if
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:45,663	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I mean we're talking about another Tamir rice guy
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:53,855	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Hovering over the conversation was what happened to Tamir rice 12 year old
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:55,903	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Tamir rice gun
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:16:02,047	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So in 2014 in Cleveland police officer shot and killed Tamir rice after they saw him holding
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:15,103	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I did not know this but the cop shot
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:21,247	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And killed Tamir rice before he worked in Cleveland he worked at another Police Department where he was deemed
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:24,319	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And when the
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:26,879	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Cleveland Police Department was hiring him
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:27,647	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	They didn't
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:33,023	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Dig into his records and then the other police department didn't like offer the records
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:39,423	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And since it had never been a new story that was Google able like no one knew about it so he was
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:40,191	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Hired
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:40,959	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	If
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:43,007	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	If all records of this disappear
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:48,895	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And he applies to be a cop again your your would be basically our fault that he's able to
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:50,687	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Do bad things
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:52,223	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And so
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:54,527	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	In this case one of the thoughts in the room is
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:55,039	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	What if
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:56,575	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	One of these people
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:58,623	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Does something horrendous
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:00,159	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Write what if
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:03,231	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	In in a future
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:03,999	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Year
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:07,071	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You know they go in and
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:08,607	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	It'll kill 17 people
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:10,399	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	When you want to know
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:15,007	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	About their past transgressions
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:17,567	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I mean wouldn't that make those past transgressions
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:20,639	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Relevant again
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:22,431	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And he told me that
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:25,759	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	When they do decide to delete someone work we're keeping
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:27,551	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	A spreadsheet
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:30,879	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Of the names
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:35,743	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	We've taken out the very limited access how that feels like a crazy
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:36,767	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Powerful
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:39,071	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Spreadsheet
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:40,351	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I bet it in a vault
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:48,287	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I'm not sure I keep saying is this is an experiment
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:49,567	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And we're not
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:51,615	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	We're not there yet
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:58,783	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So Indian what they decide to do with the guy
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:04,415	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Split Decision
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:09,791	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I think no I actually think by the ended once Tamir rice walked into the room
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:14,655	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You could steal them the energy shift to the non deletion side
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:16,447	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	They just sort of like
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:17,727	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Wrap it up
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:19,263	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Decided not to delete him
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:25,663	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And then on to the next case which is a very good one and we'll get to it after the break
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:32,063	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Okay Radiolab will continue in a moment

EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:58,687	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And I have a question for you
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:18:59,455	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Yes
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:00,223	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	DIA
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:03,551	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Play the cleveland.com Newsroom are they the
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:09,951	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	First people to do this situation
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:16,095	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Country around the country newsrooms are tearing their hair out trying to figure out how to deal with this that's pointer
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:18,143	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Kelly right again because
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:23,775	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	There are thousands and thousands of people who did one stupid thing
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:28,127	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And that is the thing that the internet remembers them for
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:34,527	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	One of the things I found out was that it is a huge conversation but not a lot of people are openly talking about it
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:38,623	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And all of these kind of quiet conversation seemed to be
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:40,671	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Happening now
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:43,743	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Because of something that's like bubbling up in Europe
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:46,815	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	What's bubbling up in Europe
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:47,583	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Well
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:50,399	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So basically what happened was
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:57,567	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	In Spain in the sky Mario in 1998 he had basic
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:20:02,687	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Gone into bankruptcy at which point the local newspaper published an announcement about it
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:04,991	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And then 10 years go by
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:06,015	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Mario
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:12,415	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Cleaned up got his money back as life back on course and so he reaches out to the newspaper and he was like
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:14,207	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Like a I cleaned up my life
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:19,839	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Can you take this bulletin down so it doesn't show up on the internet and the newspaper says no
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:21,119	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	DIY they said no
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:24,703	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The usual reason that we publish this this is local news
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:26,495	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Public records
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:32,895	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	First public record done and then he goes to Google and he says he can you delist this from your search
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:36,991	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Search engines and they say no and so long story short
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:38,271	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Yeah she takes Google
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:38,783	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Court
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:44,671	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	It's all the way up to the European Union Court which is like the Supreme Court of the European Union
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:49,279	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And in 2014 the judges in this European case make a decision that
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:51,583	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	If something is out of date
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:53,375	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Irrelevant
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:55,167	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Or not accurate
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:58,495	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	A person can request a search engine to take it down
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:04,639	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	In Europe you can petition to have things taken off the internet yeah and it's
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:05,663	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	It is this
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:12,063	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Moment we're like a new right is established this is when you start to hear the phrase right to be forgotten
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:16,672	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The unfortunate element of human remembering is it because our
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:21,280	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Brain forgets automatically we never had to deal with
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:26,400	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Deliberate forgetting disinfector victimization Burger professor of Internet governance
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:32,544	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Oxford University I called him up when I was trying to figure out what was happening in Europe we can't deliberately forget if I tell you
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:37,408	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Please forget that my second name is Michael
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:40,480	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You will remember that exact opposite
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:45,600	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Insult the problem is we don't know how to disregard memories
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:46,624	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Avara pass
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:50,464	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	We don't know how to forgive if we remember
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:57,120	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And so as we become a remembering Society we become an unforgiving Society
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:21:59,936	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So he is a strong proponent of policies that help us
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:01,216	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Forget
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:04,800	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Even just a little bit and that's the point that I wanted to make
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:06,848	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I'm not in favor of
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:08,640	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Annihilating memories
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:11,712	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I'm in favor of putting them into shoebox
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:13,504	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And stashing them in the Attic
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:18,880	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Send it if you really want to make the effort to go up there you can take them down
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:19,648	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You can read
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:22,720	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Choreographer for glass of wine and go to the
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:25,024	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	But
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:27,584	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You don't stumble over them everyday
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:29,376	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And it's some level I think
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:33,984	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	That's part of the thinking behind the European Union policy like can we just take
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:38,080	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Take some of our stuff and put it back in the attic
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:39,104	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And pretty much
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:40,896	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Everyone I spoke to
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:41,920	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Here
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:43,968	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Says a Mario type of cases
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:48,320	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Is coming I mean basically the consensus is this is going to start going to court in the states
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:51,648	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Trailer when the European Union
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:52,672	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Went with
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:54,208	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	A right to be forgotten
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:23:00,608	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Yeah I started to look at that thinking is that we shouldn't have a la like that here cuz of the First Amendment
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:01,632	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	What is that something
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:03,680	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	As an industry we should
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:07,776	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	We should consider it and Chris's like we got to do something
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:08,544	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	But
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:12,896	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	We don't want to be alive because of the First Amendment we still want editorial Independence
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:15,968	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So why don't we just figure it out on our own
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:19,552	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And this is like every Newsroom figuring it out for themselves
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:20,064	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	That
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:26,208	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Seems to be the moment that were in right now you do really get the sense that it's like on the Fly
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:28,000	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	They're figuring it out as they go
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:34,912	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	But then you think at what point do rules come into play to do everything on a case-by-case basis by its very nature
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:35,680	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	What is subjective
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:39,520	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Alright this is a good one it's college kid who
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:41,568	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Fountain
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:45,152	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So one of the cases that Chris and the other editors
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:47,968	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Talked about while I was there was this college students
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:50,528	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Who got involved in a drug operation
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:51,808	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	We're not going to say which drug
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:53,856	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And he was doing it with some friends
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:56,928	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	We're not going to say how many this is one of the kids asking us
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:24:01,024	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Again it's it's going back it's funny
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:02,048	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	It is
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:04,608	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	College kid doing something very very stupid
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:06,400	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Bye
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:08,192	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You know what are you
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:10,752	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	He's going to talk him for the rest of his life
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:12,288	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	If it stays on our side
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:13,312	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Somebody knows about it
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:17,408	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Yeah but this is this is a college kid
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:22,784	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Doing something really dumb that mean it's bad leaving he was enabling people to do drugs
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:24,320	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Is later
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:28,672	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	He's trying to get on with his life the first. You here in the room is just
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:35,072	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Oh my God we were all idiots in college we should take these articles down
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:36,352	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	If somebody does speak up
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:40,704	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	But then on the other side difference between
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:46,080	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And you know selling pot on the side when you're in
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:47,872	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	College
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:50,944	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Or even selling drugs
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:51,712	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Other drugs
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:56,832	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So it seemed to me like you're I don't know if that's
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:24:59,136	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Think white girl let's take a
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:12,192	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Now look I mean so I'm like give until I give this guy a break
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:12,960	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	But
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:13,984	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Seems to me that
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:18,080	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Judging from like some of the other cases we've looked at this
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:19,360	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Fairly serious
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:20,640	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	He wasn't one of the ones
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:21,408	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Said they had
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:25,504	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	They were getting cleaned right like he wasn't saying I was under the influence
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:26,528	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	What's the drive time
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:29,088	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Diamine
EDL	00:25:29,600	00:25:32,160	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The conversation turns to okay
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:34,976	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Who is he does he deserve to be forgotten
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:37,792	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And to figure that out there are ton of different questions you could ask
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:42,144	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You know is he sober is he reformed was he sober then
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:45,728	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	How much time has passed how much time was he doing it
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:46,496	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Question
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:51,360	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Are the other people in here having a difficult time getting job I mean there's a lot of unknowns here
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:58,016	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You know I mean all these other people their life might be fine maybe there's another reason this guy isn't getting jobs you know
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:25:59,040	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	We know
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:05,184	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	That he hasn't done anything since then
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:09,024	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	How do you say it's coming up in every job interview yes right
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:11,328	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Doesn't employer
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:13,376	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Have a right to know this
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:20,032	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Does an employer
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:22,080	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Let us know
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:23,360	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I will take it down
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:28,736	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Later he was in college was 25 it wasn't like he was 18
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:31,552	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	To remove the fact that
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:33,344	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	This is a clean-cut kid
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:35,392	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Who was going to a private college
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:39,488	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And move the scenario to the same age
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:40,256	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The same race
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:46,144	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	But not in college and in some rural community
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:48,448	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Questions of race and class
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:50,496	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Come into the room all the other doors are white
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:53,312	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Most wins College themselves
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:55,872	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Is that biasing them in some way
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:59,200	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I mean what our willingness to to forgive this kid
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:02,528	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Be different if the social economic
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:04,832	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Issue taser
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:07,648	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	This isn't about forgiveness
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:09,184	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	It's about the idea
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:10,976	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Then on our site
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:11,744	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Because we're so big
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:13,792	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	When you search for somebody
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:20,192	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	This is the first thing you find and we haven't set any kind of economic strata for this we have instead of geographic
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:25,056	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Xstrata were considering each case as it comes in this case does this kid
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:26,080	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Deserve to have
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:29,408	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	His name is Izzy and always it
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:31,456	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Is enough time passed
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:32,480	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Is is
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:34,528	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	It's not a crime of violence and Corruption
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:37,856	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And you're not really the central question
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:39,904	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	As you heard Chris reacted
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:44,256	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The abruptly to the word forgiveness being brought into the room
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:47,072	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I don't I don't think we are in a position
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:49,888	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	To forget I asked him about it
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:52,704	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	After meeting ended I think it's almost
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:54,496	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Presumptuous for me to think
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:57,056	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	That I can forgive these people
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:58,080	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I bet you but
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:28:00,640	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I agree that is that is it
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:01,664	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	But in a sentence
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:02,944	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Taking on
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:05,760	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	If we if we
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:08,064	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Acknowledge these people and
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:11,136	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Offer them respite
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:14,464	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Will help the rest of the world do that
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:16,512	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	To that that to me sounds like
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:18,048	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Forgiveness
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:22,144	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Okay I don't I'm not
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:23,680	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I don't feel like
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:26,240	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	We're forgiving
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:27,264	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	7 people
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:30,336	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Who asked for this relief I feel like
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:31,872	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Wer
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:33,408	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Or enabling them
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:34,944	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	To carry on
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:36,992	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	With their lives
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:39,040	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Without the baggage
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:43,904	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Of the mistakes they made cuz we're at societies very judgemental and end
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:45,184	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	If somebody looks them up
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:46,464	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Cease that they did this
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:49,792	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	It's a big Mark against them I think what we can do is
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:50,304	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Is
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:52,864	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Is kind of revert back
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:56,960	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	To the way things worked before the internet the way it used to be
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:29:01,824	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Right well if we think the answer to this is to find a way
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:03,872	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	To unpublish everything that
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:09,760	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Somehow we collectively think ought to be unpublished that is a pipe dream
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:12,320	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Iran Chris's thought by Deborah Dwyer
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:17,440	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Who is a doctoral student at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill School of media and journalism
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:20,512	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I was talking to her because she has been studying journalists
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:26,656	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And how they're approaching takedown requests in this whole like right to be forgotten issue
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:29,728	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And basically what she told me is you can only delete so much
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:33,824	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Yeah. We're never going to be able to eradicate our path that
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:34,592	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	That day
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:36,384	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	That ship has sailed
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:37,920	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	But
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:38,944	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The power
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:40,992	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	That we give
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:43,552	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	An arrest report from 10 years ago
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:45,600	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	On a minor offense
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:46,880	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	That some
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:50,464	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Dilly child dead and
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:55,328	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	There now grown-up and responsible and attempting to get into law school
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:56,352	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	People
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:58,656	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Actually have the power to determine
EDL	00:29:58,656	00:30:00,448	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	How important that is
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:01,216	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Right
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:03,008	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	How much weight do we give that
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:06,848	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Organizations I talked to said they were considering not
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:08,384	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Covering
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:09,408	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Arrests
EDL	00:30:09,408	00:30:10,432	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Or Court
EDL	00:30:10,432	00:30:11,968	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Cases actual trial
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:15,296	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Unless they could see them through their completion
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:22,208	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Part of this might be being better about choosing on the front end what types of stuff we want to commit to
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:23,488	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Digital memory
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:26,816	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	But part of this is a shifting our perspectives
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:30,400	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Because if you can never totally forget something
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:31,680	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You have to learn
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:33,216	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	How to forgive
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:35,264	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Without forgetting
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:36,032	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Right
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:42,432	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	But we live in a world of revenge p*** and mugshot extortion website and public
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:42,944	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	What shaming
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:44,224	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:47,040	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So is that the type of society we want to be
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:52,160	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Because against Society that's going to forgive you for that thing you did 10 years ago
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:53,184	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Well
EDL	00:30:53,696	00:30:57,280	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Likely not right now but that information
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:31:00,096	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	There's never going to be
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:03,424	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	A perfect way to clean up everyone
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:06,496	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Path that is we've got to learn to live with it
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:08,032	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:09,312	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	If we
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:11,360	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Cant decide Maybe
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:12,384	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	That
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:15,200	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	We oughta address it with a little bit of compassion
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:17,248	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	That just be hoe
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:28,256	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Doing that one I'm looking for one of the simple ones just the delete

EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:10,912	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:14,752	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You don't have a lot of information to go offer like if you're lucky you have an email
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:16,288	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Maybe
EDL	00:33:16,288	00:33:17,568	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Stealing order
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:20,384	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And articles that featured the person
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:23,968	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And at times I feels like not enough information
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:25,760	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I used to think like I want more
EDL	00:33:26,272	00:33:31,136	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And then other times you think it would be bad if we had more information because then I might just start
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:33,184	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Like judging this person
EDL	00:33:33,696	00:33:35,488	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Am I taxed to get more subjective
EDL	00:33:36,512	00:33:37,280	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I don't know
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:38,560	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	But
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:41,376	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	There's one more chapter to the story
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:47,264	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	While a very long while after I got back from Cleveland I got an email from Chris
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:52,896	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And it said that that day they had just done another round of right to be forgotten
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:53,920	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Petitions
EDL	00:33:53,920	00:33:59,040	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And that he thought that one of the people would be interested in talking to me
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:34:00,320	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	About what they did
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:01,088	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:02,624	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Why they wanted to be delete it
EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:06,208	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So at that point I called the sky
EDL	00:34:06,720	00:34:07,744	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Hello
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:08,512	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	How are you
EDL	00:34:09,792	00:34:10,560	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Okay
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:12,352	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I made it
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:13,888	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Nervous is fair
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:15,680	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Gresham traffic
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:16,704	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I was a minute late
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:22,848	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I'm just make sure everything's settled on my end so I have you until noon is that right what time do you need to get back to work
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:25,152	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Are you
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:28,736	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I can be here longer if need be I will just like roll with it then
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:29,760	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Let me power down my phone
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:32,320	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Do you know how
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:34,624	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Try this whole episode we've been like Bleeding Out facts
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:41,536	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	We're going to keep doing that with this case will just like hold back some information in some instances we might
EDL	00:34:41,536	00:34:42,560	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Change the fact
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:45,120	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Sure it is obviously a risk
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:47,168	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	For the sky be talking to us
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:50,752	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	When I give him the chance of anonymity
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:53,312	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I'm but he is up for that risk
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:53,824	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Well
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:56,640	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You go on a journey like this
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:34:58,432	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Is a
EDL	00:34:58,944	00:35:00,224	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The person who really never
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:05,088	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Insight from a speeding ticket really never interacted with the criminal justice system and
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:07,904	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:08,672	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Between Jazeera
EDL	00:35:09,184	00:35:10,464	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Way of thinking
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:13,792	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And how you approach life and how you approached each day and so
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:16,096	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	By me perhaps talking about it
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:17,376	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Maybe
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:20,704	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	It gets people thinking about it
EDL	00:35:22,752	00:35:23,520	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Trying to
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:26,080	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	To gain understanding I guess
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:28,128	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So the story is this guy
EDL	00:35:28,640	00:35:30,688	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Should I give him a name like fake name
EDL	00:35:30,688	00:35:32,224	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Yeah give me a call
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:33,760	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Seth okay

EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:40,672	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Mm 2018
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:42,720	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Seth
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:45,280	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Was just like living a pretty solid life
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:46,048	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Job
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:47,072	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Wife two kids
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:48,864	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And then
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:50,144	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Over the course of a few weeks
EDL	00:35:50,912	00:35:52,192	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I expose myself
EDL	00:35:52,704	00:35:53,728	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Two women
EDL	00:35:55,520	00:35:58,848	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Once in his neighborhood in front of a woman who is driving by
EDL	00:35:58,848	00:36:02,432	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The cops showed up later that day but they just sort of gave him a warning
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:03,712	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	We all nothing really happened
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:07,040	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Until days later when I did it again
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:08,832	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	This time it was to another woman
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:11,904	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And what state was at the gym
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:13,952	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Cited by police
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:16,000	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The demonym starting
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:18,048	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I called my wife
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:19,840	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And I and I met her
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:22,400	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	A local park
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:24,704	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I told her he tells her
EDL	00:36:25,472	00:36:26,496	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	What happened
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:27,264	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Because everything
EDL	00:36:27,776	00:36:32,640	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Tell her everything and part of what they talked about that day with something that happened years before
EDL	00:36:32,640	00:36:33,920	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Yeah
EDL	00:36:33,920	00:36:36,224	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	When I was 10 or 11
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:38,016	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I sexually abused now
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:38,528	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	It
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:42,112	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I didn't think of it as abuse at the time
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:43,392	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Are you
EDL	00:36:43,392	00:36:45,696	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Build a lot of Guild a lot of Fame
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:47,488	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I thought I was in on it
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:48,768	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:52,096	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Who's probably okay you know that's what I was thinking
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:54,656	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And I really didn't think it had an effect on me
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:59,264	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Again these are not excuses but I think the
EDL	00:36:59,776	00:37:01,056	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Really though the
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:02,592	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The most
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:03,872	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Damaging thing was
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:05,408	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	How I
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:07,200	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Was introduced
EDL	00:37:07,200	00:37:08,480	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Two sacs
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:09,248	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And how
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:12,320	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	That became an issue me not
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:14,368	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Getting help for that
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:16,672	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I guess I'm talking all about me
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:18,464	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	But you know what
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:18,976	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Really
EDL	00:37:19,488	00:37:20,000	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Frightened
EDL	00:37:20,768	00:37:21,536	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Two women
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:22,048	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:24,864	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Sorry I'm just
EDL	00:37:24,864	00:37:25,376	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Sorry
EDL	00:37:26,656	00:37:29,216	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Eventually set the has to go down to the
EDL	00:37:29,216	00:37:30,496	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Police station
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:36,896	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	His mugshot taken and actually get charged like misdemeanor charges against him
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:41,760	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	This was a couple weeks later when the police officer called today actually going to file charges come down to police station
EDL	00:37:41,760	00:37:42,272	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I am
EDL	00:37:42,784	00:37:45,344	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I went dumb and I'm pretty much okay we got to go we got to go I got to go
EDL	00:37:45,856	00:37:48,416	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And I was wearing a hoodie and it just woken up and
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:52,512	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	No thought of my mind was like they're going to take a mugshot
EDL	00:37:53,792	00:37:54,816	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	But they did
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:58,656	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Molly if you ever get
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:38:00,448	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Cited
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:02,496	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Ever get called police station
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:05,568	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Come take a shower wear something nice because
EDL	00:38:06,080	00:38:07,104	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	It was so horrible
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:10,176	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	It's always there I'm not I'm just a couple keystrokes away
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:11,712	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	For my mugshot
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:14,784	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The worst picture I took the worst day of my life
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:18,624	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So if this it just stayed in the court system
EDL	00:38:19,136	00:38:21,184	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	No one would have ever seen that mugshot
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:22,208	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Because
EDL	00:38:23,232	00:38:27,328	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You know Seth just gets this point where he's like guilty I just want my
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:30,656	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I will plead guilty to everything I don't want
EDL	00:38:32,192	00:38:32,960	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I did
EDL	00:38:32,960	00:38:34,752	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I want to take responsibility for
EDL	00:38:35,520	00:38:36,544	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And I'm sorry
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:37,824	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	He pays a fine
EDL	00:38:37,824	00:38:39,360	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Service probation
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:44,992	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	We're told the issue some sort of statement of apology to the women I get to New therapist
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:46,784	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	But then of course
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:49,856	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	In the midst of this he gets a call from a local newspaper
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:51,136	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Somebody
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:52,928	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Tip them off that I had then
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:55,232	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Cited for
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:38:57,024	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Indecent exposure
EDL	00:38:57,536	00:39:03,168	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	From there it was picked up by paper after paper and different like online news sites until it was all over the place
EDL	00:39:03,680	00:39:07,008	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	How do you think about you think about me or my parents are still alive what are they going to do
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:08,800	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Iridescent paper
EDL	00:39:10,080	00:39:11,104	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The kids
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:11,616	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Yeah
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:13,408	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Stellata shame
EDL	00:39:15,968	00:39:17,504	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	It's almost like you
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:19,552	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	James what you deserve
EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:23,648	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And so by the time that stuff starts rolling out he tells his kids
EDL	00:39:23,648	00:39:25,696	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	He ultimately loses his job
EDL	00:39:25,696	00:39:26,976	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	In the whole same thing
EDL	00:39:26,976	00:39:30,048	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So when I would walk around and go to the grocery store
EDL	00:39:30,560	00:39:31,584	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Things like that
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:39,008	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And I'm sure it was delusional by like everybody's looking at me there is pointing it out since you know again so my kids to my
EDL	00:39:39,520	00:39:40,288	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	My
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:42,592	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Your son goes off to college meets people

EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:51,040	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So
EDL	00:39:51,808	00:39:53,856	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I think that that's really up
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:55,648	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Big part of the damages
EDL	00:39:56,160	00:39:56,928	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Family
EDL	00:39:57,696	00:39:58,464	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And they don't
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:39:59,232	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Aiden
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:00,000	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You don't deserve it
EDL	00:40:01,024	00:40:03,584	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	He said a particularly low moment
EDL	00:40:04,096	00:40:04,864	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Was
EDL	00:40:04,864	00:40:07,424	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	When his daughter came to him
EDL	00:40:07,936	00:40:10,496	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And said you're the number one news story
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:17,920	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Oh wow you know how you can see like a top news stories for your area if you're in a search engine if you doing like Google Now
EDL	00:40:17,920	00:40:18,944	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	News or something
EDL	00:40:18,944	00:40:22,016	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Apparently his story was the first one
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:23,296	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And it was his mug
EDL	00:40:23,296	00:40:24,832	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Shot in really salacious
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:26,112	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Story about me
EDL	00:40:30,208	00:40:34,304	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	He didn't do a creepy dark
EDL	00:40:34,304	00:40:34,816	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Condescending
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:36,352	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Totally but that's
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:39,168	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	At the heart of the question like
EDL	00:40:39,168	00:40:40,704	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	How do you weigh
EDL	00:40:40,704	00:40:44,544	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The value of US knowing about Seth and what he did
EDL	00:40:44,544	00:40:46,080	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Against the harm
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:48,896	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	It's doing to him and his family
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:50,432	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You know in
EDL	00:40:51,200	00:40:55,040	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	This moment all of us are probably making different decisions in our heads
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:40:56,576	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	But here's what Acts
EDL	00:40:57,856	00:40:58,624	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	According to the law
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:41:04,768	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Year after he's done everything the court asks him to do he can apply to have his records sealed
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:05,792	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Which he did
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:07,328	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And the judge agreed
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:08,352	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I got them
EDL	00:41:08,352	00:41:09,632	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Finally sealed
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:10,400	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Mets
EDL	00:41:10,400	00:41:16,288	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	This year and no one has access to the judges thinking the records are sealed but not long after that
EDL	00:41:16,288	00:41:20,128	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	He saw the cleveland.com is doing this right to be forgotten thing
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:23,456	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And so he was like oh that could be me like I could do this
EDL	00:41:23,456	00:41:27,296	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I wasn't sure if I get approved but I still had hope when I sent it
EDL	00:41:27,808	00:41:29,600	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Try to get craft a good email really
EDL	00:41:30,112	00:41:32,416	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	State my case as much as I could
EDL	00:41:32,416	00:41:33,184	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So I
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:34,976	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Have the letter that Seth wrote
EDL	00:41:35,488	00:41:41,888	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	To the right to be forgotten team at cleveland.com and I'm not going to read the whole thing here but just to give you a few
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:42,656	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You excerpt
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:43,680	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	It says
EDL	00:41:43,680	00:41:48,800	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Years have now passed since my mental crisis am I very public and salacious brush with the law
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:50,848	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I'm grateful for a few things
EDL	00:41:51,616	00:41:54,687	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The love and support of my family guided me out of the darkness
EDL	00:41:55,455	00:41:58,271	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I'm here and not in a cemetery because of that
EDL	00:41:59,039	00:42:03,647	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I continues I'm also happy that I was able to model for my children
EDL	00:42:03,647	00:42:06,207	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Exactly how a person should behave
EDL	00:42:06,207	00:42:08,255	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	After making a Monumental mistake
EDL	00:42:09,023	00:42:15,423	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	While I would do anything to turn back the clock alter my actions and spare two women from my frightening Behavior
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:17,215	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I simply cannot change the past
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:19,007	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And it goes on
EDL	00:42:19,519	00:42:25,919	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I ask that you consider me and my actions for the right to be forgotten initiative and that you remove my name and photos from the
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:27,711	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The Articles written about me
EDL	00:42:27,711	00:42:30,015	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I'm grateful for this consideration
EDL	00:42:30,015	00:42:30,527	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Thank you
EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:31,807	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So
EDL	00:42:31,807	00:42:35,135	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I got an email from Chris saying that we met and we've been
EDL	00:42:35,135	00:42:36,927	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And you've been approved
EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:37,951	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And
EDL	00:42:39,487	00:42:43,327	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	He said something like they were mentions and there's really no way to
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:46,655	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Just take out your name
EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:47,679	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So we're just going to take the
EDL	00:42:47,679	00:42:48,191	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Stories.
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:49,215	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Wow
EDL	00:42:50,239	00:42:51,519	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So I talked to Chris
EDL	00:42:51,519	00:42:52,287	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	About
EDL	00:42:52,287	00:42:56,127	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Taking all the Articles down and he said like first thing
EDL	00:42:56,127	00:42:58,943	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	McKay's is just so notorious
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:04,575	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	But taking steps name out wouldn't actually allow him to be forgotten
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:08,159	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And so it just made more sense to delete all of the articles
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:10,975	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The other thing is
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:16,607	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Seem like a case of just kind of fit into the rules that are emerging in these committee meeting
EDL	00:43:17,119	00:43:18,655	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	These are misdemeanors
EDL	00:43:18,655	00:43:23,263	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You know it wasn't violent crime it was a corruption it wasn't a celebrity
EDL	00:43:23,775	00:43:27,359	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	They thought he seemed apologetic there had been no other instances
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:28,639	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:29,407	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	To them
EDL	00:43:29,407	00:43:30,943	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	It seems like
EDL	00:43:30,943	00:43:33,247	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Pretty cut-and-dry decision
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:34,783	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You know it's still like I still have
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:36,831	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	That was not the only Outlet
EDL	00:43:37,343	00:43:38,879	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	That the stuff appeared in
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:42,207	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	So I still have a Google problem but again
EDL	00:43:42,207	00:43:47,071	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Like the record Being sealed like every little step and every day that passes every bit of time
EDL	00:43:47,583	00:43:49,631	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	You leave a mistake in the past
EDL	00:43:49,631	00:43:50,143	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Inure
EDL	00:43:51,167	00:43:51,935	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	One step
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:53,983	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Closer to a New Life Second Chance
EDL	00:43:54,495	00:43:55,519	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Something better
EDL	00:43:55,519	00:43:57,567	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And this was a big milestone
EDL	00:44:00,127	00:44:03,199	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I have question about the women who you expose yourself to
EDL	00:44:03,711	00:44:07,807	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	That's Radiolab producer Annie McEwen she was in on the interview with
EDL	00:44:07,807	00:44:08,319	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Fat
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:14,207	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	As far as the women go their Anonymous and all the articles in the records are sealed
EDL	00:44:14,207	00:44:19,583	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	But it's their story too and so at the end of the interview Annie ask Seth about this
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:21,887	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Just going to put myself in there
EDL	00:44:21,887	00:44:22,399	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Shoes
EDL	00:44:22,911	00:44:24,191	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	And if they wake up
EDL	00:44:24,191	00:44:25,983	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	To somehow discover that
EDL	00:44:26,495	00:44:29,055	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	The article about their experience
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:33,407	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Was taken down like do you do you think about that from their perspective
EDL	00:44:36,479	00:44:36,991	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I have
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:38,015	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I hope
EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:41,855	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I don't think about it
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:42,367	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Honestly
EDL	00:44:43,135	00:44:44,415	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I don't know
EDL	00:44:44,415	00:44:44,927	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	How they
EDL	00:44:45,695	00:44:46,975	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	How did think about it
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:48,511	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I don't know
EDL	00:44:50,047	00:44:51,071	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I don't I don't know
EDL	00:44:51,583	00:44:52,607	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	I know I don't know if
EDL	00:44:54,911	00:44:55,935	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	They might be upset
EDL	00:45:03,359	00:45:04,639	| radiolab_podcast19rtbf |	Don't think about it
