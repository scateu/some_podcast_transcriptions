EDL	00:00:11,008	00:00:12,800	| radiolab111314 |	Which took
EDL	00:00:12,800	00:00:13,824	| radiolab111314 |	I'll look at
EDL	00:00:13,824	00:00:17,408	| radiolab111314 |	The origins of things not surprisingly disease but also other things too
EDL	00:00:18,176	00:00:20,224	| radiolab111314 |	And you know you're all that
EDL	00:00:20,224	00:00:22,784	| radiolab111314 |	But I wanted to step in and say that in the middle of the show
EDL	00:00:23,296	00:00:26,880	| radiolab111314 |	We're going to slip from looking back at a disease that
EDL	00:00:26,880	00:00:28,928	| radiolab111314 |	Started way long time ago 2
EDL	00:00:29,440	00:00:31,488	| radiolab111314 |	Examining a disease that meow
EDL	00:00:32,000	00:00:33,536	| radiolab111314 |	I speak this happening right now
EDL	00:00:34,304	00:00:36,864	| radiolab111314 |	Irish senior editor sternwheeler will bring you that
EDL	00:00:37,376	00:00:38,656	| radiolab111314 |	Meantime here's the show
EDL	00:00:39,424	00:00:40,448	| radiolab111314 |	Are you awake
EDL	00:00:48,128	00:00:52,992	| radiolab111314 |	Radio WNYC
EDL	00:00:54,016	00:00:56,320	| radiolab111314 |	End NPR
EDL	00:00:58,624	00:00:59,904	| radiolab111314 |	So we said where we are
EDL	00:01:02,976	00:01:06,560	| radiolab111314 |	Starting as off today or are producers Lynn Levy and Sean Cole
EDL	00:01:07,328	00:01:09,888	| radiolab111314 |	Very pretty day to be on abandoned Island where
EDL	00:01:10,400	00:01:12,704	| radiolab111314 |	Victims of contagious disease were quarantined
EDL	00:01:13,472	00:01:14,240	| radiolab111314 |	And
EDL	00:01:14,240	00:01:15,520	| radiolab111314 |	One in particular
EDL	00:01:17,312	00:01:20,384	| radiolab111314 |	Lived here died here never believing that she was in fact
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:20,896	| radiolab111314 |	Sick
EDL	00:01:21,408	00:01:22,176	| radiolab111314 |	And dangerous
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:28,832	| radiolab111314 |	So this is a story that begins where it starts in 1906
EDL	00:01:29,600	00:01:32,160	| radiolab111314 |	It doesn't start on the island that starts in Oyster Bay
EDL	00:01:32,160	00:01:33,952	| radiolab111314 |	Nice neighbors very nice
EDL	00:01:33,952	00:01:35,232	| radiolab111314 |	There was this one rich
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:35,744	| radiolab111314 |	Family
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:38,048	| radiolab111314 |	On vacation there and their daughter
EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:38,560	| radiolab111314 |	Get sick
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:40,096	| radiolab111314 |	Get sick for
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:43,424	| radiolab111314 |	This is Judy Levitt Ima
EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:47,008	| radiolab111314 |	Professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:51,104	| radiolab111314 |	And she wrote a book about the story so basically the girl the daughter has a fever
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:52,640	| radiolab111314 |	Then her sister comes down with it
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:54,176	| radiolab111314 |	Their mom
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:55,712	| radiolab111314 |	The maid
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:58,784	| radiolab111314 |	About 6 out of 11 in the family get sick
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:00,064	| radiolab111314 |	And with this disease the fever
EDL	00:02:00,576	00:02:04,160	| radiolab111314 |	The first part of it both diarrhea or constipation or reported
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:06,976	| radiolab111314 |	So it can go either way I guess
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:07,488	| radiolab111314 |	What is it
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:10,048	| radiolab111314 |	Typhoid
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:13,120	| radiolab111314 |	And they couldn't figure out what could cause that
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:19,520	| radiolab111314 |	Did you see so they called in the sanitary engineer named George Soper with the public health department he was the go-to guy for outbreaks
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:21,824	| radiolab111314 |	Like this back in the Department of Public Health
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:23,616	| radiolab111314 |	Thinking you know what you get sick because of
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:27,968	| radiolab111314 |	Something dirty near you being in the well or in the pipe
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:30,016	| radiolab111314 |	Yeah so he looks into all of that
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:31,296	| radiolab111314 |	Did a hole
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:37,696	| radiolab111314 |	Test on the house in the water and everything couldn't find anything is so start stalking the family and he
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:39,488	| radiolab111314 |	He started quizzing them all and they
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:40,768	| radiolab111314 |	Eventually
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:42,560	| radiolab111314 |	He builds up this
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:43,584	| radiolab111314 |	Full picture
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:44,608	| radiolab111314 |	Of of
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:45,888	| radiolab111314 |	Several outbreaks
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:49,472	| radiolab111314 |	Going back year Mamaroneck
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:55,872	| radiolab111314 |	A New York family had a house for the store 1902 Dark Harbor Maine
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:03:01,760	| radiolab111314 |	Autumn 1906 winter 1907 New York City all these cases and they all had one thing in common
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:04,320	| radiolab111314 |	What eats
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:05,600	| radiolab111314 |	Of these families
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:07,392	| radiolab111314 |	Had employed the same
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:08,416	| radiolab111314 |	Cook
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,720	| radiolab111314 |	Which is
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:11,232	| radiolab111314 |	Funny
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:14,304	| radiolab111314 |	Because when you cook food
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:17,888	| radiolab111314 |	You kill the bacteria in the food
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:20,704	| radiolab111314 |	But this cook her most famous
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:23,776	| radiolab111314 |	Dish was Peach Melba
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:25,312	| radiolab111314 |	Which is ice cream and fresh peaches

EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:50,111	| radiolab111314 |	What does he have any evidence of the
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:52,671	| radiolab111314 |	She is spreading disease not yet that's why he needs
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:53,695	| radiolab111314 |	Poop
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:55,487	| radiolab111314 |	So he goes back
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:57,023	| radiolab111314 |	Find her at a rooming house
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:07:03,679	| radiolab111314 |	Amounts where it's at in and then the health department

EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:14,687	| radiolab111314 |	PC said here in a little more jet I need to know how you ask her that she tries
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:20,063	| radiolab111314 |	And when it doesn't work she comes back a little bit later with cops and they come to the house and
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:22,111	| radiolab111314 |	Mary Mallon
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:24,415	| radiolab111314 |	When she realizes what's happening
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:25,183	| radiolab111314 |	Disappears
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:26,975	| radiolab111314 |	Flaming disappears
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:29,535	| radiolab111314 |	Completely vanishes
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:30,559	| radiolab111314 |	They end up
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:33,119	| radiolab111314 |	Searching the entire place
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:35,423	| radiolab111314 |	And I can't find her
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:39,519	| radiolab111314 |	Finally I think they're about to leave when one of them spots
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:41,567	| radiolab111314 |	Skirt at coming outside of a door
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:45,919	| radiolab111314 |	It's a little piece of calico
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:46,687	| radiolab111314 |	Kind of
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:47,711	| radiolab111314 |	Stuck in a
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:54,111	| radiolab111314 |	Doorway open the door in their shoes and so they dragged her out and she
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:08:00,511	| radiolab111314 |	Comes out kicking and screaming and
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:05,375	| radiolab111314 |	I get her the amulets of Josephine Baker sits on her according to her
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:11,519	| radiolab111314 |	It's on her and Baker later said something like it was like being in a cage with an angry lion
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:16,639	| radiolab111314 |	So they take her to the hospital they tested her feces and urine
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:19,967	| radiolab111314 |	And they found that yes she was in fact
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:20,735	| radiolab111314 |	A carrier
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,015	| radiolab111314 |	Of
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:23,295	| radiolab111314 |	Live typhoid
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:32,511	| radiolab111314 |	The weird Island that's been awhile on him
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:37,119	| radiolab111314 |	So they isolate her and they ultimately move her
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:40,447	| radiolab111314 |	From Manhattan to North brother Island
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:44,799	| radiolab111314 |	Have a good of a haunted by
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:45,567	| radiolab111314 |	And there she is
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:48,127	| radiolab111314 |	Thanks man
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:50,175	| radiolab111314 |	We went there to
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:50,943	| radiolab111314 |	Justed
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:52,223	| radiolab111314 |	How to get our heads around what
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:53,247	| radiolab111314 |	Must have
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:53,759	| radiolab111314 |	Thought
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:55,551	| radiolab111314 |	What was yelling like
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:57,599	| radiolab111314 |	And everything is
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:59,903	| radiolab111314 |	Wheatley overgrown it was really creepy
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:02,207	| radiolab111314 |	PP because it was in such
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:03,999	| radiolab111314 |	Dissolution yeah yeah
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:10,911	| radiolab111314 |	Be careful where you step and went in there all of these medical former medical building including a giant
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:13,215	| radiolab111314 |	Hospital where they isolated tuberculosis patients
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:15,007	| radiolab111314 |	Big brick
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:15,775	| radiolab111314 |	Stately building
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,567	| radiolab111314 |	None of the other side of the island
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,335	| radiolab111314 |	They're smaller
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:18,847	| radiolab111314 |	Wooden building
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:19,871	| radiolab111314 |	Crush
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:20,895	| radiolab111314 |	Maybe we're
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:23,455	| radiolab111314 |	Wearher
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:23,967	| radiolab111314 |	Cottage
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:28,575	| radiolab111314 |	Would be if it was still standing but it's not standing anymore
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:31,391	| radiolab111314 |	Well it was one room one room
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,719	| radiolab111314 |	I had a kitchen
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:35,487	| radiolab111314 |	Rattata
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:38,815	| radiolab111314 |	I guess it's sleeping area and a sitting area
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:41,887	| radiolab111314 |	It probably wasn't so bad
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:42,655	| radiolab111314 |	If you didn't have to
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:43,679	| radiolab111314 |	To stay there
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:47,519	| radiolab111314 |	You know any places that you're not free to leave
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:48,799	| radiolab111314 |	Becomes like a prison
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:53,663	| radiolab111314 |	So we're marching around and then lenses to me
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:55,455	| radiolab111314 |	Hey look at the view
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:56,223	| radiolab111314 |	And
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:57,759	| radiolab111314 |	Holy moly
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:00,575	| radiolab111314 |	It's right there
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,599	| radiolab111314 |	That's when it really hit me
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:03,647	| radiolab111314 |	If this is where her cabin was
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:06,207	| radiolab111314 |	Then one window of it
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:08,767	| radiolab111314 |	Looked exactly on to Manhattan
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:11,327	| radiolab111314 |	You could have seen where she
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:11,839	| radiolab111314 |	Used to live
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:14,655	| radiolab111314 |	You can see the
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:15,679	| radiolab111314 |	Traffic on the
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,959	| radiolab111314 |	Streets
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:18,751	| radiolab111314 |	This was like
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:21,823	| radiolab111314 |	The most horrible Seaside vacation
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:25,407	| radiolab111314 |	Almost the whole time they had her incarcerated
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,175	| radiolab111314 |	Did they took
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:27,711	| radiolab111314 |	Feces 3 times a week
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:30,527	| radiolab111314 |	Which is you know it's not pleasant to have to
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:31,039	| radiolab111314 |	Do that
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:33,855	| radiolab111314 |	And
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:35,903	| radiolab111314 |	Sometimes she was negative and sometimes she was Posse
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:37,439	| radiolab111314 |	Wait
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,207	| radiolab111314 |	What
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:40,511	| radiolab111314 |	That's that's another thing that they
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:43,071	| radiolab111314 |	Figuring out of the X 2
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:44,351	| radiolab111314 |	She was probably
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:45,631	| radiolab111314 |	An intermittent
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:47,167	| radiolab111314 |	What is that mean
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:49,215	| radiolab111314 |	The disease is always in her
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:52,799	| radiolab111314 |	But sometimes she excretes it and sometimes she doesn't
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:53,823	| radiolab111314 |	Of them has been confusing
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:57,919	| radiolab111314 |	When I first came here I was so nervous and almost prostrated with
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:58,943	| radiolab111314 |	Grief and trouble
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:00,479	| radiolab111314 |	My eyes begin
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:03,295	| radiolab111314 |	This is from a letter that Mary wrote
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:05,087	| radiolab111314 |	From the island I have in fact
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:06,111	| radiolab111314 |	Peep show
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:06,623	| radiolab111314 |	For everybody
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:13,791	| radiolab111314 |	But if you keep reading it and in fact is addressed to a lawyer it's clear that she was fighting this and she have been sending her
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,583	| radiolab111314 |	Her own feces samples herself
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:17,887	| radiolab111314 |	Do a private lab in Manhattan
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,935	| radiolab111314 |	And each one of those was an egg
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:22,751	| radiolab111314 |	Negative tuberculosis man would say
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:23,519	| radiolab111314 |	There she is
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:25,311	| radiolab111314 |	The kidnapped
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:28,639	| radiolab111314 |	Yeah that is poisonous
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:31,199	| radiolab111314 |	Shih Tzus the city
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:31,967	| radiolab111314 |	And losses
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:35,295	| radiolab111314 |	Still there all these questions as to whether any of this
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:38,879	| radiolab111314 |	Does legal mean even George super the guy who hunted her down said
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:42,975	| radiolab111314 |	It was contrary to the Constitution of the United States to hold her under the
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:44,767	| radiolab111314 |	How long was she on this island
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:46,047	| radiolab111314 |	3 years
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:46,815	| radiolab111314 |	And then
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:48,095	| radiolab111314 |	What changed
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:48,863	| radiolab111314 |	Was
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:50,143	| radiolab111314 |	New health commissioner
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:53,983	| radiolab111314 |	And so he says it's just not right that we keep a healthy woman locked
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:57,567	| radiolab111314 |	She was not dangerous to anybody if she didn't cook
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:58,335	| radiolab111314 |	He lets her go
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:00,383	| radiolab111314 |	Back to Manhattan
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:05,503	| radiolab111314 |	But he makes a promise she did promise you signed an affidavit saying
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:06,015	| radiolab111314 |	She'll never cook
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,855	| radiolab111314 |	She was released
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:13,439	| radiolab111314 |	They gave they bathed set her up with a job as a laundress and they weren't here you go Mary
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:15,743	| radiolab111314 |	And then you know
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:17,279	| radiolab111314 |	They kept track of her for a while
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:21,375	| radiolab111314 |	And then at a certain point they kind of
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:21,887	| radiolab111314 |	Stop
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:29,823	| radiolab111314 |	So how many years will go by
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:30,591	| radiolab111314 |	5
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:31,359	| radiolab111314 |	5
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:32,127	| radiolab111314 |	What happens next
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:34,431	| radiolab111314 |	There's an outbreak of typhoid
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:40,831	| radiolab111314 |	Where we are at a maternity hospital you're kidding
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:42,111	| radiolab111314 |	Ambulance before
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:44,415	| radiolab111314 |	She says that she goes and pays a visit
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:45,951	| radiolab111314 |	And walks into the kitchen and
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:46,719	| radiolab111314 |	She says the first
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:47,999	| radiolab111314 |	Person that she encountered
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:49,279	| radiolab111314 |	Was Typhoid Mary Mack
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:56,703	| radiolab111314 |	Your topper did some legwork on
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:13:00,543	| radiolab111314 |	Where Mary had been and it turned out she had worked at a restaurant
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:02,591	| radiolab111314 |	New hotels in in
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:05,151	| radiolab111314 |	And a sanatorium as well as the
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:06,687	| radiolab111314 |	And at least according
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:07,455	| radiolab111314 |	To his account
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:08,735	| radiolab111314 |	Two of the
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:09,503	| radiolab111314 |	People that she made sick
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:13,343	| radiolab111314 |	We're children
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:20,255	| radiolab111314 |	She was now a woman who could not claim innocence she was no willfully and deliberately to have taken desperate Chan
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:22,559	| radiolab111314 |	Dances with human life cheat abused her privilege
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:26,911	| radiolab111314 |	She's broken her parole so then they put her back on North brother Island back in her
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:27,423	| radiolab111314 |	Bungalow
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:31,519	| radiolab111314 |	And there she sits
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:33,823	| radiolab111314 |	She was a dangerous character and must
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:34,591	| radiolab111314 |	Be treated according
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:35,871	| radiolab111314 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:38,687	| radiolab111314 |	Oakbrook
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:40,991	| radiolab111314 |	She's made a deal and she didn't keep the deal
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:42,271	| radiolab111314 |	The thing is is that
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:44,063	| radiolab111314 |	At the time she was sent back
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:44,831	| radiolab111314 |	To the island
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:49,183	| radiolab111314 |	There were hundreds of other healthy carriers identified all over New York
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:50,463	| radiolab111314 |	And some of them work
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:53,279	| radiolab111314 |	What is mostly men
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:55,327	| radiolab111314 |	By the way and if you're cooking
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:58,143	| radiolab111314 |	Weather report from cooking but not all of them always listen
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:00,959	| radiolab111314 |	And yet Mary was the only one
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:02,495	| radiolab111314 |	Who they isolated
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:04,287	| radiolab111314 |	In this way why
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:05,567	| radiolab111314 |	Why only her
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:08,639	| radiolab111314 |	I think it was more about
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:11,455	| radiolab111314 |	Making people feel safe
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:11,967	| radiolab111314 |	Then
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:15,295	| radiolab111314 |	Actually making them safe
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:19,135	| radiolab111314 |	The lookout for the stair South humbled
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:21,951	| radiolab111314 |	She was what we needed at the time
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:26,815	| radiolab111314 |	We're in the hospital
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:30,399	| radiolab111314 |	Where the tuberculosis patients were quarantined
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:31,935	| radiolab111314 |	This was towards the end
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:33,215	| radiolab111314 |	Of linen life is at
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:33,727	| radiolab111314 |	The island
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:36,799	| radiolab111314 |	Yeah these must be the words
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:38,847	| radiolab111314 |	Yeah
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:40,383	| radiolab111314 |	Sewing machine
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:42,687	| radiolab111314 |	This is where they brought her
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:44,735	| radiolab111314 |	After she had a stroke
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:49,087	| radiolab111314 |	And this is where she was for the last
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:50,111	| radiolab111314 |	6 years of her life
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:53,695	| radiolab111314 |	Did she die in here
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:11,871	| radiolab111314 |	Hi this is David roster
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:13,407	| radiolab111314 |	Radiolab is funded in

EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:26,975	| radiolab111314 |	Radiolab
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:30,047	| radiolab111314 |	Just by WNYC and distributed by NPR
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:31,839	| radiolab111314 |	Okay that's it thanks bye
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:37,215	| radiolab111314 |	I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:42,079	| radiolab111314 |	And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:48,991	| radiolab111314 |	And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:55,391	| radiolab111314 |	We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments of childhood Brilliance basically I want to hear about those
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:16:01,791	| radiolab111314 |	When a kid you know did something that just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:07,167	| radiolab111314 |	Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:14,079	| radiolab111314 |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:19,199	| radiolab111314 |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:25,599	| radiolab111314 |	We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:29,695	| radiolab111314 |	Doesn't have anything to do with the test if you have a story please share it with us
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:34,815	| radiolab111314 |	Go to radiolab.org Brilliance and record a short audio message for us
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:38,143	| radiolab111314 |	Again that's radiolab.org / brilliance
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:39,423	| radiolab111314 |	Thank you so much
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:57,599	| radiolab111314 |	Hey I'm Jared I'm Robert Coolidge this is Radiolab today it's patient zero
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:16:59,903	| radiolab111314 |	Yeah and end this next story
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:06,303	| radiolab111314 |	What's it's so huge it's the ultimate patient zero story really many of us have lived through this it was its
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:07,583	| radiolab111314 |	Is recent an event
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:10,911	| radiolab111314 |	It's such a recent event that it still hurts and it still bleeds
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:13,471	| radiolab111314 |	I mean it somewhere is
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:15,263	| radiolab111314 |	A literally
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:17,055	| radiolab111314 |	The the patient that is
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:17,823	| radiolab111314 |	Cold zero
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:21,919	| radiolab111314 |	So this is a lot of people going to help us tell the story but starting ass off
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:23,199	| radiolab111314 |	Is
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:25,503	| radiolab111314 |	Science writer Radiolab regular Carl Zimmer
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:28,063	| radiolab111314 |	7 in 1981
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:35,999	| radiolab111314 |	Doctors for the first time described syndrome
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:36,767	| radiolab111314 |	Actual man
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:38,815	| radiolab111314 |	The young man in Los Angeles
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:42,655	| radiolab111314 |	Paradigm the number of cases has been growing faster and faster
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:49,055	| radiolab111314 |	So far more than 80 Americans have died 258 people have died 625 people have died
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:51,103	| radiolab111314 |	Of course this is the part we all know how
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:53,919	| radiolab111314 |	From the first few cases in La AIDS became
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:18:00,319	| radiolab111314 |	One of the deadliest pandemics the world has ever seen more dangerous than the plague of the Middle Ages
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:00,831	| radiolab111314 |	Story
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:04,415	| radiolab111314 |	But I've not been able to shake the last 30 years and it's a story
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:05,951	| radiolab111314 |	I want to reimagine right now
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:09,791	| radiolab111314 |	Right after
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:10,815	| radiolab111314 |	News of this
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:15,423	| radiolab111314 |	Syndrome started to break at science writer David quammen who along with Carl will be one of her
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:18,751	| radiolab111314 |	Epidemiologist were trying to figure out
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:20,543	| radiolab111314 |	Where did it come from
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:26,943	| radiolab111314 |	And they were thinking like well maybe it's a sexually transmitted disease the CDC launches the study of a group
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:27,711	| radiolab111314 |	Group of about
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:28,991	| radiolab111314 |	30 patient
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:31,551	| radiolab111314 |	Gay men in New York Los Angeles and San Francisco
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:34,367	| radiolab111314 |	To see who had had sexual contact
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:37,439	| radiolab111314 |	With whom how do you detach a series of interviews with
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:40,255	| radiolab111314 |	Pick me up please name all the people that you that you
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:41,023	| radiolab111314 |	Subway
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:45,375	| radiolab111314 |	The CDC eventually releases the results of the survey in the form of a
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:47,423	| radiolab111314 |	Diagram
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:52,543	| radiolab111314 |	With circles representing patients in the lines representing sexual contact in each patient
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:54,335	| radiolab111314 |	Diesel circle with numbered New York
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:55,871	| radiolab111314 |	7 Los Angeles
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:59,199	| radiolab111314 |	12z to know who's who but you could tell immediately
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:18:59,711	| radiolab111314 |	When you look at this
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:03,807	| radiolab111314 |	Level 30 or so circles in a circle
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:04,575	| radiolab111314 |	It was special
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:07,647	| radiolab111314 |	Headlines coming out in every direction
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:11,231	| radiolab111314 |	Seven or eight emanating from him let the Hub of a wheel
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:16,351	| radiolab111314 |	Except all the spokes on this wheel connected to other Wheels would send shout out and catch the other Wheels
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:20,703	| radiolab111314 |	Spanning outward at the center of it all was that one little circle number
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:21,215	| radiolab111314 |	0
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:23,007	| radiolab111314 |	Number zero
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:25,823	| radiolab111314 |	As far as we know that was the first time
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:27,359	| radiolab111314 |	Do you ever get the term
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:27,871	| radiolab111314 |	Patient
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:28,895	| radiolab111314 |	0
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:31,199	| radiolab111314 |	Patient zero was
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:32,735	| radiolab111314 |	Central victim and victim
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:36,575	| radiolab111314 |	This is from a 60 Minute special in 1988 that year
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:40,415	| radiolab111314 |	A reporter named Randy Schultz has written a book called and the band played on
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:42,463	| radiolab111314 |	For the first time revealed the identity
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:43,743	| radiolab111314 |	A patient zero
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:45,023	| radiolab111314 |	He was a French Canadian
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:47,327	| radiolab111314 |	A very handsome Airline
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:51,167	| radiolab111314 |	Stewart
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:55,775	| radiolab111314 |	Few minutes later in the report Schultz comes on to describe a guy
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:57,567	| radiolab111314 |	Unlimited sexual
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:03,199	| radiolab111314 |	The sexual athlete who would fly from one hotspot to the next cuz it's job
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:06,015	| radiolab111314 |	Having sex with literally thousands of men
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:08,319	| radiolab111314 |	And as he knew he was dying
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:09,599	| radiolab111314 |	At least according to Randy Shield
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:12,159	| radiolab111314 |	He became somewhat Sinister and malicious
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:13,695	| radiolab111314 |	He would sleep with a male partner
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:15,743	| radiolab111314 |	At a bathhouse in Sanford
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:16,511	| radiolab111314 |	Store somewhere else
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:20,607	| radiolab111314 |	And then when the light came up according to Randy Schultz he would say
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:22,399	| radiolab111314 |	I've got gay cancer
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:23,935	| radiolab111314 |	Now you're going to get it too
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:26,495	| radiolab111314 |	I talked to him
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:28,799	| radiolab111314 |	Mrs. dr. Selma dritz
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:31,103	| radiolab111314 |	She was part of that CDC study
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:34,687	| radiolab111314 |	He was getting other people sick with it and he said
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:36,479	| radiolab111314 |	My right to do whatever I want
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:38,271	| radiolab111314 |	Buy civil rights
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:39,807	| radiolab111314 |	Suicide please
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:41,599	| radiolab111314 |	I've got it why shouldn't they have
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:46,719	| radiolab111314 |	This is you can kill yourself you want to be cut no right to take somebody else along with you
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:49,791	| radiolab111314 |	Screw you and walked out
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:51,327	| radiolab111314 |	Really
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:52,351	| radiolab111314 |	Chilling
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:53,375	| radiolab111314 |	Moment
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:56,959	| radiolab111314 |	I'm pretty much from that moment on
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:21:00,031	| radiolab111314 |	Hindu god he just took on this this aura
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:04,895	| radiolab111314 |	As says single-handedly causing a an epidemic
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:05,407	| radiolab111314 |	In the United States
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:12,575	| radiolab111314 |	Not invite you but I first bumped into the story in the movie version of in the band played on
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:13,855	| radiolab111314 |	Thousands of men
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:20,768	| radiolab111314 |	Was faces I cannot even remember anyone that's an actor playing getting a gun movie now when I first saw that
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:23,584	| radiolab111314 |	Is it already infected two and a half million people into think
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:24,608	| radiolab111314 |	Did it all go back
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:27,936	| radiolab111314 |	Just seemed
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:32,544	| radiolab111314 |	Unreal it was a it was a very potent story there's no doubt
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:37,152	| radiolab111314 |	And then he gave HIV to a lot of people
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:38,688	| radiolab111314 |	There's no question about that
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:41,760	| radiolab111314 |	What we do know is that he was not page
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:43,552	| radiolab111314 |	It was not
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:45,856	| radiolab111314 |	No he was not the beginning point
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:46,368	| radiolab111314 |	He was
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:47,904	| radiolab111314 |	Not even close
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:51,488	| radiolab111314 |	So here's a question that got me started
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:52,000	| radiolab111314 |	Story
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:56,608	| radiolab111314 |	Okay so the gay store that was the movie stuck in my head but what's the real movie
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:21:58,912	| radiolab111314 |	What movie can we make about
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:21:59,680	| radiolab111314 |	The beginning of the 8th
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:02,752	| radiolab111314 |	You've got something so vast
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:07,104	| radiolab111314 |	According to some estimates will have killed 60 million people by the end of the decade
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:08,128	| radiolab111314 |	What you need to beginning
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:10,432	| radiolab111314 |	You need some way of explaining how this
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:11,712	| radiolab111314 |	Zas
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:12,224	| radiolab111314 |	Easter happened
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:15,552	| radiolab111314 |	What might happen again
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:22,208	| radiolab111314 |	How exactly do we know that getting to that wasn't page
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:26,304	| radiolab111314 |	Well there are a couple reasons we know it so
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:29,120	| radiolab111314 |	So one thing that people started to do
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:30,912	| radiolab111314 |	Scientist was
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:37,312	| radiolab111314 |	Two started going back and looking at people who died who died mysteriously AIDS like things
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:41,408	| radiolab111314 |	In the past might some of them have been early cases and they started finding
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:44,224	| radiolab111314 |	A lot 12 years
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:47,552	| radiolab111314 |	Before it was recognized in this country in 1959
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:48,320	| radiolab111314 |	A sailor and Britain
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:49,344	| radiolab111314 |	Died of pneumocystis
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:53,952	| radiolab111314 |	Pneumonia and soap for a while you had all these new patient zero
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:55,744	| radiolab111314 |	A nurse in Chicago Died of kaposi sarcoma
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:58,816	| radiolab111314 |	But the real definitive
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:02,912	| radiolab111314 |	Blow to this old patient zero nonsense came by actually looking at the virus
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:04,704	| radiolab111314 |	It's out in 1984
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:06,240	| radiolab111314 |	Same here that getting to God die
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:08,800	| radiolab111314 |	Scientist isolate the virus
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:09,824	| radiolab111314 |	HIV
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:11,360	| radiolab111314 |	Which is really just a little string of
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:15,712	| radiolab111314 |	Genetic code that gets into your body and into your cells and uses your cells
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:16,480	| radiolab111314 |	Make copies of
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:20,320	| radiolab111314 |	But here's the thing when it replicates within a single patient
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:21,344	| radiolab111314 |	It copies itself
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:23,392	| radiolab111314 |	Imprecisely
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:25,696	| radiolab111314 |	It mutates
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:33,120	| radiolab111314 |	Quickly it changes a lot as the virus duplicates itself inside a person that
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:36,704	| radiolab111314 |	Often have little copying errors in the movie Temptations
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:38,496	| radiolab111314 |	It turns out those errors
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:41,824	| radiolab111314 |	They happened at a predictable rate you can
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:45,408	| radiolab111314 |	Kind of almost predict how many you're going to see a year or 5 years
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:49,248	| radiolab111314 |	And so the amount of changes that you see out there the diverse
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:51,296	| radiolab111314 |	Really of the viruses in the eighth population
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:58,208	| radiolab111314 |	Will that becomes really good information is there a group of scientists begin to look at the amount of diversity
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:04,096	| radiolab111314 |	HIV patients in the US and other parts of the world and the more diversity the longer the virus has been around
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:06,144	| radiolab111314 |	Naked use that kind of like a clock
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:13,056	| radiolab111314 |	If you have a virus here in a virus there you can measure how different they are and you would know that it would take a certain amount of time for
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:14,080	| radiolab111314 |	Them to get that different
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:16,384	| radiolab111314 |	To make a long story short the picture they get
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:19,968	| radiolab111314 |	Is the date entered the United States
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:21,504	| radiolab111314 |	Around 1966
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:25,600	| radiolab111314 |	At a time when getting to God was still a virginal adolescent
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:28,416	| radiolab111314 |	From their scientists are able to
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:29,184	| radiolab111314 |	The trace the virus
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:29,696	| radiolab111314 |	Back to Haiti
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:31,232	| radiolab111314 |	From Haiti
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:32,512	| radiolab111314 |	Africa
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:39,424	| radiolab111314 |	It's been there the longest it's had the longest time to become diverse to mutate to evolve
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:40,448	| radiolab111314 |	If you want to
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:41,984	| radiolab111314 |	Really if you want to get to the
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:43,520	| radiolab111314 |	To the real patients are as it were
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:46,592	| radiolab111314 |	The most interesting stuff come actually come from Africa
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:52,224	| radiolab111314 |	It's a one-way to try to figure out its Origins there is to go looking for the virus
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:55,040	| radiolab111314 |	Yep and that takes us back to CR 59
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:56,320	| radiolab111314 |	MTR C60
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:25:03,488	| radiolab111314 |	Can we talk about then I'm sure these are the two earliest known HIV positive human stress
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:05,280	| radiolab111314 |	And this is where for me at least
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:07,328	| radiolab111314 |	Story gets way bigger than a man
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:09,376	| radiolab111314 |	Now the first sample
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:15,776	| radiolab111314 |	Vr-59 came to light in the late 90s some house scientist on Earth are very old tube of
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:18,080	| radiolab111314 |	Blood from hospital in Kinshasa democratic
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:19,616	| radiolab111314 |	Congo
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:21,920	| radiolab111314 |	When they tested it and it had HIV
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:25,504	| radiolab111314 |	This is been taken from a Bantu man in 1959
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:27,552	| radiolab111314 |	1959
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:31,136	| radiolab111314 |	Yeah nobody knows his name nobody even knows I think what he died of
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:31,648	| radiolab111314 |	End
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:35,232	| radiolab111314 |	That was the only one for a number of years that was our one
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:38,048	| radiolab111314 |	Glimpse into the kind of deep history of HIV
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:42,400	| radiolab111314 |	Then Along Comes That Guy Michael Warby he's an evolutionary biologist
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:44,704	| radiolab111314 |	At the University of Arizona in a few years ago
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:47,264	| radiolab111314 |	Michael went back to Kinshasa and found a second HIV
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:51,360	| radiolab111314 |	Virus lurking in a tiny bit of human tissue
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:53,920	| radiolab111314 |	It was preserved in paraffin wax
EDL	00:25:54,432	00:25:55,712	| radiolab111314 |	Kind of like
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:26:01,856	| radiolab111314 |	Han Solo in in the Star Wars movie when he's kind of Frozen in in that Carbonite or whatever that stuff is
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:03,648	| radiolab111314 |	And this new sample
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:06,976	| radiolab111314 |	He was from the same town Kinshasa is the first and also
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:07,488	| radiolab111314 |	Importantly
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:10,048	| radiolab111314 |	From the same time 1960
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:12,096	| radiolab111314 |	And with the two of them
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:12,864	| radiolab111314 |	Then you can
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:14,144	| radiolab111314 |	Kind of go back in time
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:17,216	| radiolab111314 |	May be described before you can measure the differences
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:17,984	| radiolab111314 |	Between
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:19,008	| radiolab111314 |	Calculate
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:20,032	| radiolab111314 |	How long
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:22,080	| radiolab111314 |	It would take for those samples to get that different
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:23,360	| radiolab111314 |	In the end
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:26,688	| radiolab111314 |	You can use these two samples to wind the clock
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:27,456	| radiolab111314 |	All the way back
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:28,480	| radiolab111314 |	Virus
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:29,504	| radiolab111314 |	It started it all
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:35,648	| radiolab111314 |	It turned out the most recent common ancestor of those two specimen
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:36,416	| radiolab111314 |	Goes back
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:38,464	| radiolab111314 |	To do about 1908
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:40,512	| radiolab111314 |	1908
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:42,816	| radiolab111314 |	That is when it started in human beings
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:43,584	| radiolab111314 |	What
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:45,632	| radiolab111314 |	1908 South Russell
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:47,680	| radiolab111314 |	Give or take a margin of error
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:48,704	| radiolab111314 |	Well
EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:49,984	| radiolab111314 |	So
EDL	00:26:49,984	00:26:52,544	| radiolab111314 |	Around 1908 give or take
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:53,056	| radiolab111314 |	Something happy
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:54,848	| radiolab111314 |	That moment is this
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:55,360	| radiolab111314 |	Spillover
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:56,896	| radiolab111314 |	Bill over
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:26:59,712	| radiolab111314 |	Spillovers the term the scientist used
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:01,504	| radiolab111314 |	Describe the moment when
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:02,528	| radiolab111314 |	A virus
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:03,808	| radiolab111314 |	In one species
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:05,856	| radiolab111314 |	Passes into another state
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:09,184	| radiolab111314 |	New diseases in humans tend to pop up
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:09,952	| radiolab111314 |	From
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:10,720	| radiolab111314 |	Animals
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:14,304	| radiolab111314 |	So people said okay but flu comes from Birds where does HIV come from
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:17,632	| radiolab111314 |	To get a dancer you have to look Beyond human beings
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:20,960	| radiolab111314 |	You have to look at other viruses that are like HIV
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:27,104	| radiolab111314 |	How to search was on a similar disease and research animal turns out right about the time that the HIV virus
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:30,432	| radiolab111314 |	Scientists at the New England Primate Research
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:36,576	| radiolab111314 |	Some research has found a virus like it in macaque monkeys monkey it was so similar that they called it SIV
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:40,160	| radiolab111314 |	Simian immunodeficiency virus
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:42,720	| radiolab111314 |	And that's where the origin Quest started
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:48,352	| radiolab111314 |	This is Beatrice Han I'm a professor of medicine and microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:49,632	| radiolab111314 |	Interested they founded macaques
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:57,824	| radiolab111314 |	It took a couple years and still another primate species to sooty mangabey
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:58,848	| radiolab111314 |	A few more
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:28:04,992	| radiolab111314 |	The African bring monkeys Mandrill for 40 different species of African monkey
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:11,904	| radiolab111314 |	Known to have their own version of SIV so then the question was which one of these monkeys are primates pasta to us
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:18,304	| radiolab111314 |	Unexpectedly a researcher named Marty Martin Peters decided to test
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:21,888	| radiolab111314 |	Her chip to Orphan chimpanzees
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:29,568	| radiolab111314 |	She found it very very close match virus that was the closest relative of hiv-1 so everybody's
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:31,616	| radiolab111314 |	Volume
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:33,152	| radiolab111314 |	Open championship
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:34,944	| radiolab111314 |	Yes but then the question was
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:35,456	| radiolab111314 |	Which
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:36,992	| radiolab111314 |	Rather
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:38,784	| radiolab111314 |	Where where exactly
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:46,208	| radiolab111314 |	So Beatrice Han and her colleagues started looking at chimps that came from different parts
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:48,256	| radiolab111314 |	Western central Africa
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:50,816	| radiolab111314 |	Now getting blood samples from chimps in the wild
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:51,840	| radiolab111314 |	Pretty much
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:53,376	| radiolab111314 |	It just isn't feasible
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:54,400	| radiolab111314 |	Yeah because in the wild
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:58,496	| radiolab111314 |	They hide the moment they see us so if you get stuck with fecal sample
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:02,592	| radiolab111314 |	The DNA in there
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:03,360	| radiolab111314 |	And viruses
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:06,944	| radiolab111314 |	So they would just go to where the chimpanzees sleep at night
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:07,968	| radiolab111314 |	And they would just
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:12,320	| radiolab111314 |	You know collection poop bring it back to the lab and Beatrice would analyze all the viruses
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:14,368	| radiolab111314 |	Over 90 different
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:19,232	| radiolab111314 |	Wild Community from every part of central Africa over 7000 different people account
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:25,376	| radiolab111314 |	And slowly they were able to piece together which communities were infected and which ones have the closest hiv-1
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:27,680	| radiolab111314 |	That's when it hit us for the first time
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:29,984	| radiolab111314 |	What exactly hit you
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:32,288	| radiolab111314 |	The geographic origin of these chumps
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:33,568	| radiolab111314 |	In 2006
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:34,848	| radiolab111314 |	Her and her colleagues public
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:38,176	| radiolab111314 |	The human AIDS virus comes from a group of
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:39,968	| radiolab111314 |	Champs very specific group
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:41,248	| radiolab111314 |	The live
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:44,320	| radiolab111314 |	A very specific place this little corner
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:46,368	| radiolab111314 |	Southeastern camera
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:47,648	| radiolab111314 |	Between the
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:51,232	| radiolab111314 |	Bumba river river in the Congo River
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:53,280	| radiolab111314 |	These chips recently
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:54,048	| radiolab111314 |	Send it
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:56,864	| radiolab111314 |	Between these Three Rivers scenario probably only
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:29:57,888	| radiolab111314 |	100 square miles
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:29:59,680	| radiolab111314 |	Not much more than that
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:01,984	| radiolab111314 |	When we're looking at what humans have
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:05,312	| radiolab111314 |	I'm looking at what all those chimps in Africa
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:07,104	| radiolab111314 |	The most
EDL	00:30:07,104	00:30:08,128	| radiolab111314 |	Perfect match
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:10,944	| radiolab111314 |	Is this little territory up there in camera
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:13,504	| radiolab111314 |	There is no other virus that is any
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:14,784	| radiolab111314 |	Closer so that's that
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:20,672	| radiolab111314 |	So can you reconstruct the spillover and the who did it spilled over into
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:22,208	| radiolab111314 |	It's Betty no asbestos
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:25,024	| radiolab111314 |	You can understand that
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:26,048	| radiolab111314 |	And the best
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:26,816	| radiolab111314 |	Hypothesis
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:28,608	| radiolab111314 |	Is the cut Hunter
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:32,704	| radiolab111314 |	Cut Under the Sea UT Hunter
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:35,520	| radiolab111314 |	A hunter who gets cut and what we say about this guy
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:38,336	| radiolab111314 |	I mean Izzy what do we know about if we had to guess
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:39,104	| radiolab111314 |	If we had to guess
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:40,640	| radiolab111314 |	That human was
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:42,432	| radiolab111314 |	Probably a Bantu man
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:44,736	| radiolab111314 |	Living
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:48,320	| radiolab111314 |	Very near the forest or in the forest in Southeastern Cameroon
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:50,112	| radiolab111314 |	He was hunting
EDL	00:30:50,880	00:30:52,672	| radiolab111314 |	Baby had a bow and arrow maybe he got a
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:53,184	| radiolab111314 |	Spear
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:54,464	| radiolab111314 |	And
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:31:00,096	| radiolab111314 |	He kills chimpanzee
EDL	00:31:00,096	00:31:01,888	| radiolab111314 |	Bingo here's a big pile of me
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:03,424	| radiolab111314 |	And you start the butcher it
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:06,496	| radiolab111314 |	Cutting open the chest cavity pulling out
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:07,008	| radiolab111314 |	Oregon
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:08,800	| radiolab111314 |	And
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:10,336	| radiolab111314 |	Customs
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:12,896	| radiolab111314 |	And it gets blood to blood contact
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:15,712	| radiolab111314 |	Chimpanzee blood against his blood
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:18,784	| radiolab111314 |	What happens
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:21,856	| radiolab111314 |	Is that the virus in the chimpanzee blood
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:25,184	| radiolab111314 |	Found itself in an environment that was
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:27,232	| radiolab111314 |	Unexpected that was alien to it
EDL	00:31:27,232	00:31:29,792	| radiolab111314 |	But was not too much different
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:30,560	| radiolab111314 |	From
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:33,376	| radiolab111314 |	The biochemical environment it had been in
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:34,144	| radiolab111314 |	Chimpanzee blood
EDL	00:31:35,424	00:31:36,192	| radiolab111314 |	It could function
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:37,984	| radiolab111314 |	And that's the moment
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:39,520	| radiolab111314 |	Begin
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:40,800	| radiolab111314 |	That human
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:42,336	| radiolab111314 |	Is
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:42,848	| radiolab111314 |	Patient zero
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:44,128	| radiolab111314 |	But why then
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:46,432	| radiolab111314 |	Why 1908
EDL	00:31:46,944	00:31:50,272	| radiolab111314 |	I mean presumably people have been hunting ships for a really long time
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:52,576	| radiolab111314 |	Why would this guy be patient
EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:53,600	| radiolab111314 |	7 million
EDL	00:31:53,600	00:31:54,624	| radiolab111314 |	That's another of the big question
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:57,952	| radiolab111314 |	People certainly in in central Africa have been eating monkeys
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:31:59,232	| radiolab111314 |	4
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:00,768	| radiolab111314 |	Thousands of years
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:01,792	| radiolab111314 |	Larry david scissors
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:06,400	| radiolab111314 |	Really no way to know but this could have just been the right virus maybe this particular virus
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:11,520	| radiolab111314 |	Evolved in a way that made it more transmissible in humans or
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:12,544	| radiolab111314 |	Maybe you just got lucky
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:14,336	| radiolab111314 |	Come along at
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:15,616	| radiolab111314 |	Precisely the right
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:17,408	| radiolab111314 |	What you're looking at
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:18,688	| radiolab111314 |	Is Carl again
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:22,528	| radiolab111314 |	A time when this part of Africa was
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:26,880	| radiolab111314 |	Being heavily colonized the French and the belgians were Building train systems
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:28,928	| radiolab111314 |	Populations were on the move
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:32,256	| radiolab111314 |	Kinshasa which is then leopoldville it was exploding
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:33,280	| radiolab111314 |	It was huge
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:35,328	| radiolab111314 |	Cities were attracting people
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:36,096	| radiolab111314 |	From the boonies
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:37,376	| radiolab111314 |	In those days
EDL	00:32:37,376	00:32:39,680	| radiolab111314 |	So by 1908 all the virus has
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:42,752	| radiolab111314 |	To do is get from that tiny village where the cut Hunter live
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:44,544	| radiolab111314 |	Tongzhou new city
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:45,312	| radiolab111314 |	That happens
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:47,616	| radiolab111314 |	Almost certainly
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:48,128	| radiolab111314 |	By river
EDL	00:32:50,688	00:32:51,200	| radiolab111314 |	I was
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:54,528	| radiolab111314 |	Stirred by the work of Beatrice on in micro RV
EDL	00:32:54,528	00:32:55,552	| radiolab111314 |	To see what this
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:57,344	| radiolab111314 |	Scenario look like on the ground
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:33:01,184	| radiolab111314 |	I went to Southeastern camera on a chartered
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:04,768	| radiolab111314 |	A little boat about a 30 foot wooden boat with an outboard motor
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:06,816	| radiolab111314 |	Trace the path of the virus
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:08,608	| radiolab111314 |	We went down the in Cocoa River
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:10,144	| radiolab111314 |	And we stopped at a few villages
EDL	00:33:11,168	00:33:13,472	| radiolab111314 |	A couple little village is there one is which has a market
EDL	00:33:13,984	00:33:14,752	| radiolab111314 |	Where you can buy
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:16,288	| radiolab111314 |	Monkey meat
EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:17,824	| radiolab111314 |	Crocodile meat
EDL	00:33:18,336	00:33:19,872	| radiolab111314 |	And he says it wasn't hard to imagine
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:20,896	| radiolab111314 |	Have it all
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:25,248	| radiolab111314 |	Perhaps the cut Hunter gave the virus to a woman
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:30,880	| radiolab111314 |	Who then passed it on to a fisherman that I called the Voyager then got in the boat is David
EDL	00:33:31,904	00:33:32,672	| radiolab111314 |	Carried it down the river
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:39,840	| radiolab111314 |	Songo river which is the leading Goku as a tributary of the Tsongas on it becomes a bigger River 200 M wide
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:41,120	| radiolab111314 |	Which then flows
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:42,400	| radiolab111314 |	To the Congo River
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:43,168	| radiolab111314 |	The Big River
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:45,472	| radiolab111314 |	And I imagine him
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:49,568	| radiolab111314 |	Sliding into brazzaville
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:57,248	| radiolab111314 |	Around 1920 the first HIV positive man to arrive
EDL	00:33:57,248	00:33:58,016	| radiolab111314 |	5 p.m.
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:34:01,088	| radiolab111314 |	An urban center
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:07,488	| radiolab111314 |	Much greater density of humans were there prostitutes a greater fluidity of Social and sexual
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:13,888	| radiolab111314 |	Interactions and that seems to have been
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:16,192	| radiolab111314 |	The place
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:18,240	| radiolab111314 |	From which
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:19,776	| radiolab111314 |	The disease went global
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:30,784	| radiolab111314 |	So that's how it happened
EDL	00:34:33,856	00:34:35,136	| radiolab111314 |	We can take it back even farther apus
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:38,976	| radiolab111314 |	For his if you want to make a movie about the
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:39,488	| radiolab111314 |	Start up
EDL	00:34:42,816	00:34:44,096	| radiolab111314 |	Because we got it from chimps
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:45,120	| radiolab111314 |	Right
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:46,400	| radiolab111314 |	She could ask
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:48,192	| radiolab111314 |	Who is Chip seal
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:49,984	| radiolab111314 |	What do we know about chimps
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:53,312	| radiolab111314 |	Right yeah I mean everything comes from somewhere
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:56,128	| radiolab111314 |	And again by molecular work
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:58,944	| radiolab111314 |	Scientists have been able to determine
EDL	00:34:58,944	00:35:00,992	| radiolab111314 |	That the chimp virus is actually
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:03,040	| radiolab111314 |	He actually comes from two monkey virus
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:04,832	| radiolab111314 |	Two different monkeys
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:06,880	| radiolab111314 |	From two completely different species
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:07,392	| radiolab111314 |	What
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:08,928	| radiolab111314 |	Would they
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:10,720	| radiolab111314 |	Have encountered each other somewhere
EDL	00:35:10,720	00:35:12,000	| radiolab111314 |	How to fight
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:16,096	| radiolab111314 |	They probably encountered each other in the stomach of a chimp
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:19,168	| radiolab111314 |	Well
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:21,216	| radiolab111314 |	From the perspective of a chimpanzee
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:22,240	| radiolab111314 |	Monkeys
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:22,752	| radiolab111314 |	They look
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:26,080	| radiolab111314 |	Tasty this is Nathan Wolfe
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:27,616	| radiolab111314 |	Professor in human biology
EDL	00:35:27,616	00:35:30,944	| radiolab111314 |	Stanford University he says to fully understand
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:31,712	| radiolab111314 |	This part
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:32,480	| radiolab111314 |	The patient
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:34,784	| radiolab111314 |	You're a rather chimp zero narrative
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:36,320	| radiolab111314 |	You have to grasp
EDL	00:35:36,320	00:35:37,344	| radiolab111314 |	How it is that
EDL	00:35:37,344	00:35:38,112	| radiolab111314 |	The Chimps hunt
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:41,440	| radiolab111314 |	This is something you witness in the kabali National
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:44,256	| radiolab111314 |	Forest Inn in Southwestern Uganda
EDL	00:35:46,816	00:35:47,584	| radiolab111314 |	Describe to us
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:50,912	| radiolab111314 |	Watching three male chimps converge
EDL	00:35:50,912	00:35:55,264	| radiolab111314 |	On a tri-fold colobus monkeys which is very small black and white monkey
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:35:57,312	| radiolab111314 |	And one individual
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:36:00,640	| radiolab111314 |	Managed to grab two juveniles
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:07,040	| radiolab111314 |	And then the three individuals all met up and began to eat the monkey with
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:13,440	| radiolab111314 |	Why was still alive the chimpanzee was going after an Oregon you know that that obviously was a a tasty morsel
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:16,256	| radiolab111314 |	I'll bet that he was going after and and the monkey was
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:18,560	| radiolab111314 |	Screaming bloody murder
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:20,864	| radiolab111314 |	It is quite
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:21,376	| radiolab111314 |	Disturbing to watch
EDL	00:36:22,144	00:36:24,704	| radiolab111314 |	One of the things that struck me at that moment
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:27,264	| radiolab111314 |	Was
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:29,056	| radiolab111314 |	The depth of contact
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:35,456	| radiolab111314 |	Between the blood and body fluids of this monkey and the chimpanzee
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:41,344	| radiolab111314 |	The Chimps are literally covered in blood they have blood on their face in their eyes and from the viruses respect
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:46,464	| radiolab111314 |	This is spillover heaven
EDL	00:36:46,464	00:36:52,096	| radiolab111314 |	Okay so the following is the closest that we can get to a zero point in this entire narrative we don't know where it
EDL	00:36:52,096	00:36:58,496	| radiolab111314 |	And we don't know exactly the time say some hundreds of thousands of years ago from the molecular clock we know it was a lesson
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:37:01,056	| radiolab111314 |	A million years that's all we know but whenever it was
EDL	00:37:01,056	00:37:02,080	| radiolab111314 |	Chimp zero with hunting
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:08,992	| radiolab111314 |	He comes upon a monkey call the red-capped mangabey the red-capped mangabey this is a larger primate
EDL	00:37:08,992	00:37:11,296	| radiolab111314 |	Laser tree dwellings little tree dwelling
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:12,832	| radiolab111314 |	Little bit of red fur on their heads yes
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:14,880	| radiolab111314 |	Gypsy Rose spots one of these monkeys
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:15,392	| radiolab111314 |	Eats it
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:20,512	| radiolab111314 |	In the process he catches a red-capped mangabey version
EDL	00:37:20,512	00:37:21,536	| radiolab111314 |	Of the AIDS virus
EDL	00:37:24,864	00:37:28,448	| radiolab111314 |	Next sometime after that first kill
EDL	00:37:28,448	00:37:34,592	| radiolab111314 |	Weeks months we don't know maybe the same day chimps zero comes across another month
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:41,504	| radiolab111314 |	And this monkey was called a spot nosed guenon yes it's got a spot on its nose I assume there you go.
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:46,112	| radiolab111314 |	One of the tiniest monkeys of all the old world monkeys and chips 08 That Monkey
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:49,696	| radiolab111314 |	And gets a spot nosed guenon version of the a
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:50,976	| radiolab111314 |	HIV
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:54,048	| radiolab111314 |	She's got the red-capped mangabey
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:38:00,192	| radiolab111314 |	And you've got the the spot nosed guenon to got a kwena Nana manga be two completely different kinds of SIV
EDL	00:38:00,704	00:38:02,496	| radiolab111314 |	Inside the same chip now
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:08,384	| radiolab111314 |	Under normal circumstances according to Nathan both of these SIV viruses would go nowhere
EDL	00:38:08,896	00:38:12,736	| radiolab111314 |	Because when one of these viruses makes the jump they go from a place they've adapted
EDL	00:38:13,248	00:38:15,808	| radiolab111314 |	They know to completely foreign lands
EDL	00:38:15,808	00:38:20,160	| radiolab111314 |	Like a human being dropped off on Mars maybe without a spacesuit
EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:21,952	| radiolab111314 |	Basically you're entering a
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:22,976	| radiolab111314 |	Completely alien habit
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:29,120	| radiolab111314 |	Estelle's don't look the same the environment is different in The Chimps immune system would normally kill them
EDL	00:38:29,120	00:38:31,680	| radiolab111314 |	But then once in a blue moon something
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:32,192	| radiolab111314 |	Crazy happens
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:34,752	| radiolab111314 |	These two viruses
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:41,152	| radiolab111314 |	This will end up inside the same cell in the same chimp at the same time literally there is a single cell
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:43,968	| radiolab111314 |	Simultaneously infected with both viruses
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:50,368	| radiolab111314 |	S'pose on one side of the cell you got the mangabey virus and on the other
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:52,672	| radiolab111314 |	Other side of the same cell you got the spot nosed guenon virus
EDL	00:38:57,280	00:38:59,072	| radiolab111314 |	And what happens is
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:39:02,656	| radiolab111314 |	Literally inside the cell you have an enzyme
EDL	00:39:02,656	00:39:08,800	| radiolab111314 |	Call the plumber is on enzyme copying genetic information of the viruses
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:16,736	| radiolab111314 |	This is what viruses do they hijack these enzymes to make copies of themselves
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:17,760	| radiolab111314 |	Now
EDL	00:39:17,760	00:39:24,160	| radiolab111314 |	Here's the problem these these enzyme they're not necessarily that sticky and while they're in the process of copying
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:30,560	| radiolab111314 |	One virus every once in awhile will accidentally fall off mid copy and
EDL	00:39:30,560	00:39:33,376	| radiolab111314 |	Go to the second virus
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:40,288	| radiolab111314 |	Just keep on copying and so what it ends up spitting out is a hybrid
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:44,384	| radiolab111314 |	Like that
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:50,784	| radiolab111314 |	Now this new Mosaic probably won't go anywhere because 99.999999 9
EDL	00:39:50,784	00:39:51,552	| radiolab111314 |	10% of the time
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:53,344	| radiolab111314 |	Wendy's hybrids happened to dead end
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:40:00,000	| radiolab111314 |	The Chimps immune system is pretty sophisticated in his evolved defenses against these viruses and it will destroy them
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:02,048	| radiolab111314 |	But again once
EDL	00:40:02,048	00:40:03,328	| radiolab111314 |	In a blue moon
EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:06,912	| radiolab111314 |	So this is a blue moon after Blue Moon after Blue Moon to really get that
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:07,936	| radiolab111314 |	Finally you get
EDL	00:40:07,936	00:40:10,496	| radiolab111314 |	One particular mosaic virus
EDL	00:40:13,056	00:40:18,432	| radiolab111314 |	Clean the manga be in the guilin that through sheer random luck
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:25,600	| radiolab111314 |	It landed on the exact right combination of genes that
EDL	00:40:25,600	00:40:32,000	| radiolab111314 |	Allow detuve The Chimps immune system one of the amazing things to think about is how many
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:37,120	| radiolab111314 |	How many hopeful monsters you had to have in order to get that one that actually survived
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:38,656	| radiolab111314 |	Probably trillions
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:40,192	| radiolab111314 |	Then boom
EDL	00:40:42,240	00:40:43,264	| radiolab111314 |	Suddenly in a Flash
EDL	00:40:44,032	00:40:45,056	| radiolab111314 |	From these two virus
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:47,360	| radiolab111314 |	I can barely survive in the chimp
EDL	00:40:47,872	00:40:48,896	| radiolab111314 |	You get a new virus
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:52,224	| radiolab111314 |	Little bit mangabey little bit wine in can only survive in the chimp
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:56,064	| radiolab111314 |	Facts for this baby virus
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:40:56,832	| radiolab111314 |	The chimp is the perfect
EDL	00:40:58,112	00:40:59,648	| radiolab111314 |	And that was the virus that ended up
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:00,672	| radiolab111314 |	Spreading
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:02,976	| radiolab111314 |	Jumping over into humans
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:05,536	| radiolab111314 |	And it's been this
EDL	00:41:05,536	00:41:07,328	| radiolab111314 |	Massive incredibly traumatic
EDL	00:41:08,096	00:41:10,400	| radiolab111314 |	Sort of tear in the fabric of humanity
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:23,200	| radiolab111314 |	Let me add another event
EDL	00:41:24,224	00:41:26,528	| radiolab111314 |	They're essentially 12 major groups
EDL	00:41:26,528	00:41:28,064	| radiolab111314 |	Of the HIV virus
EDL	00:41:28,832	00:41:30,112	| radiolab111314 |	What David means is it
EDL	00:41:30,112	00:41:32,416	| radiolab111314 |	12 different kinds of HIV virus
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:35,232	| radiolab111314 |	Have spilled over 12 different
EDL	00:41:35,232	00:41:37,280	| radiolab111314 |	Times 8 of them came from monkeys
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:39,328	| radiolab111314 |	Three of them came from chimps
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:40,352	| radiolab111314 |	And one came from Gorillaz
EDL	00:41:41,376	00:41:43,168	| radiolab111314 |	And of those 12
EDL	00:41:43,168	00:41:44,704	| radiolab111314 |	Only one of them
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:46,752	| radiolab111314 |	Is responsible for the global pandemic
EDL	00:41:47,520	00:41:49,824	| radiolab111314 |	12 times 12 times that we know about
EDL	00:41:50,336	00:41:52,895	| radiolab111314 |	Probably happened dozens and dozens more time
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:53,919	| radiolab111314 |	That we don't know about
EDL	00:41:54,431	00:41:55,199	| radiolab111314 |	So
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:42:01,343	| radiolab111314 |	Spillover is not a highly improbable event these sorts of viruses are constantly paying it us
EDL	00:42:01,343	00:42:03,135	| radiolab111314 |	They're paying us and pinging it us
EDL	00:42:03,135	00:42:04,671	| radiolab111314 |	We see it happening all the time
EDL	00:42:04,671	00:42:05,695	| radiolab111314 |	You see it happening
EDL	00:42:05,695	00:42:06,463	| radiolab111314 |	All time
EDL	00:42:06,463	00:42:08,255	| radiolab111314 |	Nathan is set up a series of monitoring
EDL	00:42:08,767	00:42:13,887	| radiolab111314 |	In places like central Africa and he and his colleagues been tracking what he calls the viral chatter
EDL	00:42:14,399	00:42:20,799	| radiolab111314 |	In the people who hunt these primates we collected specimens from the animals that they were hunting they compared that the boy
EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:26,943	| radiolab111314 |	Blood samples from Hunters themselves and guess what we found a whole range of new retroviruses that were moving over into these
EDL	00:42:27,711	00:42:30,783	| radiolab111314 |	For example he's been tracking something called the Simian foamy virus
EDL	00:42:31,295	00:42:35,391	| radiolab111314 |	Which is in the same family as HIV and he's seen it hot from an individual gorilla
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:37,951	| radiolab111314 |	To an individual human who killed that guy
EDL	00:42:38,463	00:42:43,583	| radiolab111314 |	Yeah these are almost certainly what we call primary transmission events houses you really are looking at the
EDL	00:42:44,095	00:42:45,631	| radiolab111314 |	Potential beginning of something
EDL	00:42:45,631	00:42:49,215	| radiolab111314 |	Yes you want to Patient Zero really clear patient zero
EDL	00:42:49,727	00:42:53,055	| radiolab111314 |	Buy it some of these individuals have been infected with these viruses
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:54,591	| radiolab111314 |	And the real question is
EDL	00:42:55,103	00:42:56,639	| radiolab111314 |	How do we stop patient zero
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:43:00,479	| radiolab111314 |	How to avoid patient
EDL	00:43:00,479	00:43:02,783	| radiolab111314 |	Patient one patient exactly
EDL	00:43:02,783	00:43:04,575	| radiolab111314 |	So Nathan is developing a series of
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:05,343	| radiolab111314 |	Tools
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:06,879	| radiolab111314 |	Like digital surveillance
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:08,159	| radiolab111314 |	Some of these places
EDL	00:43:09,951	00:43:13,279	| radiolab111314 |	I work in some places in Democratic Republic of Congo
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:16,351	| radiolab111314 |	You basically have to fly in to get there no roads
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:17,887	| radiolab111314 |	Electricity
EDL	00:43:18,911	00:43:20,703	| radiolab111314 |	But these places are still have cell phones
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:25,311	| radiolab111314 |	So Nathan has begun to track cell phone call patterns in these communities
EDL	00:43:25,311	00:43:26,335	| radiolab111314 |	So he sees a blip
EDL	00:43:27,359	00:43:28,639	| radiolab111314 |	Many calls
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:32,223	| radiolab111314 |	The medical center within a short. Of time okay boom now we got to investigate that
EDL	00:43:32,735	00:43:33,247	| radiolab111314 |	We
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:37,343	| radiolab111314 |	Continue to find viruses that are completely novel
EDL	00:43:37,343	00:43:39,647	| radiolab111314 |	And we're looking to
EDL	00:43:39,647	00:43:41,439	| radiolab111314 |	Determine if these are
EDL	00:43:41,439	00:43:43,231	| radiolab111314 |	If these are the next HIV
EDL	00:43:43,231	00:43:44,255	| radiolab111314 |	Is anybody says
EDL	00:43:44,767	00:43:45,791	| radiolab111314 |	HIV
EDL	00:43:45,791	00:43:48,863	| radiolab111314 |	Landed in humans at 1908 but we didn't know about it
EDL	00:43:49,375	00:43:52,191	| radiolab111314 |	Until 1981 we had decades
EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:53,727	| radiolab111314 |	Time on this was a virus
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:54,495	| radiolab111314 |	4 thread global
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:56,287	| radiolab111314 |	What if we been looking for it
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:09,087	| radiolab111314 |	Lot of people to thank for this Eggman
EDL	00:44:09,087	00:44:10,367	| radiolab111314 |	Thanks to Nathan Wolfe
EDL	00:44:10,367	00:44:16,767	| radiolab111314 |	For being Nathan and he has an awesome new book called The Viral storm book on viruses
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:21,119	| radiolab111314 |	This is called a planet of viruses and thank you also to him and to Michael Barbie
EDL	00:44:21,631	00:44:28,031	| radiolab111314 |	Are there interview was recorded on a podcast from Meet the scientist what you can find at microworld
EDL	00:44:28,031	00:44:34,431	| radiolab111314 |	Text David quammen who's got a book called spillover coming out very soon which is all about diseases crossing over from animals
EDL	00:44:34,431	00:44:40,319	| radiolab111314 |	And also to Beatrice hangzhou University of Pennsylvania
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:40,831	| radiolab111314 |	Letting us use
EDL	00:44:43,647	00:44:47,743	| radiolab111314 |	Hey this is Storm wheeler a senior editor and producer Radiolab with a quick update

EDL	00:44:51,071	00:44:52,351	| radiolab111314 |	Been out for a couple years now and
EDL	00:44:53,119	00:44:56,703	| radiolab111314 |	We all know we are actually now at this moment facing
EDL	00:44:56,703	00:44:58,239	| radiolab111314 |	Tragic consequences
EDL	00:44:58,239	00:44:59,263	| radiolab111314 |	Another spelling
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:04,383	| radiolab111314 |	This time it's the Ebola virus and we found ourselves wondering just
EDL	00:45:04,383	00:45:05,151	| radiolab111314 |	How far
EDL	00:45:05,663	00:45:06,431	| radiolab111314 |	Going to spill
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:07,967	| radiolab111314 |	Alright okay
EDL	00:45:08,735	00:45:13,343	| radiolab111314 |	So Robert and I called up David climate again he had actually just reprinted with updates
EDL	00:45:13,343	00:45:14,623	| radiolab111314 |	The chapter about a bullet from
EDL	00:45:14,623	00:45:16,159	| radiolab111314 |	Yeah Ebola
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:19,743	| radiolab111314 |	The natural and human history of a deadly virus
EDL	00:45:19,743	00:45:23,327	| radiolab111314 |	How old is this disease anyone have any idea
EDL	00:45:23,327	00:45:28,447	| radiolab111314 |	Well is a human disease as far as we know it dates the 1976
EDL	00:45:28,447	00:45:31,263	| radiolab111314 |	There was this outbreak of a strange disease
EDL	00:45:32,031	00:45:35,359	| radiolab111314 |	At the youngbou Commission in Northern Zaire
EDL	00:45:35,359	00:45:36,895	| radiolab111314 |	318 cases
EDL	00:45:37,663	00:45:38,943	| radiolab111314 |	180 people died
EDL	00:45:38,943	00:45:40,479	| radiolab111314 |	And then there was another one
EDL	00:45:40,479	00:45:45,599	| radiolab111314 |	In Sudan at about the same time this time a hundred and fifty-one people die and then it just
EDL	00:45:46,367	00:45:47,135	| radiolab111314 |	Appears
EDL	00:45:47,135	00:45:49,183	| radiolab111314 |	Hiding in the forest Without a Trace
EDL	00:45:49,183	00:45:49,951	| radiolab111314 |	Until
EDL	00:45:50,719	00:45:54,559	| radiolab111314 |	1994 thousands of miles away in Gabon another outbreak
EDL	00:45:54,559	00:45:58,143	| radiolab111314 |	Yes that's what that's the history since 1976 it disappears for
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:46:03,263	| radiolab111314 |	For two or three years at a time sometimes it disappears for a decade and then it spills over
EDL	00:46:03,263	00:46:09,151	| radiolab111314 |	Because it's a human outbreak if something is in the closet and is going to jump out of
EDL	00:46:09,151	00:46:10,943	| radiolab111314 |	Use end of natural question to ask
EDL	00:46:11,455	00:46:12,223	| radiolab111314 |	Where's the class
EDL	00:46:12,735	00:46:13,503	| radiolab111314 |	Where is it high tide
EDL	00:46:14,271	00:46:16,575	| radiolab111314 |	Well then the main suspects
EDL	00:46:16,575	00:46:17,855	| radiolab111314 |	Are bats
EDL	00:46:17,855	00:46:19,647	| radiolab111314 |	We don't know that for sure
EDL	00:46:19,647	00:46:23,487	| radiolab111314 |	Because nobody has ever isolated live Ebola virus
EDL	00:46:23,487	00:46:29,887	| radiolab111314 |	From an African bat have they tried how they looked and lots and lots of bad and all kinds of animals they looked at
EDL	00:46:29,887	00:46:32,447	| radiolab111314 |	Can insects sanlitun snakes it looked in forest
EDL	00:46:32,447	00:46:38,847	| radiolab111314 |	Antelopes they looked in monkeys they looked in Plants literally hundreds of different species they looked in found zero traces of
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:44,223	| radiolab111314 |	Live Ebola virus so we really don't know where it's coming from or where it might come from next
EDL	00:46:44,223	00:46:44,735	| radiolab111314 |	No
EDL	00:46:46,271	00:46:47,295	| radiolab111314 |	Can I just
EDL	00:46:47,807	00:46:48,831	| radiolab111314 |	Ask you just added
EDL	00:46:48,831	00:46:50,623	| radiolab111314 |	Describe the Ebola virus
EDL	00:46:51,647	00:46:55,999	| radiolab111314 |	It's apparently at Thursdays are generally teeny is this a teeny teeny teeny one
EDL	00:46:56,511	00:46:59,583	| radiolab111314 |	Yes yeah it's a teeny virus that belongs to
EDL	00:46:59,583	00:47:01,631	| radiolab111314 |	Family they call the filo viruses
EDL	00:47:02,399	00:47:03,935	| radiolab111314 |	Filo is in thread
EDL	00:47:03,935	00:47:05,471	| radiolab111314 |	It's a it's a spaghetti shaped
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:08,799	| radiolab111314 |	Virus genome is carried on
EDL	00:47:08,799	00:47:10,591	| radiolab111314 |	Just one strand of the
EDL	00:47:11,103	00:47:12,639	| radiolab111314 |	The genetic material
EDL	00:47:12,639	00:47:13,663	| radiolab111314 |	RNA
EDL	00:47:13,663	00:47:15,455	| radiolab111314 |	And while those jeans have lead
EDL	00:47:15,455	00:47:21,855	| radiolab111314 |	The virus live happily for hundreds of thousands even millions of years and bats or whatever animal lives in
EDL	00:47:21,855	00:47:23,391	| radiolab111314 |	When it gets into humans
EDL	00:47:23,391	00:47:24,927	| radiolab111314 |	Ebola Burns too hot
EDL	00:47:24,927	00:47:27,743	| radiolab111314 |	It makes so many copies of itself so quickly that it
EDL	00:47:27,743	00:47:31,583	| radiolab111314 |	Destroys the body in a person is usually dead within a few weeks
EDL	00:47:32,095	00:47:33,631	| radiolab111314 |	David says is
EDL	00:47:33,631	00:47:34,655	| radiolab111314 |	Actually bad for the fire
EDL	00:47:35,167	00:47:41,055	| radiolab111314 |	Because Ebola can only pass through direct contact with bodily fluids and because it kills so quickly
EDL	00:47:41,055	00:47:43,615	| radiolab111314 |	It doesn't have a lot of opportunities to get
EDL	00:47:43,615	00:47:46,687	| radiolab111314 |	Into the next person so the scientist have a term for that too
EDL	00:47:46,687	00:47:50,783	| radiolab111314 |	They call at least they used to call us a dead end host how's that for afraid
EDL	00:47:50,783	00:47:52,063	| radiolab111314 |	Where the dead end host
EDL	00:47:52,063	00:47:53,087	| radiolab111314 |	Puppy Bowl
EDL	00:47:53,087	00:47:56,159	| radiolab111314 |	And that means that when Ebola gets into us
EDL	00:47:56,159	00:48:00,255	| radiolab111314 |	It has no great future it's either going to burn out and come to an end
EDL	00:48:00,255	00:48:01,535	| radiolab111314 |	Are we going to stop it
EDL	00:48:01,535	00:48:07,679	| radiolab111314 |	But right now we don't seem like a dead end host yeah I'm wondering like you know if we've
EDL	00:48:07,679	00:48:10,495	| radiolab111314 |	We started noticing a 1976
EDL	00:48:11,263	00:48:13,055	| radiolab111314 |	A burst here a burst there
EDL	00:48:13,823	00:48:14,847	| radiolab111314 |	Why
EDL	00:48:15,871	00:48:22,271	| radiolab111314 |	Why now this why is it stupid question for Ebola 2014 this time we've got a very different
EDL	00:48:22,271	00:48:24,063	| radiolab111314 |	Situation has gotten out of control
EDL	00:48:24,575	00:48:26,367	| radiolab111314 |	Why is it going out of control well
EDL	00:48:27,135	00:48:27,903	| radiolab111314 |	Partly because
EDL	00:48:28,415	00:48:30,207	| radiolab111314 |	We recognized it late
EDL	00:48:30,719	00:48:36,351	| radiolab111314 |	It began back in December 2013 with a two year old boy in Southeastern Guinea
EDL	00:48:36,863	00:48:39,935	| radiolab111314 |	At least he's the first known case at this point he died
EDL	00:48:40,447	00:48:46,335	| radiolab111314 |	His mother died about a week later his sister died his grandmother died other people in the village died this went on
EDL	00:48:46,847	00:48:51,711	| radiolab111314 |	From early December until the middle of March by then it spread from these small
EDL	00:48:51,711	00:48:55,039	| radiolab111314 |	Villages into larger cities in part David says because
EDL	00:48:55,039	00:49:00,159	| radiolab111314 |	Well previous outbreaks have been in very remote places it now found itself in a more
EDL	00:49:00,159	00:49:00,927	| radiolab111314 |	Densely
EDL	00:49:00,927	00:49:02,719	| radiolab111314 |	Populated area to Capital Cities
EDL	00:49:03,231	00:49:05,535	| radiolab111314 |	In the small West African countries
EDL	00:49:06,047	00:49:09,631	| radiolab111314 |	I'm not very many miles away from The Villages of the countryside
EDL	00:49:10,655	00:49:13,471	| radiolab111314 |	The virus got into these poor neighborhoods like West Point
EDL	00:49:13,983	00:49:16,031	| radiolab111314 |	How were people were living together in
EDL	00:49:16,031	00:49:17,055	| radiolab111314 |	In crowded
EDL	00:49:17,055	00:49:17,823	| radiolab111314 |	Slum like
EDL	00:49:17,823	00:49:18,335	| radiolab111314 |	Neighborhood
EDL	00:49:18,847	00:49:20,127	| radiolab111314 |	And
EDL	00:49:20,127	00:49:21,663	| radiolab111314 |	And when their loved ones got sick
EDL	00:49:22,175	00:49:25,503	| radiolab111314 |	That people took care of them and their loved ones died
EDL	00:49:25,503	00:49:26,271	| radiolab111314 |	People
EDL	00:49:26,271	00:49:30,111	| radiolab111314 |	Clean the bodies and touch the bodies and said goodbye to him
EDL	00:49:30,111	00:49:31,647	| radiolab111314 |	So the infection spread
EDL	00:49:31,647	00:49:32,415	| radiolab111314 |	And of course those
EDL	00:49:33,439	00:49:35,743	| radiolab111314 |	Dent poor neighborhoods in the capital cities
EDL	00:49:35,743	00:49:37,791	| radiolab111314 |	Are not that far from the International Airport
EDL	00:49:38,303	00:49:39,839	| radiolab111314 |	The suddenly you've got
EDL	00:49:39,839	00:49:42,143	| radiolab111314 |	The opportunity for the almost the first time
EDL	00:49:42,655	00:49:43,679	| radiolab111314 |	For Ebola
EDL	00:49:44,447	00:49:47,007	| radiolab111314 |	To get on an airplane so if if is
EDL	00:49:47,775	00:49:52,639	| radiolab111314 |	People change the way they think about ebola because it is there a mood shift
EDL	00:49:52,639	00:49:58,271	| radiolab111314 |	There's a little bit of a mood shift but the experts of scientist Public Health officials are still saying
EDL	00:49:58,271	00:50:00,831	| radiolab111314 |	This is not that kind of virus
EDL	00:50:00,831	00:50:02,367	| radiolab111314 |	It still is
EDL	00:50:03,135	00:50:05,695	| radiolab111314 |	As far as we know a virus that is only
EDL	00:50:05,695	00:50:10,047	| radiolab111314 |	Transmissible by direct contact with bodily fluids it should be
EDL	00:50:10,047	00:50:12,095	| radiolab111314 |	Easy to stop easy to contain
EDL	00:50:12,095	00:50:18,239	| radiolab111314 |	But according to David the thing that some scientists are worried about is that as Ebola gets into more and more people and makes more more coffee
EDL	00:50:19,263	00:50:22,335	| radiolab111314 |	Change it yes every time it replicates there's a chance
EDL	00:50:22,847	00:50:24,383	| radiolab111314 |	Of a mistake
EDL	00:50:24,383	00:50:28,735	| radiolab111314 |	The chance of the genes for the next virus will come out just a little bit different it'll
EDL	00:50:28,735	00:50:32,063	| radiolab111314 |	You take most mutations are either insignificant
EDL	00:50:32,063	00:50:33,343	| radiolab111314 |	Or they do damage
EDL	00:50:33,343	00:50:34,879	| radiolab111314 |	But occasionally
EDL	00:50:34,879	00:50:37,183	| radiolab111314 |	There can be a mutation
EDL	00:50:37,183	00:50:39,743	| radiolab111314 |	That might possibly help the virus
EDL	00:50:39,743	00:50:41,791	| radiolab111314 |	Can we track these things like can we
EDL	00:50:41,791	00:50:45,631	| radiolab111314 |	Can we take a person who's got sick of Ebola in Sudan
EDL	00:50:45,631	00:50:52,031	| radiolab111314 |	I compared to person sick of Ebola in the Congo competitive person sick of Ebola in Niger and wherever
EDL	00:50:52,031	00:50:55,615	| radiolab111314 |	Can we do that and see whether it's changing yes
EDL	00:50:55,615	00:50:56,639	| radiolab111314 |	And it has been done
EDL	00:50:57,151	00:50:58,431	| radiolab111314 |	Steven Geier
EDL	00:50:58,431	00:50:59,199	| radiolab111314 |	And his
EDL	00:50:59,199	00:51:05,599	| radiolab111314 |	Colleagues published a paper in science in early September which involve doing exactly that and one of the things they say
EDL	00:51:05,599	00:51:09,439	| radiolab111314 |	Francis David is that since this virus has been in US during this outbreak
EDL	00:51:09,439	00:51:11,487	| radiolab111314 |	It's been changing twice as fast
EDL	00:51:11,487	00:51:15,071	| radiolab111314 |	As it has previously when it's living in his animal hiding place
EDL	00:51:15,071	00:51:17,631	| radiolab111314 |	Yeah so it has had more opportunities
EDL	00:51:17,631	00:51:24,031	| radiolab111314 |	To replicate in more different people that hasn't just been in 300 people it's been in 9,000 people now.
EDL	00:51:24,031	00:51:27,615	| radiolab111314 |	What is the more opportunities you have to have a
EDL	00:51:28,127	00:51:29,919	| radiolab111314 |	Good mutation from your point of view
EDL	00:51:30,431	00:51:36,831	| radiolab111314 |	Is it that this is suddenly this disease has gotten an enormous number of opportunities and that is the answer
EDL	00:51:36,831	00:51:38,111	| radiolab111314 |	Operative word yeah
EDL	00:51:38,111	00:51:41,439	| radiolab111314 |	Are there boundaries around that I mean like do we have any sense of
EDL	00:51:42,207	00:51:46,559	| radiolab111314 |	How big leap it would be for this to suddenly be transmissible in the air
EDL	00:51:46,559	00:51:47,071	| radiolab111314 |	Yeah
EDL	00:51:47,583	00:51:49,119	| radiolab111314 |	We know that for this
EDL	00:51:49,119	00:51:50,143	| radiolab111314 |	Spread through the air
EDL	00:51:50,143	00:51:52,959	| radiolab111314 |	They're very special machinery
EDL	00:51:52,959	00:51:53,727	| radiolab111314 |	You know
EDL	00:51:53,727	00:51:54,751	| radiolab111314 |	Grappling hook
EDL	00:51:55,263	00:51:57,311	| radiolab111314 |	Proteins on the outside of
EDL	00:51:57,311	00:52:01,151	| radiolab111314 |	A virus that help it catch hold of particular cells and enter them
EDL	00:52:01,663	00:52:03,455	| radiolab111314 |	An ebola doesn't have the right
EDL	00:52:03,455	00:52:05,759	| radiolab111314 |	Grappling hooks to lay hold of
EDL	00:52:05,759	00:52:09,087	| radiolab111314 |	Cells in the respiratory tract and get in them and then come
EDL	00:52:09,087	00:52:11,647	| radiolab111314 |	Bursting out of them and be carried out word on your breath
EDL	00:52:12,159	00:52:13,695	| radiolab111314 |	To get to that point
EDL	00:52:13,695	00:52:14,719	| radiolab111314 |	Would require
EDL	00:52:15,231	00:52:19,071	| radiolab111314 |	A number of mutations Each of which has infinitesimally
EDL	00:52:19,071	00:52:24,191	| radiolab111314 |	Unlikely and when you is that apply mutation that it would be startling like a what to a what
EDL	00:52:25,727	00:52:26,751	| radiolab111314 |	Been saying that
EDL	00:52:26,751	00:52:29,055	| radiolab111314 |	It would be like mutations
EDL	00:52:29,055	00:52:29,823	| radiolab111314 |	That
EDL	00:52:29,823	00:52:31,103	| radiolab111314 |	Allowed a giraffe
EDL	00:52:31,103	00:52:31,615	| radiolab111314 |	Fly
EDL	00:52:32,127	00:52:34,687	| radiolab111314 |	But they're rather scenarios that are a little more probable
EDL	00:52:35,199	00:52:39,295	| radiolab111314 |	For instance it might mutate and adapt in such a way
EDL	00:52:39,295	00:52:41,087	| radiolab111314 |	That it kills fewer people
EDL	00:52:41,855	00:52:43,647	| radiolab111314 |	Or kills them more slowly
EDL	00:52:44,159	00:52:47,231	| radiolab111314 |	And leave people infectious for a longer period of time
EDL	00:52:47,231	00:52:49,279	| radiolab111314 |	Maybe people are walking around
EDL	00:52:49,791	00:52:51,071	| radiolab111314 |	4
EDL	00:52:51,583	00:52:56,191	| radiolab111314 |	Three or four weeks with an occasional vomiting episodes but there not dying
EDL	00:52:56,191	00:52:56,959	| radiolab111314 |	That would
EDL	00:52:56,959	00:52:58,495	| radiolab111314 |	Potentially give Ebola
EDL	00:52:58,495	00:53:00,031	| radiolab111314 |	Greater opportunity
EDL	00:53:00,031	00:53:02,079	| radiolab111314 |	To spread among more people
EDL	00:53:02,591	00:53:03,103	| radiolab111314 |	What
EDL	00:53:03,871	00:53:07,711	| radiolab111314 |	This is not a fair question to ask you but what should we be
EDL	00:53:07,711	00:53:08,223	| radiolab111314 |	Doing
EDL	00:53:10,015	00:53:13,855	| radiolab111314 |	I think the most important thing we should be doing is not letting
EDL	00:53:13,855	00:53:18,975	| radiolab111314 |	The public health vs. civil civil liberties issues in the US distract us
EDL	00:53:18,975	00:53:20,511	| radiolab111314 |	From West Africa
EDL	00:53:20,511	00:53:24,863	| radiolab111314 |	Is the case count gets we talked about this is the case count gets higher it has more opportunities
EDL	00:53:25,375	00:53:25,887	| radiolab111314 |	To mutate
EDL	00:53:26,399	00:53:29,471	| radiolab111314 |	And therefore more opportunities to adapt
EDL	00:53:29,471	00:53:31,519	| radiolab111314 |	So we need to end this outbreak
EDL	00:53:31,519	00:53:33,055	| radiolab111314 |	In West Africa
EDL	00:53:33,055	00:53:35,359	| radiolab111314 |	Before this virus learns too much about us

EDL	00:55:41,311	00:55:43,103	| radiolab111314 |	Let's focus instead on invention
EDL	00:55:43,103	00:55:44,383	| radiolab111314 |	On the people
EDL	00:55:44,383	00:55:46,175	| radiolab111314 |	Who bring new ideas into the wall
EDL	00:55:46,175	00:55:47,711	| radiolab111314 |	Yeah the zeros behind the ideas

EDL	00:56:07,679	00:56:08,703	| radiolab111314 |	Ever
EDL	00:56:08,703	00:56:11,263	| radiolab111314 |	One morning a few years ago 2007
EDL	00:56:11,263	00:56:15,615	| radiolab111314 |	Four 2008 John turn down his computer open up his email and found or press release
EDL	00:56:15,615	00:56:18,943	| radiolab111314 |	Movies about the true Undisputed inventor of the high five
EDL	00:56:18,943	00:56:20,991	| radiolab111314 |	Coming you know outline Lisa press release from
EDL	00:56:21,503	00:56:25,087	| radiolab111314 |	National High Five Day which is a kind of a joke holiday
EDL	00:56:25,087	00:56:30,975	| radiolab111314 |	That was invented by a group of high school friends I think and they told the story they told the story of Le Mans
EDL	00:56:30,975	00:56:37,375	| radiolab111314 |	College basketball player Murray State in Kentucky
EDL	00:56:37,375	00:56:43,775	| radiolab111314 |	Is released when something like that deletes his father fought in Vietnam that's part of the 1st Battalion 5th Infantry
EDL	00:56:43,775	00:56:45,311	| radiolab111314 |	Is nicknamed the five
EDL	00:56:45,311	00:56:48,895	| radiolab111314 |	And they've used to greet each other by holding up their hand and saying five
EDL	00:56:49,919	00:56:51,199	| radiolab111314 |	As a kind of prideful
EDL	00:56:51,199	00:56:57,599	| radiolab111314 |	And when Lamont was younger they would also to hang out at the house in Kentucky and you can keep all their names straight so when they walk in
EDL	00:56:57,599	00:56:59,647	| radiolab111314 |	In the door and go 5 he would just hurt not going to hand
EDL	00:57:01,183	00:57:07,583	| radiolab111314 |	Lego hi-five I like high like hello five hello five, you know he has small hands he likes to put the
EDL	00:57:07,583	00:57:13,727	| radiolab111314 |	I'm up against the big hands of the Five Guys and it was years later that he started playing college basketball at Murray State
EDL	00:57:13,727	00:57:20,127	| radiolab111314 |	Started high-fiving all seem really never stopped high-fiving was just something he did when he went around playing away games other team
EDL	00:57:20,127	00:57:22,431	| radiolab111314 |	He's picked it up and it's already spread out so
EDL	00:57:22,943	00:57:25,759	| radiolab111314 |	He was sort of both the inventor of the high five in the kind of Johnny Apple
EDL	00:57:26,527	00:57:27,039	| radiolab111314 |	High five at the same time
EDL	00:57:27,551	00:57:31,135	| radiolab111314 |	And within a few weeks of John getting his press release the story was
EDL	00:57:31,135	00:57:31,903	| radiolab111314 |	Everywhere
EDL	00:57:31,903	00:57:37,023	| radiolab111314 |	Antiviral he wound up sort of all over the Internet there was some local newspapers who you know picked it up
EDL	00:57:37,023	00:57:39,583	| radiolab111314 |	You know Marie states only became very proud of the fact that they were there
EDL	00:57:40,095	00:57:43,935	| radiolab111314 |	The home of the high five if you can sort of party institutional lower in the athletic department
EDL	00:57:44,447	00:57:45,983	| radiolab111314 |	Can you read this
EDL	00:57:47,263	00:57:48,543	| radiolab111314 |	I thought
EDL	00:57:48,543	00:57:49,567	| radiolab111314 |	How's that
EDL	00:57:51,871	00:57:52,639	| radiolab111314 |	Sad
EDL	00:57:52,639	00:57:55,711	| radiolab111314 |	Because I knew the story of Glenn Burke
EDL	00:57:58,015	00:58:00,063	| radiolab111314 |	Turns out John had already been poking around and
EDL	00:58:00,063	00:58:01,343	| radiolab111314 |	This question who invented the
EDL	00:58:01,343	00:58:03,647	| radiolab111314 |	I-5 and he'd stumbled on this photograph
EDL	00:58:05,439	00:58:06,463	| radiolab111314 |	But black and white picture
EDL	00:58:07,743	00:58:10,559	| radiolab111314 |	Two baseball players facing each other afros
EDL	00:58:10,559	00:58:11,071	| radiolab111314 |	Cute smiles
EDL	00:58:12,095	00:58:15,167	| radiolab111314 |	And their hands are in the air right about to connect
EDL	00:58:15,167	00:58:16,959	| radiolab111314 |	Which one of these is Glen Burton
EDL	00:58:16,959	00:58:18,751	| radiolab111314 |	Burke's the guy in the warm-up jacket
EDL	00:58:18,751	00:58:20,543	| radiolab111314 |	I think he's even got his hat on backwards
EDL	00:58:20,543	00:58:23,615	| radiolab111314 |	Glenn Burke was a center fielder for the LA Dodgers
EDL	00:58:23,615	00:58:24,383	| radiolab111314 |	The 70s
EDL	00:58:24,383	00:58:26,175	| radiolab111314 |	Big guy he says he had 17 in

EDL	00:58:37,951	00:58:39,231	| radiolab111314 |	I mean this is the guy who was
EDL	00:58:39,999	00:58:41,279	| radiolab111314 |	You know the soul of the Dodgers
EDL	00:58:42,047	00:58:43,839	| radiolab111314 |	He just had that type of I'm charisma

EDL	00:59:47,071	00:59:52,703	| radiolab111314 |	The sportscasters that would you know announcing the game said they had never seen that done in sports before
EDL	00:59:52,703	00:59:56,543	| radiolab111314 |	And from there on the Dodgers started high-fiving and everyone else started by 5
EDL	01:00:04,479	01:00:08,575	| radiolab111314 |	It all began with that one moment the platonic Hi-Fi right there
EDL	01:00:08,575	01:00:10,111	| radiolab111314 |	Unfortunately
EDL	01:00:11,135	01:00:15,231	| radiolab111314 |	That moment that was actually supposed to be getting in and also almost the end of
EDL	01:00:15,231	01:00:17,535	| radiolab111314 |	Berks career wasn't good
EDL	01:00:17,535	01:00:19,839	| radiolab111314 |	He's actually really good even in his rookie season
EDL	01:00:19,839	01:00:23,167	| radiolab111314 |	He was being talked about as the next Willie Mays by the Dodgers organization
EDL	01:00:23,167	01:00:23,679	| radiolab111314 |	But
EDL	01:00:24,447	01:00:25,471	| radiolab111314 |	He was gay
EDL	01:00:27,263	01:00:28,543	| radiolab111314 |	And he
EDL	01:00:28,543	01:00:30,591	| radiolab111314 |	Try to keep that a secret while he was playing
EDL	01:00:30,591	01:00:36,991	| radiolab111314 |	A Dusty Baker actually had kept trying to set him up with his wife's cousins and the birth never want you to never liked any of them and they
EDL	01:00:36,991	01:00:41,087	| radiolab111314 |	These are really good looking women apparently
EDL	01:00:41,087	01:00:44,671	| radiolab111314 |	So there are rumors circulating the rumors reached the front office of of the
EDL	01:00:44,671	01:00:48,255	| radiolab111314 |	The LA Dodgers and and one day Burke was called in by management
EDL	01:00:49,023	01:00:52,095	| radiolab111314 |	And they offered him $75,000
EDL	01:00:52,095	01:00:53,119	| radiolab111314 |	To get married
EDL	01:00:53,119	01:00:55,935	| radiolab111314 |	Why is 75000 to get married
EDL	01:00:55,935	01:01:00,543	| radiolab111314 |	Just like a mop or something like that they didn't regularly offer their players
EDL	01:01:00,543	01:01:04,127	| radiolab111314 |	Money to get to get married in and Burkes response apparently was
EDL	01:01:04,639	01:01:06,687	| radiolab111314 |	He said I suppose you mean to a woman
EDL	01:01:07,967	01:01:08,991	| radiolab111314 |	Shortly after that
EDL	01:01:08,991	01:01:11,039	| radiolab111314 |	The Dodgers traded into the Oakland A's
EDL	01:01:11,039	01:01:14,367	| radiolab111314 |	Pro player who everyone acknowledge was completely inferior
EDL	01:01:14,879	01:01:20,255	| radiolab111314 |	That was confusing for us and I know it had to be confusing for him it was shocking everyone no one understood why
EDL	01:01:20,255	01:01:21,023	| radiolab111314 |	He was traded
EDL	01:01:21,535	01:01:22,559	| radiolab111314 |	Was cuz he was gay
EDL	01:01:23,071	01:01:23,839	| radiolab111314 |	Yeah
EDL	01:01:23,839	01:01:26,143	| radiolab111314 |	Yashow baseball this all American sport
EDL	01:01:27,167	01:01:27,935	| radiolab111314 |	But
EDL	01:01:27,935	01:01:30,239	| radiolab111314 |	You know Lizzy was still going to be able to play ball
EDL	01:01:31,775	01:01:33,823	| radiolab111314 |	Jodeci.
EDL	01:01:34,335	01:01:36,127	| radiolab111314 |	Doesn't get very much playing time
EDL	01:01:36,127	01:01:37,407	| radiolab111314 |	And when he did get on the field
EDL	01:01:37,919	01:01:42,015	| radiolab111314 |	It wasn't very pleasant just get heckled a lot you know some people in the bleachers and
EDL	01:01:42,015	01:01:44,831	| radiolab111314 |	An even worse according to a couple of different people his coach
EDL	01:01:44,831	01:01:45,599	| radiolab111314 |	Billy Martin
EDL	01:01:45,599	01:01:47,391	| radiolab111314 |	What often introduce Glenbrook this way
EDL	01:01:47,391	01:01:48,671	| radiolab111314 |	This is Glenbrook the faggot
EDL	01:01:49,951	01:01:50,719	| radiolab111314 |	Really
EDL	01:01:50,719	01:01:53,535	| radiolab111314 |	Yeah and so Glenbrook retires
EDL	01:01:54,303	01:01:55,839	| radiolab111314 |	Don't like 26 or
EDL	01:01:56,607	01:01:58,655	| radiolab111314 |	Yes he was young within a year of his rookie
EDL	01:01:59,423	01:02:00,447	| radiolab111314 |	Just walks
EDL	01:02:00,447	01:02:01,215	| radiolab111314 |	God that's like
EDL	01:02:01,983	01:02:03,007	| radiolab111314 |	Aborted carrier
EDL	01:02:03,007	01:02:06,079	| radiolab111314 |	Exactly from their hands up in the Castro District
EDL	01:02:06,079	01:02:06,847	| radiolab111314 |	In San Francisco
EDL	01:02:06,847	01:02:08,895	| radiolab111314 |	Is the big gay neighborhood and things go
EDL	01:02:08,895	01:02:15,295	| radiolab111314 |	Okay for a while then one day when he's crossing the street three teenage girls and their mothers car come barreling down the road
EDL	01:02:15,295	01:02:16,063	| radiolab111314 |	And they hitting
EDL	01:02:17,343	01:02:19,391	| radiolab111314 |	And broke his leg in three places
EDL	01:02:20,671	01:02:22,719	| radiolab111314 |	And that kind of ended everything that happened
EDL	01:02:23,999	01:02:25,535	| radiolab111314 |	He starts taking painkillers
EDL	01:02:26,559	01:02:27,327	| radiolab111314 |	One thing leads
EDL	01:02:27,327	01:02:27,839	| radiolab111314 |	Another
EDL	01:02:28,351	01:02:31,423	| radiolab111314 |	He gets hooked on crack can't hold a job because broke
EDL	01:02:31,423	01:02:32,703	| radiolab111314 |	End up living on the streets
EDL	01:02:33,471	01:02:36,031	| radiolab111314 |	And in 1994
EDL	01:02:36,031	01:02:38,079	| radiolab111314 |	Burke is diagnosed with
EDL	01:02:38,079	01:02:42,175	| radiolab111314 |	With HIV or Aids I can say to that point
EDL	01:02:43,967	01:02:46,015	| radiolab111314 |	Last time she didn't sleep well at night
EDL	01:02:47,039	01:02:48,063	| radiolab111314 |	And we will sit up and talk
EDL	01:02:49,855	01:02:50,879	| radiolab111314 |	Put on music in
EDL	01:02:51,647	01:02:54,719	| radiolab111314 |	I danced and he move his arms around cuz he was in the bed
EDL	01:02:56,255	01:02:57,279	| radiolab111314 |	He was bedridden
EDL	01:02:59,071	01:03:01,119	| radiolab111314 |	So you took care of him till he died
EDL	01:03:01,119	01:03:01,631	| radiolab111314 |	Yeah
EDL	01:03:03,423	01:03:05,215	| radiolab111314 |	Glenbrook died in 1995
EDL	01:03:06,495	01:03:07,775	| radiolab111314 |	But what he's left with
EDL	01:03:07,775	01:03:10,079	| radiolab111314 |	At this point is he's left with
EDL	01:03:10,079	01:03:11,615	| radiolab111314 |	The original high five
EDL	01:03:11,615	01:03:13,151	| radiolab111314 |	That's his claim yes
EDL	01:03:13,663	01:03:14,687	| radiolab111314 |	That defined
EDL	01:03:14,687	01:03:15,711	| radiolab111314 |	To some people that lie
EDL	01:03:15,711	01:03:16,479	| radiolab111314 |	Is that the end
EDL	01:03:16,479	01:03:17,503	| radiolab111314 |	And he and he believed
EDL	01:03:18,015	01:03:19,295	| radiolab111314 |	A reporter in Houston
EDL	01:03:19,295	01:03:24,927	| radiolab111314 |	You know if it was true about the high five in and he said yeah I think about the feeling you get when you give someone a high five
EDL	01:03:25,439	01:03:27,231	| radiolab111314 |	I had that feeling before everybody else did
EDL	01:03:31,583	01:03:32,863	| radiolab111314 |	So what did you do when you got this
EDL	01:03:33,631	01:03:35,423	| radiolab111314 |	So I called National High Five Day
EDL	01:03:35,935	01:03:37,727	| radiolab111314 |	Because I wanted to talk to Lamont
EDL	01:03:37,727	01:03:39,263	| radiolab111314 |	Even though I was sad
EDL	01:03:39,775	01:03:42,335	| radiolab111314 |	It seems like okay here's another person's
EDL	01:03:42,335	01:03:43,359	| radiolab111314 |	Prideful
EDL	01:03:43,359	01:03:44,127	| radiolab111314 |	Accomplishment
EDL	01:03:44,127	01:03:45,919	| radiolab111314 |	Let's get his story
EDL	01:03:45,919	01:03:47,711	| radiolab111314 |	Hello eventually
EDL	01:03:47,711	01:03:48,735	| radiolab111314 |	You get this kind of phone
EDL	01:03:48,735	01:03:50,271	| radiolab111314 |	My name is Greg Harrell Edge
EDL	01:03:50,271	01:03:54,111	| radiolab111314 |	Greg is one of the founders and he and John got to talking and John asks him
EDL	01:03:54,623	01:03:57,439	| radiolab111314 |	Sensible first question the Lamont sleep story
EDL	01:03:57,439	01:03:59,231	| radiolab111314 |	True he figured was Buddy night
EDL	01:03:59,231	01:04:00,255	| radiolab111314 |	Don't you at least ask
EDL	01:04:00,767	01:04:01,535	| radiolab111314 |	Reporter
EDL	01:04:01,535	01:04:03,583	| radiolab111314 |	And there was a pause and he said
EDL	01:04:04,351	01:04:05,887	| radiolab111314 |	No frankly
EDL	01:04:05,887	01:04:10,239	| radiolab111314 |	We've been waiting for someone to ask we thought no one would ever ask it's not true it's just something
EDL	01:04:10,239	01:04:16,639	| radiolab111314 |	We can meet up we wanted to see if the media would would run with it and made the whole thing and then they just went to go cast
EDL	01:04:16,639	01:04:18,687	| radiolab111314 |	There we set that we picked
EDL	01:04:18,687	01:04:19,967	| radiolab111314 |	Murray State
EDL	01:04:19,967	01:04:26,111	| radiolab111314 |	That's just kind of a great Sunday school at pops up in the NCAA tournament every few years and they came across this guy Lamont's
EDL	01:04:26,623	01:04:27,647	| radiolab111314 |	YMCA well
EDL	01:04:28,159	01:04:29,439	| radiolab111314 |	It was pretty close to rant
EDL	01:04:29,439	01:04:34,047	| radiolab111314 |	They then told me they had received an email from Le Mans litzas wipes
EDL	01:04:34,047	01:04:38,655	| radiolab111314 |	His wife emailed us and said some of the details that you have or are flat-out wrong
EDL	01:04:38,655	01:04:41,471	| radiolab111314 |	Some of the things you said are right though
EDL	01:04:41,471	01:04:43,775	| radiolab111314 |	But Lamont thinks he probably did invent the high five
EDL	01:04:45,567	01:04:47,359	| radiolab111314 |	What about Glenn I was kind of like
EDL	01:04:49,407	01:04:51,455	| radiolab111314 |	Kana a bit Blown Away
EDL	01:04:51,455	01:04:52,479	| radiolab111314 |	You know
EDL	01:04:52,479	01:04:53,759	| radiolab111314 |	You know here was this guy who is
EDL	01:04:54,271	01:04:56,575	| radiolab111314 |	Proud of this and these guys
EDL	01:04:56,575	01:04:57,599	| radiolab111314 |	Just kind of drifted away from
EDL	01:04:58,111	01:04:58,879	| radiolab111314 |	Do you feel a little guilty
EDL	01:04:59,903	01:05:02,207	| radiolab111314 |	Did I mean like okay to high-five it's kind of a
EDL	01:05:02,207	01:05:03,231	| radiolab111314 |	The silly thing on the other hand
EDL	01:05:03,743	01:05:04,767	| radiolab111314 |	Is life the way he died
EDL	01:05:05,535	01:05:09,375	| radiolab111314 |	I'm lucky Rob. We do feel we do feel
EDL	01:05:09,375	01:05:11,167	| radiolab111314 |	We wish that we had done things slightly different
EDL	01:05:11,679	01:05:13,215	| radiolab111314 |	In putting together this sort of
EDL	01:05:13,215	01:05:14,751	| radiolab111314 |	Collegiate prank
EDL	01:05:14,751	01:05:17,823	| radiolab111314 |	But we didn't really know Glenn Burke at that time
EDL	01:05:17,823	01:05:20,127	| radiolab111314 |	Greg said they hadn't heard of the Glenbrook
EDL	01:05:20,127	01:05:21,151	| radiolab111314 |	Story when they pulled this
EDL	01:05:21,151	01:05:22,175	| radiolab111314 |	Now that they know it
EDL	01:05:22,687	01:05:23,711	| radiolab111314 |	They really feel bad
EDL	01:05:24,223	01:05:27,807	| radiolab111314 |	Sector now organizing a charity event they're calling the national High 5 ortho
EDL	01:05:27,807	01:05:30,879	| radiolab111314 |	Which will raise money for charity including one chosen by
EDL	01:05:30,879	01:05:31,647	| radiolab111314 |	Glenbrooks
EDL	01:05:31,647	01:05:37,023	| radiolab111314 |	Sister Luther very proud anytime I see somebody do a high-five he just really makes me happy
EDL	01:05:37,023	01:05:38,559	| radiolab111314 |	And that seemed like a good end of the story
EDL	01:05:39,071	01:05:40,095	| radiolab111314 |	But
EDL	01:05:40,095	01:05:45,471	| radiolab111314 |	No because then John told us that if you really honestly want to get to the bottom of who invented the high five
EDL	01:05:45,983	01:05:49,311	| radiolab111314 |	We we didn't think we want to but now there were in it what the hell where you got to go
EDL	01:05:49,823	01:05:50,847	| radiolab111314 |	Beyond Glenbrook
EDL	01:05:52,383	01:05:58,783	| radiolab111314 |	I've wanted you to believe
EDL	01:05:58,783	01:06:01,855	| radiolab111314 |	Glenbrook died believing that the high five was his legacy
EDL	01:06:02,367	01:06:06,975	| radiolab111314 |	Add more or less the same moment that he invented it a guy named Eric Smith
EDL	01:06:06,975	01:06:09,279	| radiolab111314 |	A basketball player for the Louisville Cardinals
EDL	01:06:09,279	01:06:10,303	| radiolab111314 |	Was that practice
EDL	01:06:10,303	01:06:13,631	| radiolab111314 |	And a guy named Wiley Brown went up to Derek Smith
EDL	01:06:13,631	01:06:16,191	| radiolab111314 |	And was going to give him just a ordinary low five
EDL	01:06:16,191	01:06:17,983	| radiolab111314 |	Derek Smith looking in the eye
EDL	01:06:18,495	01:06:22,847	| radiolab111314 |	This is what Wiley Brown told me to look him in the eye and said no up high
EDL	01:06:25,919	01:06:32,319	| radiolab111314 |	That yours Lewisville team they were they were known as the doctors of dunk neither high-flying team they played Above the Rim
EDL	01:06:32,319	01:06:35,903	| radiolab111314 |	Who played in the 1980 NCAA finals
EDL	01:06:35,903	01:06:38,975	| radiolab111314 |	I haven't seen it but apparently the broadcaster refer tax
EDL	01:06:38,975	01:06:40,511	| radiolab111314 |	The high five handshake
EDL	01:06:40,511	01:06:43,071	| radiolab111314 |	Handshake
EDL	01:06:43,583	01:06:49,983	| radiolab111314 |	He felt compelled to explain it to America and it did at the moment the Derek Smith did it did an asteroid fall on his head
EDL	01:06:49,983	01:06:51,007	| radiolab111314 |	Well
EDL	01:06:51,775	01:06:55,871	| radiolab111314 |	In 1996 I believe in in the 90s he had an undiagnosed heart condition
EDL	01:06:56,639	01:06:58,943	| radiolab111314 |	And he just died all the sudden donut on a cruise ship
EDL	01:07:00,223	01:07:00,735	| radiolab111314 |	What does
EDL	01:07:01,247	01:07:02,271	| radiolab111314 |	And
EDL	01:07:02,271	01:07:06,367	| radiolab111314 |	He said explicitly the Wiley Brown this is something I'm going to be remembered for
EDL	01:07:06,367	01:07:11,743	| radiolab111314 |	You know our kids and our grandkids are going to talk about this and in fact their kids and grandkids do talk about and they're probably very proud
EDL	01:07:12,767	01:07:19,167	| radiolab111314 |	But we ran into this one
EDL	01:07:19,167	01:07:21,727	| radiolab111314 |	Volleyball in the 1960s years
EDL	01:07:21,727	01:07:23,263	| radiolab111314 |	Before Glenn Burke and Eric Smith
EDL	01:07:23,263	01:07:25,311	| radiolab111314 |	She said with her girls everyone did it
EDL	01:07:25,311	01:07:28,895	| radiolab111314 |	All the time so I do believe that it was volleyball that first started
EDL	01:07:28,895	01:07:35,295	| radiolab111314 |	She says they would high five more on a player screwed up about celebration
EDL	01:07:35,295	01:07:40,415	| radiolab111314 |	Do you need a high five course it's more when you're down so happy
EDL	01:07:40,415	01:07:41,439	| radiolab111314 |	So women's volleyball
