EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:19,680	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Because I knew the next day at school like that's all anybody would be talking about is the Maple Leafs game it was

EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:42,687	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Because
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:44,735	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	She just hadn't gotten her citizenship
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:46,015	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Before and like

EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:01,887	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	That the town gets to vote
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:02,911	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	We're literally
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:04,447	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	The town is mailed little pamphlets
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:06,751	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And those templates have
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:08,543	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Someone like Nancy Holten
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:09,823	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And a little seedy about her
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:13,663	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Forever into town can read her basic biographical information

EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:29,151	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	A hundred years hundred fifty years ago
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:30,431	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Now it's a tradition
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:32,223	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	So Nancy went after that
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:32,735	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Oh what a
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:42,207	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	So she started the procedure was like writing letters to the municipality and to all sorts of like
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:43,743	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Animal rights groups
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:45,791	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	She got an article in the
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:47,583	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Paper at one point she showed me
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:48,351	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And there was a
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:49,631	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Horrific bundle of tales
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:56,799	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Nancy's real thing more than the church bells is like animal active
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:20:02,431	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	In fact just a little while after that church bells article came out on TV
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:04,735	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Come down and turn a list.
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:10,367	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Hawkmoon of the reporters asked her team does indigenous Canada
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:13,695	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	We don't like church bells are there any other bills you don't like
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:17,535	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And she's badass t-shirts women

EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:34,431	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Constant can be made in Villa d'Este
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:36,735	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	I kicked the Hornet's Nest and that's when it all
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:38,783	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	So it sounds like she's
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:41,855	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	They never ever ever graduated escalation of
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:43,903	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Attacks on Swiss culture
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:45,695	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Suddenly trips the big one
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:47,487	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	The commander-in-chief
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:47,999	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Easton
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:21:02,079	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Now I have to say I didn't totally get why cowbells would be the Tipping Point
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:04,127	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And I mentioned this to Andy
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:06,431	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	The cowbells are an image of
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:12,831	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Romantic feelings in in Swiss culture
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:17,952	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Drive up into the hills around get so perfect with Andy and his daughter Olivia
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:21,280	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Pikachu
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:23,584	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	With end of the day we parked the car
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:26,912	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	You pulled into the
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:29,728	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Long driveway leading to a farm
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:34,592	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And we thought
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:37,664	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Six seven eight nine ten
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:43,808	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Cows in what very quickly became clear to me in that moment is that cowbells in Switzerland
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:44,576	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	2310
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:49,696	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Aren't just about postcards or with a selling a gift shop or whatever
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:51,232	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	31 cows
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:51,744	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:53,024	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Good morning baby
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:57,376	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	I really like it here and get the sunset like there's two stunts
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:21:59,424	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Touching a
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:01,472	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Touching all those fields
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:02,240	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Such as beautiful
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:11,968	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	They really represent this particular way of life in Switzer
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:14,272	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Agrarian way of life
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:16,832	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	A real simpler farming way of life
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:19,648	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	It's like the cowbell is attached
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:22,720	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	To the Swiss version of the American Heartland like
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:24,000	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Nebraska farmer
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:30,656	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	I don't know
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:37,824	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And in Switzerland for a lot of people
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:40,640	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	That feeling is connected to
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:44,992	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Cowbell I think you know also ID for example
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:51,136	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	It's a story about a Swiss girl growing up with their grandfather in the alley
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:54,976	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Everything gets like
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:23:00,608	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Like the beautiful lies in the Alps and Ukraine
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:02,144	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Milk and Peoria cafe
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:03,424	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Cheeks
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:05,728	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Cowbells are there
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:08,032	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	It's some kind of a stereo type of
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:10,592	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	A society where there are no problems
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:14,176	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Everything Is Beautiful or the sun is shining
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:18,272	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Please make every little boy and girl in the world is happy as I am
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:21,344	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Heidi

EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:28,256	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	So when Nancy
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:29,792	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Lake launch an attack
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:31,072	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	That was like
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:33,120	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Do you think it felt like it was like attacking
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:35,168	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	People sense of well-being and
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:37,472	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Absolutely Santa Clara ocean of War
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:40,032	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	I'm coming coming to a 4-inch
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:40,800	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Country
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:42,080	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	I first have to look how
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:45,152	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And then I have to pay
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:45,920	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	The choice
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:47,456	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Is that okay for me
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:53,344	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Or maybe it's not okay for me I'm coming in until you you have to lifelike
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:53,856	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	I think
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:23:57,952	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Yes
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:02,048	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	This is Ursula Knox again
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:03,328	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	It's not okay
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:05,632	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Nancy comes in and tells
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:06,656	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	That's how we have to
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:07,424	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	To do it
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:08,960	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	She's suffering person
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:12,288	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	She will tell us how to live concerts
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:12,800	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Okay
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:15,872	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Do you remember how you felt before your meeting
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:22,272	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	It made me feel so people in the town are not happy about Nancy's cowbell stance
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:26,624	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And in the midst of all this the night of Nancy's citizenship meeting arrives
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:31,232	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	. device is really
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:33,792	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	She's glad that she didn't know what she
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:36,608	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	She didn't know then what you know today as far
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:39,168	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Hardcore like the whole thing with
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:40,448	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Hardcore
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:41,472	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Describe
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:49,152	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	It takes an effort to go back
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:50,176	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Particular night
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:54,784	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	The teeth
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:25:00,672	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Tonight is Nancy citizenship meeting she shows up at the school gymnasium it's in the evening
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:06,560	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	There are rows and rows of folding chair setup and there's one round the back where the prospective citizens can sit
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:09,888	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	So Nancy walks and she sits in that back row
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:12,448	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And I'll say these meetings are usually like
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:16,288	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Calm and pretty sparsely attended there's like maybe eighty to a hundred people
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:17,312	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	But this time there was
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:18,336	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Twice that
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:19,616	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	The place was packed
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:21,152	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:24,224	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	The first thing to happen is they go through some administrative stuff like
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:30,368	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	How much budget are we going to use to fix the rotor like should we put a roof on the roller hockey rink
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:33,440	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	But then came the citizenship part of the meeting
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:35,488	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	I think they couldn't really control himself
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:37,792	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	The townspeople just like
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:40,608	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	China lost their cool people like like
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:43,680	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Peasant Farmers they would stand up and able
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:45,472	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Get angry and say Well that's
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:48,288	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	It's not right if you're against it and then
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:50,848	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	The things that were said
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:53,920	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Really surprisingly violence
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:55,968	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	They would get so emotional
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:58,784	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	I'm in the disgusting
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:02,112	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	I'd almost there was a very hateful
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:07,744	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	That's very loud and no we don't want and then
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:09,280	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Alex heeringa fabric
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:11,840	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	I was astonished about them
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:13,888	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Power off
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:15,424	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Saying no
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:16,960	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	We don't want
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:21,568	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Getting off yelling saying she doesn't belong here for me

EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:15,072	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	I'm sorry
EDL	00:35:17,120	00:35:18,144	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Yes you can

EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:24,544	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	So I was in the area I stopped by a local newspaper
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:27,616	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And I met with this reporter and nausea and an editor Roth
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:34,272	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And of course they knew all about Nancy Holten people enter that you know the hatred that they have

EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:49,632	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	So the reason Ross said
EDL	00:35:49,632	00:35:51,424	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	It's a critical story is because
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:54,496	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	It's not so much a story about weather
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:59,104	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Nancy's well-liked or not whether she's annoying or not it's more about
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:36:00,640	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Who gets to decide
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:01,664	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Who can be Swiss
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:02,944	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And who cannot
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:05,248	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Anna from us perspective
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:06,272	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	May be hard to
EDL	00:36:06,272	00:36:09,088	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Kind of wrap your head around the fact that there's so much
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:11,648	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Kind of local autonomy to make these kinds of decisions but
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:15,232	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	I think that there's just a very strong tradition in Switzerland
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:17,792	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Yunnan local matters and they should be
EDL	00:36:17,792	00:36:19,072	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Delta waves in the local community
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:25,984	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	So this is professor of political science at Stanford University
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:28,288	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	One of towns voting on someone's citizenship
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:31,616	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Was it that time a huge issue in Switzerland
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:32,896	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Still is
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:38,272	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	No because like back in the early 2000s there were more and more and more people immigrating from countries like
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:41,344	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Kosovo turkey former Yugoslavia
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:47,744	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And when that happened people started noticing something at the Times the media reports about some seemingly disc
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:48,768	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Mandatory rejections
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:50,560	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	It look like
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:51,840	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Some towns were
EDL	00:36:51,840	00:36:53,888	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Purposely rejecting immigrants from those countries
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:57,472	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And in fact in 2003 there was actually a court case
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:37:02,336	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	In Swiss federal court because there was a town in central Switzerland and
EDL	00:37:02,848	00:37:08,736	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	8 Italian applicants got in while 38 applicants from former Yugoslavia where reject
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:12,576	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And the court looked at that case and what they basically said is that
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:16,416	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	I'm a Swiss law immigrants should have a right to appeal
EDL	00:37:16,416	00:37:17,184	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	If that rejected
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:18,464	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	No
EDL	00:37:18,976	00:37:23,584	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	In order for you to make an appeal you need to know right like why you were rejected
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:25,120	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	So the decision making body
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:26,912	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Like needs to provide some justification
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:28,704	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Why you being rejected
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:31,008	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Basically they said the problem with these town.
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:37,152	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Is that people can vote Yes or No for any reason they want there's no way to tell why that person was rejected
EDL	00:37:37,152	00:37:38,944	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And because it seems like
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:43,808	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	People who were getting rejected were mostly from muslim-majority countries
EDL	00:37:43,808	00:37:50,208	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Certain immigrants might be rejected just based on their membership in a certain ethnic cultural group which Friday
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:52,768	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	The anti-discrimination clause in the Swiss Constitution
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:57,120	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	The courts way of solving this is to say that the towns have to justify
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:58,400	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Their rejection
EDL	00:37:58,400	00:38:02,496	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And if they person gets rejected that person has to be able to appeal the decision
EDL	00:38:03,264	00:38:06,080	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	It's all in the wake of that ruling much more common
EDL	00:38:06,080	00:38:07,616	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	To have politicians
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:08,640	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Decide on those
EDL	00:38:08,640	00:38:10,176	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Naturalization application
EDL	00:38:10,176	00:38:13,248	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And the Naturalization rates actually went up quite dramatically
EDL	00:38:13,248	00:38:15,296	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	A lot more people started getting citizenship
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:17,088	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Increase particularly
EDL	00:38:17,088	00:38:23,488	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	For those applicants the busy face the strongest discrimination under the direct Democratic vote
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:26,816	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Now is that the question of towns voting on citizenship
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:30,400	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Has gotten all tangled up in the issue of immigration
EDL	00:38:30,912	00:38:33,984	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And there's actually this political party the
EDL	00:38:33,984	00:38:35,264	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Farmers party
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:37,056	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Bowring Park.

EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:42,176	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Very rule party
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:44,736	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Arguing basically that town should go back
EDL	00:38:44,736	00:38:46,272	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Voting on citizenship
EDL	00:38:46,272	00:38:47,552	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Yes
EDL	00:38:47,552	00:38:50,624	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	This by the way is Lilia my name is Lydia Home Security
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:56,512	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	When we spoke she was an elected representative in the region and head of the immigration support group
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:39:02,912	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Integration Auto and she basically told me that the SVP which is actually grown pretty dramatically the

EDL	00:39:18,016	00:39:23,648	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	So clear and so easy to understand what they mean just an example of a while back
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:31,072	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	The party was campaigning for the slaw they wanted to pass where you could deport an immigrant who commits to crimes and

EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:34,144	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	They put out these poster than on the poster

EDL	00:47:28,767	00:47:31,327	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And I didn't really realize how much of that
EDL	00:47:31,327	00:47:32,863	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Actually meant to her as well
EDL	00:47:32,863	00:47:35,679	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And that sometimes you just really really

EDL	00:47:38,239	00:47:39,263	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	I did this

EDL	00:47:50,015	00:47:52,319	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Slightly disappointed in democracy
EDL	00:47:52,831	00:47:55,647	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	But also taught her a lesson that she says
EDL	00:47:56,159	00:47:57,695	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	So today she would say
EDL	00:47:58,207	00:47:59,743	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Democracy is a
EDL	00:48:00,511	00:48:01,279	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Power
EDL	00:48:01,279	00:48:04,351	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And this power should be given to people
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:06,143	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Who deals responsibly with it
EDL	00:48:08,703	00:48:09,727	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Is it used to

EDL	00:48:27,647	00:48:28,927	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	I felt conflicted
EDL	00:48:28,927	00:48:29,695	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Because
EDL	00:48:29,695	00:48:30,463	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	I
EDL	00:48:30,463	00:48:36,607	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Understand why he wouldn't want Nancy to be a part of his town and I also kind of I get why it would be painful to give
EDL	00:48:37,119	00:48:38,655	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	That kind of a choice
EDL	00:48:39,167	00:48:41,215	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	But then the conversation took
EDL	00:48:41,215	00:48:44,287	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	A turn now used to meet Islam
EDL	00:48:45,823	00:48:47,615	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	We're having philia and keep you

EDL	00:48:59,135	00:49:00,927	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	When one person
EDL	00:49:00,927	00:49:01,951	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	If naturalized
EDL	00:49:01,951	00:49:03,231	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	They would bring
EDL	00:49:03,231	00:49:07,071	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Apart from their home country
EDL	00:49:07,583	00:49:08,351	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And
EDL	00:49:08,863	00:49:12,191	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	When the partner then comes and stays here 5 or 10 years
EDL	00:49:12,191	00:49:13,983	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And we will get that fit like they will get a switch
EDL	00:49:14,495	00:49:17,567	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Or two that's how I thought you ain't like this development

EDL	00:49:22,175	00:49:23,199	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Why headache
EDL	00:49:25,759	00:49:27,295	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Mentally dead
EDL	00:49:27,295	00:49:28,575	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Steinhoff
EDL	00:49:29,343	00:49:30,623	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Intelligent
EDL	00:49:35,743	00:49:36,767	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	In that moment
EDL	00:49:37,535	00:49:38,559	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	I realize that
EDL	00:49:38,559	00:49:40,607	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Behind Nancy story behind the
EDL	00:49:41,375	00:49:45,215	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Just kind of clickbait tale of the woman too annoying to get citizenship
EDL	00:49:47,007	00:49:50,079	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	There are all kinds of things that are a lot harder to talk about
EDL	00:49:50,079	00:49:51,359	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Harder to separate out
EDL	00:49:53,407	00:49:54,431	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	A real loss
EDL	00:49:54,943	00:49:56,479	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	There's fear of
EDL	00:49:56,479	00:49:59,039	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	A changing world and the promise of
EDL	00:49:59,039	00:49:59,807	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Received
EDL	00:49:59,807	00:50:01,855	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	The promise that people could have a voice in a power
EDL	00:50:03,391	00:50:04,159	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	But
EDL	00:50:04,159	00:50:05,183	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Also
EDL	00:50:05,183	00:50:05,951	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Xenophobia
EDL	00:50:06,975	00:50:07,487	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Hostility
EDL	00:50:09,279	00:50:09,791	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And
EDL	00:50:10,303	00:50:13,375	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	All that made me think about the conversation I had with lots of
EDL	00:50:13,375	00:50:14,911	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	About his family
EDL	00:50:14,911	00:50:16,447	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Moving to Canada and
EDL	00:50:16,447	00:50:22,079	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Do you know him watching hockey but all the things that his family tried to do to make a home in their new country
EDL	00:50:22,847	00:50:24,639	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	I'm wondering if you think that
EDL	00:50:24,639	00:50:29,503	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	If your family had faced more outright hostility do you think they would have
EDL	00:50:29,503	00:50:31,295	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	You know body in on the club as much
EDL	00:50:33,343	00:50:39,487	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Yeah like I think we certainly like like I think there were certainly dark times for my parents were people call them Packy's all the time
EDL	00:50:39,999	00:50:45,631	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Yeah I'm sure they didn't they didn't anyway
EDL	00:50:46,655	00:50:51,775	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Yeah they did like I think it was in part because it was like okay this is the only place that took
EDL	00:50:51,775	00:50:53,311	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Gas like we got a really
EDL	00:50:53,311	00:50:55,615	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Make good here it's not like we have any other options
EDL	00:50:55,615	00:50:57,663	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	But I do think like I do think
EDL	00:50:57,663	00:51:01,503	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Like I think my parents felt a lot of probably felt a lot of pressure
EDL	00:51:01,503	00:51:02,015	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	2
EDL	00:51:02,527	00:51:05,343	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Conform in some way like like being the first
EDL	00:51:05,855	00:51:08,159	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	You know immigrant generation who
EDL	00:51:08,159	00:51:11,231	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Maybe you still have a trace of an accident Maybe
EDL	00:51:11,231	00:51:14,815	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Because of the food you eat you still smell a little different
EDL	00:51:14,815	00:51:21,215	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	I'm sure that generation usually that first generation is like super sensitive about those things in like basically comes out at like
EDL	00:51:21,215	00:51:22,239	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Oh I'm going to be
EDL	00:51:22,239	00:51:26,079	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	The most Canadian like more Canadian than any
EDL	00:51:26,079	00:51:26,847	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Yeah
EDL	00:51:26,847	00:51:30,175	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Degree of like erasing you know you're like okay like it like
EDL	00:51:30,943	00:51:34,015	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Forget that I came from another place like let's just erase all of that
EDL	00:51:34,783	00:51:38,879	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Yeah and I think about that and how assimilation to me is always seem like a
EDL	00:51:38,879	00:51:40,415	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Sad word like
EDL	00:51:40,415	00:51:42,463	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	The giving up of something
EDL	00:51:42,463	00:51:44,511	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Somewhere you know
EDL	00:51:44,511	00:51:45,535	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Yeah
EDL	00:51:45,535	00:51:47,839	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	But at the same time as that sits in my mind
EDL	00:51:48,351	00:51:49,119	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	I think about
EDL	00:51:49,631	00:51:50,655	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Okay what if
EDL	00:51:50,655	00:51:52,959	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Lots of lettuce immigrate to Canada
EDL	00:51:52,959	00:51:56,031	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Yeah and they all think like wow thank you so much
EDL	00:51:56,031	00:51:57,311	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Hockey is not for us
EDL	00:51:57,311	00:52:03,711	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And now suddenly hockey is no longer the thing that holds social capital and in some way Canadian identity lose
EDL	00:52:03,711	00:52:10,111	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Does that thing I know it. Now I feel sad or some Indian sport or something yeah
EDL	00:52:10,111	00:52:10,879	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Where to put that
EDL	00:52:10,879	00:52:13,439	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Yeah we can I get that I get that
EDL	00:52:13,439	00:52:19,839	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Feeling like where you're like all like just the thing that I love and all the sudden now there are people here who don't love the things
EDL	00:52:19,839	00:52:20,863	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And I love and
EDL	00:52:20,863	00:52:24,191	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	My love is being diluted or like my
EDL	00:52:24,703	00:52:27,775	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Or like or or or even potentially
EDL	00:52:27,775	00:52:28,799	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Supplanted
EDL	00:52:28,799	00:52:31,359	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And that like I think that's a fair thing to feel
EDL	00:52:32,127	00:52:34,175	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	There's also a way to like
EDL	00:52:34,175	00:52:39,551	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	To sell it you know like it's like okay like let's get some Indian kids in the NHL I remember

EDL	00:52:50,303	00:52:54,911	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	He's like a hockey player and I was like oh yeah cool like if he is in there like I can start to
EDL	00:52:54,911	00:52:57,471	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Feel my way into it and I think it's just a matter of like
EDL	00:52:57,983	00:53:04,383	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Stella at like share with me why you think this is so great and and let me have some purchase in it you know and then I'll

EDL	00:53:23,071	00:53:24,095	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	In some way lettuce
EDL	00:53:25,119	00:53:27,423	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Speak to something that yantai Mueller told me
EDL	00:53:28,447	00:53:30,495	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Really kind of flipped the way that I
EDL	00:53:30,495	00:53:31,775	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Was thinking about citizen
EDL	00:53:32,287	00:53:33,567	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Forecastle
EDL	00:53:33,567	00:53:35,103	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	You know. Swiss citizenship
EDL	00:53:35,103	00:53:38,431	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Compared to those who didn't get much more likely to know important facts
EDL	00:53:38,431	00:53:39,455	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Switzerland
EDL	00:53:39,455	00:53:41,247	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	They're much more likely to read
EDL	00:53:41,247	00:53:47,647	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Swiss that supposed to Home Country newspaper it's showing that the orientation as we move towards kind of Switzerland and being informed about what's going
EDL	00:53:47,647	00:53:50,207	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Going on the even report let's termination
EDL	00:53:50,207	00:53:52,511	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Suggested
EDL	00:53:52,511	00:53:53,279	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	The citizenship
EDL	00:53:53,791	00:53:54,559	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	It's not
EDL	00:53:54,559	00:53:57,375	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	As some people argue with the endpoint of
EDL	00:53:57,375	00:53:58,143	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Integration
EDL	00:53:58,143	00:54:02,239	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	It's not like the crowning achievement of integration process and people work very hard
EDL	00:54:02,239	00:54:04,031	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	To become citizens and then
EDL	00:54:04,031	00:54:05,055	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Haven't there
EDL	00:54:05,055	00:54:08,895	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	It's more that the citizenship itself can be an important catalyst
EDL	00:54:08,895	00:54:09,663	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	That kind of
EDL	00:54:09,663	00:54:12,735	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Facilitates the social political and economic integration
EDL	00:54:14,271	00:54:14,783	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Okay
EDL	00:54:18,879	00:54:23,743	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	So I visited Nancy on the day she was going to vote for the first time as a Swiss citizen
EDL	00:54:28,351	00:54:33,215	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	I'm nervous you was feeling like my heart's going to visit
EDL	00:54:33,727	00:54:37,311	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	I wish I had this on tape but I was not allowed to record in the meeting
EDL	00:54:37,823	00:54:39,871	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	I just parked the car
EDL	00:54:39,871	00:54:41,919	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And just I parked the car and was getting out
EDL	00:54:41,919	00:54:43,967	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	At the meeting Nancy rode up on her bike
EDL	00:54:44,479	00:54:47,807	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And she been talking all day about how she didn't wear shoes
EDL	00:54:47,807	00:54:48,575	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	And
EDL	00:54:49,087	00:54:52,671	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	I saw that she was wearing shoes and they were a sparkly
EDL	00:54:52,671	00:54:54,719	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Sequined silver shoes
EDL	00:54:55,231	00:54:57,279	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Why are you wearing shoes here and she said
EDL	00:54:57,791	00:55:04,191	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	It's my first meeting as a citizen I just really want to make a good impression and it was just so interesting that the
EDL	00:55:04,191	00:55:05,215	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	The Moors was rejected
EDL	00:55:05,727	00:55:07,519	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	The more she was like no shoes

EDL	00:55:18,527	00:55:19,551	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	She starts to compromise
EDL	00:55:35,679	00:55:36,959	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	There is a
EDL	00:55:38,239	00:55:42,335	| radiolab_podcast040519forwhomcowbelltolls |	Like I said that maybe one of the quintessential Canadian Foods really a cup
