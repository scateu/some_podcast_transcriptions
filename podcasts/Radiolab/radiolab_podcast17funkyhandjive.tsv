EDL	00:00:54,784	00:00:55,808	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	One day
EDL	00:00:55,808	00:00:57,088	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	We went to do that

EDL	00:01:10,400	00:01:13,472	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	He came up with this crazy plan that he was going to ask for his aunt
EDL	00:01:13,472	00:01:16,032	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	We walk in the lobby for the Secret Service wouldn't have to worry about us
EDL	00:01:17,056	00:01:18,080	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	So we go to the hotel

EDL	00:01:20,896	00:01:24,224	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And then crazily the elevator door opens and there is
EDL	00:01:24,736	00:01:31,136	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	President Kennedy steps out of the oven with Jackie well she's immediately grabbed by these reporters in there asking her something and he's
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:33,696	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Nothing to do so he's a politician he glances around
EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:35,232	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And I am standing behind
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:36,768	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Potted plant
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:37,536	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Staring at him
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:42,400	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Anthony steps towards the bush and he reaches over the bridge of hello young man or something like that
EDL	00:01:42,400	00:01:48,800	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And I couldn't speak because there was so much phlegm coming flooding into my throat that I thought I might drown standing up but
EDL	00:01:48,800	00:01:49,824	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I took his hand
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:50,336	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And I shook
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:53,664	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And then
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:56,480	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	He believed he went off to something else and I was just
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:57,248	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Staring at my hands
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:00,064	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Completed that day I said
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:00,576	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	My sister
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:02,112	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I shook
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:03,648	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	President Kennedy's hand
EDL	00:02:03,648	00:02:04,160	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:06,208	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I guess I'm not going to wash it
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:07,232	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Like two days
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:08,512	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Two weeks maybe
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:10,048	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	What did she say to you
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:11,840	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I don't remember what she said but
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:13,120	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	But that's a funny
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:19,520	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Thing to say when 50 years later your science reporter
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:21,312	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Google
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:22,080	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Huh
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:24,896	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Because at the moment I thought
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:32,576	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Kennedy Honors Robert I didn't I didn't know that was true it was like a dream
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:34,112	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I think of celebrities I do
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:36,928	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	But now
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:40,000	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	It turns out we can examine the question
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:42,048	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Scientifically there's no science
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:43,584	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	That can do that
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:45,632	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	What do you mean
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:46,400	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Well
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:48,448	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	First of all we all know this was covered with germs
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:52,544	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	But what I did realize that there are
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:53,824	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Scientist who say
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:57,152	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	The bacteria honest they claimed was almost like for life
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:58,944	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	So you can be identified
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:00,736	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	By your microbes
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:03,808	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And these are now making the Bold claim
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:09,184	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Did they can check those Mike up to solve crimes to detect diseases
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:13,536	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Do Public Health kind of things
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:15,328	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Put them to the test
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,864	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Serious
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:20,960	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I know after this small little up
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:22,240	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Personal history
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:28,384	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	So I decided to to reproduce the John F Kennedy Robert krulwich handshake
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:39,392	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	We could have I could find somebody who would be President Kennedy who would shake my hand and we would measure
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:40,672	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	In calculating C
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:45,536	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	So I got a team of producers on a WNYC show only human
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:47,840	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	To help me doing this and we found

EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:16,415	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	No one exactly knows the answer was
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:19,743	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	But if a person shakes another person's hand
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:21,279	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	N4a ordinary injury

EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:16,991	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Breast of the sands
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:19,295	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	By the way producer
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:21,343	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Why do we why do we start experiment now
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:25,951	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Are what you going to do
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:27,999	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	So what we going to do is we we have little
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:34,399	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	My butthole is burning it doesn't mean I'm offering you my boo
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:35,935	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Gut microbes
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:37,983	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	70 minutes
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:42,079	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Absolutely sir we have these little star all chiefs reach tubes little green
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:45,663	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Tube has a sterile swab in it with a with a completely sterile tip
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:48,479	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	We're going to open that up on very quickly rub
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:49,503	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Birth photography
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:52,575	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Each of your hand so your palm the inside of your finger
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:56,159	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I'm going to do that very big Racine and put it as quickly as possible
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:59,999	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Sister control sample
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:03,839	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I got to shake hands with the young man over that was Robert
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:08,703	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And we're going to definitely I trying to see how many you have received from Neil and how many
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:12,543	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Neil is received from Robert Leahy is swabbing your hands
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:17,663	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Before you hand shakes so that he can figure out what's the Baseline that you got them both your hands prehension
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:21,759	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And he sure you're going to have different bacteria on your on your hands
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:22,783	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	You and you
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:26,367	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	So this is where it gets very interesting so you have very specific types
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:27,903	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Bacteria and he has very
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:29,695	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Types of bacteria that are unique
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:33,023	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I mean I guess like I mean like if I just think about her second like the
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:34,815	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Two of you had different days you arrived in this
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:36,607	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	You probably touched
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:40,959	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Places you eating different things okay maybe a little bit of difference
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:42,495	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	But in general
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:43,519	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	You are
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:44,543	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Those men
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:50,943	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Living in New York City breathing the same air ride in the same Subway's exactly so why would you be
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:51,711	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	That
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:52,223	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Different from one of
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:55,039	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Well because there's one very important difference
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:55,807	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Between us
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:56,831	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Okay
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:57,855	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	We have different mothers
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:02,719	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Have you been told anything like what this is
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:09,119	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Dr. Siobhan Dolan
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:14,751	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Assist as well we brought her in because she knows more than most when it comes to moms and babies
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:16,287	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Stream my training years
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:22,687	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Delivered a hundred babies ourselves about 500 babies centers in private practice at Yale New Haven Hospital for a bunch of you
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:26,783	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And I probably delivered another couple hundred and I have three kids myself
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:28,831	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Other side as well
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:30,623	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And she says as a fetus
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:32,671	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Before your born
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:37,535	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	You know exposed to what's in the amniotic fluid but it's a pretty
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:38,303	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Clean
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:40,351	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Set up in utero but
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:45,471	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Then you go to the vagina and the vagina is just a host of bacteria and
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:46,751	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	You know heaston
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:51,871	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Amniotic fluid there's blood or bacterial
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:53,407	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Right exactly
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:57,503	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Because at this point you're this pristine unadulterated hunk of biomass
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:09:59,295	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	The bacteria
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:05,695	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Give me a ride I'm going to jump on it cuz that's what
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:06,719	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Bacteria to
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,999	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Finally
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:08,767	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	When
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:09,535	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	The baby's born
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:14,655	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	The doctors they take it to make sure that stable breathing
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:15,935	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And then right up on tomorrow
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:19,519	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Start to immediately promote the bonding and skin to skin
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:23,871	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	In your own case if
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:25,407	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	If you can remember
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,175	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I quit what happens
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:33,087	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	What I remember is describing for him like you're mine and I've been waiting nine months to meet you and
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:38,463	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Here you are and like just kind of embracing him and looking in his eyes and soap
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:43,071	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	There's a sort of bonding there that I will never forget the same moment
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:47,679	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	You're going to get some micro bonding to I'm it's a it's a very dynamic
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:52,543	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Hot and bacterial. They leap from the mom's skin on to the baby
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:58,943	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I did this for both my children night I took both of the month my bed chest at Beth and what you wanted to compete
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:10:59,711	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Against your wife
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:04,063	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Absolutely maybe a little bit daddy was a helpful thing you know who knows
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:10,975	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Sorry yeah is that that was the reason I did it and the thing is.
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:13,279	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Strains of bacteria that we get in those
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:15,327	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	First few hours
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:19,935	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Give me a ride to a lesser degree the bacteria that we meet later in the first year of our life when
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:26,335	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Stick weird things in our mouths at the dog comes by those strains of bacteria stick with us
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:27,871	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Ready Set forever
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:30,175	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Lorena Bobbitt
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:33,503	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	As much as possible even the bacteria that Jack will find a tickle
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:36,063	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Nils hand
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:39,135	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	My hand fingering in between
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:41,695	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Are descendants of those first moments of contact
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:50,911	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And crazily enough even if you try to get rid of your bacterial inheritance
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:54,751	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Get rid of all your skin back to you
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:57,311	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Take lots of antibiotics to get rid of all your tummy bacteria
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:12:02,431	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And then move to some completely different part of the world where the food is different than the temperature different still
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:04,991	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	The bacteria you got from your mom will come
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:06,015	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Creeping back
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:07,807	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Why why would the why would that be
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:11,135	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Well there's something in ecology cooled
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:12,159	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	The founder effect
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:14,975	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Whereby the first organisms
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:17,535	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	To get there and to be successful in an environment
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,607	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Ulta the trajectory
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:22,399	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Free of the rest of the ecosystem in
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:24,959	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Change how it develops right
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:26,239	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	So you know if a tree
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:31,103	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Species and type of tree lines on an island and becomes dominant
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:35,967	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Then it will support the types of beds in the types of monkeys in the types of insects
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:36,991	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Love that type of tree
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:43,903	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	The same is true in in the microbiome so you know you have a lifelong partnership
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:44,927	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	The bacteria you Interactive
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:51,327	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	So we know that Neil and I each have a unique mix of microbes almost to the point where they like a
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:51,839	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Fingerprint
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:55,679	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	But if we shake hands the mirror
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:13:00,287	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	How much of his is going to get on me how much a mine is going to get on him and most importantly
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:01,823	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Is how long will you
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:03,615	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Strange microbial
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:04,895	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Last
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:09,503	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	So you guys got to shake hands I want you shake hands like just as if you were meeting and holding you would like
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:13,599	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Hey Neil or Hey Brother nice to meet you and just shake hands
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:14,623	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Okay
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:16,159	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Not like
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:22,559	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Fanfic about how to actually shake at work
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:26,911	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	3
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:28,447	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Okay now it was my hand go
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:34,079	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Just made my index finger too cuz you got a little
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:35,871	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Didn't didn't touch
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:39,199	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And so every 5 minutes for the next 20 minutes
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:45,599	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Jack's LaBeouf at my hand
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:48,415	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Bacteria but no checking to see if any bacteria moved
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:49,695	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And for how long
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:52,767	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Joy what happened did you did your wife what happened
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:53,535	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Well
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:54,815	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Why would I tell you now
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:56,351	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	When we have the advantage of a short break
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:13:59,167	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	We'll be right back

EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:41,151	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Aunts and uncles teachers were looking for stories about what we're calling
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:41,919	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Tiny moments
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:42,943	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Brilliant
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:44,991	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Basically I want to hear about this
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:47,551	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Times when a kid you know did something
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:49,599	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	It just means you lean back and say
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:50,879	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Well
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:51,391	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	How did they do
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:53,695	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Maybe it was the moment that I
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:56,767	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Kids started reading back
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:57,535	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	To you
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:59,839	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:03,679	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their music
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:08,543	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:11,359	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	We're interested in the
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:12,639	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Epic moments where
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:14,687	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Kid does something super smart
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:16,479	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	It doesn't have anything to do with it
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:18,271	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	If you have a story

EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:48,223	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Okay just for winter break
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:49,759	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Robert Neal
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:51,295	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Just shaking hands and Jack
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:53,087	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Gilbert was going to swap those
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:55,647	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Sans write 1 minutes off the handshake
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:58,207	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Then around every 5 minutes for about 25 min
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:06,399	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Bacteria back to the lab and he identified are bacteria by their DNA
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:12,543	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	That means
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:15,615	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Well yes it is a holy signs it's
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:17,407	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Signs that's on The Cutting Edge
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:20,223	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Rena Ware still researching and developing
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:26,623	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And it will take many years before we're ready for Primetime but Jack says they are now at the phase where they can look into all kind
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:29,695	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Kinds of different applications for this new microbiome detecting
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:31,999	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Take me to Tampa forensic
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:37,119	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Imagine if somebody comes into a room and doesn't evil deed
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:39,679	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Right now we know that when somebody interrupts
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:40,959	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Without space.
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:41,727	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	15 minutes
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:44,543	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	They leave behind enough of the signature
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:46,079	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	2 Frost builds text
EDL	00:16:46,079	00:16:47,103	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	30 minutes later
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:51,711	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	If I had to pick between 3 people or full people that would break into a room
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:58,367	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	There's a good possibility that I could detect which one of them had broken into that room and they're only going to get better in bed
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:03,999	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Do you think maybe one day you'll be able to track somebody like outside moving moving around
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:08,351	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Shirley on the base in the bacteria that they leave behind back exactly what we're investigating
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:13,215	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	He also says being able to identify bacteria in a town sewer system
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:17,311	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Be a really useful in helping us to predict a potential outbreak
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:22,687	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	By noticing that there's a disease-causing bacteria right in the sewage so you can go to town
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:28,319	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And before anyone begins to show symptoms you can say to my way to second we got a quarantine vaccinate we got to do something here
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:30,879	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Nip it in the bud if you will before it becomes
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:32,159	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	A problem
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:34,207	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And as you may have heard this plenty of research
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:35,743	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Looking at the microbiome
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:36,255	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Inside
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:38,047	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Is revolutionising better
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:41,375	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I mean we already have evidence that we can
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:44,191	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Determine whether somebody will have a bad response
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:44,959	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Stewart rug
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:47,263	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Based on the bacteria that oppress
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:49,311	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Inside them so we can screen them
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:50,847	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Using the microbiome to
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:52,895	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	To determine if they have that like the outcome
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:54,431	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	But for now
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:58,271	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Back to this absolutely crucial
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:17:59,039	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And breath
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:03,647	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Taking a spare so let me just quickly remind you of the situation we left
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:05,439	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Do you and I talked a couple of weeks later
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:06,463	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	We got the result
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:08,511	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Quotes from Jack and so I decided to go to Neil
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:09,791	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	To deliver
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:13,119	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And just to set up expectations here Jack told us
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:17,983	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	What he expected was immediately after a handshake a little bit of me would be on Neil
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:20,031	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	A little bit of deal would be on me and that
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:23,615	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Pretty fast the bacteria would die
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:24,127	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And be gone
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:26,175	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	However
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:27,967	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I am very happy to say
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:28,479	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	That
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:29,759	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Is not
EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:32,063	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	What happened what percentage change
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:32,575	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Yes
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:34,879	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	You caused
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:36,415	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	On me of me on you
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,463	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	10%
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:39,231	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	10%
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:42,047	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I can't imagine it
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:44,095	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I would say 1% 10%
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:46,655	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	But not much less than 1%
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:49,215	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	What was less than 10
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:50,239	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	When they came back
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:52,543	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	It was significantly less than 10
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:53,823	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Okay
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:56,127	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	It was
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:57,151	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	0
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:18:59,199	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	0
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:04,319	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	What can it be below there whatever is this
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:07,903	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Actually found a teeny number back here but they die
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:09,695	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Nothing
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:10,975	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	From the
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:12,767	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Nothing it's just it's just
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:15,583	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Should I put it that way
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:16,863	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I mean
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:17,887	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	That was quite shocking
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:20,959	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I we were expecting that to be a lot more bacteria
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:23,007	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Being transferred
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:23,519	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Change
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:29,407	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	So that you know that one person picks up the other person picks up 10/12 bacteria
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:32,223	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I think you might have washed your hand immediately
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:37,599	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	No there's no no no sabotage running
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:39,647	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I hate antibacterial
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:41,439	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I don't use what he called a
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:42,207	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Purell
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:43,231	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Yeah I never use any of
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:49,119	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	So for reasons that are at this moment totally unknown Neil's bacteria simply failed
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:50,399	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Completely
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:51,167	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	2
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:52,447	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Affect my hands
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:54,495	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	The other side of this equation is
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:56,287	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	What would you guess the present
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:58,335	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Might microbes on you
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:00,639	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Okay what I know from physics
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:01,663	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Surfaces
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:03,455	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Is
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:05,247	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	If they have approximately the same
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:06,783	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Coefficient of friction
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:09,343	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Then it's a it's a
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:10,623	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Complete two-way street
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:12,671	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	If I gave you nothing you would have given me nothing
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:13,439	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Is my
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:13,951	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Guess
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:16,767	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Here's what happened he
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:22,911	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Definitely picked up bacteria from you and that led to quite substantial disruption it turns out
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:24,447	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Hi
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:25,983	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Your hand
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:28,287	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	You tell me you were
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:34,431	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Skank nasty
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:39,807	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I came on today funky the percentage
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:42,879	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Before the handshake was that you and I was six
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:43,647	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	50%
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:45,695	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	The same 40% differ
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:46,207	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Post Shake
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:48,255	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	You are more than 75
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:51,839	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Scarlet
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:58,239	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	You made him more You by 15% at least I was swerving all over again
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:21:04,639	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Slightly proud and control all the time
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:06,431	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Staying and staying and stink
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:07,967	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Every time
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:09,503	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I was still there
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:12,319	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	6 minutes later at 12. Nasty
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:18,720	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Could have been an hour later might still be on his hand like yeah I mean there's no indication that they were in 2K
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:21,024	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	When I left you were covered with
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:29,472	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Let the record show he beat his chest in that moment it looks like there is a possibility that some of them could have gone
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:34,080	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I think tonight you think that I might stay on him
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:37,664	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I want a what I think is that there's a high probability
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:42,272	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	But some of those organisms once they set up shop on his hand in those initial 20 minutes
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:43,808	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Could stay on his hand
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:45,344	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	What you mean like forever like
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:46,112	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Forever and ever
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:47,392	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	If there is a possibility
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:49,952	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	There's a possibility
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:50,464	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Versace
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:22:02,496	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Do you have any idea where they're what we've just described is typical of a common handshake experience
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:04,288	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	This is a typical
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:06,592	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I'll be because they may be old outcompeting
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:08,384	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Directions to understand his house
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:10,944	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Strange this result is think about it this way
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:13,504	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Two hands coming together
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:19,648	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	It's like taking a rainforest from Bolivia Anixter and dumping it on top of the rainforest in Brazil
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:27,328	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I was wondering whether any of the trees from the Bolivian rainforest will take roots and you know an adapt and become pretty
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:32,960	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	You all
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:35,008	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Bacteria have home-field advantage
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:37,312	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	They are abundant in the dominant tonight in Parma
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:39,872	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Then we would generally suspected
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:42,432	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Very quickly the invading microbes. To die
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:43,712	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	The killed off
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:44,992	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I'm pissed off
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:46,784	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And I hope they just becoming a
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:49,344	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	It's always happens and it's over and nobody wins
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:49,856	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Versace
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:51,904	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Best mutual decay
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:56,512	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	So am I now successful invasive species on his hand
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:23:01,376	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Some of your microbes are successful invasive species that yeah absolutely
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:02,912	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	How are you
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:03,936	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Spleen mice
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:08,544	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Success what we think actually happened is that something disrupted nilsy Coast
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:09,568	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Right
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:11,872	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I'm with think
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:14,176	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Based on the analysis that there was a stripped
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:14,944	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Secaucus
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:17,504	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Which is usually quite rare but that doesn't sound so good step 2
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:19,552	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Well their loss of species
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:20,576	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Streptococcus
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:21,856	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	No tolls in the pathogenic
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:23,904	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	So there was a stripper
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:27,744	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	The caucus that was very abundant on your hand the beginning
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:31,072	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	That was transferred to Niels how do we see that transfer caring
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:33,632	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I'm not streptococcus somehow
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:35,936	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I'm disrupted music
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:38,752	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	System and allowed for a greater trend
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:40,288	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Bacteria
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:41,568	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	From your hand to his hand
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:42,848	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Oh man
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:47,712	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	That's like a little band of like murderous little bacteria
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:49,760	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And it cleared away the forest
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:55,904	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And then let's sit at the rest of you could come in and colonize I don't know I don't think anybody knows the answer that question all I know is that I'm
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:58,208	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Name all over them
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:00,000	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Out of my soul Robert
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:02,560	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Slaughtered on my body that's fine
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:03,840	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Don t feel any defensiveness
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:06,656	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Towards the fact that he managed to
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:08,960	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Conquer your microbiome and yet yours
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:10,752	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Was unable to do the same to him
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:12,544	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	That by the way is producer Simon Adler
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:14,080	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	So
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:16,384	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	The word conquer in that context I would
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:17,920	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Reword this sentence and say
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:25,088	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	My microbiome was perfectly content staying where it is
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:26,880	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Apparently Roberts
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:27,904	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Microbiome
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:30,464	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Can't wait to get the hell off his body
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:32,512	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Men
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:36,096	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I came here thinking I would find out how long president
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:37,120	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Kennedy stayed on me
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:40,192	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Now there's suddenly a new question
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:42,240	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Cuz if he's a cool cucumber
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:43,776	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	It's all on you stayed on him
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:50,432	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Yeah
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:51,456	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I believe
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:06,048	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Maybe you were the anomaly
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:09,376	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	You're the creepy sweaty man with
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:10,912	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Wet Palms
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:11,936	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	That's what you came here for
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:22,176	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	When did
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:44,960	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Big big things to astrophysicist and author Neil deGrasse Tyson
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:46,496	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	For a
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:47,264	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Putting up with this
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:50,592	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Shenanigans I can go 5 days without a shower
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:51,872	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	And you wouldn't know it
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:55,968	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Lemon smelling his armpits
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:57,248	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	I just don't
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:25:58,528	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Smell
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:10,816	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	If you're on the way to smelling bad
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:28,480	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	This story was produced by Simon
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:35,392	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Big thanks to Jared myself digital of the technical work the lab work that gave us our microbial analysis

EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:05,600	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Stuck with this
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:07,392	| radiolab_podcast17funkyhandjive |	Baby things with a
