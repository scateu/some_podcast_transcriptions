EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:36,320	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	But I just wanted to get to the bottom of it
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:38,880	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And so what Mark did

EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:06,239	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Sticks to the scaffolding or something
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:07,519	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Maybe that's what's happening
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:12,895	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	You can't prove it there's some Theory which indicates that that might happen
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:14,687	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	But if you go in the laboratory
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:15,455	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	You trying to make it
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:16,223	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	You can't make it
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:17,503	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So can't prove it
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:19,295	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:26,207	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	If you get a book on ball lightning or you get my book and look at the chapter on ball lightning
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:31,071	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	You'll see probably a list of 50 different theories of people of come up with
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:33,119	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	All the way up
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:37,983	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Black holes and then discontinuities and time space and
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:39,519	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Things that are just
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:41,567	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Completely
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:43,871	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Almost out of this world
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:45,151	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So they remain a mystery
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:46,943	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	But
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:49,503	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Well observed history
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:55,647	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And other people don't have any good math for how lightning get started in a cloud
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:59,999	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Really I didn't know that we don't know what how lightning can get started
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:01,279	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Shouldn't be able to
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:07,679	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	It shouldn't really be based on what the math says there's not enough money
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,191	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Saint Cloud
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:12,031	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So you're saying understood
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:15,615	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Almost nothing is understood
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,943	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Floundering around

EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:27,903	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Do you find yourself thinking about ball lightning and then suddenly just tiptoeing into an existential crisis
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:30,975	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	How little we know of the world
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:36,863	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So I make my living as trying to uncover a little bit little more bits by little more bits but
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:39,423	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Yo there's lots of it at 9

EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:08,255	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Millions of visitors like Tracy would walk through these hallowed Halls
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:14,399	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Question questions fueled by curiosity the desire for truth or knowledge for wisdom people trying to unravel
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:16,191	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	The mysteries of
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:17,215	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	The universe
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:23,615	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	I came here to ask him a question about catnip
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:25,663	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Cabinet
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:28,991	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Yes catnip why why why can't I
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:31,039	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So we actually got like
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:33,087	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	500 questions from our listeners
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:37,183	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So I thought it might be good idea to take some of them to the library
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,999	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So I met up with this woman
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:45,631	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	She walk me into this office
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:47,167	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	There's about like I don't know
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:52,543	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	All people sitting at their death
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:56,895	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Imanage ask my DL and I've been in this department for about 5 years
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:58,431	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Smione
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:03,551	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Nypl it's 917 ask nypl and putting phone number out there
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:05,343	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And if you call them
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:06,879	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And you ask him a question
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:08,415	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	It's their job to answer
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,695	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Yes and so we are
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:13,791	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Like a call center so article day
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,327	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Starts with questions
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:16,607	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And I get a typical day honey
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:27,359	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	150 to 200 and resumes telling me that most of the questions they get it will the weather be like this weekend.
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:30,175	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Boring pay my library card expired or I wonder when you
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:34,015	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Spock you know also they they get some weird ones
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:34,783	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Ichthammol
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:36,063	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Yeah
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:39,647	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So I got a list right here and in the past they've gotten things like
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:46,047	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	What kind of apple did eat is it proper to go alone to Reno to get a divorce statistics on the lifespan of the abandoned woman
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:52,447	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Elicense in India what is the natural enemy of the book telling me how to be a mistress of Ceremonies at a musical or what does it mean when you dream
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:53,471	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Elephant
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:56,031	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Advanced robot
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:57,311	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Biltrite
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:59,615	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	I was maybe a little dismissive
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:00,639	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Ford fuel pump
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:02,175	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	I mean all the questions
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:03,455	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Of course you're very important
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:05,247	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	We welcome all questions
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:11,647	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Play this by the way is Bernard Bernard and Marsha Bean has been working for asking my plc's about
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:18,047	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	2001 answer the question he did answer my catnip question which is large feline species like tigers and lions
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,839	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Lions have the same reaction to catnip
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:21,119	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	As domestic cats
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:28,031	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Yes I cats like catnip apparently tigers at least that I had all these questions so actually had them
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:31,615	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Take one that they thought was super interesting which one did you pick
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:33,407	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Tooth answer
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:35,199	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Having me get the exact wording
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:35,711	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:41,343	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Yeah so here we go could you play a meaningful game of frisbee on the surf
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:41,855	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Pics of Mars
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:43,647	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	End
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:48,255	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Yeah that was a good one and I think the word that makes it like just
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:49,279	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Really shine is
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:50,559	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Meaningful
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:52,095	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:54,655	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	The first thing he does you want to get me kind of doing some
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:59,007	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Some searching you know again back-of-the-envelope kind of stuff here
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:02,591	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	A little disappointed that you didn't bust out any like books
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:05,663	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	I'm just looking up frisbee aerodynamic
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:09,503	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	She literally just turned a frisbee behavior on Earth
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:13,087	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	The spin of the Frisbee of course the lift
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:13,855	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Drag
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:15,391	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	But he looks all that stuff up
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:18,719	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Assume that like aerodynamics on Mars
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:19,487	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	On Mars
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:24,351	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Bear youth in the air there are so
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:26,399	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Fitting lifting thing that you begin
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:27,167	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Frisbee
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:29,471	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Not have the same sort of
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:34,847	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Hovering effect that a frisbee does here on Earth and it probably would be more like just
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:35,359	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Throwing up
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,407	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Ball it would just go
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:44,575	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Ten feet away 15 feet away I don't think that that's that counts as a meaningful game of frisbee
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:50,207	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	People throw it back and forth but leaving.
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:51,487	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	You're playing frisbee
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:52,767	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	On Mars
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:57,887	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	I mean it's just that should be inherently meaningful
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:14:00,703	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	In a growing up I remember seeing
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:04,799	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	A rebroadcast
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:05,567	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Of
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:11,455	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	You know like the astronauts on the moon
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:14,271	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Playing golf
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:27,839	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And I'm sure that they were not playing like
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:30,143	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	You know PGA
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:30,655	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Gall
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:44,735	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	They were just you know amateur Duffer's but
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:49,087	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	They were golfing on the moon
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:54,975	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	I mean to me that's
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:59,583	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Pretty good pretty impressive the venue
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:01,119	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Kind of
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:06,239	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Makes the whole Endeavor meaningful I think in it and its way
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:18,527	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Thanks to producer treatment
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:22,111	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	I asked you did ask them my dragons question
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:24,159	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Well then turn next up

EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:42,079	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	I'm a native of Novato at Northern California
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:43,359	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And I was born and raised here
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:45,151	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Love this place
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:50,527	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And you and what was your question to his if you remember what it was roughly
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:52,319	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Came across this

EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:16,895	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	The article touched on the idea that
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:18,175	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Ya folklore
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:19,199	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Thought that you
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:21,247	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Little Creatures were actually like

EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:35,583	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	I started digging into it a little bit and of course you can only find so much on the internet but there was this idea of drag
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:39,423	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Being assertive like a universal myth
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:40,703	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Across
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:44,031	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	You know different disparate cultures and
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:47,103	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Christina started to wonder why it seemed that
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:50,175	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So many cultures all over the world I'll have Miss
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:51,455	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	About dragon
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:52,991	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	What is it about like humans
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:56,063	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	About cause them to believe in these like huge

EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:03,743	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Set true that yeah.
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:10,143	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Sort out you had the northern European dragon that we're all familiar with then there's the Chinese
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:13,215	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Dragon which is a little different that doesn't have wings doesn't breathe fire
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:20,127	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Then there's other Dragon looking for two things the Nana Bolognese
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:26,271	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Pool in southern Africa. There is the Amar associated with the Incan Empire yeah I think there's no doubt that
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:28,063	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	We have fabulous awesome
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:29,087	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Creatures like
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:29,599	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Dragons
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:32,415	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	In almost every culture
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:32,927	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	In the world
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:37,535	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So this is Adrienne mayor research scholar in the classic

EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:39,583	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Stanford
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:42,655	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And I'm most interested in is what sorts of things
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:43,935	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Found in nature
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:45,983	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Might have led pre-scientific
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:46,751	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	People
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:48,799	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	To believe that dragons or
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:50,335	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Monsters are there fantastic
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:54,175	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	The creatures really existed at least in the past or even maybe in
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:54,943	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Present
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:57,759	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Adrian actually got a book called the first fossil Hunters
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:18:02,623	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	That lays out the theory that a lot of these stories were actually based on
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:04,159	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	People finding old
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:06,975	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Dino fossils and Bone fossil bones
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:08,255	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Are teeth or claws
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:10,559	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Footprints embedded in stone
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:16,191	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So they see a set of old bones that they couldn't explain with any modern features
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:18,239	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So the creature they go to is this
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:19,519	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Dragons
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:20,543	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Sheep thing
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:21,311	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Yes
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:22,591	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	But I do want to
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:23,615	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Queen Elsa
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:25,919	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	We can never know for certain which comes first.
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:27,455	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Observations of
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:28,991	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Mystery is traces of
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:35,391	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Of unknown animals or the stories of dragons we don't know which comes first she said it could be that the story about the Dragon
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:41,791	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Ken was already there and then when they found some bones they just sort of apply those bones to the dragon f
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:44,351	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	If the dragon came before the bones where did it come from
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:46,399	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	There's another theory
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:48,447	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Some Scholars have said they're like
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:50,751	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Monsters of the ear they arise from
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:52,543	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Ancient Memories
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:55,103	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	A very real predator
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:56,383	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	That were face
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:58,943	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	By our ancestors basically
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:04,831	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Dragons are composite of the Seas creatures that used to eat us and in Huntington kill us like crocodiles
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:07,647	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Saber tooth tigers and lions have bears
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:08,415	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Gigantic
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:11,743	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Serpent snakes pythons Honda Raptors
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:18,655	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	They can take like this scaly skin of the crocodile the claws of the saber-tooth tiger in the seaport
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:25,055	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	He put the wing of the Raptors put them all together is all the old Terrors rolled into one like
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:28,895	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Boom together
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:30,943	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Attack in to all those fears that are ready
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:32,479	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Cranberry inside
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:35,039	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	I'm going to go for that one
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:40,927	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Yeah like that that works that that feels like an answer
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:42,463	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Scary that could be very destructive
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:46,303	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	What's kind of magical in in Game of Thrones
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:47,839	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	The intimate scenes
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:48,863	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Wholesale
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:55,263	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Hard and bring you closer to these creatures that should be in a burning your face off
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:58,591	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	That she just used this whole Dragon thing to talk to
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:19:59,871	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	This lady at game from Game of Thrones
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:06,271	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Her name is Paula Fairfield and she makes all the dragon noises for Game of Thrones
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:09,599	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Oh she makes the dragons what did you ask her I guess it was
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:10,623	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	What did you want to know
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:13,695	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Well I wanted to know I like I wanted to know like how does she make
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:18,559	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	These
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:24,959	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Sounds and it was really interesting cuz you know we're talking a little bit about you know how dragons are composite creatures
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:30,335	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And she basically uses Composites to make these noises
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:31,871	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Absolutely take some places from
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:33,151	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Birds
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:35,455	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Ricci Chriqui bird sounds
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:37,503	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	In fact
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:43,903	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Different kinds of reptilian recordings and stuff and key is it always scary animals
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:49,279	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Dragon that sheet you know which of the Dragon said she's trying to actually create a performance Ford I have
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:51,583	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Sounds I might choose simply by
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:54,143	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Certain personality traits that I might want
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:54,911	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Push forward
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:21:01,567	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So in the case of drocon
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:07,967	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So on the show there's the nearest
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:10,783	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Dragon Queen and she has three dragons
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:13,087	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And one of them is named Rogan
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:15,391	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And she named
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:16,928	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	That dragon
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:17,952	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	After
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:18,464	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Khal Drogo
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:19,488	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Heard
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:21,024	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Hot late husband
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:24,352	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:26,400	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Drogon is like her lover
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:32,544	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	He kind of has like a very affectionate
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:34,592	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Central relationship with her
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:42,016	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	He's whistling at her all the time he's looking at her butt and going oh baby
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:52,000	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And so in order to kind of push for this sort of like
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:54,048	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Dragon sexual tension I guess
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:55,840	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	She uses the sounds of
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:57,376	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Two giant tortoises
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:58,144	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Animating
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:00,448	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Tortoises
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:01,728	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	It sound like
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:03,008	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Well
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:05,824	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And I'm out to play it
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:11,712	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Wow
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:15,296	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	The grown of the mail actually became
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:20,928	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	With some working and you know just meant and stuff became I'm the source
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:21,952	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	The basis for
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:23,744	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Drogon spur with her
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:32,704	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Volaris
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:36,032	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	We need to respond
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:37,824	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	My people need me
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:44,736	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	The funny thing about the Pervert Rogan was watching people watch it and giggling when they heard it but not really knowing why
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:46,016	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	That's me and it's big
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:47,296	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Because it had
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:52,160	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	That ass instead that kind of sensual sexual Essence at / so yeah
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:53,952	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	All all kinds of things and
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:55,488	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	You know I also use
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:56,256	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	4
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:58,048	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Dragonfly wings
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:58,816	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	2
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:01,888	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Make that kind of funny flutter of the
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:02,912	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Thorin sets
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:05,728	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Since moving like especially on the end of his tail this year
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:07,520	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	As you move through there was like a chitter
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:09,312	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And that was like dragonfly wings
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:11,104	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Dragonfly wings
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:12,128	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Yeah
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:16,992	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	I I was wondering if you ever had a question about dragons that you would like to have answered
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:19,296	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	You don't know it says Cheerios
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:21,344	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Because I think the thing that differentiates
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:21,856	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	It's the dragons
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:24,416	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Preachers and makes them
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:26,208	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Slightly I play
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:27,488	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Is the fire thing
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,024	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Where did the idea
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:32,608	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	That's a good question where did that come from
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:34,912	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Well there many theories about
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:37,216	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	That actually I took that question back to a dreamer

EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:46,176	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	To the devastating weapon called Greek Fire which was this unquenchable fire can't be put out by water

EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:49,248	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And so it was a Naval Weapon
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:52,832	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And I believe that Scholars have found that
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:56,416	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Some of the nozzles for lasting Greek fire
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:57,952	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	4 shaped like dragon

EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:09,216	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	They had dragons that breathe fire

EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:05,184	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	When a kid you know did something
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:07,744	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	It just means you lean back and say

EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:11,584	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Maybe it was the moment that
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:13,376	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	A kid you've been reading to 4 months
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:15,168	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Started reading back to you
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:17,728	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Or maybe the kid was a piano
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:21,824	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:23,872	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Or maybe the kids in math
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:26,688	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Music in the margin of their geometry

EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:04,576	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	With more questions
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:05,856	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Next one comes from
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:07,392	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Producer Rachel Cusack
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:13,280	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So this question comes from Liam hamburger from Denver Colorado
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:18,144	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	I was browsing memes on my Instagram feed
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:23,264	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	The picture was trying to go to sleep
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:31,968	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And the caption was her he's probably thinking about other girls and then
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:36,320	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	What do you say wonder what
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:40,416	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Yeah so he said I wonder if I've ever bought milk from the same cow twice
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:46,048	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So if I go to the store I bought a gallon of milk and then I go back maybe a week later I got another gallon of milk
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:50,400	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	What are the odds that the same towel is in both of those gallons of milk
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:58,592	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	I would say
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:28:00,384	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	The answer is almost
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:01,920	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Certainly
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:02,944	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	100%
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:06,016	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Start Benjamin he's a math professor Harvey Mudd College
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:07,552	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Claremont California
EDL	00:28:07,552	00:28:09,088	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And I'm also a nap emoji
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:16,000	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And how is he so sure that it's 100% according to Benjamin it all comes down to
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:17,280	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And dare I say
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:17,792	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Calculator
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:22,400	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So take a farm like Dale's here
EDL	00:28:22,400	00:28:23,424	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	My name is Dale
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:26,496	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Pine Hollow Dairy Dale has about a thousand cows
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:33,152	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And 22 time you cows walk into a milking parlor they lineup it looks like a wishbone all day all night
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:38,528	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And they get hooked up with these black rubber hoses are your here and there is a guy putting them
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:40,064	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Machine on a cow and he hits the
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:41,600	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Button that turns on the vacuum and then
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:43,648	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Out of there others
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:46,720	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Into the big hose along the bottom of the floor
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:47,488	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Run to the house
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:52,352	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And it's meeting up with all the milk from all the other cows

EDL	00:29:18,208	00:29:23,328	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Amazon picks up milk and it stops at another Farm in another Farm in another Farm until
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:24,608	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	The truck is full

EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:37,920	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And I still have my
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:41,504	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	My back-of-the-envelope that have the
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:45,856	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Calculation here here's with my something there are about 90000
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:46,624	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Drops of milk
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:47,904	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	In a gallon

EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:52,512	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Contributing

EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:56,096	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	A drop of milk
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:30:00,448	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	From anyone tile getting into any particular gallon but probably the case
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:02,240	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Gallon of milk
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:03,008	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Contains
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:04,544	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Most of those cows
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:10,688	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Contributing nothing in one drop of milk you could probably have a bunch of different milk molecules from a bunch of different
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:13,248	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And so one glass of milk
EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:14,784	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Might have
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:19,392	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Maybe hundreds of thousands of different
EDL	00:30:19,392	00:30:20,928	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	County Public Schools
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:21,696	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	In my glass
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:22,720	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Wow
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:29,632	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	I'm going back to the original question Arts argument is that
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:35,264	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	When you're drinking a glass of milk there's like so many different bits of milk from so many different cows
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:36,288	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Then it's probably the case
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:38,592	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Two glasses
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:40,128	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Look now. You're almost certain to
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:42,432	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	A cow that was rapped
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:47,552	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So you're bound to run into at least a little bit of one of those hundred thousand cows
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:50,112	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Again there's no point being that every glass of milk
EDL	00:30:50,880	00:30:53,952	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Thousands and thousands of different cows
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:59,584	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Contributing to it a little bit of 10000 cows in every class in every glass of milk
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:05,984	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	I love that I don't know that I know it's great it's like you're enjoying the collective efforts of this entire species
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:12,128	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Oh no I think it should be the product of one or two cows when you can picture in your head and maybe pat on the nose
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:13,152	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Thank you you could say
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:15,200	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Yeah I know I'm with both of you I feel like
EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:21,600	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	It weirds me out but I also think it's kind of cool at the same time what happens if you drink a glass of milk
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:22,368	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	In New York
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:24,416	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Get on a plane flight to Atlanta
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:30,816	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Then have another glass of milk are you getting the same 10,000 in each class or are they different 10,000
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:33,888	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Answer that question and it seems like no one really wants
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:35,424	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	To pay to ship milk that far
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:39,776	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And so basically it done processing plant might be in a whole different group
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:48,224	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	If you really want to figure out exactly which plant your milk is coming from you can go to where is my milk from.com
EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:49,504	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Yeah and
EDL	00:31:49,504	00:31:52,832	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	You input a little code on the top of your carton

EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:24,480	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So Zach Murray it was years ago actually they sent us an email
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:28,576	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	But what I think is like one of the most confounding perplexing mysterious devices
EDL	00:33:28,576	00:33:31,392	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	He can find inside anybody's home peso the microwave
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:33,440	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	I guess I guess what I'm wondering is
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:37,792	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	1 why were you microwaving peppers in too deep
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:39,840	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	GMM of this happen
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:40,864	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	What happened

EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:58,016	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And I said oh. Don't put those in the microwave
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:34:00,832	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And I was just like
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:01,856	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	You're crazy
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:07,744	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Hogwash
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:11,072	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Mom put some peppers in the microwave in a spark
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:17,472	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	My first thought was that he was wrong that's what I thought I bet your memory was like there must have been a piece of metal in them
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:22,592	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Nike wavys don't remember that and that's what was barking up cuz special I wouldn't do that
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:26,432	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Nothing until
EDL	00:34:26,432	00:34:28,480	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	We have the ability to find this out
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:30,784	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And I approve that's wrong
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:36,160	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So that was like five years ago in the past so we decided we would actually do
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:37,184	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Our own experiment
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:38,208	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	The present
EDL	00:34:38,720	00:34:39,744	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	To get to the bottom of this
EDL	00:34:39,744	00:34:40,768	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Do green peppers
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:47,680	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Spark in the microwave first thing first I shouldn't bottom microwave
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:54,080	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	How's it going fifty bucks
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:55,616	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Alright alright baby
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:57,920	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And carried it like

EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:28,192	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Play Bad
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:29,472	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Take a break
EDL	00:37:37,664	00:37:39,712	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	What did you say to Maria after the
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:40,736	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Peppers
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:42,528	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Spark in microwave
EDL	00:37:42,528	00:37:45,344	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	I think I would I don't know I was totally speechless
EDL	00:37:54,816	00:37:57,120	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So pepper spark in microwave that was settled but
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:38:01,984	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	The debate about my understanding of how microwaves work
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:02,752	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Why
EDL	00:38:02,752	00:38:05,824	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Maybe it's just that ever have a lot of moisture in it
EDL	00:38:05,824	00:38:08,384	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Zach maybe it's you put the pepper in microwave all that water get
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:14,784	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Skin act as like Tinder and that lights on fire quickly
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:17,600	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And I think that the green one
EDL	00:38:18,112	00:38:19,392	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Taste a little bit
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:24,768	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Little bit of metal in there that Sparky
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:27,072	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Is your next step to
EDL	00:38:27,072	00:38:30,912	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Find the appropriate scientist oh yeah I'm definitely going to try it
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:32,448	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Put this case to bed
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:34,496	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Yeah just give us one moment
EDL	00:38:35,008	00:38:40,384	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So ended up tracking down this woman is Caroline Caroline
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:41,152	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Okay
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:42,176	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Carolina Ross
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:47,296	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Summer professor in the department of Materials Science and Engineering in MIT and experience
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:49,344	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Microwave a donut with some
EDL	00:38:49,344	00:38:52,416	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	With roast potatoes
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:55,488	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Yeah I've seen Sparks most potatoes
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:56,256	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Alright so yeah
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:38:58,816	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So Astrid in the case of
EDL	00:38:58,816	00:38:59,328	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	The peppers
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:01,376	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Potatoes or
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:03,424	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Are the grapes like all the different food that we tried
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:05,728	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Like what happens in a microwave
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:08,032	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	The food just relay
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:11,872	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So they got some pieces of paper in the microwave
EDL	00:39:11,872	00:39:12,640	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Press start
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:14,176	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Like what
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:15,200	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	What happened
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:16,224	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Okay
EDL	00:39:16,224	00:39:17,504	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So that was a
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:23,904	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Gadgets in the microwave oven that produces the microwaves it's called a magnet phone and it's an interesting
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:24,672	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Thing in itself
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:30,048	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Okay quicksand it's basically like this hunk of metal that makes microwaves but Kailyn told me it's really cool thing which is
EDL	00:39:30,048	00:39:35,168	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	If she's be used in World War 4 radar that was in the forties and then
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:40,800	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	In 1945 there was an engineer Raytheon who was working on these devices
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:44,640	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And he found that some candy ball he had in his pocket got hot
EDL	00:39:44,640	00:39:49,248	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Like this Cooks food until then SLI magnetron got thrown inside of a mailbox
EDL	00:39:49,248	00:39:50,528	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Indus was born
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:54,112	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	The microwave so it's an interesting thing in itself but
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:56,672	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	It produces a beam of microwaves and they
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:40:00,512	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Bounce Around inside the microwave oven moving at the speed of light
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:02,304	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	What is pounding
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:04,352	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Into the pepper
EDL	00:40:04,352	00:40:06,400	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Like shooting independent episode
EDL	00:40:08,192	00:40:10,496	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And these microwaves
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:16,384	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	They are the right kind of frequency to cause the molecules in food to oscillate back and forth
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:19,200	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	You put the pepper in that so
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:23,296	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	The purpose of lots of water inlet Esquivel the things as well
EDL	00:40:23,296	00:40:24,320	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:28,416	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Those molecules stops absorbing the microwaves and bouncing back and forth and
EDL	00:40:28,416	00:40:30,720	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Hitting each other and heating up
EDL	00:40:30,720	00:40:33,792	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	And then that fit gets even home satin even horse app
EDL	00:40:33,792	00:40:34,560	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Eventually
EDL	00:40:35,072	00:40:36,608	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	It could burst into flames
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:38,656	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	But that is not
EDL	00:40:38,656	00:40:39,680	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	What we're seeing
EDL	00:40:39,680	00:40:41,728	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	With our pepperoni
EDL	00:40:42,240	00:40:43,520	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	It's not no because
EDL	00:40:43,520	00:40:44,288	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Is Caroline
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:46,336	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Find me a flame is very different
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:47,616	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	I got a spark
EDL	00:40:47,616	00:40:50,176	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	So one thing to keep in mind just that some
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:57,088	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	The pepper is fairly conductive it's go to all this water and that we know that water can conduct electricity
EDL	00:40:57,088	00:40:59,904	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Computer has a lot of salt dissolved in it
EDL	00:40:59,904	00:41:06,304	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Minerals things like that in that sense it's a little bit like a piece of metal metal as we know so
EDL	00:41:06,304	00:41:08,864	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Microwave energy Roswell as we all know
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:11,168	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Yes
EDL	00:41:15,264	00:41:18,848	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	30 Gatti's pizza pepperoni microwave in there
EDL	00:41:21,152	00:41:24,736	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Another thing is the microwave like the wave itself it has an electric field
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:29,856	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Which house lights back and forth high frequency
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:32,416	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Shoot in a piece of paper what happened is
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:34,464	| radiolab_podcast17biglittlequestions |	Is electricity starts
