EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:33,375	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	10 years or so
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:35,423	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	So he started hearing lots of stories
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:36,191	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Just liking
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:39,775	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Somebody shows up at the office convinced that they're allergic
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:41,055	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	All of a sudden for no apparent
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:44,639	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	To read me the first time I heard it
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:47,711	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Was probably as early as 2000
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:50,271	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And every single time he heard
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,063	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	You would tell the patient
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:53,087	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Exactly what they mean
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:55,391	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I told her no no way
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:56,927	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	No no no it's not possible
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:57,695	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Right
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:59,231	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	So what was wrong with these complaints
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:01,535	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Orthodox Medical
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:03,327	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Oh everything I don't
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:06,655	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Don't become allergic to something they've eaten for
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:08,191	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	40 years
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:13,311	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Out of the blue and suddenly not read me this page
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:14,847	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I think you must be making this up
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:16,639	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Because I can
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:18,943	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I don't I don't use language like that
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:24,319	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I said I say that bad that I was I was trying to give you your energy

EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:34,047	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Got you know some
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:35,327	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Goslee disease
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:39,167	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	When is the when he hear a story like Amy's
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:40,703	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	He just didn't believe
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:42,239	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	But then
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:44,031	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Everything change
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:45,823	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Thanks
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:50,687	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	This new cancer drug called cetuximab
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:52,223	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	In New York
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:53,759	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Today Martha Stewart was in
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:54,527	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Indicted on Criminal
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:57,343	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	This is the very drug that got Martha
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:59,903	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Stuart in all that trouble for insider trading
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:02,719	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Remember that I went to jail for 6 months
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:04,767	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Anyway very promising
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:05,535	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Exciting new drug
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:06,559	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	But then
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:10,911	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Doctors were giving people this injection
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:11,679	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:13,983	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And just like end up on the floor of the doctor's office
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:14,751	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	In shock
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:16,799	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Yeah that would be an anaphylactic shock
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:19,359	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Their hearts would start beating faster that get shorter
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:21,151	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Breath and get stomach cramps
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:25,503	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Their immune system would start to overreact to something new and alien
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:27,039	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Came in with the drug
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:28,063	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Basically a classic
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:29,343	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Allergic
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:30,367	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	So
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:33,183	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Dentistry lands on Thomas platts-mills desk
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:39,327	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Yes so we were honest to look at cetuximab to see if they could figure out what was causing it
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:41,887	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And it has two groups of blood
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:44,447	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	A control sample and then people that have this allergy
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:47,519	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Any quick easy rodian on a particular molecule
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:50,079	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	It was part of the drug
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:51,359	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	This sugar
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:53,919	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Galactose Alpha 1 3 galactose
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:58,527	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Alpha gal Alpha gal
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:09:59,295	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	As in a
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:01,855	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Particularly great lady
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:06,975	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Better than the beta or gamma gamma alpha male to female didn't quite have a ring to it
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,023	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Anyway
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:11,583	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	It seemed like alpha-gal was the Copa
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:14,143	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Yeah and if you told me four years earlier
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:17,727	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	That there's a whole lot of people out there who are allergic
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:18,495	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	To this sugar
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:20,287	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I'd have thought you would
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:21,055	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Smoking
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:27,199	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	You know vaping again because not only does this sugar alpha-gal show up in the cancer drug
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:28,991	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	This is where you get back to Amy
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:31,295	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	It also shows up in the blood of mammals
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:38,719	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	All non-primate mammals
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:43,071	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	So every time you eat lamb or beef goat
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:44,607	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Camel even try
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:46,143	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	4pics kidneys
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:47,935	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	You're also eating alpha-gal
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:53,823	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Some reading this article and it says like
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:57,663	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	This thing called Alpha the lactase are alpha-gal or what
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:02,015	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Don't make no sense that someone like Amy who been eating meat all her life
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:04,319	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Allergic
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:08,159	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I just was like this was so stupid also

EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:22,495	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And I was like
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:27,615	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Not eat meat and not even know so I was like forget it my doctor will test me I'm going to

EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:07,007	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Why people like Amy who has lived for 40 years
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:10,079	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Eating porterhouse steaks at Peter lugers with a credit
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:13,151	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Why would she suddenly develop an allergy
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:15,455	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	That is some kind of trigger
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:16,735	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Yes we were looking for
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:18,783	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Could explain it
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:22,111	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	It could be a mole that could be a nematode worm
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:23,391	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Or a fungus
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:24,927	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	But then he looked at
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:29,535	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Again and noticed that all the people who have bad reactions to the cancer
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:32,095	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	They were in a particular area of the country
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:39,263	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	West Virginia North Carolina Southern Missouri has no cases in Salt Lake City no case
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:41,823	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Denver smatterings down the West
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:43,871	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	So he turned to his technician J
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:50,015	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I said you got a Google every map you can find and say what matches that are
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:55,647	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Creatures or diseases that appear wherever the allergy appears
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:57,183	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Show Jake starts
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:16:01,023	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Googling Googling Googling Googling and eventually
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:02,303	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	He comes across a map
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:05,375	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	That matches where the cases are very beautiful
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:07,935	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	The maximum area for Rocky Mountain
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:11,007	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Spotted fever so he met this little map and it's like the
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:16,127	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Shaded dark areas of the country are places with Rocky Mountain spotted fever and then there's like some Stars
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:16,639	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I swear
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:20,735	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	This allergy had appeared yeah and they they overlap
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:23,039	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Very interesting
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:25,343	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And then all the sudden
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:26,623	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	It clicks
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:30,719	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a tick-borne disease
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:35,071	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	This is the distribution of a lone star tick
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:40,191	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And actually just a little before this it turns out an allergist down in Australia
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:43,519	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Carol Vance unit
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:46,847	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	The Noonan v i n n n n u n e end
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:51,711	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And I'm from The Tick induced allergies research and Wellness Center in Sydney Australia
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:54,783	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	She said she was now being visited by all kinds of P
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:55,807	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	People who claim suddenly
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:17:02,719	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	To be allergic to meat and whenever I take a history so if example at Austin was their family history of brown eyes
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:04,511	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	The 6-month asthma
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:08,351	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	A stinging insect allergy nice a label being bitten by ticks
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:10,143	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	When we started asking patients
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:12,447	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	We suddenly heard the stories
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:13,983	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Just out
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:15,519	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Kazoo
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:19,615	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	But at this point Dr platts-mills all he has
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:20,639	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Is a map
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:21,407	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Some stories
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:22,687	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Anaheim
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:23,711	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Right so
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:25,247	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	So what does he do
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:26,015	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Well
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:27,551	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Maybe I'll just do this to myself
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:30,367	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	He does what he decides to test it on himself
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:37,791	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Oh my God he's our like denies that he did it intentionally I know I had no intention me
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:40,095	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I think you also likes to walk and amble and
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:44,447	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Think about things right so he does for a long walk along the Blue Ridge
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:47,775	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Mountain man I knew I wanted to be off trial because
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:50,847	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I'm actually rather allergic to humans
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:56,991	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	So he's walking and walking and walking along the way he bumps into a whole bunch of
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:18:00,319	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And if you walk into a nest of those things only
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:06,463	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	If it sounds like a nightmare absolutely 200C ticks and then
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:13,375	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	In November that year I was taking out to dinner and lamb chops with particular deliciousness
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:14,655	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	The French wine was delicious
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:18,239	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And 6 hours later I woke up covered in hives
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:21,567	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	He's got an allergy to red meat
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:23,359	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	All just because of a
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:24,895	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Tick by tick bite that's right

EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:23,263	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Do you
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:25,823	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:29,919	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of the musical score
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:31,967	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Or maybe the kids in math class
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:34,783	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	You noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:18,303	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	A tick bite
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:19,583	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Tick bite
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:25,727	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Like a few weeks before all this started happening
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:28,031	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	As I said I was foraging for
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:30,335	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Ramps my mom's backyard
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:31,615	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And I had a tick
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:36,991	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	My on my arm no turns out that Not only was that tick bite
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:38,271	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Terrible thing for Amy
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:40,319	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	It was a kind of double chine
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:47,231	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Amongst the trees
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:52,351	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And I think it's only right at this point backup is it
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:55,167	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And consider the story from Atticus point of view
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:21:01,567	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Okay so I'm Grandpa clean
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:04,895	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I'm a wildlife disease ecologist at the University of Tennessee
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:06,943	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	So I was wondering if you could help us

EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:15,903	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	So they start off
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:17,440	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Little pile of eggs
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:18,976	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Perhaps a massive

EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:21,280	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Under the leaves
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:22,560	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	The proud mom just
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:25,376	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	At that point she's just a kind of a withered husk
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:26,912	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Mean that
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:30,240	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Anyway few weeks later those pigs
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:33,824	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And this massive 2000 baby ticks
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:36,128	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Emerge from underbelly
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:42,528	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Could I see them with my naked eye if you ran into a mass of them all up together
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:44,320	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Would feel like you got a little smudge of good

EDL	00:21:57,120	00:22:00,448	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Is that they dry out so when they come up from under the sea
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:03,008	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Steve's they come up briefly and then they go back down
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:05,056	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Come back up
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:09,152	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Thirsty go back down and rehydrate
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:11,456	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And we refer to the behaviorist Quest

EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:45,760	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	So you best stand up
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:49,344	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Stretch out all your little legs and do a tick.
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:56,000	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	So it's kind of interpretive dance why you waiting for that mounts to come just us enough
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:57,024	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Rabbit
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:58,560	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Suck your dancing your way
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:00,864	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	You're dancing in you
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:01,632	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Reading
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:03,424	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And you're dancing
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:05,216	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And you're waiting
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:06,496	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And you're
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:07,008	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Dancing
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:12,384	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	To be honest you are probably going to
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:13,408	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Wait your entire life
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:15,968	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And die unfulfilled
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:17,248	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Because
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:20,576	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	There are two thousand to be starting off
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:22,880	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And a stable Tech population
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:24,672	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Is Ernie going to be
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:26,464	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Two of you that survived
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:27,488	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Oh my gosh
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:31,840	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	So 1998 little baby ticks are born and then that's it
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:36,448	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Let's say that you're one of the lucky
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:40,544	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And one sunny day there you are hanging up on your little leaf when
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:41,824	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	You detect
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:45,664	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Two incoming mammals what is a 40 year old
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:47,200	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	The other is her daughter
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:52,320	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Wave detector
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:58,464	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And saved you waving your dancing and you're hoping and dancing in your opinion no waiting in your dancing in your home
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:05,888	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Grab
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:07,168	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Any
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:08,704	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And survive
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:12,032	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	The reason that
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:13,568	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Tech ended up on me
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:14,080	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Was
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:16,896	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I slept in bed with my dog naked
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:21,760	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I mean she's always make it but I was also thinking that's not gross I don't
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:23,808	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	That sound weird
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:24,576	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	But what button
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:30,976	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	How do you know that's when it happened because I know that like I did a good tick check on myself and I took a shower
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:32,000	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Power and everything
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:33,024	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And then
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:35,328	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	In the middle of the night I woke up
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:40,704	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	What's up itching sensation and I went to the bathroom and I couldn't really see what was like
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:43,008	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Something was on the back of my arm and it was a
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:46,592	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Protec so as the tick is biting into a me
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:49,664	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	What is it giving Amy that's going to make your allergic
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:54,784	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Two meatballs I need to stop to that Robert
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:25:02,464	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	That's Peter Smith and rejoining us is shoveled in the scientist.
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:03,744	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Circulation we don't really know
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:05,280	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	But here's a theory
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:12,192	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Normally when you eat a piece of meat you put alpha-gal in your stomach and your stomach digestion is in your body
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:18,592	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	But the tick cunningly drilling injects its saliva
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:20,384	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	A football that text that takes pit
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:21,920	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Into at the victims
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:23,712	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Straight into its victim largest
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:27,296	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Organ the skin and thick spit as an anti-clotting
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:32,416	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Anesthetic anti-inflammatory compounds and we think the alpha-gal
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:35,488	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	That Peter says the thing about the skin
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:37,536	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Is the skin is like this enormous like
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:38,816	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Surveillance
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:40,096	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	It's always on the look
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:41,120	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Gottfried Invader so
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:43,424	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Wind me up y'all comes
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:44,448	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Through your skin
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:45,216	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Covered by owner
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:47,008	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Bad bad ticks pits
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:48,288	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Stop that's going to really like
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:49,312	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Set off your means
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:50,848	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Immune system
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:52,896	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Freaks out like
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:56,480	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	The alpha-gal covered now in bad spit almost
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:57,760	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Sort of by mistake
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:25:58,784	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Gets labeled bad
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:01,600	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And now it's on the bad guy watch list
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:05,952	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	So before the next time you eat meat meat comes in and then
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:10,304	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	The body unleashes wave upon wave upon wave of chemical
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:12,864	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Do battle against this
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:15,680	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Alfred and his reaction gets way out of here
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:17,472	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And you got so many antibodies both
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:20,544	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Making you
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:22,080	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Aimee-ffion
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:27,200	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Right I mean
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:30,784	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	It's very weird that sounds like a science fiction movie
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:31,808	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	It sounds like
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:33,856	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	The beginning of a science-fiction at least
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:36,160	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Kidz Bop let's not go to movie but like
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:37,440	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	It's
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:38,464	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	It's just
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:39,232	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Strange
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:40,768	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Which all goes to say this
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:41,792	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Really is
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:43,328	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	The kind of double tragedy
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:44,352	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	For Amy and
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:45,888	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Yeah cuz
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:46,912	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Xidan evolved
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:48,448	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Bite humans
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:49,728	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Right we're a mistake
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:56,640	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Like we have opposable thumbs going to pull them off I actually woke my mom up and she helped get it off
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:58,688	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Play drop off the gun to drop off another
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:26:59,712	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Airport terminal
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:04,576	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Walmart High pile shag carpet
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:06,112	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	End end the dirt
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:08,160	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And for us while we lose something
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:12,000	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	That historically anyway is a big part of Who We Are
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:12,768	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Yeah
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:14,304	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Because we have
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:16,096	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	We we adapted in the
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:17,632	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Grand evolutionary
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:18,400	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Schema things
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:20,960	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Flash
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:24,288	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Yeah
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:27,104	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I mean I'm actually sitting here picturing
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:29,408	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Steak
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:32,224	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	But actually the saying I mean hot dogs
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:34,016	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Like
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:36,064	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Wrap ramps around a weenie in Rust
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:38,880	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	That's a good my mouth water
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:42,720	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Weenies weenies and ramps
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:46,304	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Yeah but I am going my allergist tomorrow cuz I did
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:52,448	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	You know I was reading about this allergy a lot when I first got it and I read that for some people the allergy can fade away
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:57,568	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	So I'm going to get a blood test to see what my blood level of alpha-gal is
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:27:59,872	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	So I'm a little hoping for tomorrow
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:02,432	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I want to be normal
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:04,224	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Again
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:12,928	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	That was the end of the Dan and Amy conversation she was going to go to the doctor
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:13,952	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Tested
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:15,488	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Find out whatever
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:21,120	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Define I would happen
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:25,472	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	So I actually did get an appointment with my allergist
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:27,008	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Dr. Korn
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:30,080	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Dr corn
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:31,616	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	She's really nice
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:36,992	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	So I got a plan I got the blood draw whatever and a few days later my doctor called me and she
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:40,064	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Said that my numbers were still really high
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:41,856	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And I was like wow
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:42,624	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	How high are they
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:44,416	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And she was like
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:45,440	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	3
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:50,816	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And I was like three that's not high and she's like they're supposed to be like 1 or something
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:52,608	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	So they had gone down
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:53,888	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	But they were still
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:58,496	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	You know many times more than they should be so when you left
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:29:02,080	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And we're waiting for the call will you waiting with the hope
EDL	00:29:02,080	00:29:03,616	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	That what that you would soon be
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:07,200	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Eating a bit of hot dog I mean honestly I was hoping
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:13,600	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	No no no I don't wish that you are you are the beat the great you you never knew I was afraid that she
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:20,000	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	He would be like oh my God your numbers are so low I think you could probably eat meat let's do a food challenge I'll be like
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:20,768	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Cuz like
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:23,840	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	That's such a scary memory
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:24,608	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I don't
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:26,400	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	You know actually just the other
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:31,520	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Night I was eating an Indian place and I was eating vegetarian but like
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:37,664	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I felt something and I pulled it out and in the dim light of an Indian restaurant like why are they all it like that
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:38,176	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I was like
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:40,480	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Was this bacon
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:44,064	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And I suddenly you know that you just get those drop in your stomach and I'm like
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:45,344	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	What time is it
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:50,208	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	4 hours from now if I did cuz it's there something about it being delayed
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:52,512	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	That makes it so difficult it just says like
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:54,560	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Make a suspense movie
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:59,424	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	With you it's like it could happen in the next 3 hours or maybe not I don't know
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:01,984	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I mean honestly the only thing that
EDL	00:30:02,752	00:30:05,056	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	The real reason I want to be able to eat meat
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:07,360	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	It's so that I will be prepared
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:09,408	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	To eat at in case of emergency
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:10,432	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I mean
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:11,968	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:18,368	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	When on a canoe trip in Adirondacks and I was like what what happens if I get stranded out here in like what if I have to
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:24,768	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	But I can't even eat meat out I have to hunt fish but then when the lake freezes over what would I eat I can't survive something
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:25,792	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Wrong with me
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:28,096	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Byfield evolutionarily challenge
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:34,752	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	What is what I think about before I go to bed every night when I be able to survive if I had just what's on me right now a pen
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:35,520	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Underwear
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:36,032	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	My daughter
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:39,872	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	And so yeah I mean that's a real issue is like
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:43,968	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	That's not a real issue obviously it's never going to happen in live in Brooklyn but
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:47,808	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I do for some reason I always think like
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:51,136	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I want to be prepared in case
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:52,416	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	But
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:54,208	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Yeah you know
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:57,280	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I don't think I would go back to eating meat necessarily
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:30:59,840	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Like you are still more
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:00,608	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Morphe
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:01,632	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Frightened and game
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:03,424	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	How to speak
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:03,936	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Well
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:05,472	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Also like
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:08,544	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I wish I could be a vegetarian for ethical reasons because it's
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:15,200	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Not so much just eating me but just like you know the the factory farming and I kind of stuff so
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:19,296	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I feel like morally Superior now I can be like why I don't eat red meat
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:22,880	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Course I'm forcing not even put at the same time
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:28,000	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I would if I had the if I had the willpower I probably go that way anyway and then also
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:32,864	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	I think it's great it's like we're all evolving to be on this planet which is
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:34,656	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Getting harder to be Anand
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:35,680	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	We know that
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:38,240	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Meat takes a lot of resources and like
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:44,128	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Now I don't know I'm not doing that so like the tickets helping me evolve into a better human being
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:49,248	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Xo1 could
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:50,784	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	Instead of thinking of the tick
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:52,064	| radiolab_podcast16alphagal |	As
