EDL	00:01:03,744	00:01:04,256	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	To look like
EDL	00:01:05,024	00:01:09,632	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	There are fewer and fewer technical constraints on what we can do
EDL	00:01:10,144	00:01:11,168	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	That place is
EDL	00:01:11,168	00:01:13,728	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	A special obligation on us to ask tough question
EDL	00:01:13,728	00:01:14,496	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	About what we
EDL	00:01:15,520	00:01:17,312	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Should
EDL	00:01:17,312	00:01:23,712	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	With our friends down the hall manoush zomorodi and Alex goldmark there on a grape podcast

EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:41,888	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	I think he's actually special
EDL	00:01:42,400	00:01:46,240	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	My background I've got a PhD in Rapid product development out of MIT
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:50,080	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And what I do is I teach young people how to build new systems
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:57,248	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And the new system that's a system that we want to talk about that kind of began in 2004
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:02:01,088	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Ross was teaching a course at a Military College
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:04,928	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Was that the Air Force Institute of Technology here in Wright-Patterson in Dayton
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:06,720	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Does one day in 2004
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:08,768	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Are the whole school gathered together
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:09,536	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Pharrell
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:14,144	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And our commander got up in front of the whole school and said we need to do something to help
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:14,912	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	The war effort
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:23,616	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Terrible violence today in the city of Basra at that time in the Iraq War
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:28,224	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	You're not going well suicide
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:29,504	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	IEDs going off
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:35,904	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	All over the place is going off everywhere soldiers being blown up
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:37,184	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Weak I got blown up
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:37,696	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Recon
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:42,304	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And to be honest with you in 2004 it looks like we're going to lose
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:49,984	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Psoriasis he gets together some of the students some of his colleagues and they decide Lena let's sit down and see if we can find
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:52,288	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Find a solution quickly find a solution
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:55,360	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	To figuring out who is planting all these roadside bomb
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:56,640	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Yeah
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:58,688	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Bombs going off of pretty easy to detect
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:02:59,200	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And images
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:00,480	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	The problem is
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:01,504	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	How do you go from
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:04,064	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Bomb going off backwards in time
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:06,368	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	To be able to figure out who planted it
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:06,880	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	So
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:08,160	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Somehow
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:11,488	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	It just came out
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:13,280	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Are you guys sitting around
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:15,072	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	It was at a bar
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:17,120	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	We're working on the back of the napkin
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:21,216	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And withdrawing out different ideas and turning around and seeing what happens
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:24,288	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	They're just like hey let's he's playing just try this let's try that
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:26,848	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	They had this one stock and we sort of
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:28,640	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Through this out on the back of an MBA
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:29,920	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Making it
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:31,200	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Took a little while
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:32,480	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	38 students working
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:33,504	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Confirm me for 2 years
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:36,064	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	But eventually they developed what became known as
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:38,624	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Project Angel Fire
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:46,304	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	You're at work to take a small plane and on the belly
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:49,888	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	The plane they hook up his array of cameras
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:53,472	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Start the camera system we design and build
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:54,496	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Super hayat
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:57,568	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Men the pilot
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:59,872	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Takes off
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:06,784	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Flies the plane High over Fallujah
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:13,184	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Military we were up at about 15 to 16 thousand feet to stay out of the Missile Range
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:16,000	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	On the ground in Fallujah and I look up what would I say
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:17,280	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	You wouldn't see us
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:23,679	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	You wouldn't hear us or you wouldn't see us
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:29,823	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Over Fallujah circle circle circle

EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:33,151	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Click
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:38,527	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Click every second takes a still image of the entire city of Fallujah 25 square miles
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:41,855	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And then teams it down to an operator we take a picture
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:43,647	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Processing Down Lincoln
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:45,951	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Process it Down Lincoln
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:47,487	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Every single second
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:53,119	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	To the plaintiff snapping picture after picture after picture which cures what makes the system so powerful
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:56,959	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	The operator on the ground has what say an entire day's worth
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:05:00,287	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Of the high-res pictures of the entire city of Fallujah
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:06,687	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And let's say there's an explosion at least 20 people were killed in explosions on the market
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,967	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	11 others
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:10,783	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	First the operator would pull up the most current image of the city
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:14,367	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Zoom into the place with in Fallujah where it happened
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:15,391	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And then click
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:16,415	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Click click
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:18,975	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	In one second increments go back in time
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:23,839	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And see who was there what happened the last time somebody fiddled around in that
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:28,703	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Yeah you like okay I might have gone back to ours and
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,007	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	It's bad car
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:31,775	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Fast forward
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:35,359	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Click the canal follow that car forward
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:35,871	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	In time
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,407	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	To see where it goes
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:38,943	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	You see that it went to
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:40,991	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	House in another neighborhood 2 miles away
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:43,551	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Well that's where you dispatcher troops to write that
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:47,647	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Basically we be able to send either the Special Forces then I the Marines in
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:48,671	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Intuitive
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:49,439	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Take appropriate action
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:56,095	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	It's not like they release a lot of
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:57,631	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Think about how well their
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:58,911	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Technology has work
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:01,471	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	But you will find several quotes from office
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:03,007	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Saying that yes
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:04,543	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Project Angel Fire disc
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:05,055	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Save lives
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:13,247	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	But the reason why we decided to do the story is because it's not just a military thing right like with a lot of
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:16,319	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	These Technologies they may be stored in the military
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:19,391	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	But then they trickled down all the way down
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:20,415	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	To all of us
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:22,463	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Actually in this case trickle-down
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:25,791	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	To Dayton Ohio
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:28,607	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Ross Group Incorporated
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:36,543	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Yabby weird producer and emails and I actually went to Dayton Ohio
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:37,823	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	To visit Ross
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:38,847	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	At his best
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:43,967	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Persistent surveillance systems persistent surveillance
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:45,759	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Write that essay
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:47,295	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Orwellian
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:51,391	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	These are the lenses and the motors here basically control it
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:57,023	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	So first we went over to his Workshop where he actually works and makes the camera
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:07:00,607	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	These are more powerful than some of the best military systems
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:04,191	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Like we could see him actually making them and how they get attached to the bottom
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:05,471	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	The airplane
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:11,615	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Oh so many airplanes then we went over to the hangar where he has all the airplanes
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:13,919	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Beautiful Dover all we got 27 airplane
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:16,223	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Africa
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:19,039	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Oh my God it's big and then he showed us their Command Center
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:23,391	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And this is where you have a bunch of people sitting in front of these enormous screen
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:25,183	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	This is like your viewing room
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:28,255	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Yeah and this is where all the
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:29,535	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Plane pictures end up
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:37,215	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Because Ross is basic idea and taking this technology from Fallujah to a city like Dayton Ohio
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:42,847	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Basically this is just as large a problem as we doing
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:46,943	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Afghanistan and Iraq only it's not IEDs it's crying
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:53,343	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	We've had a lot of major events this year we've had four officer-involved shooting so far this year our homicides are up this
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:57,183	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Here to this is Dayton Police Chief Richard Biehl
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,463	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	I talked to him last summer
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:07:59,487	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Couple years ago
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:00,511	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Ross call them up
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:05,631	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Was like look a city like Dayton Ohio we've got 28,000 crimes a year
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:07,167	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	About ten thousand part 1
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,959	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Murder rape
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:11,007	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Salt 10000 part 1 crime
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:14,335	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Comes out to be 480 million dollars
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:20,735	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	A year but McKnight is like for the about the price of a police helicopter we believe that we would be able to decrease
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:21,759	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Crime by 30 to 40
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:22,527	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Percent
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:25,599	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	30% decrease in that is 155 million.
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:31,231	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	The Dayton Police were like
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:32,255	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Basically setup
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:32,767	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	The test
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:34,303	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	In June of 20

EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:39,423	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	This see for ourselves
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:40,447	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	What it was capable of doing
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:43,775	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Isn't the plane up in the air
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:48,895	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Started doing its thing
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:49,919	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Buju
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:51,199	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And within just a few hours
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:53,503	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	There is a
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:55,295	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Call of this a breaking entering a
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:09:01,439	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	In progress with the description of an irregular random moving
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:02,975	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	This is Angie horn
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:05,023	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	She's the one who called 911

EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:10,143	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Pull up in front of her neighbor's house
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:11,679	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Guy gets outbreaks in
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:12,191	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Start smoothie
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:18,847	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	You know we immediately called the police and they got their relatively quickly from what I remember
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:20,639	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	He had already taken off
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:24,735	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Now normally in a case like this the police would be like
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:26,271	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Well how do we follow
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,295	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	We don't know where he went
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:29,087	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	But this case
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:36,255	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	The police contact persistent surveillance systems and ultimately
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:42,655	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	James Alex blasingame I'm the senior analyst for the company
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:49,055	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	We're about 5 minutes until he sees this little grainy white. Appear in front of her neighbor's house
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:55,455	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Is the vehicle here that we're wanting to track what vehicle I don't I barely see anything so the image looks blurry
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:58,783	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	But the human brain in the human eyes are very very evolved to pick out movie
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:03,647	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	You gotta understand that from two miles up a car looks just like a random shape
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:04,671	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	People they look like
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:06,719	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Alex has trained himself to
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,487	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Pick out Lube
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:12,607	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Going to put a tag down and where he's at places in Orange Circle over that random little shape
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:17,727	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And then quickly quickly moves forward forward forward follow him to his real time location
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:23,871	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Alex follows it up some roads finds out that it is parked in a parking lot six blocks away because up the people on the field
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:26,687	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Does go over there they get there they see the guy
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:27,967	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Is your truck full of stuff
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:31,295	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	They send different cap over to pick up the witness
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,831	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Yep that's the guy
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:35,391	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Yeah this is minutes later
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:37,695	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	No kidding
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:42,303	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	That Could Have Been a Murder
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:43,839	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	I could have been armed robber
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:44,863	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	It could have been a lot of
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:51,519	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	This is so weird is like having a superpower but it is actually better than Batman you can't go back for the
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:52,799	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Timeshares
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:53,311	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Superhero
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:55,615	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	I just feel sad
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:58,687	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	It's like
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:00,735	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	We're all just he's little.
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:04,831	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	It just seems like the antithesis of what a lot of
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:07,903	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Police Department seem to be trying to do in the aftermath of
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:09,183	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Staten Island
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:10,975	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Other
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:12,255	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Horrific things
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:13,023	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	That have happened
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:15,071	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Which is getting the police
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:15,839	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	On the sea

EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:24,799	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	The community policing
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:29,407	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Battle by the way this may dramatically help
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:30,687	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	That community relations
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:32,991	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	The reason they're putting body cams on
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:35,551	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Fun police officers is try to get the police officers
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:37,343	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	More respect
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:37,855	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Old because they
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:40,671	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Well this lets us watch all the off
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:42,207	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	25 ski
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:43,487	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Malaria
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:46,047	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	But then you can watch so many other people
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:49,631	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Here's other things that people in Dayton do
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:53,727	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Like Romeo and Juliet they sometimes meet without the
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:55,007	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Their parents permission
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:55,775	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	In the playground
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:57,311	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Smooch
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:12:01,919	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	There are going to be divorce lawyers who going to be tracking Aaron spouses
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:03,967	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Is there going to be traffic police work
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:09,343	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Watching who goes through the red light there going to be Realtors were wondering who are how many tenants do
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:12,415	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	You really have in that building and I guess
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:13,951	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	This thought might beat it
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:16,255	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	If the information exists
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:21,119	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	That will show what my pixel was actually doing then
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:23,167	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Then I'm a little less
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:24,959	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Free
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:25,983	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	There is a
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:26,751	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	A clear trade off
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:27,263	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Between
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:28,543	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Security price
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:30,079	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:32,639	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	You know in our major cities where we have
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:34,943	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Tens of thousands of Major Crimes
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:37,759	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	You are a lot less free when you can't leave your
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:38,527	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	House at night
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:39,551	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Is obviously a
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:42,367	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Huge advantage
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:43,135	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	To knowing what you know
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:44,671	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	But then there's a huge
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:46,463	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Sing
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:47,231	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	To knowing what you
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:50,559	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Acknowledge all by itself is sort of
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:52,095	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Is pregnant with
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:53,119	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Funny
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:55,167	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	You know what here's my problem with with
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:56,959	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Was it all of these private
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:59,263	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	It's like when you talk about these technology
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:02,591	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	The advantages are always so concrete
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,895	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And the trade-offs
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:06,431	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Always feel so abstract
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:12,063	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	I feel like there is there certain there's something being lost here but I can never quite put my finger on

EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:17,247	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Eyes
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:17,759	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	In the sky
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:24,159	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	In the situation we left it is at mnuchin one of our producers and emails have gone down to Dayton Ohio to talk with Ross McNutt
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:26,463	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Check out his technology
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:29,279	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	How are you feeling
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:31,327	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	I was feeling like
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:35,167	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	You have not convinced me I do I am not
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:35,679	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Gone for this
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:37,727	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And then I saw was my
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:39,263	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And that
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:40,543	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Well
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:43,103	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	I mean that's what made me start to think otherwise
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:47,711	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Where is especially the time we did this the average
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:49,247	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	300 murders a month
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:52,063	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	52 kidnappings a week 300 murders a month
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:53,087	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Yeah
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:57,183	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	McNutt the gang they got a contract we've been asked not to say
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:15:58,207	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	For whom
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:16:04,607	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And they went down south set themselves up in a hotel room got the plane up in the sky and then whoever the client was started
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:06,399	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Bringing them crime reports
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:12,031	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	So this is kind of what you never want to see happen but this is kind of why the system was up
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:16,639	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Alex pulled up on the screen is very grainy aerial shot
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:17,663	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Avoir as This Is War
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:21,759	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	It looks like any city right you've got like grids of streets
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:23,807	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Cars and houses
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:25,599	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Like over on the left of the screen
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:28,927	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Key points to the start little square it's a vehicle
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:29,951	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	It's going down the street
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:34,303	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	This is a female police officer she was actually headed to work
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:36,351	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	On this morning
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:43,775	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	All kind of go through it here there's her house
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:46,591	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Her car is parked outside
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:50,175	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	You see that like little pixel gets in her car
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:52,479	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	She pulls out of her driveway that was her home
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:54,015	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Start to drive to work
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:56,575	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And then right when
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:58,367	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	She leaves
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:00,671	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	If you look up
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:02,207	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Here points to the upper left
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:04,511	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Several cars were parked
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:06,047	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Up on the corner
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:07,839	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Soon as she left her driveway those cars
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:08,607	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Become active
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:12,447	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	So this is a Stakeout
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:13,983	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Yeah they were waiting for her to leave
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:16,031	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	He's so zoomed in
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:19,359	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	That you can see it's like a Tic Tac moving down the street
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:22,431	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And then two more Tic Tacs come alongside
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:23,711	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Until they get right about
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:29,855	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	I hear clicking forward on the photo and you see these cars just inch closer
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:32,159	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Kind of hesitate there which is
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:32,671	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Unfortunate
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:37,023	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	So she's driving down the street and Thursdays
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:39,071	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Is cars following behind her
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:39,839	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And then
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:41,375	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	There's this car up ahead of her
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:43,679	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	A vehicle that had been parked here for
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:46,495	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	15 20 30 minutes all the sudden
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:48,287	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Backs out into traffic
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:52,383	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And seemingly slows them down almost gets in an accident right here
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:54,943	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Which gives these guys
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:55,711	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Enough time
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:57,247	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Ketchup
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:17:58,783	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Is where there go
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:00,063	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Pull up beside her
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:02,111	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And then suddenly
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:06,719	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Alex says
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:08,511	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Right there this is the point
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:13,631	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Where are the first car pulls up and shoots her mouth
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:17,727	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Whole time she was shot in the head multiple times in the head right here
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:22,847	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	She's actually going to roll through the intersection
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:25,919	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Her car continues to go even though she's been
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:26,687	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Gunshot in the head
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:27,455	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	There's a park
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:28,991	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Car behind the tree
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:31,807	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And you'll actually see this parked car move
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:32,575	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	When she runs in
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:35,903	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And then these guys
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:36,927	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Takeoff
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:43,583	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	It was
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:45,119	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Not fun to watch
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:47,423	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	But
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:49,727	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	What happens next
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:53,311	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Made me really start to understand what this technology is
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:55,871	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Real quickly just
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:59,199	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Show you some of the other takes that moment
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:05,599	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Horrible moment and then he starts to like shoot back and forth in time
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:11,999	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Bad before the murder hears his path after the murders actually takes the two cars from that murder and you see
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:18,399	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	He draws on the map you see that they meet up with two other cards that were involved in a different word
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:22,239	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	One murder becomes two two cars become 4.
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:27,103	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And if you follow all four of these cars drawing lines as they move through the city
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:33,503	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	You find out who they meet up with four becomes KAIT8 becomes so on and so on and you have all the
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:38,111	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	These lines crisscrossing the city and then you see that a whole bunch of those card
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:40,415	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Are headed to one place
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:41,183	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	This house
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:43,999	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	This house appears to be there cartel headquarter
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:46,815	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:48,863	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	That's when you start to think
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,703	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Oh that's how you have to take something
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:53,727	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Like this down
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:57,055	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	It's not a One-Shot thing like solving the crime
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:59,871	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	It's about cracking an entire system
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:03,199	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	In fact
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:04,223	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	This is Andy Harris
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:05,759	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	When I was doing some
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:07,807	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Some background research on this part of the story
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:08,575	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	I spoke
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:09,855	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	This one
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:12,671	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Source from the US government who told me
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:13,183	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	That
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:14,975	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	This information that roster
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:15,487	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Did you showed us
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:18,559	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	It was one of the primary tools
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:21,119	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Used to dismantle
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:24,191	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	An entire cartel Juarez in that
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:24,703	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Apparently
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:27,263	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	The leader of that cartel
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:28,799	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Was responsible
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:30,079	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Something like
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:31,615	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	1500
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:32,127	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Murders
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:36,223	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Cigarettes
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:38,271	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Cigarettes again so how are you feeling at this point
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:40,575	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Happier
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:42,111	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Scared
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:44,415	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Feel ashamed of myself
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:47,231	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Because I thought all the reason why I'm so excited about it is
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:48,767	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Because it's in a country
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:50,559	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	I don't live
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:53,119	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And I'm an outsider and I think of it as being met
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:53,631	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Stop
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:57,471	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	So it's okay for them but it's still not okay for us
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:20:59,007	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	What did you think Andy
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:00,031	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	I mean
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:02,847	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Like this is where I
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:05,919	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Stop being a good journalist because I picked a side
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:08,223	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	It feels wrong
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:11,039	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Cannot solve these crimes
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:11,807	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Things that we can solve
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:13,855	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And what is his plan is on top of New York
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:14,879	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Good
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:16,672	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	God really
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:18,976	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	From me it became
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:25,120	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Could you remember like after 9/11 when you'd walk down the street and you hear the F-16 circling over the city
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:30,496	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	I just remember the feeling in my stomach was like nausea like I felt
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:31,776	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Stick it felt
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:38,944	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Grossed it felt like we had no autonomy over ourselves and at that point I was scared enough that I could live with it but right now
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:40,224	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Now I don't feel that way
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:41,248	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:44,832	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Look at it's a very privileged position to be able to say that we
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:45,600	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Shouldn't have it
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:47,136	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	I get that
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:48,416	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	I've became a convert
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:49,696	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Because
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:51,744	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Somebody got kidnapped
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:56,608	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And if we had an eye in the sky we might be able to get the kids back in a few
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:21:58,144	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Minutes hours
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:02,496	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Compared to like you see the stats on Amber Alerts they're not good
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:07,104	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	What we're talking about is like and I'm not saying that I'm like anti McNutt
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:09,152	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Not at all but what I'm saying is like
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:11,456	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	It's very easy to paint it as
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:14,784	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	We're going to get bad guys and I just don't think it's that
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:21,184	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	McNutt & Co they seem like decent people they have set limitations for themselves they have said they
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:24,768	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	I will not use photography that could get any closer they've made a moral choice
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:27,840	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	With that how do we know other people will make the same moral choice
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:31,424	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Even though this thing might solve
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:32,704	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	A ton of crimes
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:33,984	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Might save lives
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:36,800	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	It's still not worth the risk
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:37,568	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Because
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:38,848	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	It just asks
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:39,616	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Level up
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:40,384	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Of trust
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:40,896	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	In government
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:42,176	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	That we shouldn't
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:42,688	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	We shouldn't get
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:43,968	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Is that what you're saying
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:47,296	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	For now yes
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:48,320	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	So
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:50,368	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Back to dating what would happen in Dayton
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:51,904	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Well I was pretty impressed
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:53,696	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	That was pretty impressed
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:55,488	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	After that five-day demo the
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:56,768	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Police chief Richard Biehl
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:57,792	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	I recommended
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:22:59,072	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	That we
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:01,632	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Enter into a contract
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:02,656	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	What is valency
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:03,936	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And so
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:07,264	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	They took it to the city Commission
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:10,336	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Alison Carey Gregg New York
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:13,664	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	According to Carrie gray director of the city Commission office
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:20,064	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	For the city of Dayton Ohio city commission was interested in the in the presentation
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:23,136	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	But they decided that before they go forward they should have a public forum
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:24,928	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	So they could just
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:25,440	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Hear from the people
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:30,048	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	There was about 75 or so people there and he says that the people of Dayton
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:33,632	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	People of Radiolab a note to self
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:35,168	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	I'm very divided
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:36,192	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	A quarter
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:37,216	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Of the people
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:37,728	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Where
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:40,288	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Supportive of this technology and they were
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:45,408	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Frustrated with the amount of crime their belief was I'm not doing anything wrong so I don't care what
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:46,432	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	People see me doing
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:53,088	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	We want this implemented and we want it implemented very broadly Bring It On they were basically in the
EDL	00:23:55,392	00:23:57,184	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Then there was another group
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:24:03,072	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Slightly smaller but not my mind maybe 15% believed
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:05,376	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	This was a grotesque
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:08,960	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Invasion of privacy and some of the people spoke in
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:10,496	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Very impassioned
EDL	00:24:11,008	00:24:11,520	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Terms
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:13,056	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	So yay
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:19,968	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	I think they calling it grotesque invasion of privacy would pretty much reflect the weight and the way this group was feeling
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:23,808	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Proved him and that there was no way that you could trust government
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:27,136	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	With this volume of information and this breath of information
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:29,184	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	So you had your Pros in your cons
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:35,584	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	The rest of the people like the majority maybe had some feelings one way or another but just didn't have enough information
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:37,632	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And so they came and kind of
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:38,656	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Eye mask
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:39,168	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Questions
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:42,496	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Like how long will persistent surveillance systems keep the images
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:43,520	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	90 days
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:46,592	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	How far can the zoom in can they see my face
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:48,640	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Know something it'll ask questions
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:52,992	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Which carry seems to think that they could have answered they could have gotten everybody on board
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:54,528	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	But in the end
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:56,832	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Even though the room was basically divided into
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:57,344	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	The three parts
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:25:01,440	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	The naysayers were so loud and so impassioned
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:03,744	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	That these would have defined the
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:08,608	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	As we do so we took that lesson to understand that
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:09,888	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	There was going to be
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:11,680	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Some significant
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:17,056	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Education that was going to be needed and some significant hurdles that we're going to have to be crossed
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:20,640	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Before that we were able to do a broad-based implementation
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:21,920	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:23,968	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Based on the amount of time
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:24,992	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	What's going to have to be spent
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:31,904	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	We decided there were other more immediate techniques that could be used it could be invested in and we took the money
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:33,440	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	That could have been spent on this
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:35,744	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	And spend it on some other activities
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:37,536	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	It seems like what you're saying is it like
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:41,376	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	It was just going to be too hard to get people of the hurdle so I guess it's not worth it
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:42,144	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Yeah
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:45,984	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	I think that's probably probably accurate So the plan is off
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:46,752	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Table saw
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:49,312	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	It's off the table for right now
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:54,176	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	But that doesn't mean that it's never coming back on the
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:58,272	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	I think it's fair to say
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:00,576	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Frustrating to him
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:06,976	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Right now we've got about a hundred and fifty million dollars for the proposal sitting out there for a large number of cities Baltimore
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:08,512	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Moscow weekend
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:09,536	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	There were waiting for them to me
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:16,704	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	We've done Compton and Jerome Compton psych maybe like maybe dating is like maybe
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:23,104	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Whole lot of babies out there
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:29,248	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	They're analyzing as we are looking at a
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:33,856	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Turnpike or something yet traffic in New Jersey
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:35,392	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Understanding traffic
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:40,000	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	We look at congested areas which are typically especially in that part of the country
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:45,632	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Exits and on-ramps any kind of Junction in a highway sometimes you just want to scream
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:58,688	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	I think that might be 10 times
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:27:03,552	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Thank you and thank you
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:04,576	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinthesky |	Yeah sure
