EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:21,984	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Goes off on this riff
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:24,032	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	It's a matter of budgetary priority
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:28,640	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	It takes money to build schools so perhaps if we put it in
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:31,200	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	273 Sanctuary City policy

EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:48,096	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And then just as it seemed
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:52,448	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Seems like people were settling down
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:54,240	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Democrats right
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:57,824	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	This man on the
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:04:00,128	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Far right side of the auditorium
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:02,432	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Stands up and then goes on to say
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:08,832	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Get the Arab people
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:10,112	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The freaking Asians out of here

EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:23,679	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Everybody sort of sat up in their seats
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:28,031	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And nobody was quite sure if this thing we can escalate
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:30,847	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Shortly after he said this
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:32,639	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	One of the candidates up on stage
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:35,967	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	This tall guy like six-foot-three salt-and-pepper beard
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:37,503	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Stood up
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:40,575	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	From behind the table and actually walked out
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:44,671	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	In front of it
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:45,951	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And I and said

EDL	00:08:54,015	00:09:00,415	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	In this case it was the Palestinian Liberation Organization which at the time was explicitly an armed resist
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:02,463	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Distance movement that often targeted Israelis
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:08,095	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And then they will say I would like to see what they did to you now you have to do this to them
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:09,631	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Blessed absolutely no
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:13,471	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	This is not the way I want to live the rest of my life
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:16,287	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You know I always wanted to
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:20,127	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Be engaged in a place where I can bring hope I can
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:21,919	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Help people
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:26,527	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And the only way I can do that was it through a being become a minister
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:29,087	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So he doubled down in his studies
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:31,903	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Seminary with working in Palestine
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,183	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And then
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:34,463	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	In the early 90s
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:37,535	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	He's at he was actually sent to start a new Lutheran Church
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:39,071	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	In Bay Ridge Brooklyn
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:44,703	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So I came to Brooklyn 1995
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:48,031	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I remember on the first day I was shocked
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:49,823	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Because
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:55,455	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Biking down Fifth Avenue if you take the whole neighborhood in we are in Bay Ridge
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:59,551	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Which I actually did not too long ago on a bike what you notice is
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:02,879	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	On the right we have Leif Erikson Park
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:04,415	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	A nod to the

EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:09,535	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	This sort of crazy mix of different kinds of people
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:14,143	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The Bay Ridge Bakery beautiful neon sign
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:16,191	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Looks like it hasn't changed much since the 1960s

EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:41,023	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Schnitzel House on the Left can see how groups of people layered themselves on top of groups of people
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:44,863	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Making themselves part of one of the most deeply mixed neighborhoods in the country
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:48,447	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	When you get just a little bit South
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:51,775	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	It's impossible to not notice one of the latest
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,311	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Trying to settle in

EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:13,023	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	What and how large is the Arab community in the 43rd.
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:15,583	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	We don't have the exact
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:17,375	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Because again
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:18,911	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	When The Simpsons
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:20,191	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Department
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:23,007	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	10 years ago they told the Arab Community if you're an Arab
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:24,287	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Chick
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:24,799	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	White
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:27,359	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So we don't have specific numbers
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:30,175	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But the estimate I heard her somewhere between 20 and 30
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:32,223	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Living in southwest
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,271	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	That's a huge community
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:37,343	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Yeah I mean that's only about 10% of the total population
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:43,231	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But in a Democratic primary for city council we need only about 4,000 volts to 1
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:44,511	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	4000
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:45,279	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Total ya
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:49,887	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	That's it I mean the turnout is very low
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:51,679	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And we have an open seat
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:53,983	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So we'll have a bigger chance
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:56,031	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Winning because we're not running against an incumbent
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:58,079	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	How what's the margin of Victory to
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:00,639	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	They can be squeakers eye mean
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:03,199	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Justice several years back
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:04,991	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The race was won by just
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:05,759	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	31 volt
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:11,647	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	31 yes so it would seem that if this guy can just
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:15,999	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Despite the fact that there's never been an arab-american on city council before
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:19,839	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	It seems that if he can get out the the arab-american vote
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:24,447	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	He's got a shot what shot mean do you just told us there's a lot of Arabs there so he should
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:25,983	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You should own insulin
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:30,847	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Actually yes but at the same time this neighborhood is such a microcosm
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:38,015	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I think that Islam is an evil ideology that's what I think everything that's going on
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:44,159	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Caleb deputy director of the Arab American Association of New York
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:51,327	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And she said if you look around the neighborhood you'll see all these sort of national level issues
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:57,471	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Playing out on the ground like a shadow play or something
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:13:01,311	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I mean you've got neighborhoods in the country right
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:07,455	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Right next to all of these people who voted for Trump who support the travel ban
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:14,367	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	None 0 shifting National demographics were one of the last remaining New York City neighborhoods
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:20,767	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Weather is still strong white working-class but is in the process
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:26,655	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Being priced out gentrification is really kidding white people heart and so clearly there's going to be
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:30,751	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Like we just got a lot of the elements of
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:34,335	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Struggles and the anxieties that are going on a national level
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:35,359	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:39,199	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Candidate login
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:46,111	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	1:10 a.m. with all of this in mind we still are there in search for new voters

EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:23,743	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:25,023	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Dad joke aside
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:25,535	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	It's true
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:27,327	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	She really is

EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:32,191	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And one reason that it's never been tried before is that
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:34,751	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Is 20 some thousand arab-americans
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:36,031	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The last 20 years
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:38,591	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	They've been hiding like for me to
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:43,199	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	It's been unnerving to take to be a district where you don't feel like people are watching out for you and your community
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:44,735	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	This is Linda sarsour

EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:53,439	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	No is that not long after the 9/11 attacks
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:55,743	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The US government in 2003
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:58,815	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Did engage in a registration program a registry
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:15:04,447	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Called en Sears National Security entry-exit registration system
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:10,847	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Which meant that males over the age of 16 who are from these like 29 countries of origin countries that have
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:11,615	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Had a historic

EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:17,247	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Go down the list
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:20,575	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	People from those countries that were visitors temporary workers
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,855	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Non US citizens
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:25,183	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Had to come and formally register
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:26,207	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	With the federal government
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:29,023	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Tell me give me people
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:31,583	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Hitting us like animals
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:35,423	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Linda was there with some of these men providing translation services
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:37,471	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	In this
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:43,871	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Post office like room where there are all these windows the men would be called Upon a Time photograph fingerprinted
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:45,663	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Passport ask them general questions
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:52,575	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And I noticed that at one point that there were some men that were being told to either leave or just go home and got some stamps in their path
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:54,367	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Passport with future appointment
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:56,671	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Or they were telling him to go to the 10th floor
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:57,695	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	That's when my life
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:16:02,047	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Something like I got punched in the stomach like I felt really nauseous I was like what's going on here
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:06,911	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So when I went to ask the officer she was told the 10th floor was the FBI headquarters
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:10,239	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	This wasn't just an information-gathering operation
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:11,519	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	They were planning to deport
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:15,359	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And as this realization sunken throughout the waiting room
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:18,175	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I can't tell you the faces that these people had
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:20,991	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Like they didn't know what their Destiny was
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:24,319	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And in fact about 10% of those that did go register
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:29,439	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	We're put on deportation proceedings and many of them were deported no going home no packing a bag
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:31,231	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And I think that's where the Divide start
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:34,303	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And Saudi Arab American population in New York
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:37,631	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Anna Bayridge learned it was better to not show up
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:38,911	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	To not be counted
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:45,311	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Yeah and then just a few years later the Associated Press came out with their investigative report
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:49,151	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Press reports details how Police use informants
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:50,175	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Police Department
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,199	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Operated on

EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:55,295	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Turns out that after

EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:12,351	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	What that does is it makes you feel like the people quote
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:13,119	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Power
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:19,519	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Don't care about us like we were out on our own and I started realizing that there was going to have to be a moment where we
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:20,543	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	We had somebody in
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:22,079	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	In the local area
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:23,871	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Somebody who is Arab
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:24,895	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Stand up
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:26,687	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And protect us
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:30,015	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And in this is where LOL your team steps
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:36,927	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Linda started to raise these thoughts with imams and Business Leaders whole bunch of leaders from different insta
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:43,327	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Tatoosh and decided the first step was to run a candidate for the New York City Council the idea was start small and
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:45,887	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Start in a place where they have a strong base
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:46,655	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Bay Ridge
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:48,447	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Which also happened to be Linda's
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:55,103	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And according to her lot of the unions and a lot of the people in politics were like Linda this is your seat
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:57,919	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You have to run for the sea so I saw it like
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:59,711	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Unfold before my very eyes
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:04,319	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But is calling for a total and complete shutdown
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:06,623	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Of Muslims
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:07,903	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Entering the United States
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:11,487	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Pallet exchange I think Islam
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:14,559	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Hate us
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:16,351	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	We have to look at
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:23,263	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The politically correct and
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:28,639	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Executive director of the new political climate
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:32,735	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I started doing a lot of national work
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:34,271	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Chiusano the cable news shows
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:35,295	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Became a national figure
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:37,087	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Really
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:37,599	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	A polarizer
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:43,743	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Why is that well in large part because and I'm sure she would hate me saying this but
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:46,815	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Herbrand ugly is very similar to Donald Trump
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:48,351	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	She can be very reactive
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:54,495	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	She's just going to say it like it is at a straight I'm very Brooklyn and maybe too cuz I was born and raised here but I tell it like it is
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:58,335	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	More than just telling it like it is she's the provocateur
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:20:00,127	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	She's tweeted some tongue-in-cheek post
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:02,431	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	About how Sharia law wouldn't be that bad
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:06,527	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	More recently she called CNN anchor Jake Tapper a member of the alt right
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:07,551	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I mean she's brash
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:14,207	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And clematis poster-child Linda sarsour the conservative media.
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:18,303	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Jumped all over for it
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:27,007	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	She is taking these missteps and warping them
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:28,799	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Is it totally unfounded
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:35,199	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Linda sarsour she is in extremis who has gas
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:39,551	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Goddamn country
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:45,183	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So it just didn't feel right at the moment
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:47,743	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I didn't want to run for the New York City Council
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:50,559	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And so after four or five years of
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:53,375	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Planning organizing and laying the groundwork
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:56,959	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So that Linda sarsour could run and represent the Arab community
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:59,007	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Lyrics suddenly this moment of
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:02,079	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Oh God. What are we going to do
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:07,199	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You know just by the way again is Kayla santosuosso who at the time was working with Linda
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:08,735	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	At the Arab American association
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:15,647	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And then I remember a moment when that be Association I walked in and I said to her like I just got out of him
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:16,672	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Meeting at father K Within
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:22,048	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And I was like what that time I was like I think I was calling him a friendly demon remember what we was calling him but I was like
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:27,936	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Don't you think he'd be a great person to run for Council and she likes land or hand down on the table and chairs
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:28,704	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Michaela
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:29,472	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I was
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:30,496	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Just thinking about
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:34,336	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	It was like a light bulb went off
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:38,688	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So we both like started going through our heads
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:45,088	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Why he meets Us in the middle of that all these connections with people outside of the Arab Community he's a parent of public school students here
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:50,720	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You work that an Orthodox Jewish hospital he's clearly Liaisons the NYPD is Lutheran he's Arab but he's
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:52,256	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Christian is not Muslim
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:58,400	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And they start thinking like he's going to be able to get folks that no other Arab
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:22:00,448	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Oh my God he's like the most
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:01,728	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Intersectional
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:04,544	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	He's at jogging term he's like
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:08,640	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The person with the most complex identity that might just be
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:09,920	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So complex it'll work
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:14,016	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And so they reached out to me on this it listen
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:15,040	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	We want you to do this
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:19,392	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And you know he thought about the fact that doing this it would require him to quit his job it would be
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:20,672	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Family
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:22,720	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But it felt again like
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:24,256	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Here with an opportunity to
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:26,304	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	To help the people around
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:27,584	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The people in my community
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:30,400	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So so I think I'm not sure if
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,960	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Like the end of December
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:34,752	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Where I became like
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:35,520	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Yes 100 /
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:42,176	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And so
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:44,480	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Couple months later
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:46,784	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Announce on February 20th
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:48,832	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	This is my phone
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:49,344	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Vista
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:57,792	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	At La Saj restaurant a local Lebanese restaurant
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:23:00,608	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Heading into the microphone blowing out the speakers
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:05,728	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Every single seat was filled
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:09,056	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And his message to them was essentially we can look
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:11,360	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And live in the shadow anymore
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:17,504	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	We have to be engaged we have to be involved we have to be part of the decision-making in this country we have to bring our perspective to the
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:18,784	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Because
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:20,576	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The fact is
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:22,112	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Other people cannot represent us
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:30,048	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	We have to present ourselves
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:42,336	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Play I'm really getting lucky with the parking spots
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:44,128	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Your relationship with God
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:45,152	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I think so
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:48,736	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I'm pretty much right off the bat those words like us
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:49,760	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And ourselves
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:52,064	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	They presented a series of challenges
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:52,576	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Forefathers
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:57,184	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The first one being a large number of Arab Americans who are
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:58,976	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	American citizens
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:04,608	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But they are not registered and they refuse to be part of the political system in this country because they don't trust it
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:06,656	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Like here is a community that has
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:08,192	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Avoided government
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:09,984	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	To the nth degree for the past
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:11,264	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Decade-and-a-half
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:12,800	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So what does he do
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:18,688	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Well during the month of Ramadan is the holy month or four nights a week he would show up
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:19,456	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	To the mosque
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:21,248	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Stack of literature
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:23,040	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I need a larger stack
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:27,136	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Voter registration form
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:29,952	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	On the night I tagged along with him and his campaign manager Kayla
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:30,976	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	This month
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:33,024	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	It was hot
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:34,304	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Muggy
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:36,608	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Elliott team was dressed in his Minister garb
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:39,680	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You know suit and collar
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:41,728	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And as we walked into the mosque
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:46,848	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	It wasn't at all clear to me
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:48,128	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	How this was going to go
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:54,528	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	What's happening in the Middle East the world and the division and the different groups I was not sure if they were ready

EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:17,824	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	There's a break in the
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:19,360	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Salaam alaikum
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:19,872	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Polo bucket
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:26,784	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I'll call you in to speak now to address the people so they know that I am here
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:29,344	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So we sort of tiptoe through all these people
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:31,392	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	We are at the front of the Mustang
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:33,184	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	They introduce them

EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:45,472	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	New York
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:51,872	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Basically saying you know this is our historic opportunity for the herb

EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:55,456	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Arab-american to city council
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:26:02,368	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And even with the language barrier you can hear the passion in this speech
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:05,952	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	In a response that was
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:06,720	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Tepid
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:08,512	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Fbat
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:18,496	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	When he was done we headed out to the front of the mosque
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:19,008	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:21,568	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Is the service light out
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:28,992	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Sea of 700 people come crashing out of the mosque

EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:42,304	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	They're giving him hugs they're saying we're behind you we love you
EDL	00:26:42,304	00:26:45,888	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The kids the best candidate in the field and he will represent the community

EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:55,104	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And that evening
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:56,640	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	12:25 in the morning
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:57,664	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	We are at
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:27:03,552	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Number two
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:06,368	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Good Luck Charlie
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:14,560	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Each time that same energetic response everyone
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:18,656	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	People were signing
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:24,544	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Petition to get on the ballot 39 Ogden Avenue
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:26,080	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And registering to vote
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:27,360	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Register template
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:28,384	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Register him
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:30,432	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So you you just registered to vote
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:31,456	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Yes is my birth sign
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:33,760	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Many of them for the first time
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:34,528	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You're the best
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:36,320	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Did you just register
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:39,136	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Oh no just I'm
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:41,440	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Only for him to just Add Water
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:46,560	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You know me what's up brother
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:53,984	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Ultimately everybody thinks we're insane when we say we're investing a fair amount of our resources in people who have never voted before
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:55,264	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Foreign people are kind of like
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:58,080	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	What you doing don't do that as a waste of money
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:28:04,480	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Because for many of these people the whole thing about registering and then later voting it was a foreign language
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:06,784	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Which of them
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:09,088	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Sometimes when he'd ask people to register to vote
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:10,880	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	They respond
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:17,280	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	We go to the give you money I understand but this is the process of other people thought that just registering to vote
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:18,816	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	With the same as voting for
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:25,216	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	September 12th
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:31,616	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And on top of that we did see signs of that mistrust of government
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:38,016	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You want to get the first Arab American and city council
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:44,160	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	First time for a lot of people
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:47,232	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But still
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:48,512	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Crazy I didn't think it would get
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:51,072	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	After going from mosque to mosque
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:52,608	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Through all of Ramadan
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:58,240	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	5.3 months before the election we have registered opposed to 300 voters so
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:05,408	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	What do you think do you think you can get those four thousand foot from the from the Arab Community alone we are
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:07,456	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You know
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:12,064	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Not counting on that app that we can think about 1000 votes from therapy
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:16,672	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	With only a thousand votes
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:22,304	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Yeah just as house but didn't you just say there were tens of thousands of arab-americans living there
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:26,656	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So first of all if I get this correct about 250
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:28,192	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Are American boats
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:28,960	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Forecast
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:30,240	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	In the last couple primary
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:34,080	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	250 even getting to that one thousand number
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:35,104	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Who is going to be
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:35,872	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I have you left
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:37,920	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And there's one more ring
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:45,088	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So in Brooklyn we have about eight hundred families that attend our church the folks you might expect to be
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:46,112	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	His most Ardent supporters
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:48,672	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Other Arab American Christians
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:49,952	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	We Are Men
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:54,816	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Ostrich in Egypt like Sharif here Sharif Sheriff Church
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:59,424	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I don't know yet they were really uninterested in support
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:01,984	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Will you be voting for father father Elia team
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:02,752	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	No no no

EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:11,968	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The beginning of my campaign I tried to reach out to them for me personally
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:18,368	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	No no I don't know why is that and what what it what what's going on
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:21,440	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Will the other be Christians in our districts are
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:23,744	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The vast majority
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:24,512	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Republic
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:30,400	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Yeah I will send 95% of them already
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:33,984	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So that's number one number two
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:40,384	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You have the situation in Egypt where Christians are being attacked
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:46,784	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Killed after bombing Christian churches in Egypt churches are being burned
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:51,904	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Are these radical groups of the Dead
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:54,976	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	UC
EDL	00:30:55,488	00:30:56,256	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Tensions
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:58,560	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Swellinfo is there a level of distress
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:02,912	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	In the Christian Arab community of you because you are so
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:09,056	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Close with the Muslim Arab Community here I mean I will give you an example
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:11,104	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Close a friend of mine his name is Francois
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:13,408	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So people went out to him and saying
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:15,968	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	How we cannot support him and he said why not
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:18,784	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Why is it because he's very close
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:22,112	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Will the Muslims and they will take advantage of him
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:24,928	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	This is the dynamic this is what's happening
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:30,816	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So eventually they decided only going after the Arab vote wasn't the right numbers game like that's just not
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:34,912	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	At work and see what that meant was to get 3000 volt
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:37,216	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	From the Arabs in the district
EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:38,496	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Who won this election
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:44,128	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	In other words he was going to have to convince the majority white voters
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:45,920	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	That she could represent them to
EDL	00:31:46,944	00:31:48,480	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Which wasn't going to be
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:53,856	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Alright walking down 50 year as I discovered when maybe a month before the election
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:57,440	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I went on a stroll to try to take a pulse of some of the neighborhoods of white residue
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:31:59,744	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Have you lived here in Bay Ridge for a while
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:00,768	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Call my wife
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:02,560	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Has the neighborhood changed a lot
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:04,352	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Foreigners
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:05,376	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Then American
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:07,424	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I was scary
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:07,936	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Listen
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:09,728	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Get so expensive
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:13,056	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	A 78 year old Irish woman
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:16,384	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You have newcomers coming into
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:17,152	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Art District
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:18,432	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	What do they know about
EDL	00:32:20,224	00:32:20,736	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Nothing
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:23,296	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Beijing Zoo
EDL	00:32:23,296	00:32:28,928	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Not know and when I asked them about father Lu team specifically what did you know anything about it
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:29,440	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	No
EDL	00:32:29,952	00:32:30,976	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I don't
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:32,000	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And I don't care to
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:34,816	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Honestly I've never heard of them
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:35,840	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The one that's
EDL	00:32:35,840	00:32:36,608	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	It's running
EDL	00:32:37,888	00:32:38,400	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Right
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:39,680	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	His Egyptian
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:42,240	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Okay
EDL	00:32:42,752	00:32:43,520	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Sumatriptan
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:45,056	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	That's how I feel
EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:48,896	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Completely turns me off
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:50,432	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And just to be clear here
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:50,944	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You're a Democrat
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:52,224	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Yes
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:54,784	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	These are Democrat
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:58,880	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	If anybody asks for Donald Trump when he was running
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:00,416	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I said hell no
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:01,696	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But I feel
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:02,464	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	This is Alex
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:04,256	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	This is America
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:07,072	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And I feel American person
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:09,120	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Should be in office
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:13,984	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Is that representative of what you heard was that street on that day yes
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:17,824	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Clearly it's not like everyone down there has easy pay
EDL	00:33:18,336	00:33:23,968	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	This by no means excuses their behavior or language but I think it explains some of it that
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:26,784	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	DC rent prices going up and
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:33,184	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Dozens of new Arab folks moving into the neighborhood every month these are not the gentrifying force though this is.
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:34,208	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Oddly enough

EDL	00:33:37,280	00:33:38,560	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	They in some ways are
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:45,216	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Let's talk about the issues that I hear and every issue jumping back to the debate from the top of the Peace
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:49,312	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	This is one of the Republican candidates Lee in the cave
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:51,872	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Weather it infrastructure and transportation
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:56,992	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	One particular issue in South Brooklyn and MattyB legal home conversion
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:34:00,320	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Absolute my signature
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:04,160	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Developers or landlords are taking the single family homes
EDL	00:34:04,672	00:34:07,744	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Knocking out all the walls on the ground floor in the second floor
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:09,536	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And then putting up these these
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:10,560	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Temporary walls
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:12,608	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Building these very
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:13,376	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Tiny
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:14,400	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Cramped domicile
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:16,960	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	That they can then rent out to
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:18,240	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	10 or 15 sound
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:20,800	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	What that does
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:22,592	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Is first of all
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:23,872	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Incredibly unsafe
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:25,408	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	For the people living in the house
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:28,736	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But also it's putting stress on the sewer system and streets
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:30,016	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	It causes
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:31,552	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Classroom sizes to go up
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:37,952	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Housing prices go up because there are just less actual single family homes on the market it's making
EDL	00:34:37,952	00:34:40,768	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The neighborhood up more dense than it was ever meant to be
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:45,376	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And so for a lot of these people who have lived in this neighborhood for a long time
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:51,520	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I think it feels like their daily lives are being affected by these forces outside their controlling they are
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:53,056	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Reacting emotionally to those thing
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:54,848	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So you're fighting for
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:59,968	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I'm fighting for the district fighting to make sure the quality of life example
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:05,856	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Couple months before the election Elliott team was going around knocking on doors

EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:35,040	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You know I deeply believe that illegal immigration
EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:37,344	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Has is a big root cause of this
EDL	00:35:37,344	00:35:39,136	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You're trying to harness those emotion
EDL	00:35:39,136	00:35:43,744	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You come here legally get a handout public health benefits
EDL	00:35:43,744	00:35:49,632	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Republican
EDL	00:35:49,632	00:35:52,448	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	About me I am a radical
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:55,264	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	A lift is Palestinian cleric
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:36:01,664	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Presumably they're using the word Claire insinuating that you are not are not in fact Christian but you are Muslim is that the incentive
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:04,480	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Malaysian air
EDL	00:36:04,480	00:36:06,272	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I plan the trying to use
EDL	00:36:06,272	00:36:08,832	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The fear of the people against my candidacy
EDL	00:36:09,344	00:36:13,696	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Then the comments and needed that post it is
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:14,464	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Just terrifying
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:16,256	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I'm going to hang him
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:23,168	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But for example one guy said all this one I cannot read it already but I will show it to you
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:25,472	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	He's a f****** a****** and should be treated as such
EDL	00:36:26,240	00:36:30,848	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I have lived in this payment for the best 22 years and never in my life faced anything like this
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:38,016	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And is very interesting because the attacks not only coming from Republicans but also coming from Democrats in the race
EDL	00:36:38,528	00:36:41,600	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	About the Democrats the donut kind of under the table
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:45,184	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	OU team claims that some of the Democrats are making the argument that
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:48,000	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Yes he might be able to win a Democratic primary
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:50,304	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Because he's Arab
EDL	00:36:50,304	00:36:52,864	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	He won't be able to win the general election
EDL	00:36:52,864	00:36:54,144	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So don't waste your vote on
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:58,752	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And Justin Brannan who's really The Establishment democratic
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:37:01,824	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	FrontRunner in the race is a flyers and Hazlett
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:03,616	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	This is our neighborhood our guy
EDL	00:37:04,128	00:37:06,944	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So for me as a Native American who living here what that's
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:07,712	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Supposed to mean
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:09,504	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	It is a dog whistling
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:11,296	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	A statement
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:12,064	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Exclusion
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:14,624	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And that I'll just say on that
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:17,440	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	As a white dude
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:20,000	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	From Wisconsin
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:21,792	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	When I see that fire I don't
EDL	00:37:21,792	00:37:22,816	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	See that division in
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:25,120	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Am I just blind to it
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:28,704	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	We you have to understand the context
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:30,240	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Cast of the neighborhood
EDL	00:37:30,240	00:37:32,032	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And the context is
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:34,848	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Everything wrong in the neighborhood is Plainville Daughter by the Chinese
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:36,128	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You know
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:38,688	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	If the street is dirty because of these damn Arabs
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:40,992	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You know like when I go out and say
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:45,856	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I'm fighting for the community and say Jose is only fighting for his community
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:50,976	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But if somebody else say the word Community it's okay it means everybody
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:54,304	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I don't mean to push back but it seems like
EDL	00:37:55,328	00:38:01,728	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	It seems like you two are essentially doing the same thing to one another yeah he's saying when you say the word Community it's only about the Arab to me
EDL	00:38:01,728	00:38:05,824	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And when he says our neighborhood you're saying he's just talking about the white folks
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:08,640	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Isn't it the same thing happening about the Rex
EDL	00:38:12,736	00:38:18,624	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	It could be but we need to understand the background we have a president who you so much rhetoric
EDL	00:38:19,392	00:38:21,952	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	He came up with the Muslim ban
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:25,792	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I'm building the wall and an attacking minorities and people of color
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:32,704	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Our councilman and his death never took a stand on these issues and came out in support of the Arab and Muslim
EDL	00:38:32,704	00:38:33,728	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Give me the deets
EDL	00:38:33,728	00:38:38,080	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You have to look at the history and will it seems like maybe his opponents are
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:40,384	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Playing up this kind of identity politics
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:43,712	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Over and over again I saw Elliot team making it
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:44,480	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Explicit attempt
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:46,528	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	To reach out across the boundary
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:53,440	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Is a Republican
EDL	00:38:53,440	00:38:54,464	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Cider bar
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:57,792	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	He strolled up to the table of Burly white men
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:38:59,328	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	How are you into started giving hug
EDL	00:38:59,840	00:39:05,216	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And I mean just listen to how Brooklyn he sounds you let's hear that once more
EDL	00:39:05,216	00:39:11,616	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	How you doing is he behaving
EDL	00:39:11,616	00:39:13,408	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Thing is been a really delicate line
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:14,688	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Kayla santosuosso
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:17,248	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Because we really wanted to be honest and
EDL	00:39:17,248	00:39:18,784	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And not adjust too much
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:24,928	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But while also like letting people know that this campaign wasn't just for the yard Community it was for them as well
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:27,232	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	59
EDL	00:39:27,744	00:39:31,072	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And so the campaign was also focusing on things that
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:34,144	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	12 things that matter to everyone what what's happening
EDL	00:39:34,144	00:39:37,472	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	They doing a complete renovation of the station
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:37,984	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The station
EDL	00:39:38,496	00:39:44,384	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	No real daily life concerns 5 months
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:50,784	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Chaotic morning Elliott team set up a Podium right in front of the cordoned off staircase of a close Subway stay
EDL	00:39:50,784	00:39:56,160	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Station railed against the MTA for doing with next to no warning at all these repair that we're really just cosmetic
EDL	00:39:56,160	00:39:57,440	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Work needed at all
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:39:58,976	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	We think about all this
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:05,120	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Students with a growth will think about our small business owners and master barber shops with who would be affected impacted
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:06,912	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Proposing this station
EDL	00:40:07,424	00:40:12,544	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	For no reason I mean what's more unifying here in New York then complaining about the subway
EDL	00:40:13,568	00:40:15,616	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And she also went after specific
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:17,408	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Groups
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:18,176	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Who are traditionally
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:25,856	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I just want to say thank you so much for this opportunity to invite me to be
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:26,880	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	With you tonight
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:32,256	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Like on this rainy Thursday night in this YWCA multi-purpose room
EDL	00:40:32,256	00:40:37,376	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	That felt a lot like an elementary school cafeteria
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:39,680	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	My reasoning why I'm learning Forsyth
EDL	00:40:39,680	00:40:40,448	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	City Council
EDL	00:40:40,448	00:40:42,496	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And also to tell you
EDL	00:40:42,496	00:40:46,336	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	That I would be very proud to be the first one to represent
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:47,872	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The Democratic Socialist
EDL	00:40:47,872	00:40:50,944	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	In City Hall who are the Democratic socialists
EDL	00:40:50,944	00:40:52,480	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	These are the Bernie Sanders
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:58,368	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	An important fact to know is there are lots of anti-establishment
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:40:59,904	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	White people in this District
EDL	00:40:59,904	00:41:04,256	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	This neighborhood in the presidential primary went Bernie and went Trump
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:05,280	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Beat Hillary in this test
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:08,864	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So you think have to put on the clothes of
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:10,912	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Yes Brooklyn Jew above
EDL	00:41:10,912	00:41:14,240	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And watching him try to do that a couple things struck me
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:20,384	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	He said that was born and raised in Bethlehem Palestine and my father actually also Carpenter
EDL	00:41:20,896	00:41:23,968	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Lauren London relationship
EDL	00:41:25,504	00:41:26,272	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	First
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:31,904	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	How he was intentionally bringing parts of himself to the four well pushing other parts into the background
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:33,696	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So I'm going to tell you that
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:35,232	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	We have some commonality
EDL	00:41:35,232	00:41:37,280	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	This together and 2nd
EDL	00:41:38,304	00:41:39,840	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I don't think that's why you are here today
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:40,608	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Right
EDL	00:41:40,608	00:41:42,656	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Otherwise
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:47,264	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	How he highlighted specific policies that represented those parts
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:49,056	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I'm selfish economic just
EDL	00:41:49,824	00:41:53,407	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	If free education Oregon universities I have two daughters in
EDL	00:41:53,919	00:42:00,319	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	College and I know how much it cost me I know that my wife and I will have to get a second job to be able to pay for them to
EDL	00:42:00,319	00:42:00,831	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Go to college
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:03,903	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So did they decide to support a partner no
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:04,415	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Well
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:05,695	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	In fact
EDL	00:42:05,695	00:42:06,463	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Bigot
EDL	00:42:08,255	00:42:10,815	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Eagan Thrift by the Democratic socialists of America
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:16,191	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Both the local and National chapters of the organization
EDL	00:42:16,191	00:42:17,215	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Yes
EDL	00:42:17,215	00:42:22,079	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	100%
EDL	00:42:22,079	00:42:28,479	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Because with that endorsement came from real support
EDL	00:42:28,479	00:42:34,879	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Cafe seemed like a good conduit locally they committed hundreds of volunteers had
EDL	00:42:34,879	00:42:40,511	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	5200 power that allowed them to
EDL	00:42:40,511	00:42:43,327	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	What the neighborhood
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:47,935	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And not on Thousand Oaks
EDL	00:42:49,215	00:42:55,615	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Trying to convince people to vote
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:59,967	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Excited about that I'm feeling good.
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:06,111	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And more than just helping them knock on doors because of the national endorsement
EDL	00:43:06,111	00:43:11,743	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	On many evenings of the week they actually had folks from all over the United States phone back
EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:15,839	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Calling from places like Florida to Bay Ridge Brooklyn
EDL	00:43:15,839	00:43:18,399	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Again pitching people to vote for father Elliott
EDL	00:43:19,679	00:43:23,519	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I'm trying to show that my candidacy for City Council
EDL	00:43:24,031	00:43:26,591	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	It is for everyone in this District
EDL	00:43:27,615	00:43:30,687	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	This is what I find so fascinating about you
EDL	00:43:31,199	00:43:37,599	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Did I see such a contradiction and everything you're saying there that you're saying you want to represent the whole Community which I'm sure
EDL	00:43:37,599	00:43:38,367	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Sure you do
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:41,951	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But at the heart of it like what's motivating that is wanting to give voice
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:44,255	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	To this group of people that don't have a voice
EDL	00:43:44,767	00:43:48,095	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Absolutely I mean that that is 100% that I cannot deny.
EDL	00:43:49,631	00:43:51,167	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	What is vemos
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:56,543	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Motivating factors of me running because I wanted to make sure my commute
EDL	00:43:56,543	00:43:59,103	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	City has a voice and has representation but
EDL	00:44:00,127	00:44:01,919	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Running to represent everyone
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:07,039	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You know
EDL	00:44:07,039	00:44:07,807	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Because
EDL	00:44:07,807	00:44:08,319	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You know
EDL	00:44:09,855	00:44:12,927	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Was that a question in your mind going into this like
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:14,207	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	How do I walk this
EDL	00:44:15,231	00:44:15,999	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Probably
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:17,791	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Tiny tightrope
EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:19,839	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Of telling
EDL	00:44:19,839	00:44:20,863	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Deer community
EDL	00:44:21,375	00:44:22,143	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	IMU
EDL	00:44:22,655	00:44:24,447	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And this is our moment
EDL	00:44:25,471	00:44:27,007	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But simultaneously
EDL	00:44:27,519	00:44:28,799	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Hummingbird
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:30,335	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Majority of the neighborhood like
EDL	00:44:30,847	00:44:35,711	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But I'm still you to like Dover I can be both people have to understand
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:36,735	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	My identity
EDL	00:44:36,735	00:44:39,807	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I mean I went and knocked on thousands of doors
EDL	00:44:39,807	00:44:41,087	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	We we talk to people
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:43,647	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	My my
EDL	00:44:43,647	00:44:46,207	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Talking points of the door was always I'm a
EDL	00:44:46,207	00:44:48,767	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Father for my wife is a school near
EDL	00:44:48,767	00:44:55,167	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I love this community and I didn't speak on the apartheid open listings
EDL	00:44:55,167	00:44:59,775	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Livability in the community we spoke about transportation we spoke about
EDL	00:45:00,287	00:45:03,871	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	A police accountability we spoke about things that people in the community
EDL	00:45:03,871	00:45:04,895	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Embassy Suites
EDL	00:45:05,407	00:45:07,199	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Yes we are going to support
EDL	00:45:07,199	00:45:10,783	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	We need somebody like you who can go and in our behalf
EDL	00:45:11,295	00:45:15,135	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So at the end of the day my identity is
EDL	00:45:15,135	00:45:15,903	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Who I am
EDL	00:45:16,415	00:45:17,695	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I am running as
EDL	00:45:17,695	00:45:18,719	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Who I am
EDL	00:45:18,719	00:45:21,023	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And I would not allow anybody to take
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:21,791	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	That away from
EDL	00:45:23,839	00:45:28,191	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And so just a couple of days before September 12th before the election
EDL	00:45:28,191	00:45:30,495	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I checked in with Kayla to see how things were look
EDL	00:45:31,007	00:45:32,287	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	How many days do we have left here
EDL	00:45:40,223	00:45:46,367	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And apparently she told me as Lu team and is canvassers had been going around to all of these doors knocking
EDL	00:45:46,879	00:45:47,903	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	They had been taking notes
EDL	00:45:48,671	00:45:52,255	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	In those notes each person was given a number from 1 to 5
EDL	00:45:52,767	00:45:53,791	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Based on
EDL	00:45:53,791	00:45:59,935	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Their level of support one is like that person was so proelia team you didn't even need to go to that door you're just marking them
EDL	00:46:00,959	00:46:01,983	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	5 is like
EDL	00:46:01,983	00:46:03,007	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Sorry I'm voting for somebody else
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:05,823	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Twos and ones are positive IDs
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:11,967	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I'm just a couple of days before the election an election I'll remind you they only need four thousand votes to win
EDL	00:46:11,967	00:46:14,271	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The number of positive IDs they had was
EDL	00:46:14,783	00:46:21,183	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	5500 so you currently a 5500 give or take
EDL	00:46:21,183	00:46:26,303	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Sol Willoughby be interesting to see how the primaries will be translated the numbers when the
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:27,839	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	September 12th comes
EDL	00:46:28,607	00:46:35,007	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Okay well we're going to take a break and when we come back it'll be Election Day election day

EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:15,455	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Basically I want to hear about this
EDL	00:47:15,455	00:47:17,503	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	When a kid you know did something
EDL	00:47:17,503	00:47:19,551	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	It just means you lean back and say
EDL	00:47:21,087	00:47:21,599	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	How do they do that
EDL	00:47:22,111	00:47:23,647	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Maybe it was the moment that I
EDL	00:47:23,647	00:47:26,719	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back
EDL	00:47:26,719	00:47:27,231	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	To you
EDL	00:47:27,743	00:47:29,791	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Or maybe the kid was a piano
EDL	00:47:29,791	00:47:33,887	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score
EDL	00:47:34,655	00:47:35,935	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Or maybe the kids in math class
EDL	00:47:35,935	00:47:38,751	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Music in the margin of their geometry
EDL	00:47:39,519	00:47:40,287	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	We're interested in the
EDL	00:47:41,311	00:47:42,591	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Epic moments where

EDL	00:50:14,399	00:50:16,447	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You can't blame for their campaign to do this
EDL	00:50:16,447	00:50:18,751	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	We have two affected we have two different operations
EDL	00:50:20,543	00:50:21,823	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	First and foremost
EDL	00:50:22,591	00:50:28,991	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Salaam alaikum
EDL	00:50:28,991	00:50:30,783	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	We have likely Arabic
EDL	00:50:30,783	00:50:32,831	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Speakers assumption was
EDL	00:50:33,343	00:50:37,183	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	That an Arab voter is going to need their hand held much more tightly
EDL	00:50:37,183	00:50:38,207	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	To get them
EDL	00:50:38,207	00:50:38,975	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	To the polls
EDL	00:50:38,975	00:50:41,023	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Never been to the polls before
EDL	00:50:41,023	00:50:47,423	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And so they had like six people on their phones just going down these list
EDL	00:50:47,423	00:50:53,567	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Have you voted today
EDL	00:50:54,079	00:51:00,479	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Simultaneously that same person who's been called basically the person that actually make sure that you go vote
EDL	00:51:00,479	00:51:02,527	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Being flanked by a group of canvassers
EDL	00:51:03,295	00:51:08,159	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	This is a Muhammad marching up to their apartment in banging on their door saying
EDL	00:51:08,927	00:51:13,535	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	1 C to e r e d
EDL	00:51:14,047	00:51:15,327	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	4 + 40
EDL	00:51:15,327	00:51:19,167	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Come out and vote we're going to pull you out
EDL	00:51:19,167	00:51:25,311	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	What time are you going to the polls
EDL	00:51:26,591	00:51:29,151	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I need you to go vote father K need you to go look
EDL	00:51:30,175	00:51:32,223	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	They had this very
EDL	00:51:32,223	00:51:34,015	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Long script they would go through
EDL	00:51:34,527	00:51:40,159	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And I don't remember all of the Arabic but they would often say so are you going to the polls today and the responsibility and Shala
EDL	00:51:40,159	00:51:45,535	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I like God willing and they weren't supposed to accept that they'd have to say no no no no no no no
EDL	00:51:45,535	00:51:51,935	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Inshallah tomorrow today God willing you willing and then they would have to get them to say either like I
EDL	00:51:51,935	00:51:53,983	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I promise on my head and I promise on my heart and
EDL	00:51:53,983	00:51:59,871	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And if they got either of those then they felt like they had imposed social pressures that would work on the Arab community
EDL	00:51:59,871	00:52:06,271	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And then on top of all this we have to do the standard operation of get-out-the-vote with the Triple Crown voters which is like
EDL	00:52:06,271	00:52:09,599	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The voters that have that reliably vote in primaries
EDL	00:52:09,599	00:52:11,903	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	In this community largely White
EDL	00:52:11,903	00:52:12,927	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Largely over the age of
EDL	00:52:12,927	00:52:14,463	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	250 St Nicholas

EDL	00:52:19,583	00:52:25,983	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I am back again nursing homes sending out even more canvassers and even
EDL	00:52:25,983	00:52:29,823	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Educational shout out the passenger window of your car
EDL	00:52:30,591	00:52:33,919	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Early on in the day back at the campaign headquarters
EDL	00:52:37,247	00:52:38,271	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I need somebody to free
EDL	00:52:41,343	00:52:46,719	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	It was clear just how complicated and resource-intensive running these two parallel campaigns what
EDL	00:52:48,255	00:52:48,767	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Go to vote
EDL	00:52:50,303	00:52:55,935	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I just received a call from several Muslim women saying that they needed a ride to the polls
EDL	00:52:56,447	00:52:58,495	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	His wife Grace was going to go pick them up
EDL	00:52:58,495	00:53:04,639	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But you needed someone to go with her
EDL	00:53:05,151	00:53:06,431	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But you know.
EDL	00:53:07,455	00:53:08,991	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	If I can leave the table
EDL	00:53:08,991	00:53:10,527	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You got it
EDL	00:53:10,527	00:53:16,159	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Yeah I'll be one of the campaign directors and eat said no you got to stay here
EDL	00:53:17,951	00:53:18,719	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I'll take care of this
EDL	00:53:20,767	00:53:21,279	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Muhammad
EDL	00:53:21,791	00:53:23,839	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Can it be Muhammad like Justin Muhammad
EDL	00:53:26,911	00:53:29,471	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But turns out at Muhammad doesn't speak Arabic
EDL	00:53:30,751	00:53:31,519	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Arabic
EDL	00:53:32,287	00:53:37,407	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Eventually turned out to not actually be a problem so why doesn't Muhammad
EDL	00:53:44,319	00:53:44,831	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Sogo
EDL	00:53:45,343	00:53:47,391	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But then we died put it up
EDL	00:53:47,391	00:53:50,207	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Women
EDL	00:53:50,719	00:53:53,535	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Would be more appropriate for all those going to pick them up
EDL	00:53:53,535	00:53:54,815	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Three women
EDL	00:53:54,815	00:53:56,351	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	San Marino culture
EDL	00:53:57,887	00:53:59,679	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Muhammad can be here
EDL	00:53:59,679	00:54:01,215	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	How to make it take my place for a little bit
EDL	00:54:01,727	00:54:02,495	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	What do I do
EDL	00:54:04,287	00:54:05,567	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Define lie
EDL	00:54:05,567	00:54:06,591	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Indeed a hectic
EDL	00:54:06,591	00:54:08,127	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	They said we. Just go
EDL	00:54:08,895	00:54:10,687	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And this was all for just to vote
EDL	00:54:11,711	00:54:17,855	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But I will say despite all that Midway through the day it did appear like this two-pronged approach woodworking
EDL	00:54:21,439	00:54:23,487	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You didn't
EDL	00:54:23,999	00:54:25,023	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	50 doors
EDL	00:54:26,047	00:54:28,863	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	71 people canvassers we're getting good feedback
EDL	00:54:28,863	00:54:29,631	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And on the street

EDL	00:54:38,079	00:54:39,871	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	White folks were coming up to and saying like

EDL	00:54:52,415	00:54:53,439	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You only know what it means
EDL	00:54:55,231	00:54:55,999	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Pretty personal
EDL	00:54:58,559	00:54:59,071	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Are you going to say
EDL	00:55:03,679	00:55:05,727	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Really emotional I don't want to be voice in the loop
EDL	00:55:06,239	00:55:07,519	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	My husband is dad in Malaysia
EDL	00:55:08,287	00:55:09,311	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Because you send me a man

EDL	00:55:16,479	00:55:17,247	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Public voting
EDL	00:55:17,759	00:55:18,271	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Thank you
EDL	00:55:21,855	00:55:22,879	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	It is very personal
EDL	00:55:28,511	00:55:29,023	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But then
EDL	00:55:30,303	00:55:31,327	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Hi how are you
EDL	00:55:31,327	00:55:34,143	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	In LED in car at about 2 in the afternoon
EDL	00:55:34,143	00:55:35,167	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	How's the numbers looking
EDL	00:55:35,679	00:55:38,751	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	They got their first sense of what voter turnout was looking like
EDL	00:55:53,855	00:55:54,367	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Right
EDL	00:55:58,207	00:55:59,743	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So they never said that we're
EDL	00:56:00,511	00:56:02,303	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Underperforming in a few poll sites
EDL	00:56:02,815	00:56:03,327	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You should be doing better
EDL	00:56:05,375	00:56:05,887	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Yeah
EDL	00:56:06,655	00:56:07,167	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Sorry
EDL	00:56:10,751	00:56:12,799	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	This is Muhammad Khan the campaign treasurer
EDL	00:56:14,079	00:56:15,103	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Yeah they never said that
EDL	00:56:15,103	00:56:16,895	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You know post I swear we have
EDL	00:56:16,895	00:56:17,663	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Strong support
EDL	00:56:18,431	00:56:19,455	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Are showing lower
EDL	00:56:19,455	00:56:19,967	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Turn out the way
EDL	00:56:21,759	00:56:24,063	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So I can see what I know who people are voting
EDL	00:56:24,063	00:56:24,831	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Informant we're guessing
EDL	00:56:26,111	00:56:27,903	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Since less people are voting their overall that means
EDL	00:56:30,207	00:56:31,743	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Lymphocytes where are we now
EDL	00:56:31,743	00:56:32,767	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Our opponent has trunks
EDL	00:56:32,767	00:56:33,279	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Support
EDL	00:56:36,351	00:56:39,167	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And so what what are the strategies to remedy that
EDL	00:56:40,191	00:56:41,727	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So is need to allocate more again
EDL	00:56:44,543	00:56:45,823	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Areas where we see
EDL	00:56:45,823	00:56:46,335	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Thunder performance
EDL	00:56:47,103	00:56:47,615	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Turn more people
EDL	00:56:48,383	00:56:49,151	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	To go knock on the
EDL	00:56:50,175	00:56:51,455	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Knock on the doors
EDL	00:56:51,455	00:56:52,735	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Old people out of their homes
EDL	00:56:53,247	00:56:53,759	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Make sure they vote
EDL	00:56:55,551	00:56:58,111	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And so with about 4 hours remaining
EDL	00:56:58,879	00:57:02,207	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The right now is all about talking to individuals Dragon people off the street
EDL	00:57:02,207	00:57:07,839	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	All of the leaders of the campaign including Linda sarsour
EDL	00:57:08,863	00:57:12,191	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Barber shops
EDL	00:57:12,191	00:57:17,055	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	They were literally going into arab-owned stores
EDL	00:57:17,055	00:57:23,455	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Barbershops delhi's hookah lounges
EDL	00:57:23,455	00:57:27,551	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Google
EDL	00:57:29,343	00:57:35,231	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And what was happening of the final push
EDL	00:57:35,231	00:57:37,023	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Volunteers were showing up
EDL	00:57:37,023	00:57:42,143	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	It's a good time to push again
EDL	00:57:48,031	00:57:50,847	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Liverpool sites that have been hit at 115
EDL	00:57:52,127	00:57:52,639	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Seem to be working
EDL	00:57:53,151	00:57:53,919	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So we just got to keep that up
EDL	00:57:54,431	00:57:56,479	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	What what what what's the what's the emotion of the moment
EDL	00:57:57,503	00:58:01,343	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Yeah I don't know I mean it's a closed right there like if I eat it feels like it
EDL	00:58:01,855	00:58:07,487	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Based on the turnout numbers that were seeing in the way that turn out happening there's basically two strongholds that are currently developing
EDL	00:58:07,999	00:58:09,791	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	North Bay ridge ave Bay Ridge
EDL	00:58:09,791	00:58:12,863	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	South Bay Ridge which is largely White
EDL	00:58:12,863	00:58:16,191	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Seems to be turning out hard for the establishment candidate just
EDL	00:58:16,191	00:58:21,055	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And Brandon in North Bay Ridge is where the majority of the arab-american
EDL	00:58:22,079	00:58:24,895	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And in that moment the campaign makes a decision
EDL	00:58:25,407	00:58:28,479	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So at this point we're zeroing in all of our efforts on just
EDL	00:58:28,991	00:58:30,271	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Everything North
EDL	00:58:30,271	00:58:31,039	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	75th Street
EDL	00:58:32,063	00:58:34,623	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	That the only way to win
EDL	00:58:34,623	00:58:41,023	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Is the push hard to get as many votes as they can in those Arab American neighborhoods and essentially
EDL	00:58:41,023	00:58:43,071	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Write off trying to convince the white
EDL	00:58:43,583	00:58:48,447	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So this is like you know we got it it's our people are going to make the difference so we go for our people
EDL	00:58:48,447	00:58:49,215	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Yes
EDL	00:58:49,215	00:58:50,751	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	We're doing good
EDL	00:58:54,079	00:58:56,383	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Inside like an hour remaining
EDL	00:58:56,383	00:58:57,407	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Everyone went out
EDL	00:58:58,431	00:59:00,223	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	For one final push
EDL	00:59:02,783	00:59:03,295	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Lock.
EDL	00:59:08,415	00:59:09,439	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And I'll see it when I come back
EDL	00:59:10,719	00:59:13,023	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Cars were driving by honking their horns for him
EDL	00:59:14,815	00:59:16,607	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Brooklyn

EDL	01:00:08,063	01:00:11,391	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I was with eliaquim right when we hit 9
EDL	01:00:12,415	01:00:13,183	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And in that moment
EDL	01:00:14,207	01:00:17,023	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I don't know from where but someone handed him
EDL	01:00:17,023	01:00:17,791	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	What's up baby

EDL	01:00:19,583	01:00:20,607	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And he was just
EDL	01:00:20,607	01:00:22,143	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Standing on this dark
EDL	01:00:22,143	01:00:23,167	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Street
EDL	01:00:23,167	01:00:25,215	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	His back against the minivan
EDL	01:00:25,215	01:00:27,519	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	His face illuminated by the Light
EDL	01:00:27,519	01:00:29,567	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Pouring out from his campaign headquarters
EDL	01:00:30,591	01:00:32,895	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	With this baby in one arm
EDL	01:00:32,895	01:00:35,711	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And his cell phone pressed tightly up against his ear
EDL	01:00:36,223	01:00:36,991	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Asking Kayla
EDL	01:00:41,343	01:00:42,623	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	What the numbers were looking like
EDL	01:00:48,511	01:00:51,071	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	All of these volunteers staff and supporters
EDL	01:00:51,583	01:00:54,911	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	We're gathering in the patio of this bar Pizzeria called the Firefly
EDL	01:00:56,959	01:00:59,263	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Waiting there for eliaquim to arrive
EDL	01:00:59,263	01:01:00,287	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	As well as the results
EDL	01:01:01,055	01:01:04,127	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Kayla called me as I was walking up to the fire
EDL	01:01:04,127	01:01:04,639	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Fly pizzeria
EDL	01:01:05,919	01:01:08,991	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Because of that time the numbers from South Brooklyn came in
EDL	01:01:08,991	01:01:13,599	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	She said I've added these results with what we already know and she said the
EDL	01:01:14,111	01:01:14,623	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Willis
EDL	01:01:22,303	01:01:24,351	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The moment before I walked into
EDL	01:01:26,655	01:01:27,935	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Biloxi weather
EDL	01:01:27,935	01:01:28,447	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The Firefly
EDL	01:01:51,999	01:01:57,375	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	After word got around that they had in fact lost on Linda sarsour
EDL	01:01:59,167	01:02:00,959	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Stood up on this picnic table
EDL	01:02:00,959	01:02:01,727	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And addressed everyone
EDL	01:02:02,495	01:02:04,799	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I know a lot of folks were here who are not
EDL	01:02:05,311	01:02:09,151	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Children immigrants or if you're not arab-american or Muslim you do not under
EDL	01:02:09,151	01:02:09,663	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Understand what
EDL	01:02:13,759	01:02:14,271	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	It is not over
EDL	01:02:14,783	01:02:16,319	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And I want to see the father
EDL	01:02:18,879	01:02:20,415	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Father, did not have to do
EDL	01:02:21,439	01:02:22,719	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	He did not have to
EDL	01:02:22,719	01:02:23,743	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Quit his job
EDL	01:02:24,255	01:02:25,535	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	A father of four
EDL	01:02:26,303	01:02:27,839	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But father I just did it
EDL	01:02:28,607	01:02:32,703	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	He did it to help us build the political voice that we knew we always had
EDL	01:02:33,215	01:02:39,615	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	In this community to allow people to pay attention to us and our issues
EDL	01:02:39,615	01:02:42,431	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The weather tonight we're doing this again
EDL	01:02:58,815	01:03:00,095	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But we lost it
EDL	01:03:01,631	01:03:05,983	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Gwinnett to they know why we ended up losing by just under 700 votes
EDL	01:03:05,983	01:03:08,799	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Which is about 7% of the total vote
EDL	01:03:08,799	01:03:14,687	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Cast we know what what what would account for the difference
EDL	01:03:15,199	01:03:21,599	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Because the voter records don't come out until December but there are a couple things that we do know one
EDL	01:03:21,599	01:03:24,927	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Was that the Renault Arabic translators at the polls
EDL	01:03:25,439	01:03:25,951	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Really
EDL	01:03:26,975	01:03:27,743	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Yeah
EDL	01:03:27,743	01:03:33,375	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	See how far I can get I'm just follow we actually had reporters sarkari go down into one of the polling
EDL	01:03:33,887	01:03:35,423	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	To see exactly what was going on
EDL	01:03:35,423	01:03:38,495	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Hi can I just ask what languages you guys are translating
EDL	01:03:39,007	01:03:40,543	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Cantonese and Mandarin
EDL	01:03:40,543	01:03:41,567	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	How about you
EDL	01:03:41,567	01:03:42,079	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Cantonese
EDL	01:03:42,847	01:03:43,615	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Spanish
EDL	01:03:43,615	01:03:44,383	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	English to Spanish
EDL	01:03:45,151	01:03:47,967	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Okay is there somebody in Arabic translator
EDL	01:03:48,479	01:03:50,527	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Portugal Arabic is not a
EDL	01:03:50,527	01:03:51,551	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Approved the language
EDL	01:03:51,551	01:03:52,319	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	4 in
EDL	01:03:52,319	01:03:52,831	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Driving trip
EDL	01:03:54,879	01:03:55,391	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Acting New York
EDL	01:03:57,695	01:03:58,719	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Turns out
EDL	01:03:58,719	01:04:01,791	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	What languages are provided in any borough of New York City
EDL	01:04:02,303	01:04:03,839	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Are decided upon
EDL	01:04:03,839	01:04:04,863	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Based on census
EDL	01:04:05,631	01:04:12,031	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And because there is no census data, that may be so angry
EDL	01:04:12,031	01:04:14,591	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You can't come here like who they are they just have
EDL	01:04:14,591	01:04:15,103	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Go neutral
EDL	01:04:15,615	01:04:20,991	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	What the problem was the interpreters that the campaign was attempting to provide for these folks
EDL	01:04:21,503	01:04:24,575	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	At several of the polling locations they were actually turned away from the
EDL	01:04:24,575	01:04:29,183	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Play New York state official by the election people by the folks working the polls
EDL	01:04:29,695	01:04:30,719	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Relay
EDL	01:04:30,719	01:04:32,511	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Which is which it turns out is illegal
EDL	01:04:33,023	01:04:34,559	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	They were illegally turned away
EDL	01:04:34,559	01:04:35,583	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	They were illegally turned away
EDL	01:04:36,095	01:04:37,119	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But
EDL	01:04:37,119	01:04:42,751	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Despite all that they did in fact get out more arab-american voters than have
EDL	01:04:42,751	01:04:44,031	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Ever turned out
EDL	01:04:44,031	01:04:44,799	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	For a Raceway
EDL	01:04:45,311	01:04:46,079	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	It's like by
EDL	01:04:46,847	01:04:49,407	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Factor of 404
EDL	01:04:49,919	01:04:51,455	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Where they ended up
EDL	01:04:51,455	01:04:53,247	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Coming up short it would seem
EDL	01:04:53,247	01:04:54,527	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Is with the white photo
EDL	01:04:55,039	01:04:57,855	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And nobody has a perfect explanation
EDL	01:04:57,855	01:05:02,975	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But I did talk to some political movers and shakers down in the area and they they offer.
EDL	01:05:02,975	01:05:04,511	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Three different explanations
EDL	01:05:05,023	01:05:08,863	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	When is that the message that he was delivering to the white folks to fail
EDL	01:05:08,863	01:05:09,631	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	How to connect
EDL	01:05:09,631	01:05:11,679	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The second one is that
EDL	01:05:11,679	01:05:17,823	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Having these two campaigns at the same time one for the Arabs one for the white folks that that just damn damn from the beginning II recovery
EDL	01:05:19,615	01:05:20,895	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	All of it either
EDL	01:05:20,895	01:05:22,943	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	IMM the third one is that
EDL	01:05:23,455	01:05:24,735	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	This had nothing to do with him
EDL	01:05:25,247	01:05:27,039	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The fat nothing to do with this campaign
EDL	01:05:27,039	01:05:32,927	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Just In This Moment there were not enough white folks who would be willing to vote for in Arab candidate
EDL	01:05:33,439	01:05:34,207	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	No matter what
EDL	01:05:36,511	01:05:37,535	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	No it's nice to
EDL	01:05:43,679	01:05:44,959	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	We're emotionally where are you

EDL	01:05:47,519	01:05:48,031	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Do you like cotton
EDL	01:05:49,311	01:05:53,407	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	A couple weeks after the election I headed back down to Bayridge to sit down
EDL	01:05:53,407	01:05:55,455	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	One more time with Father Lut
EDL	01:05:55,967	01:05:59,039	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Well of a truth is that I haven't taken a day off yet
EDL	01:06:00,575	01:06:01,855	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You cuz I've been so busy
EDL	01:06:04,415	01:06:07,231	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I'm not doing this to myself it is just
EDL	01:06:07,231	01:06:08,511	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The outcome of the
EDL	01:06:08,511	01:06:09,535	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Just convince husband
EDL	01:06:10,047	01:06:11,071	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Unbelievable
EDL	01:06:11,071	01:06:13,375	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So the moment we finished with the campaign week
EDL	01:06:13,375	01:06:14,143	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Continue to meet
EDL	01:06:14,143	01:06:14,655	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The discus
EDL	01:06:15,423	01:06:17,215	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The boutique aboard that we have built
EDL	01:06:17,215	01:06:19,007	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	What the weather going to do with it
EDL	01:06:19,007	01:06:22,591	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Because we have almost three thousand people came out and voted
EDL	01:06:22,591	01:06:24,639	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	We can make a difference in any election
EDL	01:06:25,407	01:06:31,807	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And that's why I said we cannot slow down now we need to continue to educate the community we need to continue to be engaged
EDL	01:06:31,807	01:06:33,087	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	It's within we cannot oppose government
EDL	01:06:33,599	01:06:34,623	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	We cannot
EDL	01:06:34,623	01:06:36,415	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Afford to lose the momentum
EDL	01:06:36,415	01:06:37,183	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	We just can't
EDL	01:06:37,183	01:06:37,951	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So this is

EDL	01:07:13,279	01:07:14,047	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Trying to
EDL	01:07:14,047	01:07:15,071	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Speak to

EDL	01:07:22,239	01:07:24,543	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	What I heard from him in that was
EDL	01:07:25,311	01:07:27,871	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Can becoming more and more of a voice of just
EDL	01:07:28,639	01:07:29,407	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	One group
EDL	01:07:29,407	01:07:29,919	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	One community

EDL	01:07:37,599	01:07:40,415	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I feel like this is him recognizing the nature of the game and
EDL	01:07:41,183	01:07:43,231	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Deciding to come from a position of strength
EDL	01:07:43,231	01:07:45,023	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I say also I'm also you want him to

EDL	01:07:51,423	01:07:54,751	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	When you want it our votes deal with me I've got votes
EDL	01:07:54,751	01:07:57,055	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The push I've got votes to give and withhold
EDL	01:07:57,055	01:07:59,615	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	What I want I want that community
EDL	01:08:00,383	01:08:01,407	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	To step out
EDL	01:08:01,407	01:08:01,919	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And be heard
EDL	01:08:02,431	01:08:03,199	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Have a voice
EDL	01:08:03,967	01:08:04,991	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And this is how it has
EDL	01:08:04,991	01:08:06,015	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I think it has two
EDL	01:08:06,015	01:08:08,063	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	If you believe in this system it has
EDL	01:08:08,063	01:08:08,575	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	To be possible
EDL	01:08:09,087	01:08:10,623	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	If someone talented enough
EDL	01:08:10,623	01:08:11,903	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	To be able to stand up
EDL	01:08:12,415	01:08:13,439	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Say two things at
EDL	01:08:13,439	01:08:14,207	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	At the same time
EDL	01:08:14,207	01:08:16,767	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Two things seem contradictory but he does believe in
EDL	01:08:17,279	01:08:18,815	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	It has to be possible
EDL	01:08:18,815	01:08:22,911	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Yeah I understand that but I mean in this particular moment in this pretty good I mean
EDL	01:08:22,911	01:08:24,447	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I don't think identity politics
EDL	01:08:24,447	01:08:24,959	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	The choice
EDL	01:08:25,983	01:08:28,031	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Yeah I mean you remember the woman who's like
EDL	01:08:28,031	01:08:28,799	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Stele egyptian
EDL	01:08:29,311	01:08:30,335	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Stele egyptian
EDL	01:08:30,335	01:08:31,871	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	He's being seen
EDL	01:08:31,871	01:08:37,503	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	That's one thing that he is not what are you doing
EDL	01:08:37,503	01:08:40,063	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Just like pretend to have a Rainbow Coalition when there's no
EDL	01:08:40,063	01:08:41,855	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Chances that you just want to fight
EDL	01:08:43,391	01:08:44,671	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You got that out of your system
EDL	01:08:51,839	01:08:54,911	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	So how does he feel about me I was going to say oddly enough
EDL	01:08:56,447	01:08:58,495	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I tried to put all of this in front of him
EDL	01:09:00,287	01:09:01,567	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	With that
EDL	01:09:02,335	01:09:05,919	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	That brings me actually to the question that I think is at the heart of everything IV
EDL	01:09:06,687	01:09:09,247	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Is you were really trying to transcend
EDL	01:09:09,247	01:09:10,015	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Identity politics
EDL	01:09:10,783	01:09:13,087	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You were trying to at one time speak to those
EDL	01:09:13,087	01:09:13,599	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	People in yet
EDL	01:09:14,623	01:09:15,903	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	At the same time say no.
EDL	01:09:15,903	01:09:17,439	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	My turban is has nothing to do with
EDL	01:09:18,719	01:09:19,999	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You trying to do both
EDL	01:09:20,511	01:09:21,279	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	And I think that
EDL	01:09:22,559	01:09:24,095	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I worry that that is why it's
EDL	01:09:27,423	01:09:28,447	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I don't know
EDL	01:09:33,055	01:09:35,103	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	To think about what you just said but the
EDL	01:09:36,895	01:09:37,663	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	You know I
EDL	01:09:37,663	01:09:40,735	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	With other as myself as an Arab American Lutheran pastor
EDL	01:09:41,503	01:09:42,271	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But I had to take
EDL	01:09:43,039	01:09:48,415	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Stance on issues that really matter to me and to the things that I am passionate about
EDL	01:09:49,183	01:09:53,279	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	But does that mean you're sort of a better person than you are a politician
EDL	01:09:54,815	01:09:57,887	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	I like to see myself like that definitely I mean I
EDL	01:09:59,423	01:10:02,239	| radiolab_podcast17bayridge |	Did I saw it with my team so it was the right thing
