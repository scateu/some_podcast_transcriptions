EDL	00:00:24,576	00:00:28,416	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	We're going to begin with a conversation we had actually
EDL	00:00:29,440	00:00:34,048	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I I would benefit from a little bit of framing about kind of what we were like our goal of the session
EDL	00:00:34,560	00:00:35,584	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Sure we can frame it
EDL	00:00:35,584	00:00:37,888	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Make you blab a lot and then we added later
EDL	00:00:38,656	00:00:39,936	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Right
EDL	00:00:39,936	00:00:43,776	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	It's a conversation we had with a reporter
EDL	00:00:50,688	00:00:53,760	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	She at the time was a New York Times
EDL	00:00:54,528	00:00:56,832	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	But is now the editorial director

EDL	00:00:59,904	00:01:01,440	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Personal interest lies in a relationship with milk
EDL	00:01:01,952	00:01:03,744	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And I was very open about that
EDL	00:01:03,744	00:01:06,304	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Talk about it with all my friends and we open with him
EDL	00:01:06,304	00:01:07,584	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Yeah I mean I would say
EDL	00:01:07,584	00:01:09,888	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	He was in some denial and but yeah I was
EDL	00:01:10,912	00:01:13,472	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I regularly would tell him hey like you have a problem with this
EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:16,288	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	You know when he would be clear back
EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:17,568	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	So you know if you're going to make me choose
EDL	00:01:17,568	00:01:19,104	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Between me and vodka I'm going to choose vodka
EDL	00:01:19,616	00:01:21,408	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	So
EDL	00:01:22,176	00:01:23,712	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And I was going to be young
EDL	00:01:24,224	00:01:26,528	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	But every night after 11 my life
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:27,552	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Became
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:29,600	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Without getting into a lot of detail there were
EDL	00:01:29,600	00:01:30,368	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Fights
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:30,880	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Arguments
EDL	00:01:31,392	00:01:32,160	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	A lot of rage
EDL	00:01:32,160	00:01:35,744	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And I didn't know what to do and then felt really out of control and
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:37,536	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And I've been to Al-Anon meetings and
EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:39,072	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Jesse Metcalfe
EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:43,424	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Terrible tragic problem that like a really smart cool person would turn really awful on you
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:47,776	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	But then one day Amy found herself in Barnes & Noble on Union Square
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:48,800	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Union Square
EDL	00:01:48,800	00:01:50,592	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Think I'm on the third floor and there was a
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:54,944	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	The table of mostly self-help books and there was this one called the end of my addiction
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:55,456	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Fiction
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:01:58,784	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	She picked it up
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:03,392	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	This book was super fascinating it was the Memoir of a French cardiologist
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:06,720	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	This French Doctor Who had his life completely ruined by alcoholism
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:10,816	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And I looked at it and I probably stood there like feet glued
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:12,352	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	To the floor and just like red
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:13,120	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	70%
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:21,568	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	The book described in very Vivid detail this successful doctor just sliding off the rails
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:26,176	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Are detoxes and medical treatment facilities you know upwards of a half-dozen times
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:32,576	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Is practicing falling off he was losing everything in his life
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:33,856	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	In the back of a taxi
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:37,952	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Blood all over himself doesn't it was blood it is doesn't know where he's going
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:38,976	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Used totally desperate
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:41,792	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	He kill himself was the next option
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:45,376	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And then at one point he says that he had read this
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:46,400	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Tiny nugget
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:48,192	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And this is like the
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:48,704	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Early 90
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:53,312	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Barely eat some lacrosse the short piece about a guy who's been addicted to cocaine
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:54,592	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Taking some muscle
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:55,616	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:57,664	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Cravings for cocaine completely
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:02:59,712	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	You're just one guy one guy six
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:02,272	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Eats all that and he basically just felt like
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:03,808	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Well I might as well try it
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:05,856	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I'm just going to experiment on myself
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:07,392	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	So he gets the drug
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:09,952	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Start taking it and he slowly like doses up
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:13,280	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	More and more mount
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:19,424	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	The drug nothing happens nothing happens and then at one point he says the switch
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:25,824	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And once the switch hit you just became absolutely indifferent.
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:32,224	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Apparently this obsessive need for alcohol that it burdens him his entire life
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:34,272	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Just went away
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:36,064	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Total indifference

EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:03,519	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And I sort of started to
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:04,543	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Downshift
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:05,311	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	My
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:06,591	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Thought of doing a story
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:07,615	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:12,479	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Right about this time I reporting group got disbanded do it and due to an internal reorganization and so
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:14,783	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I moved to a different desk and it was like okay
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:18,367	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Maybe someday Radiolab will be interested
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:21,695	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Kids will eat anything
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:26,559	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	No in all fairness dr. Mason to enforcing passed away a few years ago
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:31,935	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	May have been in the middle of a manic episode which doesn't necessarily negate his story with
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:38,335	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Even after dropping the story Amy as a journalist is someone who can
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:40,895	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Personally affected by alcoholism is incredibly torn
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:42,175	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	As a journalist
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:42,943	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	You have to be
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:45,503	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Skeptical of everything but
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:51,903	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	At the same time like when it be great if we lived in a world where you could
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:55,231	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Deal with this problem which you know tear it apart so many lives
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:59,583	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Kill so many people create all kinds of pain and agony
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:01,119	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	With like a medication
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:02,655	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	That just seems
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:03,679	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Great
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:07,519	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	A question for me
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:10,335	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	We often see addiction is like
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:12,639	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Things that you've got them morally conqueror
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:14,943	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Spiritual calamity
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:17,759	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	They've got some how we organize your entire being in order
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:19,039	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Through
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:21,343	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	But what if it's not that way what if it's
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:26,207	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	What if it's simply a switch in your brain that got stuck in the on position
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:27,231	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Can use a pill that
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:27,743	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Just switch it right off
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:29,535	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	It would be nice
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:34,143	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Now we were super skeptical of this idea but we also couldn't stop thinking about it
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:36,703	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	So recently
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:38,751	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	We start making some calls

EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:13,311	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Is it they would sometimes described as head of a wave of sensation
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:15,615	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Just pulsates throughout your whole body
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:19,455	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Their toes up to their head back down again
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:34,559	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Okay one day in 1995 she's at a conference she bumps into a guy who tells her he has managed
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:38,655	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	To get some rats addicted to cocaine give them Baclofen and they totally lost interest in the
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:41,215	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	They were just interested for several hours
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:42,495	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	So I saw this and I thought
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:43,775	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Well
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:45,823	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	So she began to give baclofen to people
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,359	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Who are addicted to crack
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:48,127	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Small doses
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:50,687	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And initially there was a lot of disappointment
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:51,455	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Results
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:54,783	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Then she says one day she was sitting in the staff Lounge
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:55,807	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Chilling
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:58,111	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Macaulay Grant
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:08:59,903	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Guy over
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:02,463	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Hospital next door
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:05,279	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And you know it was you got to talk to him
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:07,839	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	His name was Ed Coleman
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:08,607	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Is a paraplegic
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:11,167	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	He had a drug deal gone wrong
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:12,191	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Been shot in the neck
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:18,591	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Paralyzed from the waist down so he was in a wheelchair taking Baclofen
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:20,127	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Spasms in legs
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:24,223	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	He recounted this to me and actually have the tape of it doing low dose at first
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:27,039	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And that was 10 mg 4 times a day
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:31,135	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Tell me why you up the dose
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:32,927	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Turn
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,463	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Nintendo's
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:36,255	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Does it take your muscles
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:39,583	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I'm still beat up my legs are stingy
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:44,191	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	So I said well maybe if I take two
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:48,031	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	What did you notice
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:52,639	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	What Edward found was that when he doubled
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:55,455	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	His baclofen dose
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:10:01,855	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Teens cocaine
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:03,391	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	No longer had the high
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:04,927	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	When I was taking it
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:06,975	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Manhattan cream
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:11,839	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Even when I'm to tell that when he stopped taking baclofen cuz he did stop for 2 days
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:18,239	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I was having bad spasms the leg spasms came back
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:21,055	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	He could get the high again and the craving went through the ceiling
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:30,527	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	So Edward had been doing his own experiments did have the toast to see
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:35,135	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	What was the dose wake Stone, cocaine high but it hasn't wouldn't be driving him crazy
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:37,183	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Wow so he's like a one-man study
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:44,095	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	This is actually the specific story that inspired Dr Mason to do his one-man studying to write that book
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:45,887	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Which held Amy
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:47,167	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Glute

EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:51,007	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Now even though none of this was
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:53,567	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Rock Solid science by any means
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,615	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Amy says that since then
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:57,151	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	People have begun
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:57,919	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Quietly
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:11:04,319	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Take this drug in some doctors if you going to prescribe it I talked to a guy who runs a halfway house in Youngstown Ohio
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:09,439	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Who is using baclofen with people that were under his care there was a doctor
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:13,535	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	In Chicago who is prescribing it to a lot of people that Zoloft
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:16,607	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Jobs in the book message boards
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:20,959	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Hundreds of people on these boards swapping stories about how much they took when they took it
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:24,799	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	They were crowdsourcing their own cure in effect
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:25,823	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	The really surprising
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:30,687	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Is it as we kept calling around we realized that Baclofen
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:33,503	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Was just the tip of the iceberg
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:37,343	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Yes yes there's another drug a can of procedure campral
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:41,439	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And this other drug Gabapentin is Topiramate or Topamax
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:43,999	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Disulfiram Chantix Suboxone
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:46,815	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Naltrexone buprenorphine is a Doctor Mark willenbring

EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:58,335	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Try to Target the high that you get a simple way to put it is this
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:00,127	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	It's a buzzkill
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:01,407	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	The bus schedule
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:04,991	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Interesting seat drink but you don't get the milk at the happy warm feeling
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,575	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Apparently takes all the fun out of
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:15,487	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	According to one journalist we talk to Gabrielle Glaser who does a ton of reporting about mental health and addiction
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:19,071	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	30 L but she tried one of these trucks during the course of reporting and
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:22,655	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	It honestly it made a second glass of wine same about as
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,703	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Enjoyable as a
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:25,727	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	A glass of Dimetapp
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:28,031	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	It was it was just
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:30,079	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	It was like drinking water
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:32,639	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Why what is the drug supposedly doing
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:33,407	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Well
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:36,479	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	It blocks opioid receptors in the brain which is our pleasure sis
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:39,807	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	According to Dr dr. willenbring
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:42,879	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Basically if you think of like if you think of a good Buzz as a
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:47,743	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Has like a chemical handshake like you've got the alcohol molecules
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:54,143	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I need to click in with the receptors in your brain and that's what creates ultimately the good feeling
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:55,935	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	What is what does category of drug
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:13:02,591	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Do is they they get in the middle of the handshake they sort of like a blanket prevent the hands from shaking or muffled them
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:03,359	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Search Bright
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:05,407	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And if you're not getting as much enjoyment out of the drinks
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:07,199	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Any ideas or not
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:07,967	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I can drink as much
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:09,503	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And these are home run
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:11,807	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Drugs Eden things are drugs that you just don't
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:13,087	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	See
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:14,111	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	These kinds of effects
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:16,415	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	In medicine
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:17,439	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And hardly any say
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:21,535	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Mark Twain Addison Studies have been done in Finland
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:26,399	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Are the Netherlands UK run a bunch of us
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:29,983	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Hey look at this one particular drug called Naltrexone and show
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:31,775	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	It has a very high success rate
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:38,687	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Like one particular study in Finland 150 people show that this truck has a 78% success rate
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:39,455	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Helping
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:40,735	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Very heavy drinker
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:43,295	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Reduce their drinking to normal levels
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:44,063	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Sprint
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:48,671	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	So are these rocks venues
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:49,951	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	No
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:55,071	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Basically the pickup has been near zero
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:58,399	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	This is something over and over again
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:14:00,959	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	These trucks are out there that there's there is some evidence that they work
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:06,079	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	But they're kind of invisible yes that's Gabrielle Glaser again
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:07,103	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Shear
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:11,455	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	About 1% of people who suffer from alcohol use disorder
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:16,831	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Ever given the choice or an option to take any sort of medication
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:19,135	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Set B1 2% of best
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:19,647	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Yes
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:24,511	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Which is particularly weird she says because that drug Naltrexone was using the Finish study that did well
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:27,327	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	It's been out for a while
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:31,167	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	This drug was approved by the FDA in 1994
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:33,727	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I'm by the way the purpose of treating alcoholics
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:35,775	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	We never heard about it
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:38,335	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	That's so weird
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:44,735	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Well that's a very complicated question should sort of hard to pin down but that there had basically just been this psychic
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:46,015	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Barriers we've all had
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:47,807	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	To seeing addiction is something up
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:48,575	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Pill
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:49,855	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Can help I mean just look at med school
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:53,183	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I think there are something around 240 Medical
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:53,951	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Schools in the United
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:57,791	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	In only 14 medical schools
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:14:59,839	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Was there a single
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:00,607	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Course
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:02,143	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	In addiction medicine
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:05,983	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	That number has since gone up a little bit but not a lot and so we asked her why would that be
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:07,519	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	She said well
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:13,919	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	It's just that addiction treatment has never really been part of the rest of medicine it has been complete
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:14,943	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Desegregated
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:17,247	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	It's been snowing self-contained world and
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:20,575	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	This actually goes back to how it was set up
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:26,975	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	The very beginning of fast I need to go back about 80 years we had in hospitals at the time in the late 19th
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:29,023	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Recent early 1940s we had

EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:33,375	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	But then
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:35,167	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Funway
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:37,727	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	After World War II TB how to cure
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:41,055	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	You got better you didn't have to stay in the hospital in the sanitarium just

EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:46,687	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And she says it was just a
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:47,455	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	A few years earlier

EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:05,375	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	People they were called drunkards inebriate was another word that was commonly used
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:09,983	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Of course the founders of a new this so when they saw all those empty TV War
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:12,799	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	They went to the hospital
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:14,591	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Let's

EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:31,999	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And that's where we are now
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:37,119	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Out of this physical separation according to Gabrielle Glaser you got a
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:38,655	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Cultural separation 2
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:40,191	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Very different ways of singing
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:46,591	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Culture II what does that mean it's just like someone in the medical Sciences who might
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:48,127	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Decline to see addiction as
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:49,407	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Purely biologic
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:50,943	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	That's all
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:57,855	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I will just fix it will just fix it
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:59,903	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Play there's something deeply wrong here there's a
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:06,303	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Something in the person in the spirit in the souls is a reflection of your inner broken self

EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:14,239	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I may have my facts wrong I believe
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:17,311	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	5 out of the 12 Steps mention God

EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:23,455	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Half and the big book which is the Bible of of Alcoholics Anonymous
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:27,039	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	There's a mention of God or him or your higher power
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:28,319	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	On almost every page
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:35,231	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	What is the recovery rate from the AA crap what many researchers say is that the success rate of AA
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:36,511	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Pee is in the single-digit
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:39,327	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	One study show
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:43,679	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	That for every 100 people who show up in an AA meeting on January
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:45,215	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Only five
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:47,519	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Of those people will be sitting there on December 30th
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:51,871	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Of the same year
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:53,919	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	You call that the dropout rate is
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:55,455	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Is 95 /
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:56,479	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Percent
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:58,527	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I was really surprised to find that out
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:17:59,807	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Not to be fair
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:02,111	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I think we should be
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:03,647	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	We have to say that
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:08,255	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Couple things like first of all AAA is it is a volunteer organizations
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:09,535	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Support group doesn't claim to be a treat
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:15,679	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And also when you start talking about success rates that gets really squishy I mean if a person doesn't show up
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:18,495	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Today beating it doesn't necessarily mean that they're
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:24,639	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Drinking and they may be doing just fine or perhaps they switched group they've moved him laugh really hard to sort
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:26,175	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Find your terms here
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:28,223	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Clearly AA is born
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:33,855	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	To a lot of people and that's something that actually Gabrielle Glaser found out last spring when she published an article
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:34,623	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	In the Atlantic
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:36,159	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Get laid all this out
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:38,463	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	When that article came out I received
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:40,511	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Thousands of emails
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:46,143	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	You are a horrible person you deserve to die I hope your kids get killed by drunk drivers
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:48,703	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	But so there was this article in the Atlantic in April
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:52,031	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	We talk to doctor willing Bryan Glazer mentioned in the article
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:55,615	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Call somebody who believes more medication than 12 step
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:57,407	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	He said that when that article came out
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:58,431	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Since then our phone is
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:18:59,711	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Run off the hook
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:03,807	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	We got about half her calls from out-of-state
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:10,207	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Is there anybody in North Carolina or in New York or in Texas or in California
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:13,023	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Or where it is and they're desperate in the families are desperate
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:16,095	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	For an alternative and they can't find one
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:23,007	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	He says all this makes him think back about 30 years when I was a resident there was this debate raging
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:28,639	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	There was a big debate about depression whether people should be treated with antidepressants
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:30,687	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Reset the debate completely shifted
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:31,967	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Can we go
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:34,015	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	It comes to Prozac
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:34,783	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	When we got
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:38,623	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Prozac prescribed Prozac
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:40,671	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Suddenly had this drug that was a massive
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:42,975	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Success Pond other drugs and in the process
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:44,255	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Changed how people

EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:47,583	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And now most people
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:49,375	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Male get treatment for anxiety or depression
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:51,679	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	With antidepressants
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:52,959	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Compared to psychotherapy
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:55,775	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Do you think we're heading in the same place with addiction

EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:12,575	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Do you
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:14,879	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:18,976	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:51,456	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	He was excited as we're a lot of the colors in this category because
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:53,248	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Kind of means that they're just sick
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:54,528	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	They're not bad people
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:58,368	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Not something that people choose even though it seems that way
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:01,952	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Tomorrow in Manhattan near on WNYC hello tomorrow
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:02,720	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Hi-yah
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:05,280	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	One color called in
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:06,560	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	To say that
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:08,608	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Her dad had a terrible time with Alka
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:09,632	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	What's the strongest
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:16,544	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	We were thinking about putting him in rehab or something but afraid of the stigma of it and my mom is a doctor squish
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:18,080	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Is working in the hospital
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:21,664	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	He told me that one day she took matters into her own hands and
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:24,992	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	He gave him injection shots of
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:27,040	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Voltaren
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:33,440	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	You know the way we say it is like mold during a muscle relaxant not too dissimilar from Baclofen
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:34,464	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And it work
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:40,864	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	One day like everything was okay and he was over it I mean it wasn't something that was controlling our lives anymore
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:41,632	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Let me ask you this
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:46,496	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	That's pretty strange emails again after the Brian Lehrer show we had so many calls
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:50,848	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	That he set up a Google voicemail and he talked with an additional 40 or so people
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:55,712	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Eddie asked everyone do you feel that we're headed toward a sea-change where we're going to start
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:59,296	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Treating addictions in the new way
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:03,904	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I completely do you know you got a drug problem find a drug that fixes the drug problem
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:06,720	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Is no pill that will make you want to put them drinks
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:09,792	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Hello Billy
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:10,560	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Today
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:13,120	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Will you just introduce yourself tell me who you are

EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:21,312	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Really live in St Paul Minnesota
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:25,664	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Hey this is Andy so I'm talking to all those people on the phone Billy's
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:30,528	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	It was a story that I just kept thinking about over and over again until eventually we ended up getting him into the studio
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:32,832	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Remember
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:33,856	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	What it was like
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:35,392	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	The first time
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:37,952	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	That you had alcohol it was
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:40,000	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	The summer that I turned 16
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:40,768	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:43,072	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I was a quiet kid
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:43,584	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:45,120	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	It's kind of a
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:47,168	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Nerd you might say I was into
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:51,264	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Computer games but then it took the tide sort of swelling and I got into music and most
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:52,800	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Specifically punk rock in
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:54,592	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Sky
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:56,640	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	He says it was this time that he was
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:57,664	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Coming out of the shell
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:26:59,200	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Learn how to play the bass
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:04,576	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Practicing all the time I made these new friends and they started the band we were horrible
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:07,904	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	But we're willing to put ourselves out there and we started playing gigs and
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:12,000	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I have done my first girlfriend at that time and I was very excited
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:13,280	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And nervous to see her
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:14,560	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	So
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:18,912	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I figured why not why not losing myself up a little bit
EDL	00:27:18,912	00:27:20,192	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	So one day he breaks
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:21,984	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Into his father's liquor cabinet
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:24,800	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Takes a couple shots of Mount gay rum
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:27,872	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	To be honest with you and I finally felt like I was myself
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:34,784	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And it just felt like I was on top of the world and I could do anything and I had all these creative ideas that came to me
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:36,320	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I wanted to talk to people
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:38,368	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	That's when things started to take off
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:42,464	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	By the time Billy was $24 becoming an entrepreneur
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:44,000	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	He was running his own business
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:50,400	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	What is a storage facility that he plan to convert into art spaces where we would have shows and maybe even a little small
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:51,168	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Record Shop
EDL	00:27:51,168	00:27:53,728	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Thousand a relationship we had a dog
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:59,360	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	He was a new band that toured it was fun I can say that for sure I could even conduct business out of
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:00,896	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	The bar down the street
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:03,712	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	If I wanted to cuz the business line forwarded to my cell
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:06,016	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	But he said that it was also around this time
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:07,808	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Have you started to wake up in the morning
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:08,832	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	With the shakes
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:09,600	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	But I remember
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:12,416	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Drinking beer in the morning in the bathroom
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:13,696	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	How much do you think you were drinking
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:16,512	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	20 drinks a day 25 sometimes
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:18,560	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	They usually the night before
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:19,584	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Before I
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:21,632	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Passed out or went to sleep
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:26,752	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I would say you know I'm going to turn it around in the morning I'm going to I'm going to get out of bed and workout eat a full meal
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:29,056	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And that never ended up happening
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:30,336	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	What eventually
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:31,360	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Did end up happening is that
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:32,896	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Billy s
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:34,944	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	For help both his mom and sister the
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:39,296	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Flew Billy up to Minnesota where he checked into one of the best rehab centers in the Midwest
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:40,832	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And when I got there looks like a
EDL	00:28:41,344	00:28:43,904	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Small college campus I mean is very serene
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:47,232	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Sort of peaceful setting very welcoming
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:50,304	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	He started going to group meetings started working out and was like
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:52,352	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Alright I was actually excited
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:54,400	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I thought that things would turn around when I got back
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:56,192	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	But
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:58,752	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Within just a day of being back in Cleveland
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:29:00,032	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And it was right back to where I was
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:02,848	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	20 drinks a day 25 sometimes
EDL	00:29:03,872	00:29:05,664	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	So I ended up back in treatment
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:11,296	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	We figured you know I just didn't do it right the first time so if we go back we'll get it right this time
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:11,808	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:13,344	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Once again
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:13,856	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	You know I
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:15,392	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Crash and Burn
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:17,184	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	This time not even in Cleveland
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:18,976	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I had realized at the airport
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:20,256	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Even make it to Cleveland
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:22,304	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And he said this is just how things went
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:30,496	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	It was just the same old story of In and Out In and Out in the span of about 4 years time Billy tree
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:36,896	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	7 different treatment centers detox centers lots of AA meetings I want 210 meetings in
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:40,992	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	70 days I went to 28 in one week one time nothing worked
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:46,368	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	He says there's a a sponsor's with tell him you can do this so get it right so we leave those meetings feeling positive
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:50,976	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Another liquor store I just consider myself a failure at this point of time that
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:52,512	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I was never going to get better
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:53,536	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And that led to
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:55,072	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	More more drinking
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:58,912	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	He said that he lost his girlfriend pretty much all his friends
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:00,448	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Got fired from his job
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:03,008	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Due to drinking and my day is just consisted of
EDL	00:30:03,776	00:30:05,056	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Walking to the liquor store
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:07,360	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Find 2/5 and walking home
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:08,896	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	That's all I did I just laid in bed
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:11,712	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And and drink tart even
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:12,736	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Think about
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:16,064	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Without being completely horrified that that's with
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:17,344	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	My life has turned into
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:18,880	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And then
EDL	00:30:18,880	00:30:23,488	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I woke up one day with severe severe pain in my abdomen and I couldn't move or walk
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:25,536	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Or keep water down
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:29,888	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And it was really scary and it was pancreatitis so I ended up
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:33,472	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Checking myself into Hospital in Grand Rapids and
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:37,056	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I saw these people and they said why we don't even we don't see
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:39,104	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	This condition until people are usually in there
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:40,384	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Mid-forties
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:42,944	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Billy was only 29 years old
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:46,272	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	When I got out I moved into a sober house
EDL	00:30:46,272	00:30:46,784	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	St Paul
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:49,600	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And that's what I got hooked up with
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:50,880	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	The Altier Clinic
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:56,512	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	No at the altar Clinic which I should say really quick is run by dr. Mark willenbring we talked to earlier
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:58,816	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Are there they do something that they call evidence-based treatment
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:01,632	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	So if a patient shows up looking for help
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:03,424	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	They are giving a therapist
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:08,544	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Did any underlying mental health conditions that they may have in for everything connected to their addiction
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:10,336	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	They're given medication
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:14,944	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Into his case they gave him when I took them out strike zone
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:17,760	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I actually was able to limit my drinking to
EDL	00:31:19,040	00:31:21,344	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	2 to 6 drinks a night which was
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:22,624	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Quite frankly
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:24,160	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Felt like
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:25,696	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	The normal amount to me
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:27,488	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	He's able to drink
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:28,768	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Yeah
EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:29,792	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Almost overnight
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:31,072	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I was blown away
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:33,888	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	That's all I wanted was to be like everyone else who can
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:35,936	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Write have a couple drinks in
EDL	00:31:36,448	00:31:39,776	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Set it down what does that tell you that tells you that you are
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:42,080	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Q word
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:44,128	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I just felt like there was
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:45,408	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	There is no compulsion
EDL	00:31:45,408	00:31:46,176	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Keep going and going
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:51,552	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	What was what was different than I did it did it not taste as good did it not as good
EDL	00:31:51,552	00:31:55,904	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I can say that for sure especially if it was a microbrew or something like that
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:31:56,416	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	But
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:31:59,744	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I didn't get that same brush in my head
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:02,048	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And being able to drink without
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:02,816	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	That Rush
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:04,352	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	For a while
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:05,120	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	That made all the difference
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:08,704	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Couple months I was okay you know now I can just have a couple
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:09,728	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	But
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:12,544	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	What happened was I
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:17,152	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Was taking it and then on one weekend I just decided
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:17,920	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	You know what
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:21,760	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	You know what I'm not going to take it this weekend it's a long weekend
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:24,064	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I don't need it
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:26,112	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Listen to even though the urge to drink
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:29,952	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Which was something that have been nagging at him for years even those that
EDL	00:32:29,952	00:32:33,280	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Was now gone he told me that there was just some part of him that
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:33,792	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Miss
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:35,328	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Being drunk
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:36,608	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	If I wanted to
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:38,400	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	B2B intoxicated
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:40,192	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Even with this medication that was
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:40,960	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Who's helping you
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:41,984	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	You missed it
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:48,128	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Yeah knowing all that it cost
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:48,640	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Askew
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:50,432	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	What about it did you miss
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:55,808	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I missed
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:58,880	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Feeling like myself
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:00,928	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I didn't I
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:05,024	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Hey guys this is for the engine I hate to interrupt but we have to
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:06,048	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	The studios
EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:06,560	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Is being blocked
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:08,608	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	10 minutes of sorry guys
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:11,680	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Poetically bad timing
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:12,960	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	We got
EDL	00:33:12,960	00:33:13,984	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	8 out of the studio
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:16,800	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And this was this was several months back actually
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:23,200	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And it took about another month and a half before we could all get back in the studio again Billy
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:24,992	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Well yeah yeah
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:27,808	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	So I started by asking him so
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:29,088	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	When you said that
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:31,136	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	You didn't feel like yourself what would that mean
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:32,160	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I didn't
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:37,280	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Picture life being possible without alcohol that's the only person that I knew
EDL	00:33:37,280	00:33:39,328	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And basically what he told me that if you
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:41,632	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Think back to the beginning of the story
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:42,656	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	He came out of his shell
EDL	00:33:43,168	00:33:47,520	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Alongside alcohol being creative writing music performing music
EDL	00:33:47,520	00:33:49,312	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Alcohol's are his verse
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:50,592	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Girlfriend alcohol
EDL	00:33:51,360	00:33:52,896	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	He's had drinking
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:53,920	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Associated
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:55,456	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Since puberty
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:57,504	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	With the best parts
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:33:58,272	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Themself
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:34:00,320	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Angelique you know how we all have this sense of
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:01,600	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Like who we are inside
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:04,416	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Again I have like giving your inner Jaguar like
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:07,488	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	People can think what they want about you and you got your Epic
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:08,256	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Mutation
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:11,072	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	So you you know who you are.
EDL	00:34:11,584	00:34:12,352	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Will his
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:13,632	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	It was all wrapped up
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:14,656	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And alcohol
EDL	00:34:14,656	00:34:17,216	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Do you take that alcohol away what was left was
EDL	00:34:17,728	00:34:19,776	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	An empty guy that I didn't know
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:20,288	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Justice
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:21,312	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Boyd
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:23,872	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And filling up that boy he says was this
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:25,920	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Onslaught of these
EDL	00:34:25,920	00:34:26,688	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Terrible memories
EDL	00:34:27,200	00:34:27,712	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Sequestered
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:29,760	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Detox words and
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:30,784	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Punitive treatment
EDL	00:34:31,808	00:34:33,600	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	All the people I've alienated
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:36,928	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Over the years all the Lost opportunities
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:39,232	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And all the failed attempt
EDL	00:34:39,744	00:34:42,304	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	He says that's what he would think about when he was sober
EDL	00:34:42,816	00:34:43,584	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And you just wanted not
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:49,216	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Last time we talked to Billy he was doing really well I had the job I had
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:50,752	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	The girl I had a band back
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:52,544	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	But he says that in the course
EDL	00:34:52,544	00:34:55,360	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I'm just as month-and-a-half since the last time we talked
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:57,920	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Elastigirl isolated want your friends and lost it
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:35:00,736	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Good job that I wanted to keep for a while
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:02,784	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Until I could get in the garage
EDL	00:35:02,784	00:35:03,296	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	It's cool so
EDL	00:35:04,064	00:35:05,344	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Kind of having to start over now
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:09,952	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Even just listening to your voice right now you sound so different
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:14,816	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I know that I sound different because I was I was coming in here with more than
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:17,376	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Positive spirit last time
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:21,216	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I really was flying high last time
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:27,616	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	People were excited for me to come in and now they're they said are you sure are you sure you want to come in today and talk to them
EDL	00:35:27,616	00:35:28,384	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I mean
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:29,664	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	The pit of people who
EDL	00:35:30,432	00:35:31,712	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Even talk to me right now
EDL	00:35:33,760	00:35:34,272	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	So
EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:36,576	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	It's hard to do a triple backflip
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:41,440	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Didn't want to come in here crying or anything but you know
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:45,024	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	It's pretty sad
EDL	00:35:45,024	00:35:46,304	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	It's pretty sad but
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:49,376	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	At the same time I mean I feel hopeful that I can beat this
EDL	00:35:52,704	00:35:57,568	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I believe still seeing a therapist he still going out here he's actually on this new medication out called
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:36:00,128	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Gabapentin what she says has been helpful
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:04,224	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And I know I was pretty staunchly against to the 12 Steps last time
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:05,760	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	But
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:07,040	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I am actually
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:08,576	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Going back to meetings
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:09,344	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	These days
EDL	00:36:12,416	00:36:14,208	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Just to be with people who are in the same boat
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:16,256	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Suicune buff
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:17,280	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Yeah
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:20,608	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I hear story like that and I say
EDL	00:36:22,144	00:36:25,216	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Yeah I think we're ready to see Addiction in the new way
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:29,568	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	And we're definitely I think pills will be a big part of that seems me
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:31,104	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	But
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:33,920	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	The pills can't get all the way down
EDL	00:36:33,920	00:36:34,688	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	You know
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:37,504	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Write the duck thing that makes addiction go is
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:38,272	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Really deep
EDL	00:36:38,272	00:36:39,552	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Retin A
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:45,696	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	This reminds me of when we were talking to Nora volkow spine and director of the National Institute of drug abuse at the NIH
EDL	00:36:46,464	00:36:47,232	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	She's at a point that is
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:53,888	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	The same idea in a really interesting way one of the questions that I've always got in my brain is
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:55,680	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Why do we become a
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:59,776	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Why is it that we can fall into a state where we actually
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:03,616	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Become obsessed about something and compulsive
EDL	00:37:03,616	00:37:05,408	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Despite the fact that
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:07,968	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	It can have negative consequences and
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:09,760	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Romantic love
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:11,808	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	He's exactly that situation
EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:13,344	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Nora said that one thing that biologists
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:14,368	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Snow in actually
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:15,904	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	I've known for a while is that
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:16,672	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Drugs
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:21,280	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Hijack systems in our brain that are there for other purposes
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:22,048	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	She says literally
EDL	00:37:22,560	00:37:25,120	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Drugs will light up the same circuit in your brain
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:27,424	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	That are usually engaged
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:28,448	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Take when you're in love
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:31,776	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	When you're hanging out with your friends when
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:33,312	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Now you're being hugged by your kid
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:38,176	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Since it's almost like randomness of chemistry that you have this chemical compounds
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:41,760	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	That can go directly and activities
EDL	00:37:41,760	00:37:43,040	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Dissenters
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:46,112	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	So it hijacks the very things that make us
EDL	00:37:46,112	00:37:46,880	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Casino
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:47,648	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Good friends
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:48,928	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Good parent
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:50,208	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Correct
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:51,744	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	It's like a weakness point of a
EDL	00:37:51,744	00:37:52,256	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	The strength
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:53,792	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	Yeah and actually
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:57,376	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	According to Andrews children so we talked to her earlier
EDL	00:37:58,400	00:38:00,960	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	People with addictions ironically
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:03,776	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	They're the fittest of the step in evolutionary terms right
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:10,176	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	They're the people who would have been earliest for the the food earliest for the sexual partner
EDL	00:38:10,176	00:38:11,712	| radiolab_podcast15thefix |	There's a deep down inside of them
