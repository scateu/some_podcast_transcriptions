EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:58,751	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	At the time named Richard Henry Pratt bagai shock of white hair

EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:02,335	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Gallantly quite gallantly in the Civil War
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:05,919	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And then he had actually served out west in Oklahoma territory
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:09,503	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	He had fought American Indians himself
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:11,295	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	It was after winning a lot of those fights
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:13,343	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Too many of those fights really
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:15,391	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	We're talking about 1870s now that Pratt
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:17,951	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	How to change your heart and he
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:19,999	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	He suddenly became concerned
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:24,095	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	About the very people you just been fighting the fact of the matter is that
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:26,911	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Indians weren't very very desperate situation
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:30,239	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Are the Bison we're almost there
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:32,543	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Extinct that they were being pushed onto reservations
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,079	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And population
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:35,871	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Fallen 2

EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:41,759	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Pratt and a lot of other
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:44,575	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Policymakers came to the conclusion that something had to happen
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:50,975	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Fast or Indians would literally become extinct they would in fact become
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:52,255	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The Vanishing race

EDL	00:05:57,631	00:06:01,471	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	His idea was started boarding school specifically for American Indian children
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:05,823	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	It was kind of a radical experiment children will be taken removed
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:07,359	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	For several years at a time
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:08,127	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	They would be
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:09,151	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Stripped of their
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:12,479	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	I was called her Savage Heritage and they would be civilized
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:15,039	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	IE they would be white attire
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:17,343	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	It was it was forcible assimilation
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:19,135	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Pratt head of a slogan
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:20,159	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Kill the Indian
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:20,927	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Save the man
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:23,743	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	That's Barbara Landis
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:24,255	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Probiotic
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:28,095	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Will one of the Carlyle to talk with her and her colleague Kara Curtis
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:31,423	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And they told us it Pratt basically made that pitch
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:32,191	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Save the man
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:38,079	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Not just to Congress by directly to American Indian families all over the country I want your son
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:41,151	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Is that my house isn't worth your children because
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:46,271	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	White people are going to keep coming and coming they want to settle in your lands they want to take your land
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:48,575	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And you need to learn how to
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:50,111	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Deal with these people
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:56,511	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	So we need to teach your children how to speak English to communicate with the white vans
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:59,327	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	When the white man comes and tries to get you to sign away the Black Hills
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:01,119	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	You won't fall for it again
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:02,911	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And it was a convincing argument

EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:18,783	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Joe lives near the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota East Lakota
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:21,087	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	He told us the story about his grandfather
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:23,135	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	I was a famous Lakota chief
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:27,743	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	In the 1890s is Grandpa's lead a delegation of American Indians to

EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:37,471	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And if he was down there but he's a lot of people down there just as his grandpa had this moment where he was just
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:38,495	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Standby how many white people
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:41,055	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	His face was there like ants
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:44,383	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Come to the area so
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:46,175	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	He had the idea of a
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:48,735	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Trying to send his kids to school so they can
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:52,831	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Intermingle or whatever
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:55,647	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Basically Joe says his grandpa just had this realization
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:56,159	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Recant
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:58,207	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	We can't go back
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:07:59,487	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Got to go forward
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:02,047	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And it seemed to him Carlisle
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:02,559	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Was the way for
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:08,191	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Who are we going now
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:11,519	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Baskets were admitted here's how it would work they would come in

EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:17,663	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Then they be given an Extreme Makeover
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:19,455	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Which would also be photographed
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:28,671	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	This is Tom torlino
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:34,047	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Barber showed us a picture of a Navajo kid looking maybe 18 years old today 1882
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:40,447	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	This is one of your ride so you he's got kind of dark-skinned high cheekbones hearing

EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:52,479	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And then I hear he is in a suit with clean cut hair the second picture his hair is very short not long
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:53,247	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	No blanket

EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:17,567	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	When she came back and she looks like a white woman to know she had that real tiny waist and
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:19,359	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Vomiting everything
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:20,639	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:22,431	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	You can speak Lakota
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:24,223	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	She forgot
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:24,735	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Haha
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:26,527	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	We just think about the
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:27,295	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Disrespect
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:34,463	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	We spoke with one guy oppressor Eric Anderson who teaches at Haskell is us apart Potawatomi just a mess
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:35,231	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Imagine the parents
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:37,791	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	First time they see their kid
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:41,119	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Kids parents are seeing their students marched around in
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:43,423	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Essentially the uniform
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:43,935	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Of
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:46,751	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	What had not
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:49,055	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Very long before for many of the tribes
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:49,567	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Ben
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:51,359	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The uniform of the enemy
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:53,663	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	At the very least
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:55,199	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	I think that would be
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:57,247	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Startling
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:09:59,551	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Did a case
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:02,623	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	According to Sally Jenkins after the kids were
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:04,159	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Cropped and redressed
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:05,439	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Brentwood running through a bunch of
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:08,767	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Drill sanding Carlisle was a little Military Academy
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:15,167	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And the Indian kids were so unhealthy at first they have been put on an unfamiliar diet they had been sleeping indoors
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:17,727	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	For the first time in their lives and a lot of them are getting sick
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:20,031	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Movie know that Hindi 39-year history
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:20,543	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The school
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:21,823	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	At least
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:23,359	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	200 kids died
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:24,639	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	A disease
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:26,431	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	4Health or even homes
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:28,223	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Hand soap
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:30,015	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Was constantly trying to get the kids outside
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:31,295	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:33,855	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	At a certain point he hired some teachers
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:35,903	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Sally thinks that one of those hires
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:38,207	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Probably one of the first dormitory Masters
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:40,767	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	This guy who had formerly taught at at Ivy Leagues
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:43,071	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	School he showed the Carlisle Indian kids
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:45,631	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	This game that the kids at Harbor playing
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:47,423	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Have you thought it would toughen him up
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:48,959	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	No it's but suddenly
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:51,007	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	They're playing football
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:55,359	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	No keep in mind this is at a point in 1882 where
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:56,895	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Football's barely a thing
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:58,687	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Not so many schools had teams
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:11:05,087	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	It wasn't such a thing as a head coach back then they were volunteer coaches who tended to be students or ex-students for the Carlisle
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:10,207	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Kids self-organized level the field start to play they even start to scrimmage some kids across town
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:11,743	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And it one of those games
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,279	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Call you Barbara
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:17,887	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Staci Matlock who is upon a student at Carlisle later became a Pawnee chief
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:19,423	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	He broke his leg
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:22,495	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Playing football in Pratt that's it
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:24,799	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Football
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:28,127	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Is in his mind he was trying to civilize these kids in football was doing the opposite
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:31,199	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	But
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:31,967	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Showtime later
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:38,367	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Set David Adams approximately three dozen Carlisle boys came into Pratt's office they said we want to play football
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:42,207	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Do you know what they said exactly we don't have
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:43,999	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	We don't have the exact words
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:45,535	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Buy Pratt says at one point
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:48,095	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	He says while they stood around my desk
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:52,447	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	I'm quoting here around my desk there black eyes intensely watching
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:58,335	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	This is the order gave practically all the arguments in favor
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:59,615	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	About contending
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:01,151	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	An outside football
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:02,687	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And ended up
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:04,991	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Requesting the removal of the Embargo
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:07,295	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	According to his Memoir Pratt was
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:12,159	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Bowled over by the eloquence and passion of the peel
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:12,927	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	So we said
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,975	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Okay you can play
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:17,023	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	If you do these two things what he says
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:18,047	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Never slept
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:21,119	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	People who are looking
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,191	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Okay
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:27,519	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And the other one was you have to beat the best teams in America
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:32,639	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And that early Point American football
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:33,663	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Team was yell
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:38,783	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Which brings us to October 24th 1896
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:42,623	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	It's a r off all day in New York New York
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:45,183	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Yes at the old Polo Grounds
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:51,327	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Apparently there was about four thousand people in the stands including a handful of newspaper men New York newspaper men
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:53,375	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Give me a big story
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:59,775	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	How did they publicize it what did they say
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:06,175	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	They represent specifically the Perfection of mod
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:10,015	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	American Life
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:16,927	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	On the other side
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:18,975	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The real Sun
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:25,375	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Origin playing the Redskins history and story of War developed
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:31,775	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	By education and if you read the newspaper stories are written as they're written in this kind of blood curdling
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:36,639	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Shot through with Indian cliches you know from the Redskins
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:43,039	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Right right Cody's David Adams in one paper
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:43,807	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Indian fashion
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:50,975	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	I mean try to put yourself in the shoes of a New Yorker in the early 1880s PR contact with an American Indian
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:51,999	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Was in a wild west show
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:53,023	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	It was theater
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:54,815	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And here comes a football game
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:14:00,191	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And all of these American Indian kids run onto the field and there's literally an instance
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:04,287	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	What are the first games with someone in the audience says will they look just like our boys
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:05,567	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Because of course
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:06,847	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	That's a pratt wanted
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:14,271	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Now one thing it was immediately clear to everyone in attendance when they saw the Carlyle players was that they were physically outmatched
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:16,575	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Dell Rapids
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:22,975	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Shaklee 20 lb Spider-Man impression going in as it'll be an absolute smear job
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:25,023	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	But they released the odds are heavily against them
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:25,535	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	But
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:31,423	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	3 minutes into the game
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:37,823	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	EBay big pile up
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:38,591	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Squirting out
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,407	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Carla guy picks it up
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:44,735	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And runs
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:47,039	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The entire length of the field 63 yards
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:52,927	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Scores a touchdown
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:53,439	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Now
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:15:00,095	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Nobody had scored on Yale and seven games they were Furious so what they do is they use their bulk
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:01,119	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	To slowly
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:02,655	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Push
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:04,959	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The pile down the field
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:06,495	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Twice
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:09,567	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	To take leave
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:10,847	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And with three minutes left
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:14,687	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Jealous up 12 to 6 Carlisle has the ball
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:21,855	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Carlisle running back charges the pile in gets clobbered falls backwards
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:25,951	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And just as he's about to hit the earth he laterals the ball
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:32,351	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	To a teammate who grabs it runs around the scrum the entire length of the field
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:38,751	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Carlisle scores a touchdown that would have tied the game
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:40,287	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	But
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:42,591	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Called back
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:44,383	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Bye
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:45,663	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	A referee
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:46,431	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Who was the Yale man
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:51,807	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Why the call was that the referee claimed that a whistle had blown
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:52,575	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The play dead
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:56,927	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Well they were they were Furious
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:58,719	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Yes there was bullying them
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:15:59,743	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And hooting
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:05,375	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Everyone knew it was a terrible miscarriage of Justice we're going to walk out of
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:06,399	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	We are leaving this game
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:08,191	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	But according to David
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:09,215	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	At the last moment
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:14,591	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Runs down from the stand coming onto the fields at Wayside ways I don't forget rule number one
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:16,895	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	A gentleman
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:18,431	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Pratt did not want
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:20,223	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	This game to end
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:20,991	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Because of
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:23,039	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Their tempers even though they've been wrong
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:24,831	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Bye-bye that call
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:26,111	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	So the Cowboys
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:26,623	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Finish the game
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:29,183	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And when they walk off the field
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:40,959	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	They get a standing ovation
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:43,775	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Carlisle wins incredible respect and renown
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:47,359	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	In the aftermath of the game in fact one of the newspaper men
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:49,663	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	After another Carlisle Yale game or something similar
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:56,575	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Wrote something to the effect of Carlisle could beat 11 yell men but they couldn't beat 11 Yale men and a Yale rep
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:59,135	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Yes
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:02,719	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	After the Yale game of 1896
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:03,487	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Pratt
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:05,023	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Is committed
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:10,655	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Pratt believes that it's the greatest thing that can happen to his school
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:15,007	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	It is an instant way to do what he's been struggling to do for 15
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:17,055	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Years at the Carlisle school which is to
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:18,335	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Prove the value
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:20,639	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Are these American Indian kids against their white peers
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:22,943	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	D'Abruzzo value or civilized
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:29,343	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	To civilize them but also to prove that given education and equal opportunity
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:30,879	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	They were the equal of there
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:33,439	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	How's their white peers
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:37,279	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	He was before all of his forcible assimilation methods which were
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:39,583	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Remain extremely cruel
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:40,863	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And destructive
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:43,167	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	I truly believed
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:45,727	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	In the concept of of racial equality
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:48,031	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The complicatedness
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:50,335	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Pratt ahold Carlisle idea
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:56,735	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Kep smacking ass in the face as we were putting the show together it mean on the one hand they were clearly students who felt
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:57,759	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The Carlyle was prison
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:17:59,551	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Is that Barbara Landis
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:03,135	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	When she took us on a tour of the grounds of the former
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:03,647	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Carlisle Indians
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:06,719	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	She said the kids will even set fire to the building
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:12,095	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	It's a yes M did burn down which is kind of typical on Indian campuses
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:15,423	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Fires in burning building why
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:19,263	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Int form of resistance
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:20,287	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	On the other hand
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:25,407	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	When will you start looking around for original archival recordings of
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:31,807	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	See the earliest Carlisle players pretty much the only recording me to find
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:33,087	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	If you're making it
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:36,927	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	With this oral history with a guy named
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:45,119	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Albert exendine in the early 70s
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:45,887	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Justice
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:48,447	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	B99
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:50,239	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	You are 15 years old
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:56,383	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Can't really play you too much of this cuz the audio quality is really bad but in the interview Brad comes up
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:57,407	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Stratosphere
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:03,295	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And xidan talks about them with a great deal of affection and gratitude
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:06,623	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Father of indian education
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:08,415	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Call the father of Indian education
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:17,887	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Man so he's a tough figure Pratt he's got very mixed Legacy I mean I like to say Pratt was his country
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:22,239	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Whatever you think of him he was his country
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:25,311	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Sookie sookie 1896 he gets
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:26,335	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The Berkeley
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:28,383	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	UCF football score PR yes
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:31,199	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	What happens next
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:34,271	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	He begins looking around for coaches full-time coaches
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:35,551	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Just to come in and coached
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:36,319	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The team
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:37,599	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And he whines up
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:40,159	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	With Cornell grad
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:42,463	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Name Pop Warner
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:47,071	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Glenn Pop Warner
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:50,143	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Is this part right here
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:52,191	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Just to give you a visual
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:58,591	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Kerasotes pictures
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:02,943	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	If Mike did go ahead Einstein's hair up Pops a little bit of a of an outlier
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:05,247	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	East Texas roads
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:07,039	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	He's a bit of a rogue
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:13,183	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Can be kind of vulgar party a little bit
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:16,767	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And that is exactly what he does in spectacular fashion
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:21,375	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	When you get to the Carlyle because Pop Warner looks at his Squad and he realizes that
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:24,959	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Sure they're fast they got heart but they're underweight and they're small
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:30,335	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Wasteful yeah well they might occasionally for Setai with it where they yell if they
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:31,103	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	You know
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:32,127	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Have killed themselves
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:33,407	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Physically
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:37,247	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	They weren't going to beat the ivy League's on any kind of consistent basis without
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:39,039	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Without doing something different
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:43,135	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And dumped it was a very fine line between innovation
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:43,903	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And cheating
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:46,975	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	In Pop Warner start 6
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:51,071	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Exploding that line absolutely as hard as he can
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:52,095	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And he comes up with
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:54,911	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The trick play
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:55,679	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	For example
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:59,519	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	1903 Pop Warner devices the hidden ball trick what was that
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:04,383	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The hidden ball trick is the quarterback takes the ball
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:06,431	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And actually
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:08,479	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Behind the Chute Parliament
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:11,551	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Tucks it under another guy's sweater
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:17,952	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	While the big pile of man is struggling in the mud in the center of the field not knowing quite where the football is but believing it's summer
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:24,352	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Summer in the middle of the pile there's this kid who squirts around the end but the football hidden under his jersey and he's 30 yards downfield beef
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:30,752	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Before anybody realizes it how does it keep the ball from falling out of his jersey
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:37,152	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The Jersey so that the ball would stay in there without falling out a cheating pocket native cheating
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:40,480	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Pocket without legal because I got to go together legitimate touchdown
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:42,016	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Was it legal you ask
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:44,320	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Pop Warner would have said
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:50,208	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	There was nothing in the rulebook against it another thing he does which actually worked brilliantly
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:50,976	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Is a
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:52,768	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Piso's
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:55,072	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Footballs on to the front of their
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:56,608	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Jerseys
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:22:03,008	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Switch for really bulky sweaters at the time he sews leather football-shaped patches onto the front of their jerseys
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:09,408	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	In order to try to disguise who's got the ball
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:10,176	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Sane
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:15,296	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Betches Bachelorette
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:16,832	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	But
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:17,600	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Harvard
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:24,000	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Did not take this line. Harvard retaliates by painting the footballs the same color as their
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:30,400	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Jersey's it's maroon everywhere so when they basically what you can't see
EDL	00:22:30,400	00:22:36,032	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	American football is essentially a rule-breaking experience
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:36,800	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	As opposed
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:37,568	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	British football
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:39,360	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Didn't have referees
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:42,176	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	At least initially a British football ran on the underside
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:43,712	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	But with American football
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:45,248	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The rest were there practice
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:47,808	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	In the beginning and she says it was largely a response
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:51,136	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The brutality the game but also to the kind of rule band
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:54,208	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	That you saw from Pop Warner in the coral island
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:58,304	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Everytime Pop Warner came up with an innovation the next year there was a rule against
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:02,144	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	So immediately I really would get together and pass a rule and say okay no more
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:07,520	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	NFL rulebook really virgins in an American football and it's thanks to Pop Warner
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:09,312	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Sleight of hand

EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:16,480	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The Carlisle Indians most soaring moment and I mean that literally
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:17,504	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Happened
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:19,808	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	At a moment when the game almost
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:20,576	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Disappeared

EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:22,528	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something

EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:28,672	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Maybe it was the moment that I
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:31,744	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	I kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:32,256	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Do you
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:34,816	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:38,912	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:43,776	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:46,336	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	We're interested in the
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:47,616	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Epic moments where
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:50,176	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Kid does something super smart
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:51,712	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	But it doesn't have anything to do with it

EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:23,712	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Is Radiolab and getting back to our story on the Carlisle Indian School and the
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:24,736	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Birth of the
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:26,528	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Football
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:31,904	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	What are the most important moments in the story I happens at a time when football it was right on the edge
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:33,184	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Spearing
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:36,768	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Timeout 1905
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:38,048	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	This was
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:40,864	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The most violent year in football
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:45,728	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	19 people died on the football 19
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:47,776	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	19
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:48,800	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	That's crazy
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:53,152	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Cuz what would happen is that Carla will try and do these things that are open up the game
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:58,016	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The iveys would consistently respond by making the game more about Brute Force more about violence
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:26:01,344	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And suddenly all the major programs
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:02,112	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	We're spooked
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:04,416	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Columbia polls
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:05,440	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Are there football team
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:09,792	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Harvard even think about doing that and so and this is kind of odd Into The Fray steps
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:11,584	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	President of the United States of America
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:12,608	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Teddy Roosevelt
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:15,680	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The conrad beijing
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:17,728	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	He's like football he like the
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:20,288	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The manly aspects of it's a tough aspects of it
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:21,824	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	But nobody like people dying
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:23,616	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And then there was his
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:24,640	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Skip gets his son
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:25,664	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	What's playing
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:27,968	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And and getting beat up pretty badly
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:28,736	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	As well
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:29,760	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Broke his nose
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:30,784	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Plated eyebrow
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:32,320	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The one game you got knocked out cold
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:34,880	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	So after the violence of 05
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:35,648	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The present
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:37,952	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Calls the president of all these colleges in Saint
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:39,232	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Washington
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:41,280	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And according to David Adams he basically tells
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:43,584	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	That the rules had to be Rewritten
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:44,352	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	It had it become
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:46,400	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	A little bit more safe at least
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:47,168	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Or it would be bad
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:49,984	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And out of that we see a couple of rules
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:53,568	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	First school to side in order to loosen up the
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:54,080	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The pile
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:56,128	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	They're going to
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:57,408	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Tinker with the
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:26:59,968	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Down yardage ratio
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:02,016	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	3 Downs of game 5 yards
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:03,040	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	3 Downs
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:04,576	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	10 yards
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:06,112	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Renounce
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:07,392	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Forward
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:08,160	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Couple years later
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:09,440	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	But the second rule
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:11,232	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Just may be the most important first
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:12,512	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Is for the first time
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:14,816	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	They legalize the ability
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:15,840	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	To move the ball
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:17,376	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Through
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:18,912	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Free-floating
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:21,472	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	It surrounds us all
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:26,592	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Okay where do we go to the next today soak if I could if I could place you in a moment
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:28,640	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Before this you'd like to hit
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:30,688	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	I believe
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:32,736	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	November 23rd 1907
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:37,088	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Yes the big moment K can you set the scene
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:42,208	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	From the standpoint of broader American history things have gone airborne
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:49,888	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	You mean Wilbur and Orville Wright 1960
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:59,616	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	There are aeronautical experiments happening really all over the world in France everyone is experimenting with line machines things
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:00,640	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Things are going up in the air
EDL	00:28:01,408	00:28:03,200	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	But not so fast with football because
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:08,320	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	When the rule committee had made that rule about for passing they'd also hedged a little bit saying
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:11,136	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	If you throw forward pass through receiver doesn't catch it
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:17,280	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	You are penalized 15 yards which back in the day with a monster amount so nobody threw the ball was too rich
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:22,656	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Back story goes as soon as that rule got passed Pop Warner goes back to his garage
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:24,704	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Show me the garage with a ball
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:28,800	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And he starts experimenting and what would be the most efficient way
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:30,080	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Costas
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:34,688	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	People have to understand that the footballs knows days are not the footballs we have today with the nice
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:38,016	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Oblate spheroid or whatever they call it
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:40,320	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	With a nice points and thinks he's a rugby ball
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:42,368	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Citic imagine that deflated basketball
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:44,928	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	They're thicker in the middle they're not as well shaped
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:47,488	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	They're really tough to get your hand on
EDL	00:28:47,488	00:28:48,512	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	It's all right
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:50,048	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And in 1906
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:55,680	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	In Albert exendine Zorro history we talked about this in 1906
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:58,752	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	He says called all the players together
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:29:01,312	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	He tells them
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:03,616	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	You would have to learn
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:07,712	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Carla ball
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:08,480	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Spiral the ball
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:11,808	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Cuz if you throw the ball in the spiral it gets
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:13,344	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	10 times less Air drag
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:15,648	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And if you throw it and over and plus it's easier
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:22,816	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	They start experimenting with it a little bit in in 1906 but they come out in 1907 as a throwing offense
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:24,352	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Which gets us to that game
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:31,776	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	November 23rd 1907 Carlyle place the University of Chicago last game of the season were in Chicago
EDL	00:29:31,776	00:29:36,640	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And the Chicago team is arguably the best in the nation V best
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:38,176	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Will Carlos good at this point though
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:39,456	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Yeah but Chicago

EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:45,344	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And they're 27000 people in the stands
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:51,744	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Well what happened was the Chicago players had decided to try to defeat Carlisle's innovative
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:55,072	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Forward passing by Justice
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:58,912	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Knocking the crap out of their receivers every time they came off the line of scrimmage
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:30:05,312	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Until Carlisle's greatest receiver Albert exendine our guy had been stymied the entire game because the minutes ball
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:07,360	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Snap Chicago players wood
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:10,688	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Hit him and try to throw him down or knocking out of bounds
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:12,736	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	So
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:17,088	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Pop Warner said the exendine here's what we're going to do next time they hit you out of bounds
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:19,904	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Sneak around the bench and get back on the field
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:23,232	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	By some accounts with X and idea but
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:25,024	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	On the next play
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:29,120	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	I would like to dine at expected ends up out of bounds
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:32,192	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	But it keeps running
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:36,800	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	He runs around the back of the bench spectators
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:38,848	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Maybe around the van and comes back on the field
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:40,384	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Reddit that moment
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:42,432	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Hauser the quarterback of Carlisle
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:47,296	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Lex Luthor vicious spiders

EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:54,720	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	This is Sally's description of that moment from her book the real All-American
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:58,560	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	For a moment it was a frozen scene in a stage drama
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:03,424	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The ball hung in the air a tantalizing possibility
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:04,960	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Could exendine reach it
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:05,728	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Woody catch it
EDL	00:31:06,240	00:31:09,312	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Or drop it Defenders will then stare down field
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:11,360	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Spectators watching from the stands
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:17,760	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Redhead died in their Collective throats the spiraling ball
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:18,784	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Defy physics
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:20,320	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	What made it stay up
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:21,856	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	When will it come down
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:25,184	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	In that long moment 27000 spectators
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:28,256	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Mashed together on benches and crammed on platforms
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:33,632	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	May have felt their loyalty to the home team evaporate in the grip of a powerful new emotion
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:36,704	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	I have noticed something they never had before
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:41,312	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Set a ball traveling through space traces of profoundly elegant path
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:43,616	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	They may have realized something else
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:45,920	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	That it was beautiful
EDL	00:31:52,832	00:31:54,368	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The ball struck is human target
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:57,184	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Action done caught the pass all alone
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:31:59,488	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And trotted over the Chicago line
EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:05,888	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The stadium exploded
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:12,032	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Sound in motion it was the game break it the rest was just anticlimax
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:18,688	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The final score was 18244 Carlisle
EDL	00:32:25,088	00:32:31,488	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	But very next year the ivy league pass is a rule that you can't leave the field and then come back on
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:34,048	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	That's what a real company
EDL	00:32:34,048	00:32:36,352	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Description of the ball in the air
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:38,912	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Is
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:40,448	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Timeless
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:43,520	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Anyway that's exactly why football is still beautiful
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:45,568	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	For the time that's that's that's when
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:49,920	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Carlisle in 1907 is when American football becomes to sport that you watched
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:54,784	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Oh wow this is
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:58,880	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	This is the fee can we get out
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:11,936	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	After we spent an entire day looking at pictures of
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:13,984	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	You know Albert exendine in
EDL	00:33:13,984	00:33:16,288	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Pride Pop Warner and doulas Lone Wolf

EDL	00:33:18,336	00:33:22,688	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Carlisle players Barbara and Carol took us to the field where they practice
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:24,736	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Answer this is the Carlyle
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:27,552	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Indian School football field
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:30,112	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Covered in snow
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:34,720	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	410 degrees out here really really bright sun coming off this now
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:36,256	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And sit empty
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:43,168	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	And we just kind of walked around and
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:44,960	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Try to imagine all the stuff
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:45,728	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	We just seen in photos
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:49,056	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	He was a little bit like walking among ghosts
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:51,872	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	That's the sound of the flag blowing in the back
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:08,256	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Understanding on that feel the end
EDL	00:34:09,024	00:34:09,536	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Having the
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:11,328	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Thought that I couldn't quite art

EDL	00:34:39,488	00:34:42,048	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Together there is a middle ground
EDL	00:34:42,560	00:34:44,608	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	Clearly it's more than a game
EDL	00:34:45,120	00:34:47,168	| radiolab_podcast18ghostsfootballpast |	The stakes are higher than that
