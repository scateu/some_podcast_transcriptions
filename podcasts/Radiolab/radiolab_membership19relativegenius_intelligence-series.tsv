EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:08,320	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I said I want you to find
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:09,344	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Einstein's brain
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:14,976	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And I thought what we like
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:19,839	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	That's exciting or you would like pretty cool
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:24,959	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I've been working on a piece about the psychology of the New Jersey driver

EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:45,183	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Going back years
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:48,255	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	That when Einstein died back in 1955
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:49,791	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Moments after his death
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:52,863	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Someone had literally stolen his brain
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:54,911	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And run
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:05:00,287	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Urban legend Einstein's brain is somewhere and you know that
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:03,103	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Now that the Russians have it and
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:08,735	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Clone Einstein
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:11,551	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	It literally said to me I want you to find Einstein
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:17,695	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	What did you know about Einstein at that point in his brain
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:19,487	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Street with no at Einstein
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:20,767	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Pine essential oil
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:27,167	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	This guy the funny hair relativity right whatever that was

EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:31,519	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	After a little bit of reading
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:32,031	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Is that
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,335	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	In the early 20th century
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:40,223	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Einstein pretty much rewrote the way that we thought the universe works
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:45,599	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Einstein brilliant physicist and theoretical mathematician
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:51,999	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	She said that mass is equivalent energy equals MC square light to the atomic bomb
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:58,399	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Devastation in time and space to bend
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:06:04,543	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Let's discover black holes and like a million other things being able to last on the total
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:07,615	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And it didn't take long before Einstein
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:14,271	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Just became a symbol do you think you're smarter than Einstein
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:26,047	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Einstein
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:35,007	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So that was Steve's assignment
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:38,079	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Find the brain of the guy
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:39,615	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Whose name basically means
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:43,711	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Then he said by the way this is going to be
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:45,759	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Are cover in August

EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:56,255	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The richest thing
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:58,303	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The library and
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:02,143	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So new that Einstein lived in Princeton
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:08,543	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Undine Princeton April 1955 so he headed over to the local public library

EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:15,455	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And he finds this article a couple days after Einstein die
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:19,039	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And it's at Einstein's brain be preserved for study
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,391	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And it talked about
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:25,951	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yeah there's going to be a study of Einstein's brain and
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:27,743	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yeah we are going to have a press conference
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:34,655	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So he pulls up the next day's paper and King will be a big front-page story about this press conference
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:36,703	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Cricket's nothing
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:37,983	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	There was no press conf

EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:48,479	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I went through all sorts of

EDL	00:07:58,463	00:07:59,999	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	That was the last thing written
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:01,535	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	About Einstein's brain
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,863	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But there was one clue
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:06,143	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And that little newspaper article
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:08,703	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	A name
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:13,055	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The name of the guy who was supposed to hold that press conference
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:13,567	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The Never
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:15,103	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Dr. Thomas Harvey
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,687	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Who it seemed
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:22,015	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	In addition to being the guy who didn't hold that press conference
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:26,111	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Was also the pathologist who would have done the autopsy on Einstein
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:38,911	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So the next step on Steve search hospital and we're supposedly this Harvey
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:40,703	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	At work. And I went there I found
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:41,983	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	What's the vice president
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:45,055	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I asked him about the phone with you
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:46,591	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Sky dr. Thomas Harvey
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:47,871	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Where is dr. Harvey
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:50,431	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Hospital guy says he left you a long time ago
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:56,063	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Venti Pike what about the brain I heard the brain got taken is it here at the hospital need to know anything I put talk to talk to Harvey
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:58,623	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So what do you do to find Harvey
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:01,439	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So when I was looking for a person
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,975	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	In 1978 there's no Google
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:05,791	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yeah there's no Facebook there's no LinkedIn
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:09,631	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So and there's a lot of
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:10,399	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Places
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:13,727	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Bata city is in every city
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:16,031	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Phone book
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:16,799	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:17,567	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	You been looking every phone
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:20,127	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yeah I eventually figured
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:22,687	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	One place I might go is the American medic
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:27,295	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Figured this guy Harvey was a doctor maybe they have his contact info
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:28,575	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So I called them up
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:30,111	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I'm trying to find this
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:31,135	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Thomas Harvey
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:33,695	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Thomas S Harvey I know his middle name
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:37,023	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And this very kindly woman
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:38,303	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Look up stuff
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:40,095	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	M
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:42,399	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Then told me there is a Thomas S Harvey
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:43,423	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	In Wichita Kansas
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:49,567	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So he calls directory assistance in Wichita says you guys have a number for a Thomas Harvey
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:50,591	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	They said yes
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:52,127	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yes
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:52,895	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Is that number listed
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:54,687	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I said yes
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:55,711	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Make a bee
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:56,479	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	His phone number
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:59,551	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And I took a deep breath and dial the phone number
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,343	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Back then
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:02,879	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Someone wasn't there
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:04,671	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	It was raining in rain
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:05,695	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Hang up
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:06,207	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	That would be at
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:09,535	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Buddy pick up phone
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:10,559	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:11,583	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Isaiah
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:12,095	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Is this
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:14,399	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Eye doctor Harvey ND
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:15,679	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yes and I said disaster
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:19,263	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Dr. Harvey who worked at Princeton Hospital
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:21,311	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	In 1950
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:21,823	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	85
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:23,615	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I never said
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,127	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Pause
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:31,807	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I figured
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:37,695	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Is a yes or no question right either supposed like he was almost debating
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:39,231	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Weather today
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:44,607	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And finally said yes
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:49,727	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The retrospect maybe was little The Jig Is Up
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:52,799	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:54,591	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He said why don't know if I can help you
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:56,127	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:59,199	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I said well I just like to talk to you
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:00,479	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Well
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:02,015	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And he was sort of
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:07,903	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Not saying yes or no I'm coming out there to talk
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:14,047	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So I booked a ticket for
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:15,327	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Wichita Kansas
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:17,887	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Department of Labor Kansas
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,423	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He spends the night
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:23,519	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And then the next morning he wakes up get the cab and goes over to Harvey's lab
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:25,055	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Ring the bell or whatever
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,847	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And dr. Harvey
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:28,895	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Came to open the door for

EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:07,807	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And I sat down and we talked
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:11,135	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Now at this point Harvey hadn't admitted to anything
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:12,159	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But Steve had a feeling
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:14,463	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	A definite feeling
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:17,023	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yeah you can tell he's very cautious Right Guard
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:20,095	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Asking every way to try to figure out
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:20,863	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Where's the brain.
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:23,167	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	A few times
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:24,191	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yeah where's the brain
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:26,239	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And he really want to answer that
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:31,103	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Pictures of it and then he should have broke down
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:31,871	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	When I guess
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:33,151	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yakame because he
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:34,175	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Because I was so fun
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:35,455	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Frustrated

EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:15,807	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	In this episode
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:18,879	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	We're going to try to untangle Batman
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:21,695	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Manifestation
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:22,975	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	X15
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:28,095	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	What can the brain of one of the greatest Geniuses that Humanity has ever produced
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:30,143	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Unfamiliar concept
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:33,727	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Intelius
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:39,103	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Well I'm just going to say for the record that I think that's silly
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:46,271	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And I think that brain is a whole it is though
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:52,671	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I do not but I am going to bring my exam
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:58,047	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I would just like to declare my bias I don't think there is anything special about his brain
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:15:01,631	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Anything not even I mean you think he was brilliant
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:04,959	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	There's something about the idea that is genius is
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:08,031	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Tied to the physical structure of his brain that makes me
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:09,055	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Itchy
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:12,639	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Literally as physical sensation I have I start to itch
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:15,967	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yeah I think you're dismissing it too soon I think there's more to it
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:16,991	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Then
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:18,015	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Eustace bagge
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:21,087	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Alright let me ask you more basic
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:23,903	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	What's the what's the fellas name again
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:25,183	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Thomas Harvey
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:27,231	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	How did he end up with that brain to begin with
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:27,999	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Well
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:29,791	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	You know
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:35,935	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Dictate to answer your question this is dr. Fred Lepore he's a neurologist
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:37,471	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Book about Einstein
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:40,543	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	It only people talk to you to answer that very question
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:43,871	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And he says you got to go back to the winter of 1950
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:47,967	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Einstein was living on borrowed time 76 years old
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:49,759	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Retired living in Princeton
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:50,271	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And get sick
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:53,087	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Start feel this pain in his abdomen
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:55,903	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	It was almost like a gallbladder attack
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:57,951	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Turned out to be way worse than that
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:59,487	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Ultimately
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:01,023	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	An abdominal aortic aneurysm
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:04,095	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Franklin who was a neurosurgeon
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:06,655	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Surgeon at Cornell came down ready to operate
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:09,471	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But I sign basically said look I am you know
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:14,847	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	My time is up I I will die I think he's I will die Allegan
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:17,919	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He knew he was and that was a brave thing to say because he was in pain
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:20,991	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Eventually in the spring of 1955
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:25,599	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Einstein under the hospital Friday died this morning after refusing surgery
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:28,159	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Wechat turned off would not have helped him recover from a ruptured artery
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:34,047	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	As the story goes in the early morning hours of April 18th murdered a couple of in comprehensible words
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:37,119	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Incomprehensible to his nurse who didn't speak German
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:38,655	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And then
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:39,935	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	In the early morning hours
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:40,447	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Just found dead
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:47,615	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Note on Harvey our guy was the chief pathologist at Princeton.
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:49,407	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	His job was to do autopsy
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:50,943	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And that night
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:52,735	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	April 18th 1955
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:53,503	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He's at home
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:54,527	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Sleeping
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:55,551	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:56,831	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	You get the call
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:17:03,231	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yeah I think the phone call came sometime before Dawn and it was Einstein's personal
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:03,999	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Mission
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:06,047	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Who called him to let him know
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:11,423	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The Einstein's son had given permission for an autopsy to be performed on his father
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:15,263	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	This is Carolyn Abraham science journalist author of
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:16,543	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Possessing genius
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:19,359	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The story of the bizarre Odyssey of Einstein's brain
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:22,175	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Hardy actually died in 2007
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:24,735	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But before he did Carolyn spend some time with him
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:27,295	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And got his take on that day
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:29,855	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He gets himself ready and
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:32,159	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He remembered it was a really nice morning
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:39,583	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	A spring was in the air and your things were turning green and he was walking towards what
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:45,727	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He realized was going to be a major opportunity in his professional life
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:52,895	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He got to that hospital and he got to his Pathology lab and someone that morning
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:56,735	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Had already placed Einstein on the autopsy table
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:00,575	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	She says he walked into the room
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:02,111	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Einstein playing there
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:03,903	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Flat on the table
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:10,303	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Picked up a scalpel now he open the abdomen and he saw it was full of blood from the aneurysm so he establishes cause
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:11,071	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Cause of death
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:13,631	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Did a routine examination of the heart
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:15,423	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Then he did something that was not in the script
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:17,983	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He remove the top of the skull
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:19,775	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Cut a bunch of cranial nerves
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:20,287	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And arteries
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:21,823	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And he took the brain out
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:23,615	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And then you put the brain
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:24,639	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	In a jar
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:25,919	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	End
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:27,711	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Walked out
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:29,759	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So he literally just
EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:31,295	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Stole the brain out of
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:32,319	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Einstein skull
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:33,087	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Just stole it
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:33,599	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yeah
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:35,135	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Which is
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:35,903	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Pretty gross
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:37,439	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	It's not a crime
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:41,279	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Probably history has not been kind to Thomas as Harvey
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:43,071	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But in Tom Harvey
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:47,167	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Estimation and he actually put it this way in our conversations once
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:49,215	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	As that he would have felt ashamed
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:50,751	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	If he didn't take it
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:54,847	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	She's not here was ashamed because here was this opportunity
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:56,383	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	To learn
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:19:03,295	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Something about sort of the biological underpinnings of intelligence of Genius onofre
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:08,671	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	From arguably we are certainly one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century and
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:10,975	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	To not study it would have been
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:12,255	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Negligent
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:18,143	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Courtney Carolyn however misguided it might seem Harvey says he wasn't taking the brain from South
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:20,191	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	You taking it for
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:20,703	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	All of us
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:21,983	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Bike for Humanity
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:23,519	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	First time
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:24,287	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:29,407	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Best work the next day the family at this point or read on the front page of the April 19th New York
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:31,199	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	55 New York Times read that
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:33,759	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The brain was preserved for science
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:35,551	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And they were flabbergasted
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:38,879	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Timeout heard of it
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:40,671	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yeah in the paper
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:44,767	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Find out
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:50,399	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yep the family didn't know and didn't give permission the understanding although you'll find none of this in the will
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:52,191	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But the understanding was
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:55,007	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Einstein would be cremated and his
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:20:01,151	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Ashes scattered in a secret location so that quote-unquote no one could come and worship at my bones
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:04,735	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He was the first scientist
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:06,015	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Become a public figure
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:07,295	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Electra
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:08,063	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Camden ar time
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:11,135	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Ice cream is always very uncomfortable with
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:14,463	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The attention that celebrity brought with
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:21,375	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He was really afraid that people are going to start to see him as something superhuman
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:21,887	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	True science
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:23,167	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Its power
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:25,471	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I linked with Einsteins image
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:30,591	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	It speaks to the fact that in the twentieth century science sort of displaced religion
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:31,871	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	As
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:32,383	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	What
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:34,175	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	People put their face in
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:36,991	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And he was going to start of its high priest
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:39,039	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And so he didn't want his grave site
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:41,855	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	2B, shrine
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:44,671	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	That's why you wanted to be cremated as he was
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:45,951	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	On April
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:46,719	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	18th
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:48,511	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But Harvey kept the brain
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:54,655	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So the family went they saw the headline do they do they knock on Harvey's door and I want to say what the hell
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:58,495	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	No they found the hospital they phone Princeton hospital and they're very upset
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:21:00,031	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Eventually
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:01,311	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Hans Albert
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:02,847	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Einstein Galveston
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:04,639	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Get on the phone with
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:05,151	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Tom Hardy
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:11,039	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Now we don't know exactly what they said to each other
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:12,831	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	You probably imagined Hans Albert was
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:15,391	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	That probably be yelled at Tom Harvey
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:20,000	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Tom Harvey apparently apologized for taking it without permission Dad finally
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:22,048	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Harvey makes
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:23,072	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The picture of his wife
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:30,752	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He says you know this isn't you know the mind for all the ages we're never going to get this opportunity again and I pledged that
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:34,848	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I will do a scholarly study made this very solemn vow
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:39,968	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	To take care of this brain to not allow it to become sort of an object of
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:46,112	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Fascination Tom Hardy told Hans Albert he'd never let the brain become a spectacle he honor Einstein
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:48,672	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Adjust Adidas brain
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:53,536	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	It might reveal something The Secret of human genius and creativity
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:55,840	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	You can't pass it up
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:21:59,680	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And the Sun
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:00,960	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Honda Robertson
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:03,008	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	You can study at
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:06,080	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But only as long as it's serious science
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:07,104	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	No spec
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:09,408	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So the next step that Harvey has
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:13,760	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He's trying to craft a kind of a do-it-yourself
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:17,600	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Approach to studying a famous brain even though he's a doctor
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:18,624	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Carby's not trained in
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:24,768	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	In an in this kind of neuropathology he learned some but not to the degree that especially
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:25,792	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	What's the weather
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:28,352	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Spends evenings taking photographs
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:34,752	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He weighs that he measures it hit some standard textbooks different reference guides one of the really interesting things he did
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:38,336	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Did during this. He brought this artist into
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:40,640	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Paint a portrait of Einstein's brain
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:46,272	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	We really went when it was whole he said he just wanted to have it and he never did hang that
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:47,808	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	That painting really
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:54,208	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	One-time thing thing to do I think partly it was because he knew what Pat to happen next door and he
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:56,768	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	His estimation what he was going to do next
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:59,584	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He's going to cut the brain into 240SX
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:10,336	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And after that he goes across the Delaware George Washington or something to University of
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:15,200	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Pennsylvania where there's a technician who had worked with gave her some of those jumps of rain
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:17,504	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And she's like family
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:19,040	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Into microscope slides
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:20,064	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Cinema 12
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:26,464	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Smoke Clears and I'm sorry
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:31,328	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Untold 12 sets of at least 200 slides per set
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:34,144	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And his job for the next few years
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:37,984	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Is the try to take it individually to various
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:41,056	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Neuropathologist who might be able to study this brain
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:47,200	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So I resend that slide
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:53,344	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Photos and samples of Einstein's brain he was trying to collaborate with experts in the field
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:55,904	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Specialist we don't exactly know
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:59,488	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	How many photographs he gave out how many slides who he gave them to
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:00,768	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	There's a lot
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:08,960	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Despite all the effort though there's no record of them ever getting back to him or doing anything of
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:09,728	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Importance
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:16,896	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	From the few scientists I was able to contact at that time who received those pieces
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:17,920	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	If you were still alive
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:20,480	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	They said they didn't really know what they should be looking for
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:22,528	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Which of course was
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:23,040	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	True
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:30,208	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	This is where Tom Harvey ran into the reality of
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:36,352	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	You know neuroscience at that time everything
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:38,912	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	As a complex beginning in our brain
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:42,752	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	At that point I just figure out
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:45,568	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	What neurons do are the communicate back and forth
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:48,128	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Brain alone has 10000
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:55,296	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	They hadn't even scratch the surface of absurd of the understanding
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:58,624	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	A normal brain let alone trying to
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:25:01,184	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Solve the mystery of genius and Einstein's brain
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:03,232	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So years and years go by
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:04,768	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	End
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:05,536	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Nothing
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:06,816	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But now we wouldn't give up
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:13,728	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He knew it was of significance he thought there was something that could be learned and he never abandon that and I think at this point
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:18,080	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Harvey began to see himself as kind of a living time capsule
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:26,272	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He was going to take this brain with him into the future when science
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:28,320	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Would be equipped to study of properly
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:31,904	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:32,672	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	In the meantime
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:37,024	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Arby's life falls apart
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:39,840	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Affair
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:40,608	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He got divorced
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:46,752	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He loses his job at Princeton
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:47,520	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yeah he does
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:54,688	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	That is until 1978
EDL	00:25:55,456	00:25:57,760	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	When a young reporter from New Jersey
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:25:58,784	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Knock on his door
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:25:59,808	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Asking about it
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:05,696	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Turn airplane home when did you call your editor or something on your way the first thing I did
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:07,488	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I went straight to my
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:08,000	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Etter's house
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:10,304	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And he was like
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:11,072	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Watching a basketball
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:13,120	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	We watched a little of basketball
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:15,936	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And without saying anyway
EDL	00:26:16,960	00:26:18,240	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And finally said he will
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:19,264	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Joe find a brain
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:28,480	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	That's what you tell him that's like you would hold it for halftime virus
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:31,552	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Was it I had to write it
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:35,136	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	We got a great image for the cover
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:36,928	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Cuddling with my search for Einstein's brain
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:38,720	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And then
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:40,768	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	One of the people who got the press release
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:41,792	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	This was
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:44,352	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So in the story came out
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:46,400	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Baby rattlesnake
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:48,192	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And
EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:53,568	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	It was in every newspaper in the country
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:56,896	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Johnny Carson made a joke
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:26:59,200	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Oh really
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:27:01,760	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	If you remember you about the brain
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:03,552	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Did they really Einstein's brain
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:06,368	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	What is one of the guy to Wichita come like that
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:11,232	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yeah and
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:12,000	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Dr. Harvey
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:14,048	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Have people camped out in this lawn
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:16,352	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Really drive everyone out
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:17,888	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	It was
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:18,656	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	You have a lot of it
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:20,704	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The Einstein estate
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:21,728	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Went bonkers
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:25,824	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I mean this is exactly what they didn't want to happen
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:29,920	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	People keep calling they were cash offers for the brain
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:34,528	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	People all over the place started to write to him to volunteer to become its next
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:36,832	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Keeper in the offer to money
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:38,880	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So not only did Harvey
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:41,696	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Fail to come up with any science about the brain
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:44,512	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	BFF broke that promise you made to the family
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:57,568	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Because of all the attention
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:27:59,616	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	At least on the science side
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:00,384	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	His luck
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:04,736	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Kind of changed one place to pick up the story was Science magazine
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:07,552	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	By the late 70s
EDL	00:28:07,552	00:28:13,696	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Neuroscience had picked up a woman
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:15,744	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Two new techniques
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:17,536	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Exploring brains
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:18,560	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Have been developed
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:21,888	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	For example we figured out there were opioid receptors in the brain
EDL	00:28:22,400	00:28:27,264	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Millions of these sensory receptors and had developed a treatment for Parkinson's
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:30,592	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Soap scientist at this point we're just slightly more equipped
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:32,896	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And Wednesday story came out
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:34,176	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Actually kicked off
EDL	00:28:34,176	00:28:35,712	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Real research
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:37,248	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Into Einstein's brain
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:40,064	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Bed directly flowed from my making it
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:41,600	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So what happened
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:44,416	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So the first thing that happens
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:46,208	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Is he got the call from this
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:48,768	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Scientist names
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:51,328	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	My name is Marian diamond. Diamond
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:52,864	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	That's a good name
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:54,144	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Brightening
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:29:00,544	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Choose a professor of anatomy at Berkeley on campus
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:01,568	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Carrying a box
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:03,616	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	She got excited coming to class

EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:11,040	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I never seen a human brain before freshman Anatomy lecture in front of all these
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:17,440	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Skip by bring a hat box onto the table and open it is like a flower print half buck
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:21,024	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Turn it up and pull out this brain cyst Mass only weighs

EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:24,864	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And yet it has the capacity
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:26,400	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	To conceive

EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:30,752	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	A billion light years
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:31,520	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Across
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:34,336	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Some people call her one of the founders of modern neuroscience
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:35,616	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Isn't that phenomenal
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:36,896	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Alaska
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:37,664	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The protoplasm
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:38,432	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Do that
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:40,224	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So she did these studies on rats
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:41,504	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Which became very famous
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:45,856	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Where she figured out that if you like put a rat in an enriched
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:48,160	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Environment sowa cage with like a lot
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:54,560	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Toys things to climb around on and lots of other rat friends to hang out with instead of just putting them in like the boring
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:55,840	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Normal cage
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:56,864	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	What you'll find
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:29:58,144	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Is that their brains
EDL	00:29:58,656	00:29:59,424	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Actually
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:03,008	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Change. More of these little cells called glial cells switch
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:07,104	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	For a long time people thought glial cells were just like
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:12,992	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The scaffolding of the brain like neurons where the action was that throughout the thinking happened
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:14,528	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And glial cells were just like
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:16,064	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	You know the
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:17,088	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	This dis
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:18,112	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Studs and mortar of the
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:19,904	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Houston that I'm holding everything
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:20,416	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Together
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:26,304	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But around this time when Marian Diamond was doing the studies are starting to realize that the
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:27,584	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Glial cells
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:30,656	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Also had neurotransmitters flowing through them
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:32,960	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Like that they might be more important than we thought
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:35,520	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But shortly after she publishes her rat
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:36,032	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Studies
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:37,056	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	She
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:38,848	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Here's about Harvey
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:45,248	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	She saw you know a little piece about it in the journal science and so she started to track down Harvey and she call
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:49,088	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Call Tim in 1984 Harvey Center for chunks of brain
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:52,416	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	She went looking and Einstein's brain to see if there was
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:56,000	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	You know something similar to what she had been recording in her animal
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:59,840	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Experiments and she finds that compared to the average brain
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:01,376	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Einstein had a lot
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:02,400	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Of glial cells
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:03,424	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	What's what's a lot
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:04,960	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I like twice as many three times as many
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:07,776	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	What about 70% more than the control group
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:08,800	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But what does that even mean
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:10,336	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I don't
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:14,688	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Really know how to describe that which is part of the problem and on top of that
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:16,480	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	After she published This research
EDL	00:31:16,480	00:31:18,272	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Some other scientists race
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:22,368	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Questions that maybe the experimental methods were invalid
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:24,160	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Stove
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:25,696	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Not convinced yeah me neither
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:27,488	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So that diamond
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:28,256	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Diamond
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:34,656	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So after Diamond then describe Britt Anderson comes along and his whole thing he studied five other
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:35,680	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Adult male
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:36,704	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Dead brands
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:39,264	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He looked at their prefrontal cortex has
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:45,664	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And that's like where higher cognitive abilities are located so like if you're going to take a test that's the part of your brain is going to be active
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:52,064	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Cheated and he found that compared to the other brands that he had the neurons and Einstein's brain were more
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:52,832	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Tightly packed
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:56,416	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	To his neurons were more tightly packed
EDL	00:31:56,928	00:31:57,440	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	In a certain part of a
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:32:01,536	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yeah three of more neurons that part or less neurons
EDL	00:32:01,536	00:32:02,816	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Same number roughly
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:04,352	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	They're just more crowded together
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:05,120	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	What is that
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:07,424	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Say I kind of take that as like
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:09,728	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Einstein problem-solving abilities
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:12,032	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Could go much more quickly and efficiently
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:16,384	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yeah actually pretty Anderson the guy who found this
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:21,504	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He dismisses himself and he found a difference but he also was quick to say like
EDL	00:32:21,504	00:32:23,296	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	We just have one of these brands
EDL	00:32:23,296	00:32:24,832	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He said listen you know I
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:26,624	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	It was always going to be a
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:32,512	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	An NF1 in any experiment you kind of like the middle child of all these researchers you made like the smallest
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:33,024	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Splash
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:35,584	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	It is through Britt Anderson
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:41,984	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	That Tom Harvey hears about Sandra Wilson in Canada and that was like the biggest splash of them all really yes
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:46,592	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Sandra Mendelson in the fall of 1995 she ends up getting this back
EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:48,384	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	A one-page fax
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:53,760	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	From a man by the name of Thomas Harvey and the back basically says hey
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:54,784	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Heard about your research
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:33:01,184	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Would you like to study the brain of Albert Einstein it almost seems like you were suspected to be a prank
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:03,744	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Just being mad
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:09,120	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Exactly but you know obviously she faxed back yes and so
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:12,704	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Harvey hop in the car with the brain brains in the trunk actually
EDL	00:33:12,704	00:33:16,800	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And drives North to bring to bring the brain to Canada
EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:20,896	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And the reason he was so excited to have her look at the brain what had really
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:24,736	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Caught his attention was the fact that she had this collection of normal brains
EDL	00:33:24,736	00:33:27,808	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	She's been doing this long term before and after study
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:34,208	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So years before she died. In this group together basically like they signed up they took IQ tests they did all these things while they were still alive
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:34,720	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Live
EDL	00:33:36,256	00:33:39,584	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Stream and then when they died she got to study their brains to see like
EDL	00:33:39,584	00:33:41,888	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	A before-and-after picture of these people's brains
EDL	00:33:41,888	00:33:44,960	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Willie. Smart people so she had a mix
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:48,544	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But the ones that she compared Einstein's brain to wear all high IQ men
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:51,360	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So she makes this comparison
EDL	00:33:51,360	00:33:54,432	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Einstein brain vs these other brains in her collection
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:56,736	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And she write this article
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:33:57,760	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Of the article
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:34:04,672	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Was that he had unusual parietal lobes usual Primal low Bridal lobes of Einsteins
EDL	00:34:04,672	00:34:05,952	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Brain for anatomically
EDL	00:34:06,720	00:34:08,000	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Exceptional if you will
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:09,536	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Where is the parietal lobes again
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:14,144	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Can I wear your baseball cap is like mainly
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:17,216	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The back or if you had animal exactly
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:21,824	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And this area of your brain this is where all of your sensory information comes in
EDL	00:34:22,336	00:34:28,736	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And because of that is also where your visual spatial awareness is located so like the way that you
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:30,528	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	You Orient yourself in the world is
EDL	00:34:30,528	00:34:33,088	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Bug mostly located in that part of your brain
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:35,648	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Like if you were to close your eyes right now and you think
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:36,416	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Where my hands
EDL	00:34:36,928	00:34:38,208	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Where are my knees
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:38,720	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	For my feet
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:44,608	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Well you have an internal mental map that's telling you where those things are and that's your parietal lobe doing that
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:46,144	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Anyhow
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:52,544	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So what was different about this part of Einstein's brain is that if you imagine the brains look like a walnut which is kind of the only way.
EDL	00:34:52,544	00:34:53,568	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I imagine the brain
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:56,128	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	There are like all these grooves and crevices
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:35:02,016	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And there's this one Groove like a groovy groovy like a deeper crevice called the Sylvian fissure
EDL	00:35:02,528	00:35:05,856	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	In Einstein's brain it was shorter than the rest of ours
EDL	00:35:05,856	00:35:12,000	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And apparently that's very strange when she described it to me she said it was enough to see this unique pattern in Einstein's brain
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:14,560	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Was a striking as
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:15,328	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Seeing a face
EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:16,608	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	With
EDL	00:35:16,608	00:35:18,400	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The eyebrows beneath the eyes
EDL	00:35:18,912	00:35:23,776	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And Sandra Wilson proposed that maybe because this crevice was a little bit shorter
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:26,848	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The electricity in this part of his brain could go much more quickly
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:30,944	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	How to travel around in half
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:32,992	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I could just go
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:36,320	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So speculative
EDL	00:35:36,320	00:35:39,904	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yes and so she was saying like the parietal lobe like this is where
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:41,440	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	His genius might be

EDL	00:35:51,168	00:35:53,472	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	In his head I mean just like the idea that
EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:55,264	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	SpaceTime is
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:35:59,104	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Curved so he has is kind of great visuospatial
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:36:02,432	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	If you had to pick a part of your brain that could

EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:11,648	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Looking at these papers you see Thomas Harvey's name is like the co-author
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:12,928	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He was a coop
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:18,304	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yeah he's like cited in the paper made my heart Happy like you made it
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:23,168	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Especially for Sandra Wilson because he all these years have been like shepherding this forward
EDL	00:36:23,680	00:36:25,216	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And when that paper came out I think
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:26,752	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Tom Harvey felt
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:28,288	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Then that
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:29,056	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	That his work
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:32,640	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Was over cuz he felt at that point it did they hit
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:36,992	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Pointed to something that was real at Ruby felt like finally
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:39,552	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The work that he promised to do in the very beginning
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:40,832	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Was finally done
EDL	00:36:40,832	00:36:41,856	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And at that point
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:44,672	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He actually decided to give the brain
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:45,184	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Back

EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:56,704	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He did when he first took that rain in 1955
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:36:58,496	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	You know it
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:36:59,264	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Some
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:02,080	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	It's kind of uncanny that it's back where it was
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:02,848	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yeah
EDL	00:37:04,128	00:37:05,152	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I'm going to rain on this parade
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:07,968	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I'm happy for mr. Harvey
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:08,992	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:10,784	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	In terms of the science
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:13,344	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	You convinced me a little bit
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:15,136	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Comedian bit
EDL	00:37:15,136	00:37:17,440	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But still kind of smells like phrenology to me
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:21,792	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I mean it's like I'm listening to it that the experience I have is like
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:23,840	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Sylvian fissure
EDL	00:37:26,400	00:37:27,168	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And then I think to myself
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:29,216	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Is a Sylvian fissure
EDL	00:37:29,216	00:37:35,616	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I don't even know what that is like the fact that like we so clearly default to this fascination with a thing that I don't think
EDL	00:37:35,616	00:37:36,640	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Can you explain it
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:37,920	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	It just kind of seemed absurd
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:39,968	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And we know that he said that like
EDL	00:37:39,968	00:37:41,248	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He didn't think he was a
EDL	00:37:41,248	00:37:42,528	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Particularly special
EDL	00:37:42,528	00:37:43,296	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Guy
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:47,904	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Think he said various does lots of Courts for memories talks about saying like
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:52,256	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I was just in the right place at the right time or I'm just say that
EDL	00:37:52,256	00:37:56,096	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Really yeah you know what he's talking about his famous cousin quote about
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:37:58,400	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Worrying that the packaging
EDL	00:37:58,400	00:37:59,424	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Of him
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:38:01,216	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Is better than the meat inside
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:06,336	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I mean this is part of the
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:09,408	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Method him is like and he was very humble
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:10,944	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Is another one we talked about like
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:14,784	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He sometimes talks about what made him special with his stubbornness
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:18,368	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But he was really obstinate and he wouldn't let things go
EDL	00:38:18,368	00:38:21,184	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	That's when the only things I feel like you hear him talking about
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:22,464	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Add some innate
EDL	00:38:22,464	00:38:25,536	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Characteristic of him that made him different than other people
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:28,352	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But didn't he never talked about being smart she never talks about
EDL	00:38:29,120	00:38:29,632	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Brain
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:36,544	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I feel like we've been swimming around it for a while
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:37,312	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	His brain
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:38,080	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Hammer
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:41,664	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But it is interesting that he says he he was in the right place at the right time
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:46,016	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Which can sound kind of like humble but also maybe it's sleepy
EDL	00:38:46,016	00:38:47,808	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	You take it seriously maybe there's something to it
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:49,600	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yeah I mean it like
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:52,928	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	We've been talking about the neural connections inside
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:56,768	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But you can also think about it a little more broadly
EDL	00:38:56,768	00:38:58,304	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Like about the connections
EDL	00:38:58,816	00:38:59,328	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Outsiders

EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:37,728	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	What that is

EDL	00:40:20,480	00:40:22,784	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Buy the thing you said at the end of the last chapter that
EDL	00:40:23,552	00:40:27,648	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	You know there are the circuits in in his head but then what about the circus outside is that
EDL	00:40:28,160	00:40:29,184	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Maybe you just got lucky
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:31,232	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	What were you thinking of when you said
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:34,816	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yeah I mean a lot of the obvious things that
EDL	00:40:34,816	00:40:35,840	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Must be dead
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:37,120	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Einstein was

EDL	00:40:38,656	00:40:39,680	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Lots of other physicists

EDL	00:40:44,544	00:40:45,568	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Puzzled him
EDL	00:40:45,568	00:40:46,592	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So there's that
EDL	00:40:46,592	00:40:48,640	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But if you widen the lens a little boy
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:50,688	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Let me start to think more broadly
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:51,712	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	You start to see
EDL	00:40:52,224	00:40:54,528	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Something really interesting
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:55,296	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Got a bigger
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:40:57,600	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Forces that were at work on Einstein

EDL	00:40:59,392	00:41:00,160	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Like
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:00,928	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Just take
EDL	00:41:00,928	00:41:01,440	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Special relativity
EDL	00:41:01,952	00:41:04,256	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Which most people would say it's one of his most Revolution
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:05,024	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Share ideas
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:06,304	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Special relativity
EDL	00:41:06,304	00:41:07,584	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Special relativity proper length
EDL	00:41:07,584	00:41:10,400	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Very basically is the idea that
EDL	00:41:11,424	00:41:12,704	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Time is relative
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:13,472	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And that
EDL	00:41:13,472	00:41:14,496	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Time slows down
EDL	00:41:14,496	00:41:15,008	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	As you go fat
EDL	00:41:16,032	00:41:17,568	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So if you're going a million miles an hour
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:19,104	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	10 miles an hour
EDL	00:41:19,104	00:41:20,384	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I'm will literally
EDL	00:41:20,384	00:41:20,896	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Slow down
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:22,688	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Images
EDL	00:41:22,688	00:41:24,736	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Seems lower it will actually be
EDL	00:41:25,504	00:41:27,808	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I feel like this is the moment when
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:30,624	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Science and Common Sense
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:31,648	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Parted ways
EDL	00:41:32,160	00:41:33,184	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	It's such a weird idea
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:34,464	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Totally
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:35,744	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Well that idea
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:38,560	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I came from Einstein but also kind of came from
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:39,840	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The world around
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:45,472	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Okay so I'm going to give you a couple of really interesting examples that we came across as we research
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:46,752	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Okay
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:53,407	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Number one I'm not in it at all an expert on the brain Story I mean look at some of the same things that you have but

EDL	00:41:58,015	00:42:01,599	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Professor at Harvard University where I work on the history and philosophy
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:02,623	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	If science and Dawn
EDL	00:42:02,623	00:42:04,415	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Physics and what Peter told us
EDL	00:42:04,415	00:42:08,767	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Is a if you look at when Einstein came up with the idea of special relativity
EDL	00:42:09,279	00:42:10,815	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	1905
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:17,215	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Destroy the dolphin told is Einstein was working in the patent office just sitting around all by himself thinking
EDL	00:42:17,215	00:42:17,727	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Take thoughts
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:20,543	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But you look at what was actually happening at that moment
EDL	00:42:20,543	00:42:25,407	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Like outside this was a transformative moment in the technological history of the world
EDL	00:42:26,687	00:42:32,063	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yeah what were what were some of the big like the hot inventions happening you looked out the window
EDL	00:42:33,087	00:42:36,159	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Any central European or Western European city
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:38,463	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	You would see
EDL	00:42:38,463	00:42:44,607	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	New kinds of trams being installed electric motors you would see
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:52,031	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Networks of clocks that were established UNC
EDL	00:42:53,055	00:42:56,895	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I also a new devices that are being invented that could
EDL	00:42:56,895	00:43:00,223	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Send signals the extension of the telegraph Network
EDL	00:43:00,735	00:43:03,039	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Everything in motion everything in the chain
EDL	00:43:04,831	00:43:05,599	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:06,367	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	As a consequence
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:07,903	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Time is
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:09,183	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Has suddenly become
EDL	00:43:11,487	00:43:13,023	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Atopic of immense in
EDL	00:43:13,791	00:43:16,095	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Not just because the world seem to be moving faster
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:18,911	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The first time in human history
EDL	00:43:21,215	00:43:23,775	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	You could be in several different time
EDL	00:43:24,543	00:43:25,311	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	At 1
EDL	00:43:25,311	00:43:26,847	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Cuz you ran trains
EDL	00:43:28,127	00:43:29,919	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So you leave Chicago at
EDL	00:43:29,919	00:43:30,687	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	3 p.m.
EDL	00:43:32,479	00:43:34,527	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	When you get to a distant City
EDL	00:43:34,527	00:43:35,551	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	What time is it there
EDL	00:43:36,575	00:43:38,111	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Do use the time
EDL	00:43:38,111	00:43:40,671	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But you started with in Chicago do you use
EDL	00:43:40,671	00:43:41,439	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The time
EDL	00:43:41,439	00:43:43,487	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Did you arriving at in Philadelphia
EDL	00:43:43,999	00:43:44,767	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Who sets
EDL	00:43:44,767	00:43:47,071	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	What are the times you know before the railroad
EDL	00:43:47,071	00:43:47,839	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Time was local
EDL	00:43:48,351	00:43:50,911	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Every town had like its own time
EDL	00:43:50,911	00:43:55,263	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Set in each town by the local jeweler who repaired and made clocks and watch
EDL	00:43:55,775	00:43:57,311	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Open with the railroad you needed
EDL	00:43:57,311	00:44:02,431	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Central Time in the early skirmishes over whose time would become
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:03,455	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The time
EDL	00:44:03,455	00:44:04,735	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Especially to the Showbox
EDL	00:44:04,735	00:44:08,575	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	It's like a million years ago it's a big big didn't like that at all
EDL	00:44:09,087	00:44:10,623	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But suddenly the ability
EDL	00:44:10,623	00:44:12,927	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	To Traverse at a fairly high speed
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:14,719	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Hundreds even thousands of miles
EDL	00:44:15,231	00:44:16,767	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Created the demand
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:18,047	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Think about
EDL	00:44:18,047	00:44:19,327	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	What time was
EDL	00:44:19,327	00:44:20,607	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And how to coordinate
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:22,911	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	That was sort of the mood of the MoMA
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:25,983	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Like just outside the window
EDL	00:44:25,983	00:44:26,751	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	A patent office
EDL	00:44:26,751	00:44:29,055	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Where Einstein was sitting there thinking big thoughts
EDL	00:44:31,615	00:44:34,175	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And what are the specific questions he was wrestling with
EDL	00:44:34,175	00:44:35,967	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Was the one Peter just threw out
EDL	00:44:35,967	00:44:39,551	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Like how would you coordinate two different clocks in two different cities
EDL	00:44:40,063	00:44:42,367	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	A lot of people the time.
EDL	00:44:42,879	00:44:44,671	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	We do it is you send an Alexa
EDL	00:44:45,183	00:44:48,511	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Signal bike through a telegraph wire from one to the other
EDL	00:44:48,511	00:44:54,911	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Calculate the amount of time it would take that signal to get from the first clock to the second clock then you take that minuscule amount of time until
EDL	00:44:54,911	00:44:56,447	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Attractive from 1:00
EDL	00:44:56,447	00:44:57,727	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Or at it when the clock
EDL	00:44:58,239	00:45:00,287	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And then you have the same time in two places
EDL	00:45:01,055	00:45:02,847	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And that's part of the problem
EDL	00:45:03,871	00:45:05,151	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But then the next.
EDL	00:45:05,663	00:45:07,455	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	That was
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:09,759	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	What is that signal you were using was traveling at the
EDL	00:45:09,759	00:45:10,271	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Speed of light
EDL	00:45:10,783	00:45:12,063	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	What does to clock
EDL	00:45:12,831	00:45:14,111	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	What if one of them was moved
EDL	00:45:14,879	00:45:15,903	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Equals movie
EDL	00:45:15,903	00:45:17,951	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And the light was tired of chasing it
EDL	00:45:18,719	00:45:19,743	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Wouldn't it take
EDL	00:45:19,743	00:45:21,535	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The light longer to get there
EDL	00:45:22,303	00:45:23,839	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And wouldn't that like
EDL	00:45:24,351	00:45:25,375	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Screw up your
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:26,655	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Whole ability to
EDL	00:45:26,655	00:45:27,423	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Coordinate
EDL	00:45:28,703	00:45:29,727	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Why am I telling you this
EDL	00:45:30,239	00:45:31,007	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Because
EDL	00:45:31,007	00:45:32,287	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	These kinds of questions
EDL	00:45:32,799	00:45:35,103	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	They sort of infiltrated Einstein
EDL	00:45:35,103	00:45:35,871	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Dreams
EDL	00:45:35,871	00:45:40,223	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Einstein wrote about this in his autobiography so we have a very good idea
EDL	00:45:40,735	00:45:44,831	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	That semantic analysis of science at the University of Illinois
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:51,231	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	She says Einstein wrote about these very particular Daydreams yet he said the P imagine himself
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:54,047	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Be propelled through space chasing after
EDL	00:45:54,047	00:45:54,815	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	A light beam
EDL	00:45:56,095	00:45:57,887	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And and thought
EDL	00:45:57,887	00:46:00,959	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Stories of signs of biographers to Feinstein
EDL	00:46:00,959	00:46:06,335	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Often agreed that it was that sort of experiment of of seeing in a what actually happens
EDL	00:46:06,335	00:46:12,735	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	If I pursue a light beam. Had the provided the the yard
EDL	00:46:12,735	00:46:14,783	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Turn off his thoughts the theory of relativity
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:20,159	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And explain why that light beam was such a big deal in a minute but the mean thing him and wanted to
EDL	00:46:20,159	00:46:23,743	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The tell me about it what that is explained as something that just emerged
EDL	00:46:23,743	00:46:24,767	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	From Einstein's brain
EDL	00:46:25,535	00:46:27,327	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I think it was purely an original
EDL	00:46:27,327	00:46:27,839	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Idea of her
EDL	00:46:28,351	00:46:30,143	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But it was not his idea at all
EDL	00:46:32,959	00:46:33,983	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Printed mint
EDL	00:46:33,983	00:46:34,751	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	A story hero
EDL	00:46:36,031	00:46:37,311	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Lead him to it
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:40,639	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	She does Einstein love science
EDL	00:46:41,663	00:46:44,479	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And he said he was particularly taken
EDL	00:46:44,991	00:46:47,551	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Bye-bye one author the name is
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:48,319	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I run
EDL	00:46:48,319	00:46:49,087	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Bernstein
EDL	00:46:49,599	00:46:51,903	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Who wrote quite a few volumes
EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:54,719	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And Einstein says that he if he brought them with quote
EDL	00:46:54,719	00:46:55,743	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Breathless attention
EDL	00:46:56,767	00:47:00,607	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Infinisys the story that got Einstein thinking about chasing light beams
EDL	00:47:01,119	00:47:03,679	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Was about a faster-than-light travel
EDL	00:47:04,191	00:47:07,007	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And what happens if we travel faster than the speed
EDL	00:47:07,007	00:47:07,775	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Safelite
EDL	00:47:07,775	00:47:11,615	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The story of imagine that you could have a guy who shoots off into space
EDL	00:47:12,383	00:47:14,175	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And purchased himself on a star
EDL	00:47:15,199	00:47:18,527	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	We looks back at Earth
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:21,855	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Isn't the same Earth he left a different world at different
EDL	00:47:22,367	00:47:22,879	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Universe
EDL	00:47:23,391	00:47:24,415	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Earlier
EDL	00:47:24,927	00:47:29,279	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Because as Bernstein explains when we look out at anything in space
EDL	00:47:29,279	00:47:30,047	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Square knot
EDL	00:47:30,047	00:47:30,815	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Being it
EDL	00:47:30,815	00:47:32,095	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Exactly as it is
EDL	00:47:32,607	00:47:34,143	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But rather as it was
EDL	00:47:34,655	00:47:35,935	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Example when you look up
EDL	00:47:35,935	00:47:38,495	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Son you're really seeing the Sun

EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:41,823	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Because the light waves

EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:48,991	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Enough if
EDL	00:47:48,991	00:47:50,783	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	If you wanted to look at the Earth

EDL	00:47:53,343	00:47:54,111	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Go to the Sun
EDL	00:47:54,879	00:47:55,647	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And if you

EDL	00:49:55,711	00:49:57,759	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So you're saying that if
EDL	00:49:59,295	00:50:05,695	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He hadn't been alive at a time when there are well roads would create a Time problems all the while there are people writing time travel fics

EDL	00:50:12,863	00:50:14,911	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yeah yeah like I still think
EDL	00:50:15,423	00:50:17,471	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	There's something about his brain that is
EDL	00:50:17,471	00:50:18,239	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Explains
EDL	00:50:18,239	00:50:19,007	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Part of it
EDL	00:50:19,007	00:50:20,799	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Can I buy all this other stuff
EDL	00:50:20,799	00:50:22,591	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The time-travel the railroads
EDL	00:50:22,591	00:50:23,359	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The stories
EDL	00:50:23,359	00:50:25,407	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I would say that that adds like

EDL	00:50:26,431	00:50:27,199	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Corny bike
EDL	00:50:27,711	00:50:34,111	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So the brain is what like 20 maybe 20 as a 12 basketball let's go to 20/20 Plus
EDL	00:50:34,111	00:50:35,391	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	25 Forester like
EDL	00:50:35,903	00:50:36,671	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Roughly half
EDL	00:50:36,671	00:50:37,439	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I don't know
EDL	00:50:37,439	00:50:39,999	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I have to say that I like halfway there
EDL	00:50:39,999	00:50:45,375	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Precise method where do I get to see if I can push a little bit further
EDL	00:50:45,375	00:50:45,887	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Okay
EDL	00:50:46,399	00:50:48,959	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Give another explanation bring it what are you up to
EDL	00:50:50,751	00:50:53,567	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I got to start small okay
EDL	00:50:53,567	00:50:54,847	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The first one
EDL	00:50:54,847	00:50:58,687	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I spoke to the sky Alberto Martinez he's a historian of science
EDL	00:50:59,199	00:51:04,063	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And he told me that one of the other things Einstein was reading that really blew his mind was
EDL	00:51:04,575	00:51:10,975	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Scottish philosopher David Hume who are these pretty radical ideas including that the laws of nature kind of start
EDL	00:51:10,975	00:51:14,047	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	AirHeads that the fundamental concepts of science

EDL	00:51:17,119	00:51:17,887	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	What's of the human mind
EDL	00:51:18,399	00:51:20,703	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Alberto says that those ideas
EDL	00:51:20,703	00:51:23,519	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Evine sign permission to think his own crazy thought
EDL	00:51:23,519	00:51:26,591	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	There's a letter from 1915 in which Einstein
EDL	00:51:26,591	00:51:32,735	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Write this line of thought was of great influence in my efforts very probably I wouldn't have reached
EDL	00:51:32,735	00:51:34,783	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The solution without those philosophic
EDL	00:51:34,783	00:51:35,295	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Legal studies
EDL	00:51:35,807	00:51:37,855	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And I was gone
EDL	00:51:37,855	00:51:41,439	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So much so and there's a little bit of a digression that
EDL	00:51:41,439	00:51:45,023	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Just a couple of months before he was about to publish the theory of relativity
EDL	00:51:45,023	00:51:50,911	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Of 1905 Einstein was supposed to meet with a group of his friends to discuss him if he was writing kind of study group
EDL	00:51:51,423	00:51:54,239	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But one of the guys this game Lori Sullivan
EDL	00:51:54,239	00:51:56,287	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	You wanted to skip a meeting of their discussion
EDL	00:51:56,287	00:51:57,567	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Betty wanted to go see

EDL	00:54:50,879	00:54:52,159	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He was like the first person
EDL	00:54:52,671	00:54:57,535	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	From what I can tell they like really engage with him as like this like weird off-the-beaten-path kind of guy
EDL	00:54:58,047	00:55:00,607	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And like support that unlike love that about him
EDL	00:55:01,119	00:55:04,191	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So they get married they have kids she leaves the science community
EDL	00:55:04,703	00:55:11,103	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He continues to your thing not very successful
EDL	00:55:11,103	00:55:11,615	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	How to do it
EDL	00:55:12,127	00:55:14,943	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And for a long time is drains and think much better
EDL	00:55:15,455	00:55:16,479	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But then
EDL	00:55:16,479	00:55:19,551	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	You know them these love letters I mean they really were
EDL	00:55:19,551	00:55:20,575	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	A big news item
EDL	00:55:21,087	00:55:22,623	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	In 1986
EDL	00:55:22,623	00:55:25,695	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I love letters between mileva and Einstein turned up
EDL	00:55:25,695	00:55:30,303	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And there's one letter and there's one line from Einstein that kind of like rocked the world
EDL	00:55:31,071	00:55:33,887	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	There's a letter from 1901 in which Einstein says
EDL	00:55:34,911	00:55:36,191	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	How proud will I be
EDL	00:55:36,191	00:55:36,959	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	When we both
EDL	00:55:36,959	00:55:37,727	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Together
EDL	00:55:37,727	00:55:39,007	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Bring our work
EDL	00:55:39,007	00:55:43,871	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	On the relative motion victoriously Switzerland literally says in his power
EDL	00:55:44,383	00:55:45,407	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Our work
EDL	00:55:45,407	00:55:46,431	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Like our Theory
EDL	00:55:47,711	00:55:53,855	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And everyone's like what they could that because she helping him on the sidelines giving him reason

EDL	00:55:57,439	00:55:58,975	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The idea that
EDL	00:55:59,487	00:56:00,255	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	This
EDL	00:56:00,255	00:56:01,535	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Iconic genius
EDL	00:56:02,047	00:56:04,607	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Had had a wife who maybe was his equal
EDL	00:56:04,607	00:56:08,703	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	There's a couple of other letters in which Einstein again refers to our work our Theory
EDL	00:56:08,703	00:56:15,103	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	When you put them all together it's enough to give anyone the impression relative motion our theory that Einstein is literally saying that
EDL	00:56:15,103	00:56:16,383	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Mileva was
EDL	00:56:17,151	00:56:18,175	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	His secret coworker
EDL	00:56:24,319	00:56:25,599	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Before we get too excited about this
EDL	00:56:26,111	00:56:27,647	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Baby mostly me
EDL	00:56:28,159	00:56:29,951	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I need to throw in a few bag
EDL	00:56:31,743	00:56:35,071	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The replies that we have from her do not engage the science
EDL	00:56:35,071	00:56:36,351	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The letters in which he
EDL	00:56:37,119	00:56:40,447	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Write this to her he doesn't specify what she herself did
EDL	00:56:40,447	00:56:41,471	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Alberta says
EDL	00:56:41,471	00:56:43,775	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	When you read the letters you realize what
EDL	00:56:43,775	00:56:46,335	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He believed at the time when he wrote that letter
EDL	00:56:46,335	00:56:50,687	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Wasn't that special that relative motion idea they talked about in the letter.
EDL	00:56:50,687	00:56:51,711	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Not relative
EDL	00:56:51,711	00:56:55,807	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And something everybody knew about it at the time did Einstein have
EDL	00:56:56,575	00:56:57,855	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The theory of relativity
EDL	00:56:57,855	00:56:59,903	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	When he's writing them and then the answer is no
EDL	00:56:59,903	00:57:03,231	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	We have nothing and we have multiple sources and what she says
EDL	00:57:03,999	00:57:05,023	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I have nothing
EDL	00:57:05,023	00:57:11,423	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So she probably wasn't his co-conspirator but she did support him at this time when everybody else was
EDL	00:57:11,423	00:57:13,215	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Contradicting him and for that
EDL	00:57:13,215	00:57:14,495	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I think I gave her some points
EDL	00:57:14,495	00:57:17,567	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I'm going to be 15% based on what just cuz you just
EDL	00:57:17,567	00:57:20,639	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Cuz it makes you feel good to give 15 or you don't
EDL	00:57:20,639	00:57:27,039	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Arbitrarily I like to pick numbers out of the sky
EDL	00:57:27,039	00:57:32,415	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I support V

EDL	00:57:52,895	00:57:55,199	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Cuz when I will have an answer

EDL	00:58:01,599	00:58:02,367	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Kiss written
EDL	00:58:02,367	00:58:03,647	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So much about Einstein
EDL	00:58:04,159	00:58:06,463	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	About Einstein in his best-selling books
EDL	00:58:06,463	00:58:07,743	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Talked about him
EDL	00:58:07,743	00:58:09,791	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Television specials he has a
EDL	00:58:09,791	00:58:14,655	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Play about Einstein he has written about all the ways Einstein has impacted the world
EDL	00:58:14,655	00:58:16,447	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And all the ways the world

EDL	00:58:18,239	00:58:20,287	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But surprisingly when we asked him about this
EDL	00:58:20,799	00:58:24,895	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	He brought it back to the brain I have to say if I was in the shoes of the

EDL	00:58:42,047	00:58:43,583	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	All of them came together
EDL	00:58:44,095	00:58:45,375	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	In this one brain
EDL	00:58:46,143	00:58:47,167	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	In a way that was different
EDL	00:58:47,167	00:58:51,007	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Somewhere in the collection of atoms and molecules in the brain that would cause
EDL	00:58:51,007	00:58:56,127	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Albert Einstein is the answer to why Albert Einstein was Albert Einstein
EDL	00:58:56,127	00:59:01,503	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	What do you think there's something innate about it like Einstein was born with some special mental equipment
EDL	00:59:01,503	00:59:04,575	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Or you think it had more to do with his environment

EDL	00:59:42,719	00:59:43,487	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Somewhere
EDL	00:59:43,487	00:59:46,815	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And if we had the capacity to lay out every single circuit
EDL	00:59:47,327	00:59:48,351	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And every
EDL	00:59:48,863	00:59:50,399	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Single influence
EDL	00:59:50,399	00:59:51,679	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	That could
EDL	00:59:51,679	00:59:57,567	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Cascade through that brain if we were able to fully understand all the electrical signals and crackles
EDL	00:59:58,079	00:59:59,103	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	That would
EDL	00:59:59,615	01:00:06,015	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Go through that brain yes I believe that we would fully understand Einstein's process and
EDL	01:00:06,015	01:00:09,599	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Understand how it was that he was able to do what he did
EDL	01:00:09,599	01:00:10,367	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I can't do that
EDL	01:00:11,391	01:00:11,903	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yet
EDL	01:00:12,927	01:00:13,439	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Well

EDL	01:00:36,991	01:00:43,135	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Describe is funded to the tune of 4.5 billion told us that one guy who's doing this just about a mile from where Einstein lived
EDL	01:00:43,135	01:00:44,159	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	There's a
EDL	01:00:44,159	01:00:48,767	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Princeton University Professor Sebastian Seung and what he does he takes
EDL	01:00:48,767	01:00:49,791	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Cubic millimeter
EDL	01:00:50,303	01:00:52,607	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	A cubic millimeter of mouse retina

EDL	01:00:56,447	01:01:02,847	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And he slices us into these vanishingly thin sections and then he tries to trace the axons that
EDL	01:01:02,847	01:01:07,199	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Dendrites of neurons the astrocytes the oligodendroglia etc etc
EDL	01:01:07,711	01:01:08,223	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	It can take

EDL	01:01:09,759	01:01:12,063	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	It can take months to do a cubic millimeter
EDL	01:01:16,671	01:01:21,535	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And then you got to have some kind of software that can analyze
EDL	01:01:21,535	01:01:27,935	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The see if the structure can lead you to some kind of conclusion about circuitry
EDL	01:01:27,935	01:01:28,703	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	My cat YouTube
EDL	01:01:29,215	01:01:35,615	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Quick why not definitely like if that doesn't get you to function then what what what would be what would be left
EDL	01:01:35,615	01:01:36,639	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I doubt if we could map
EDL	01:01:36,639	01:01:37,919	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Perfect labor
EDL	01:01:37,919	01:01:39,967	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Structure of all the connections
EDL	01:01:39,967	01:01:44,831	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	What you're talking like me you're talking like a man
EDL	01:01:44,831	01:01:50,975	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I'm a material they call me and materials because I'm saying well the left side of the brain has something to do with the right arm
EDL	01:01:51,487	01:01:52,511	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And speech
EDL	01:01:52,511	01:01:54,815	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	That's that's called materialism
EDL	01:01:54,815	01:01:57,375	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	But there's another school of thought is called
EDL	01:01:57,887	01:01:59,935	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Somehow
EDL	01:02:00,703	01:02:03,007	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Mind consciousness
EDL	01:02:03,007	01:02:06,079	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Spirit soul
EDL	01:02:06,079	01:02:06,847	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Is
EDL	01:02:06,847	01:02:07,615	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Separate
EDL	01:02:07,615	01:02:09,919	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	From the physical substrate of the brain
EDL	01:02:09,919	01:02:16,319	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	How would that be science though cuz isn't I mean I can imagine school of thought which allows for that but but it feels like you're
EDL	01:02:16,319	01:02:18,623	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	You're very quickly stepping out of science
EDL	01:02:18,623	01:02:19,903	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	If you go that way
EDL	01:02:19,903	01:02:21,183	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Well yes
EDL	01:02:21,183	01:02:22,463	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Yes okay
EDL	01:02:22,463	01:02:23,487	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Probably
EDL	01:02:23,487	01:02:28,095	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	You know we're all brought up on this thing when you read anything in the popular press
EDL	01:02:28,095	01:02:29,375	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	About the brain
EDL	01:02:29,375	01:02:31,167	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	They'll show you functional neuroimaging
EDL	01:02:31,679	01:02:33,471	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	So when someone talks
EDL	01:02:34,239	01:02:38,847	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	The little the Broca's area the speech area on the left side of the brain
EDL	01:02:38,847	01:02:39,615	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Lights up
EDL	01:02:40,127	01:02:42,175	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	And you got well there's your answer
EDL	01:02:42,175	01:02:45,759	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	That's the structure it lights up that's what's creating language
EDL	01:02:46,271	01:02:46,783	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Except
EDL	01:02:47,295	01:02:50,367	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	When you deal with lobsters they said when we got one problem with that
EDL	01:02:50,879	01:02:52,415	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	It's called the hard problem
EDL	01:02:52,415	01:02:56,767	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	If you look at that chunk of brain that you're calling Broca's area that lights up when you talk
EDL	01:02:56,767	01:02:58,559	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	What exactly is happening there
EDL	01:02:58,559	01:02:59,839	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	How does that create
EDL	01:03:00,351	01:03:01,887	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	How does that create a word
EDL	01:03:01,887	01:03:05,215	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Or if you're looking at the occipital lobe and you're looking at the color red
EDL	01:03:05,727	01:03:09,823	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	How do you create that Kweli at which is a fancy way of saying the sensation of color
EDL	01:03:10,591	01:03:14,687	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	We can show you where it's happening we just can't show you how
EDL	01:03:18,271	01:03:20,063	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	We're all looking the same thing we're saying
EDL	01:03:20,063	01:03:23,391	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Somehow if we could get a better handle on the anatomy
EDL	01:03:23,391	01:03:24,927	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Maybe we can explain a thought
EDL	01:03:25,439	01:03:27,231	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	We can explain the song
EDL	01:03:28,255	01:03:30,047	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	I mean forget forget
EDL	01:03:30,047	01:03:32,607	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	Relativity we can explain a thought
EDL	01:04:04,607	01:04:11,007	| radiolab_membership19relativegenius_intelligence-series |	It follows Santa special.
