EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:09,919	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And then there were these fanciful stories that
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:10,943	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Sprung up about
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:16,063	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Where she came from as far away as possible
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:22,463	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Pretty much as soon as she hit the scene you started hearing these rumors that she had being adopted from a coconut

EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:27,903	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Different
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:33,023	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	It was a totally different approach Surya was always very like
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:39,423	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Closest Elvis stojko is in the building
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:44,287	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	3 time world figure skating Champion for me it was sort of new
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:50,687	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	When you face on the scene, is the still like the fresh ticket young tiny fifteen-year-old French kahoot
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:57,087	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Everyone's imagination to hear Tonya Harding Style skating is so exciting
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:09:00,927	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Just no boundaries for her this is Tonya Harding
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:06,047	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And she answering over friends strengthen the power except on the ice
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:12,191	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	People are crazy
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:19,615	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Take off Surya would go from one end to the other hits speed across the online
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:26,015	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Soaring through the air
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:32,415	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	What powerful spin Institute
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,183	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Combination
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:39,583	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Combination to do pretty spread eagle
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:41,119	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And shoot attack
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:47,519	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Everything is a reference to step sequence she had the the gliding
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:51,359	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Running
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:57,759	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	She had it all what cloud here appreciate it
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:10:04,159	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	This sucks jumping ability and there's no end to what she might achieve
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:08,255	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Outside of competition should be revised shows and exhibitions
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:10,047	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And that's when you would see like whiskey
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:11,839	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Can really do just do all kind of other jump
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:14,655	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Backflip
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:21,055	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Yes very first time that I ever saw her do a backflip I mean I just my mouth just draw
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:27,455	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Dropped open that's honey Harding again I was like how did you do that cuz it's really dangerous Elvis stojko
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:30,015	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Joe told us that one time he tried it and it did not go well
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:31,295	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I came down right on my face
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:33,599	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And I split my eye open
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:35,391	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And almost broke my neck and I was like
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:42,559	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	You know I don't think this is going to be a good thing and just a little teenage girl Surya bonaly no problem
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:45,119	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Just doing it like it was nothing absolutely Fearless
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:49,983	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And the crowd loved it. Making noise in table fit
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:51,007	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Into the grown
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:56,895	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I can feel like the whole building building I'm like I swear it looks like an earthquake but
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:10:59,199	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Here's what
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:00,479	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And this is where things can I get
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:01,503	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Felix
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:06,623	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	3 blows up and all these people who never like figure skating fall in love with her
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:08,671	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Over and over
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:15,583	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	The judges don't artistic impression when you can see this Terry from
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:20,447	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And the crowd do not like amox
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:22,751	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Even with

EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:37,343	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	0 to 6
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:40,159	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And on Syria's artistic marks
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:42,207	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Get scores like
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:44,767	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	05

EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:53,727	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	What did you think about Mark
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:12:00,127	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Very very disappointed
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:02,175	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	She said nevermind that's life
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:02,687	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I'm used to it
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:04,735	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Excel Sports

EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:15,999	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	But clearly there were some times where I got her there was this one time we found on YouTube where she
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:19,839	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Cabooze the judge
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:21,631	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	What her she gets her
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:24,703	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Why was she getting bad marks
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:25,215	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	To begin with what
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:26,495	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	What was the problem
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:28,543	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Well that's the question and it's
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:30,591	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Kind of complicated yeah I think there's
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:33,407	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Several things John Howard
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:35,711	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	That ESPN writer
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:37,247	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	The first thing you got to know and
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:41,855	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Quick little dive into the weirdo world of figure skating
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:43,647	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Is that there's this
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:46,207	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Fundamental tension
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:48,767	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	In the sport of figure skating between
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:50,559	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Artistry on one side
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:51,839	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	In athleticism Monday
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:53,375	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Powerful Mistress of prettiness
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:57,727	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Slate they want these people to look like little ballerinas but leap into these jumps
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:58,239	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Looks like
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:02,335	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Predators at the time Skating was sort of
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:03,359	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Locked in the
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:04,383	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Loud and fracture
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:05,151	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Debate about

EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:07,967	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:09,759	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Sorry I was sort of the epitome of
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:12,063	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Almost the endpoint what could happen
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:16,159	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	If somebody with unrivaled athleticism and no aversion to risk
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:21,279	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Was willing to go after it and I think there were a lot of people in the skating that didn't want it
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:22,559	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I went through it
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:24,095	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I know all about it
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:29,215	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Tonya Harding's she said that she had this issue I didn't want to skate like what they wanted
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:29,983	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Skating to look like
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:32,031	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Elvis stojko two-button
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:34,591	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Surya's case a lot of work to be done on my car
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:35,871	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	There's a lot of books
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:40,991	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	To be done on the grass all those words used to criticize her skating Salat 36th

EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:47,391	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	We just a little bit more loaded
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:51,743	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Baby taken glyco brought a lot of raw talent
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:52,511	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	But it's not
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:55,327	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	It's not fully kind of
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:58,143	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I can be refined and
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:03,007	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	For us like none Skeeter's like that's one of the challenges of the story I guess it's like trying to see like
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:04,799	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Is Zazzle legit
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:05,311	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Criticism
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:08,383	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Is this just a way of
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:08,895	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Saying that
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:09,919	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Cease
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,455	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Black Beatles

EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:15,295	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	How to say because she was black
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:18,879	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	This is Marie Wren Laguna and she is a former French figure skate
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:20,671	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And she was part of it
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:23,231	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Team whose job it was to decide which girls to send to
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:25,535	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	World junior Championship
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:29,119	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And we have to choose to only two girls and we had
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:29,887	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Three possibilities
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:32,191	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	She said that she backed
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:33,983	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Surya
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:35,007	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	The majority of the

EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:37,823	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Cato's
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:41,663	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Were they saying it out loud like we don't
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:47,551	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Want somebody don't want her because she's like it was a very subtly inside
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:50,879	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	According to her what they would say she levitated kind of things like
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:53,439	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	She's too muscular or she wasn't elegant enough
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,207	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Oh yes
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:55,231	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I have to say that
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:57,535	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	That's what Elegance many times I have heard that
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:14:59,839	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	She's not there
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:04,447	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Marie Wren is an outsider in the figure skating World these days because of an unrelated
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:05,983	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Scandal and so we weren't
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:07,775	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Totally sure what to think about that but
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:08,543	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Wait how did
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:09,311	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Sorry I feel bad
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:11,103	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Well I asked her
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:14,431	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Did you feel like any of the difficulty was because you're black
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:17,503	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	No
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:19,295	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	No no no
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:21,343	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	But then moments later she said
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:22,367	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Well
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:23,135	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I know
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:24,671	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	When you go black you know
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:27,743	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Everybody knows that you have to do better than
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:29,023	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Anybody else was white
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:30,303	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Well
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:33,119	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I think the idea that she was held back
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:34,655	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	In Martin her mark
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:37,215	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	For any other reason other than
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:38,495	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	The quality of
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:39,775	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Skating I think his
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:40,543	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Incorrect
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,567	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	That Sandra bezic
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:42,591	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Has been involved
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:44,639	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Skating World my whole life as a
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:45,407	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Competitor is in
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:46,175	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Olympian
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:46,943	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Commentator
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:52,319	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And actually as a commentator I'd like to see your stop jumping for 6 months and learn to skate
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:54,879	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	She was kind of hard on Syria
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:56,671	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And when we asked her why
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:58,975	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	This is what she said everything about
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:15:59,999	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Skating is built on
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:05,631	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	The radius could be huge but it's
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:06,399	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Phyllis Circle
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:07,935	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Everything is about edges
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:10,239	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Leaning into those edges
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:11,263	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And leaning into the
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:12,031	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Returns
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:13,567	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And in carving
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:15,103	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Massive circles on the ice
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:16,383	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And that is
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:17,151	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	R-sport
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:18,175	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Which
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:19,711	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Leads to Syria
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:22,783	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And if you want to jump starter
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:23,807	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	They were on straight line
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:25,087	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:28,415	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	If a jump is on a straight line then it can't land with
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:29,183	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Blow
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:30,463	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Because the idea is
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:31,743	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Tool and you jump
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:32,767	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	With as much
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:34,047	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Evenflo is you
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:34,815	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	You had going into it
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:39,679	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And that's something that she couldn't do because she was jumping on straight line
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:43,775	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And in the other thing about skating that you don't necessarily get on
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:47,359	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Is the sound of yet
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,711	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	The sound of
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:53,247	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Of a beautiful
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:54,271	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Skater going for
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:56,063	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Edge-to-edge from lean-to
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:56,831	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Celine
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:57,855	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	What is that sound like
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:03,487	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	It's a beautiful sound
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:06,047	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	It's a sound that we all love
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:08,095	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	It's a gentle carving
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:15,263	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	No no no no
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:16,031	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	No because
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:18,079	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	There's no there I can tell you
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:19,103	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	There are no scratches
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:20,639	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	It's a Glide
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:26,783	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	It's just that it's a ham
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:35,487	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Is there a different sound to me like there's a sound of Brian Boitano's back crossover
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:36,767	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	You know used to
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:38,815	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Like excite me when I was in the rink with
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:40,607	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	But then there's also
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:42,143	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Sister did the gentle almost
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:42,655	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Soundless
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:46,495	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Quality of
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:47,519	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	So you can saute
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:49,055	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Katia gordeeva
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:51,103	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Weather like a witch
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:51,615	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Farrah Fawcett
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:52,639	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I said yet there
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:56,223	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	In a flipping from one address to another Edge
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:59,551	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And forward to backward and it's
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:01,087	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Almost
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:01,599	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	It's just a
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:02,879	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	This
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:04,159	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Glide
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:06,207	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I haven't got a good word
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:11,071	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Damn it's a win-win 3 was hitting would she have that sound
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:11,839	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	No
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:13,119	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	She would be
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:13,631	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Scratchy
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:24,895	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Now we should say that wasn't the sound of Surya skating or any of those other people we just like
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:25,919	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Mic'd up a whole bunch of
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:32,831	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Like pretty good figure skaters with a professional skin yeah yeah yeah these are legit scared
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:33,599	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Reset the clip
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:34,623	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	What is Sandra at
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,975	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Since you gave me the thumbs up
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:44,351	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Do we got a ride or whatever it is she is hearing and think yes I sound different
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:51,263	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Not even that different really so that's exactly the problem ice skating is largely about aesthetic
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:55,615	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	So as far as it's like kind of in its own category
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:19:00,223	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Like if you're talking about Serena Williams is facing a lot of these same kinds of criticism
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:06,111	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	It doesn't matter there's a line on a court and it's either inside or outside There are rules
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:08,415	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Where is there aren't these rules
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:09,183	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	When it comes
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:10,207	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	The beauty it
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:11,231	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	It's super slushie
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:12,767	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And that makes
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:13,535	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Someone likes
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:15,583	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Surya much more vulnerable
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:18,655	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	So what so what ended up happening
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:23,007	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Well after a couple years of getting these kinds of marks
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:23,775	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	See
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:24,287	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Best insults
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:29,407	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I mean I was born March 1992 at the age of 18
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:30,943	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I have new car garage
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:34,271	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Change my whole skating rules you know I change poachers
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:36,575	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And she decides to take the note
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:41,951	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Jackie travel to California and works with Frank Carroll who's like this legendary American coach
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:43,999	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And what you doing
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:45,535	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Trying to be no
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:46,559	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	B
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:51,167	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	More graceful more beautiful more elegantly mohr Circle yeah
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:52,447	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:53,983	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	After that you kind of
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:57,567	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	You can watch the Youtube videos from that. And if
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:19:58,591	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	It's like she's a
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:00,639	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Does it work
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:03,455	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Yeah in 1993 in the world championships
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:04,223	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	She comes in second
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:09,599	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And then by the time I'm a 94 rolls around she is a favorite she is she busy
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:12,159	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Probably going to win
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:13,695	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:14,207	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	What happened
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:16,767	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Things take a risk
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:17,279	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Estranged

EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:09,056	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Beside to a bench
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:10,080	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	With her coach

EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:33,632	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	She jumps in the first place and then and there's only one skater left
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:39,520	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	It's a skater who usually finishes below three-eyed comedy
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:40,800	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Yuka Sato

EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:03,840	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Like a whisper across the ice
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:04,864	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Physically hurt
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:07,424	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Skating style was the exact opposite end
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:08,960	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	From Sirius
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:13,824	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	21 year old son Tokyo
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:20,992	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	So she gets up does her final skate in for the home crowd
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:27,392	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	My favorite skaters but she doesn't know she's going to need all her jumps opening up
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:28,160	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	XXX
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:32,512	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And she gets her first jump
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:38,912	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Crowd loved it and me but she was prettier
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:41,728	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	It in her routine there were these moments where it just
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:43,008	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Looks like some sort of skipping
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:44,544	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Crusty eyes
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:47,872	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Just very balletic moves
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:49,408	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	It's good to know
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:56,064	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Just one here at makuhari event center 4th the local favorite Lucas

EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:17,568	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Birthmarks of course for technical Merit bowling alley strength osako stated
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:21,920	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And every one of those marks except the Finish judge
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:25,760	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Go to bowling alley she wins 8 out of 9 technical Merit
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:32,160	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	The light came down to the artistic mark But the French judge
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:35,232	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Giving her higher marks
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:37,280	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	What this is going to be closed
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:39,840	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	It actually ends up being a tie
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:43,680	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	So it goes to being a timer
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:48,032	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And that's been the the judges basically pick for 2nd and 3rd
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:51,360	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And in a 5-4 decision
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:57,760	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	The new world champion
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:26:04,160	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Unfortunately the truth hurt
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:06,720	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Medal ceremony
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:09,792	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	What happens next is
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:13,888	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	One of these moments that really defines serious story for a lot of people
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:15,424	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	So what happened was that
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:20,032	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Right after all the results were out
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:22,592	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	He set up the medal ceremony they called out

EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:27,712	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Tunnel backstage under the ice
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:31,552	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	What about waves Smiles everybody
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:32,064	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And then
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:37,696	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	After about a minute
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:38,720	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Syria
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:45,120	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	But
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:48,960	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Where is the European Champion all the cameras Friday around and
EDL	00:26:49,984	00:26:50,752	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Timeout
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:52,544	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Not an idiot
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:56,128	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	How late arrival and here she comes
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:57,920	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Cheapskates out
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:58,944	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Santa dice
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:27:00,480	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	She weighed but her faces
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:01,248	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Smiling
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:05,600	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	No and then when she gets to the podium she congratulates you Casado
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:06,624	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	But then
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:10,976	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Finally has chosen not to stand on the podium
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:14,048	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	She just stopped before getting on the podium she just stood right
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:15,584	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Next
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:18,656	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I think this is a form of protest
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:24,288	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I really hope she doesn't go through with this she wouldn't stand on it she was crying
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:26,592	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Elvis actually was in the crowd watching
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:29,408	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I feel bad for her cuz I know what she was going through
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:30,688	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Where
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:31,968	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	You know you out skated
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:33,760	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Your competitor and they just wouldn't give it
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:35,808	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And I was like Siri adjust
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:37,344	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Get on the podium
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:38,880	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Take the metal
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:43,488	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	International skating Union president Olaf
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:48,352	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Official is giving out the medals he gives you cuz of gold put it around your neck
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:53,728	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	But then when he turns to Surya he just sort of
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:58,592	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Stands there looks at are you said something that you can't hear what it is
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:27:59,872	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	She shakes her head
EDL	00:28:01,408	00:28:03,200	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	What's the metal around Serena's neck
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:06,016	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Shakes her hand and he holds her hand and it's kind of like
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:08,064	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Is her off the podium
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:14,976	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	This is a first for me that's for sure
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:21,376	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Takes off the middle
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:25,728	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I'm not sure if she takes
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:27,776	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	It's over metal off of her
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:28,544	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Had

EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:37,248	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	The camera Zooms in on her face and and she is just
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:40,576	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	What's going on inside
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:45,696	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	That young woman
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:50,304	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	So after the medal ceremonies over
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:52,864	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	She just gets mop
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:59,264	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Why would you not accept what was the problem
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:03,360	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I'm just disappointed
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:05,920	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	What are the judges unfair to you
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:10,528	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	You're saying

EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:16,416	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And eventually what she says
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:20,256	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Is I'm just
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:21,536	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And I'm just not lucky
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:29,728	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	What what was going on like what happened you use I seen was more like a plan Jose is this it it stop now
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:33,056	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Can you put your fist on the table
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:35,104	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Enough is enough.
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:37,152	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Say Hey you know
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:42,272	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I'm not dumb and I'm just getting sick and now I'm sick of it. I keep my eyes open that is not fair
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:44,832	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	We have those task. I was just sold
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:45,600	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Depressing
EDL	00:29:45,600	00:29:48,160	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And was so not fair mostly it was not fair
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:50,208	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	What about it felt unfair
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:52,256	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Joseph Savino
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:55,584	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Up and over and over so many times that's every time
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:30:01,984	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	It's never me because whatever I can do how many people I can be pretty I can have the best choreographer I can so everything was made
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:03,520	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	To be on the top
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:06,592	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I'm like what do you need more me to do I just want
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:10,176	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	You know how many triple-triple you want me if I don't do you kill me
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:11,200	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And if I do
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:14,016	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	You don't care anyway you took somebody choose somebody else
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:15,552	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Don't you think
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:16,576	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	But that's a little
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:18,112	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Unsportsmanlike
EDL	00:30:18,880	00:30:19,904	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Yeah totally absent
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:25,024	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Yeah but if she's other girls have to work just as hard as she has one cuz UMES
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:28,352	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Sure but okay so picture yourself if you're at that
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:33,472	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Is it your you're in that position you find yourself getting second second you feel like you're not
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:37,056	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	You're not she came in second that always had the margin with
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:38,080	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	So close
EDL	00:30:38,080	00:30:42,432	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	It was so close
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:47,296	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I just more like soap empathy for heart for her
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:50,112	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Can't imagine what it
EDL	00:30:51,392	00:30:52,160	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Be like
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:52,928	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Like anime
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:53,952	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	What atmosphere
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:57,024	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	But you know in that kind on that scale
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:30:58,560	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	To be the only one
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:02,144	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Xerosis
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:04,448	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Anything for you know
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:09,568	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	A friend of mine once told me that racism can make black people crazy
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:14,176	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Which is very very broad way of looking at it
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:19,808	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	In the sense that you kind of almost never know why people are reacting to you the way that they do
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:22,880	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And it's it and it's kind of a
EDL	00:31:22,880	00:31:24,928	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	You're always sort of second
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:25,440	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Guessing
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:27,232	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	You know what's up
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:29,280	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	You know that
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:33,632	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Did they go that guy just came and he said hi to everybody in the room but he did say it to me
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:34,400	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	What is that what was that
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:39,520	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	There's no obvious thing about it but it can make you feel
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:42,592	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	A little paranoia a little
EDL	00:31:42,592	00:31:43,872	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Crazy now I cannot
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:46,688	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Put myself I can't imagine how
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:48,480	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	YouTube Sevilla felt in that moment
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:52,832	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	But I didn't necessarily like think that you know these
EDL	00:31:52,832	00:31:56,416	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Prejudiced people had denied her this if anything I felt more like
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:31:57,952	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Man
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:31:58,720	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	It really must
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:02,816	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Skating at that kind of level
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:05,376	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And not really understand
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:06,400	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Why
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:07,424	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Things Are
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:08,704	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Gormiti
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:12,288	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	It must be like a very confusing
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:13,568	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Situation to be in
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:16,896	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And that is in and it was more like empathy
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:18,944	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Don't know
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:20,480	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	You know if if if if
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:21,248	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	There was racism
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:27,392	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Quite frankly Yuka Sato is an amazing skater it's very legitimate
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:28,672	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Feel
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:29,696	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Like you
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:32,000	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Put your finger
EDL	00:32:34,048	00:32:35,072	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Never goes away
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:36,096	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	No
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:37,120	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Never
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:39,680	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Always there
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:40,960	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And always
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:45,056	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Happens what happens
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:46,848	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	That's a pretty
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:53,760	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I think that I think the the wreck that she got after this moment was that she was a sore loser
EDL	00:32:54,528	00:32:55,552	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And that she was Define
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:57,088	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	That
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:58,368	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	She had a bad attitude
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:00,160	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Does she
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:00,928	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Quit at this point
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:02,464	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Well she keeps going
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:07,584	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	She competed again in the world championships in 1995 the very next year she came in second
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:08,864	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Again again
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:09,632	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	3 years
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:11,680	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	In a similar pattern was there like
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:12,704	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Just the 100
EDL	00:33:12,704	00:33:15,776	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	That one wasn't as close
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:16,288	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Second again for the
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:26,784	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I think seriously no European championships you know Skate America
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:27,296	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Is doing a lot
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:30,368	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Not at the Olympics not at the world championship
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:37,024	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	But I guess it depends on how you define
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:37,536	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Find First
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:41,120	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	What do you mean he said that actually takes us right back to the beginning
EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:48,032	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	We're here live at 10 a.m. on Saturday morning in Japan
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:49,824	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	So bored but
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:50,592	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Remind
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:52,128	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Where in Nagano Japan
EDL	00:33:52,128	00:33:53,664	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	1998 Winter
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:56,480	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I knew it was my last Olympics in the last
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:34:01,600	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Major major big competition and everything was fine until the day before
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:02,624	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	The short program
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:04,928	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I pulled a muscle
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:07,488	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Her left
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:09,536	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And I couldn't leave
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:10,560	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I can do anything
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:16,960	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	To make matters worse Surya. Moment was already recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:17,984	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	To carry me
EDL	00:34:17,984	00:34:23,360	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	To walk stairs because I couldn't get there so you have to leave me to go to my room because you're not doing a village
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:24,640	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I couldn't walk
EDL	00:34:25,920	00:34:31,552	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	You know even broken I'm damaged I'm like a used car that's really good good for Life trash
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:34,112	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I'll let you know really I was so messed up
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:34,880	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Between my legs
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:37,184	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	But in my achilles I was like
EDL	00:34:37,184	00:34:38,720	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Nas the disaster
EDL	00:34:38,720	00:34:44,608	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And the doctor said maybe we should withdraw and I know I'm already here and I don't want to
EDL	00:34:45,120	00:34:46,912	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	To trust me retires my
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:48,960	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Probably my last option I don't want to dress
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:49,728	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Metallica
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:51,264	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Just give me anything you can
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:52,288	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I have to keep going
EDL	00:34:52,800	00:34:55,104	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And so on the final day she says that she
EDL	00:34:56,128	00:34:59,456	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Between May DC massage acupuncture Hills
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:00,736	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	She goes back out on the ice
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:03,552	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And is now getting ready to skate
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:04,320	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	For her country
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:06,880	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Golden blue
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:08,160	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Sequins outfit and
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:08,672	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	She starts her
EDL	00:35:09,184	00:35:11,488	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	You can tell she
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:13,536	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Favoring one leg but she manages
EDL	00:35:16,608	00:35:18,656	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Didn't work for the Telco
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:23,264	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Get back up
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:26,080	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Going through her routine
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:28,384	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Triple sow-cow
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:29,408	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And then she said
EDL	00:35:29,408	00:35:31,200	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Chillicothe this point where
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:32,224	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	She couldn't do it
EDL	00:35:33,504	00:35:35,040	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	It was so much in pain
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:38,368	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I hadn't oceanos program I was supposed to go
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:44,768	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	But you know what I don't feel it I know I'm going to crash I can do I'm not capable
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:45,792	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	My leg is not
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:46,816	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	With me anymore
EDL	00:35:46,816	00:35:47,840	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And then what comes
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:49,376	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	There is this movie
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:51,680	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	House in a repertoire that you
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:52,448	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Can do
EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:53,984	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	But it's illegal
EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:57,312	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	A special thing in my backpack and say hey I can't do it
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:58,336	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Is my last
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:36:02,432	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Is molluscum t-shirts or going through your mind was you were skating
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:07,552	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Yeah oh yeah you know me is like a computer if you know if I would have missed something or dramas okay here
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:09,088	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I can see the triple here
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:13,952	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I was there I can do a combo triple triple I know I need to feel something you're like the GPS lady you're like recalculating
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:21,632	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Turns around from getting forwards to skating backwards
EDL	00:36:22,144	00:36:24,704	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Picks up speed just like she's about to do triple
EDL	00:36:25,472	00:36:30,336	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	But she does
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:31,872	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Backflip
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:33,152	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	But not any old backflow
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:36,224	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Sheetz Wings on leg over
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:36,992	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Blitz
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:38,016	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	In the air
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:43,392	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Upside down and then she lands on one
EDL	00:36:43,392	00:36:49,536	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Oh my goodness
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:57,216	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	What is it when you do the backflip do you go do your skates go up towards the ceiling and then come back down underneath you again
EDL	00:36:57,728	00:37:00,288	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I just am having trouble Avenue
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:03,872	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Because it
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:04,640	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	It's so dangerous
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:08,992	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Also she says you're supposed to land all your jumps on one foot
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:10,528	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	But she did that
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:16,160	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	You didn't want photo just hold hold I just want this whole
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:21,792	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And couldn't be like totally illegal because they are as long as laying on one food maybe we'll be
EDL	00:37:22,304	00:37:28,704	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	We will sing about
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:32,800	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And she finishes her program with her back to the judges
EDL	00:37:33,568	00:37:39,968	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And you know usually is it you skate you perform you smile in front of the camera but was it gives a mock neck skater
EDL	00:37:39,968	00:37:46,368	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Call me to collect 10 minutes seriously 10 minutes people think about what should we do
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:52,256	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Do with me and I said whatever just put a zero and so we can move on there or the marks that you get mailed
EDL	00:37:52,768	00:37:58,912	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Presentation absolutely 48522 how do you get noticed in Olympic competition
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:04,288	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Nope so she ends up finishing
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:05,056	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Intense
EDL	00:38:05,056	00:38:06,848	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I like yeah I finished and it's okay
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:15,552	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Adele afterwards a lot of people interpreted that backflip as a
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:17,600	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Big fat middle finger up
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:19,136	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	To the entire
EDL	00:38:19,136	00:38:24,256	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Skating World I know you don't want me to but I'm going to do this anyway
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:28,608	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	When I asked no
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:29,120	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I don't know what
EDL	00:38:31,168	00:38:32,448	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I was just trying to
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:33,984	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Be happy
EDL	00:38:35,008	00:38:36,032	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	She said she just wanted
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:37,568	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Something that was her
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:38,336	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Yes
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:40,896	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Yes I had anyone ever done this
EDL	00:38:40,896	00:38:42,688	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Backflip onto one blade before
EDL	00:38:43,200	00:38:43,712	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	No
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:47,296	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	No no no I'm the one who created this one

EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:12,896	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Story end
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:16,736	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Well as she retired from figure skating after
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:17,760	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	The 98 Olympics
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:19,808	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	She continues
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:20,576	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	What to do
EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:21,600	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Isozaki
EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:22,624	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Occasionally
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:27,488	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	But right now I think the main thing that she's doing is she's coaching she was in Minnesota
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:29,792	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And she's coaching and skaters yes
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:31,072	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Black women weed
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:33,120	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Ask people like oh did she
EDL	00:39:33,120	00:39:33,632	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	She
EDL	00:39:34,144	00:39:35,168	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Did she changed
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:35,936	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	The sport
EDL	00:39:35,936	00:39:36,704	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Did she change figures
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:37,984	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Answer the
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:38,496	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Giving
EDL	00:39:39,264	00:39:40,032	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	No
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:40,800	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Oh she did
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:43,872	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	You know sound like all of a sudden
EDL	00:39:44,640	00:39:48,992	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Ito figure skating rinks across the country but across the world are flooded with
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:53,088	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Little black girls learning their sock house in their Lexus and things like that
EDL	00:39:53,088	00:39:55,392	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I will say for my
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:39:56,416	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	From what I can
EDL	00:39:56,416	00:39:57,184	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Until
EDL	00:39:57,184	00:39:58,976	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	For the first time that there are
EDL	00:39:59,744	00:40:01,024	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	There's more than one
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:02,304	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Black
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:03,072	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Skater
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:03,584	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Competing
EDL	00:40:04,096	00:40:10,240	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	At the same time internationally at least by their backflips
EDL	00:40:13,056	00:40:13,824	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	They are still
EDL	00:40:16,384	00:40:17,408	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	So
EDL	00:40:18,432	00:40:19,200	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	This is sort of like
EDL	00:40:19,712	00:40:20,224	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Almost
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:22,016	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	This way to blip
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:22,784	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	On the skating
EDL	00:40:23,552	00:40:24,320	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Where's he was just
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:27,392	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	You know no one would like her before
EDL	00:40:27,904	00:40:30,208	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	And there hasn't really been anyone like
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:33,792	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	But there is this kind of ironic
EDL	00:40:33,792	00:40:34,560	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	I guess we just did
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:36,096	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	If
EDL	00:40:36,096	00:40:37,376	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	You took her and
EDL	00:40:37,376	00:40:39,680	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	NNU put her in competition
EDL	00:40:39,680	00:40:40,448	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Today if she was
EDL	00:40:41,216	00:40:42,752	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Competing on the world stage
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:43,520	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Today
EDL	00:40:43,520	00:40:44,032	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	She would
EDL	00:40:44,544	00:40:46,336	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Probably do better than she
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:47,360	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	She did back then
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:48,896	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	They've changed the
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:52,224	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	These are the scoring systems hope so now
EDL	00:40:52,224	00:40:53,760	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	You get points
EDL	00:40:53,760	00:40:56,064	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	For doing the kinds of power moves that
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:41:00,928	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	She was doing way back when and and even if you if you spill even if you fail at those moves
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:02,208	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	You still got
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:04,256	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	You get points for trying
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:05,280	| radiolab_podcast16ontheedge |	Yeah
