EDL	00:01:02,464	00:01:06,560	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I like a bomba
EDL	00:01:07,584	00:01:09,120	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	My parents recently moved to this
EDL	00:01:09,120	00:01:15,520	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Marshy swampy area near the Intracoastal Waterway which is like a connecting series of

EDL	00:01:17,312	00:01:19,104	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And we grew up in Ohio and he was like

EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:38,560	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Okay so this is the story of the story is
EDL	00:01:38,560	00:01:44,960	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	So my parents first move there and remember going out on the docks with my dad and we are sort of looking at the beautiful
EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:46,240	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Marsh rides
EDL	00:01:46,240	00:01:48,288	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And it was really weird sound like
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:49,312	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Coming off the water
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:53,920	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I recently took my nieces and nephew out to see if they could
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:58,016	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Allen vs
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:01:59,040	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	They're not going to move
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:01,088	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Are not going to squeak

EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:02,880	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Not going to talk
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:06,720	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Okay so we leaned down off the dock and see if we can hear it
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:16,192	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Oh my gosh I hear some Crackle
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:18,496	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	That crackling sound
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:20,032	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Yeah what is that
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:27,456	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	That was a question
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:31,296	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It sounds
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:32,064	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Sounds like rice
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:41,280	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Most of the scientist you talked to say it sounds like bacon frying or Twigs crackling in a fire
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:42,816	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Maybe have a large.
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:48,192	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I would say that except there's no bubbles popping like on the water
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:51,520	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Oh so it's not a gaseous emission it's a
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:52,288	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Clickety clack
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,824	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Let me just pay you a better record
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:54,848	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Yeah but up
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:57,152	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	What do I have to put it through the producer PC
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:02,528	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I went.
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:04,064	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	This is actually under water report
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:06,880	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Oh my God
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:15,840	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Cashing a teeny world that would be like the 4th of July
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:21,472	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Kevin Bacon Bacon you're frying what is the sound what is it
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:27,616	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	This sound is a very tiny
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:30,432	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Welded the story started in the forties
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:37,344	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	That's Michelle over spouse of physical Acoustics and medical Acoustics at the University of Toronto in the
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:39,392	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Basically what he said is
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:44,512	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	World War II is the first war were like really using submarines and sonar
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:51,424	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And so you've got all of these u.s. Navy submarines down deep in the ocean and they're like listening out for the
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:54,752	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The enemy but what happened is all they hear is this
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:04:00,896	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Like crazy crackling sound levels that were measured so very very until
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:07,808	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	He says in some instances is actually interfering with the sonar
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:12,928	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I found a classified document that was Declassified right after the war
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:14,720	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Wear the Navy they actually
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:16,512	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Tired
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:22,911	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Actually hired this scientist is guy named Martin Johnson this is in California San Diego
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:25,727	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Go at the scripture hired this guy to figure out
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:32,127	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	What is the sound like what is the sound we're hearing like all over the ocean what is it already
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:33,407	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Tell me what the damn sound
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:34,687	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Yes well
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:41,087	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It turns out I don't want to go too fast year notice in those years that that sound originated
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:41,855	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Tickets from
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:43,647	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Bishop B's Tampa
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:44,927	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It was
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:48,767	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Shrimp oh yeah shrimp is called a snapping shrimp
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:49,535	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Or a pistol
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:54,399	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Pistol like that
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:05:00,287	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	An interesting lead I found these like Old Navy recording
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:02,847	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Did they win
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:09,759	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Give to the Navy guys were they had to learn the sounds they were hearing coming in through the ship and through the sonar
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:14,623	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Work with the Expendables radio tunnel Bowie you will probably hear many sound other than submarine
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:18,207	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It was like this is the sound of a snapping turtle
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:20,255	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It produces a harsh clicking noise
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:27,935	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Okay shrimp sonar cool I get it in there
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:34,335	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And then I found with altamese be a crazy article which is newspaper clipping from 19
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:35,103	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	46
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:36,639	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Basically says
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:39,455	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Shrimps Help win the war
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:46,879	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And it's about how the American Navy admitted that one of their tactical sings during
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:53,279	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Like World War II was that they would hide their submarines in the beds of these trim
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:59,679	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	So I like the Japanese submarines couldn't detect our shift
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:00,447	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Visibility clothes
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:01,215	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Yes
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:06,335	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And according to Michelle the US would also speakers on the hull of the ship
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:08,127	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	22 simulator
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:12,735	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Snapping shrimp it was sound camo
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:17,599	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Yeah so we may we are these are they like normal normal shrimp cocktail shrimp
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:20,415	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Welder about the 5 cm
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:22,719	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	2in feel like smaller than a shrimp
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:25,279	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Depends what sort of shrimp you eat
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:27,071	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Why do whatever
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:29,375	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	River Red Lobster
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:33,215	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	If they're that small how are they making that sound
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:33,727	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	That
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:36,543	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Is Xanax
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:38,847	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Silly question we where do you think the sound comes from
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:41,151	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I'm thinking
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:41,663	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It's
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:43,967	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Fish and bees are eating
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:44,991	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	There
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:48,575	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Illinois's is there little
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:52,671	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Woosh Beauty teeth
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:54,207	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	TV I think it comes from
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:55,231	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	They're like
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:07:00,863	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Clotting easy and that's what you would think right like especially if you look at these things up close they have
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:02,143	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Two front claws
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:02,911	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:06,751	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The clothes aren't the same on each side that's Nancy Knowlton a marine biologist
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:07,263	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Snapping shrimp
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:08,543	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Expert
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:13,407	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Claudette specialized for pinching and a class tiny and a Claddagh specialized for snap
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:15,199	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And that clot is like
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:18,783	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Exponentially bigger it's like 10 times
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:19,551	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	20
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:23,135	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Maybe three times bigger is quite a bit bigger
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:25,695	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And so they use it to defend themselves against
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:27,743	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Potential predators are competitors
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:29,535	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	They're very territorial
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:35,935	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	She doesn't want shrimp runs into another shrimp can get into these prolonged snapping matches where they snap at each other to show
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:40,543	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Me this means bigger and stronger
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:41,823	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Okay Vine
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:42,591	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Anakin
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:44,639	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Mike Judge how big they are by the
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,919	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Power of the snap
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:47,199	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	All of which is to say
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:49,247	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	My niece Sophie's guess
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:50,271	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Their likes
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:55,647	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Clotting issue of course it's like the two sides of the claw just like snapping
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:59,231	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Just like you snap your fingers like this just a snap
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:00,767	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Snap without and turns out not to be
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:02,815	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	So not true
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:03,583	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Who sings
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:09,983	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Were wrong basically with a picture so I don't know if you ever try to clap your hands
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:11,775	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	In swimming pool
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:18,175	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Underwater but never difficult you don't feel very smart
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:24,575	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	That's not a lot of that is because there's a lubrication layer water in between that prevents direct mechanical
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:30,975	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Contact yes there's this lubricating layer between the two claw halves and it makes snapping hard
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:34,559	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And the second problem was that sound the same way too loud
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:35,839	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	When they measure the
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:38,655	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The decibel level of a single snap
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:44,799	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	220 decibels of sound that that can be produced by by single snap
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:47,359	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	To put that in context that is basically equivalent to
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:55,039	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	From Just One Snap
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:56,063	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	But it's very
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:57,087	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Impulsive
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:58,879	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Sinsaenum very very short
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:08:59,391	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Jewish
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:02,463	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Still sick one of the loudest sounds in the ocean
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:04,255	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	So Michelle was like
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:05,791	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Probably more than snapping
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:06,559	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I'm going on here
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:08,351	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Yes I said so
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:14,751	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	So it was 1999 a new high-speed camera in our lab
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:16,031	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Camera at
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:19,871	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The shrimp and see what happens when they say shrimp
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:20,639	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Snapchat
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:24,991	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Claw they takes a little shrimps and they glue screws on their butts
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:28,575	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Igloo screws on them
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:30,879	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Screw them into tiny platforms
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:35,999	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It's like a little aquarium so that they were fixed in space and that was important
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:39,071	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Because I happened in like a microsecond and they need to keep it
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:41,631	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Still see the camera can focus right on the clock
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:45,727	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And to do the experiment what we needed to do was to tickle them a little bit
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:46,495	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	With the paintbrush
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:50,079	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	You tickle them with a paintbrush
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:51,871	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	They're closed
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:54,687	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Nmda
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:55,455	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And then
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:56,223	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Fires
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:57,759	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And the camera captures
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:59,807	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The entire thing was like thousands of frames
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:03,391	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Did they say anything they did see something
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:06,975	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	What it what happened what is it when they look at the footage of the moment
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:09,279	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Just after its snaps
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:12,863	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	In super slow-mo very blurry
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:13,375	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Object
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:15,679	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	In front of the shrimp
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:19,263	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	What will blurry had it was just like bloppy Blurry something
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:21,311	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It was blurry blurry especially
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:25,151	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I mean it turned out that we were
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:26,175	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Certified auto focus
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:30,527	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	So they refocus the camera they do the same thing they take all the shrimp the cloth snaps
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:32,831	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And they see that win the claw snap
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:34,367	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	They see
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:35,391	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Dislike
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:38,463	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	In front of the shrimp
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:41,279	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Claw and it turns out that it's that bubble that's
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:42,303	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Causing
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:43,583	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The noise and
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:48,959	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	This is so much undersea turmoil
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:53,311	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	In with the high-speed camera they were sort of able to see how it all breaks down
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,335	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Netsertive unfold like
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:11:01,247	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	What actually happens when this Club closes is that
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:07,647	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The water that is in between these claws to squeeze out at high speed
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,927	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The typical speed
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:15,327	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Can be up to 60 miles per hour
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:18,399	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	60 miles per hour in what happens is
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,935	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	China jet
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:26,335	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Empty spaces created like a little voice
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:32,735	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	All the water molecules in that space cuz they start to expand outwards
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:39,135	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And essentially they just become like a little gas bubble change from liquid to gas
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:45,279	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	They actually go from like liquid is like tightly packed molecules and then as they spread out they become like gaseous
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:52,191	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And they create this like little bubble pocket in the middle of the huge ocean and as they have all the space they like
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:58,591	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I can figure and bigger and bigger until the oceans like nope microseconds later the ocean star
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:11:59,615	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Cushing
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:03,711	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Back in on this bubble and the all the little the little love
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:07,039	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Are molecules in the Indus bubble have nowhere to go in there
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:10,879	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Force closer and closer together and so they really want to get away from
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:16,511	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	All those are molecules but you're pushing them together really hard and since they can't get away from each other like that
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:18,303	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Energy build-up super super
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:21,119	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Acute pressure Rises and the temperature rises
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:24,191	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Really Rises
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:30,591	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	5000 degrees the surface of the Sun is also 5000 degrees
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:34,431	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Sit inside the bubble turns to plasma
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:39,807	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And that plasma image very short intense flash of light
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:44,927	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Edesur bubble inflows and then
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:51,327	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Like a microsecond later degenerates to Shockwave
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:53,887	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And that Shockwave
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:55,167	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Will basically
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:56,703	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Kill or stun
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:13:03,103	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Any I pray that this nearby somebody from the College of exaggeration graduated this
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,127	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Explanation
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:05,663	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Because you
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:12,575	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Teeny little animals
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:14,623	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Okay
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:16,415	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	That's amazing
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:21,023	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	How Eeveelution Master created this kind of Sonic weapon
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:22,047	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	So basically
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:29,471	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Quality
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:31,519	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Generate huge bubbles Heat
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:33,055	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It's like
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:35,103	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The Black Veil
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:36,383	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Spitting out light
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:37,663	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	End
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:39,711	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Hot hot hot temperature
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:40,223	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Yeah
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:41,247	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Does that mean
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:46,111	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	That's crazy I feel like it should be like a Marvel
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:47,135	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Character
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:47,647	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Totaling
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:50,975	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Yeah cuz if you scaled this up
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:52,511	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The bubble bee the size of a basque
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:54,559	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Humanscale
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:55,583	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	What can I do with a basket
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:56,607	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Fall of sun Heat
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:57,887	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Light
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:14:01,471	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Rule the world
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:11,455	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Song about with my sister's hanging off the dock she asks like can we use this to power like
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:12,991	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Make the world or something
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:14,271	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Know the answer was no
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:16,831	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	But the same physical process
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:19,135	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Disease that are involved in the shrimp Bubba
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:19,903	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Pulse right sole
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:20,927	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The temperature in
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:21,695	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Heat that bubbles
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:22,975	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Create
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:25,791	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Researchers became really excited about is there a way to
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:27,327	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Harness this bubble power
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:31,935	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Yeah that's also a Hollywood movie I think I did it
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:38,335	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Is it stable on powerful couples with Tatiana Reeves Rd
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:44,735	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	There is enough energy in this glass of water to power the city of Chicago
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:47,551	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Went too far
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:53,695	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Taken with the web
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:54,975	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	With the weapon possibility
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:56,767	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Yeah my nephew got excited about
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:58,303	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Bastille
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:14:59,071	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	But
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:06,239	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I hate to tell you I don't think there are any you can like make a bear claw tub
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:07,007	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Sorry guys
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:10,335	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	There is one thing
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:11,871	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Where
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:16,223	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Researchers are thinking about using bubbles in this goes beyond the shrimp bubble
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:17,759	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	In a way that
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:18,271	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Save-A-Lot
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:40,799	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	My name is Josie Packard I'm calling from Columbia South Carolina where do you live is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:45,151	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Foundation for enhancing public understanding of Science and Technology in the modern world
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:49,503	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	More information about Sloan at www.slha.org
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:57,183	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	This is Radiolab now going to go back to the story from Molly Webster
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:16:01,023	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	You were saying people here are trying to use bubble power
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:02,815	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Save lives
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:05,887	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Yeah so when I was talking to Michelle versluis
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:06,655	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Applications
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:13,055	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	We're talking on the phone and he explains all the crazy bubbly stuff and somehow like in the middle of a conversation
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:14,591	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And he just said
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:16,639	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	If you think the shrimp bubbles are cool
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:18,943	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Everything we know about the shrimp bubbles like
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:20,223	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Can also be like
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:22,783	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Adapted to use bubbles in the body
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:23,807	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Oh and I
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:29,695	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Like what in the body is
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:33,023	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Totally I had the same thought like when divers get the bends or when they like
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:39,167	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Tap bubbles out of IV lines and stuff but these are very very small bubbles smaller than red blood cells
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:39,935	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	According to her
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:44,799	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Are sloths there like 1 20th the size of human hair
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:50,943	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And he told me about how in Toronto and they actually just did this for the first time in November
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:52,479	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	On a patient
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:56,063	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	They're using bubbles to get across the blood-brain barrier
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:17:00,159	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	What is what exactly is the brain
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:00,927	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Blood-brain barrier
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:02,207	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It sells or is it
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:05,279	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Yeah in tissue super super tightly packed
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:06,303	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Cells
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:09,887	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Is there a sits between the bloodstream and the Brain
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:11,679	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It's like this protective wall
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:15,519	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And it keeps out all is like the nasty stuff so it keeps out any like
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:17,823	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Bacteria or viruses that would be
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:23,199	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	In your bloodstream can't get past the wall to get into your brain I kind of keep thinking of it as like
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:29,087	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I've never actually watched Game of Thrones except for like one episode and if there was this
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:30,367	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Giant wall
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:31,647	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Yeah
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:33,695	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	To protect
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:36,767	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Civilization from third of all of the the bad thing
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:37,279	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The Wild Thing
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:39,839	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It was made of ice and it went up
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:46,239	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Forever I kind of feel like that wall in Game of Thrones is like the barrier
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:46,751	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Are between
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:49,055	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The rest of the body in the brain
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:53,151	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	But you said it's there to protect the brain so why would you want to punch a hole
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:18:00,319	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Well you can imagine that if somebody has a brain tumor and we want to deliver chemicals in there that we think can
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:01,855	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Help fight the tumor
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:05,439	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Those chemicals the brain does not want in there
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:07,999	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	So the blood-brain barrier can create problems
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:09,023	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	According to Todd
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:11,071	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Give me a price on a neurosurgeon at Sunnybrook
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:15,679	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	He's part of the team in Toronto that using this new bubble technique and here's how it works
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:20,543	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Okay so say you got a tumor on the right side of your brain right above your ears
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:23,615	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	You're so mean price in the team will stick you in a chair and then I'll put a helmet on
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:24,639	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Special helmet
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:27,455	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	This helmet has 1024
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:29,759	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Ultrasound transducers
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:31,807	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And we aim
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:35,391	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	2024 Altima same spot
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:38,463	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Right on the spot at the wall where the tumor sets
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:39,743	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Just on the other side
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:40,511	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Just Out Of Reach
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:43,327	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Okay so they all the ultrasound waves kind of
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:45,375	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Focus at that one area
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:48,703	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And then we we inject the bubbles
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:52,287	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	How many bubbles are in adults
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:54,079	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Like hundreds of thousands
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:56,639	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Play just put an IV in your arm
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:59,711	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And the bubbles go in
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:06,111	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	A no-go like into your arm like over your shoulder into your heart to your lungs back to your heart eventually some of them will get
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:12,511	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Up to the brain approximately 28 seconds from the time we inject the bubble into arm vein to buy time
EDL	00:19:12,511	00:19:16,351	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I start going into a brain and eventually some of those bubbles get up
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:18,655	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	To the blood-brain barrier that wall
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:24,287	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	To the spot without laser beam is focused at specific spot is tumor sitting on the other side of and when they cross
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:27,103	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Have with that beat
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:29,663	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Ultrasound waves causes
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:32,479	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The microbubbles to oscillate in size
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:39,647	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Google big and small big and small big mouth
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:46,047	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Bubble dance party so at this really specific part in the brain and it can be small
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:52,447	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Smaller than like 1 millimeter by 1 mm Square all these bubbles are dancing and what that does is it
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:58,847	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Causes the wall specific spot to almost loose it and so like a little
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:20:05,247	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Like a window of space or a little hole is created in that wall and if you happen to have chemo
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:10,879	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Therapy in your blood which you will because ahead of time the minute that hole is open
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:16,255	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Good ideas to chemotherapy in your bloodstream would be able to just order
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:19,071	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Flow through that opening and get straight to that brain tumor
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:22,143	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Instead of using sound to turn the
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:23,423	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Bubbles and Tall dancing robot
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:25,727	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Yeah drill through the wall
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:28,799	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Wow now that the bodies of living organism
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:30,335	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	So
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:32,127	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Over the next
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:36,479	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	6 to 12 hours they will close those
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:37,247	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Gaps
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:38,015	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Transient
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:39,295	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Meaning
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:41,087	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It heals itself
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:44,927	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	In about 6 to 12 hours and you say they try this on someone
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:45,951	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Yeah last November
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:47,743	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And I think it went well
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:50,815	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	One of the things these researchers said was
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:51,327	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Once
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:54,655	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	You're able to open these passageways
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:55,679	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	To the brain
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:21:02,591	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It's not just chemo that can get in there but like suddenly any type of drug you might want to send through can can get through
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:08,223	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Through and we just never had access to the Brain before in that way and there's a question of
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:10,527	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	How will drugs interact with the brain
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:13,599	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Kind of don't know they've they've never been there before
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:17,440	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It's like a whole new frontier
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:21,280	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Using shrimp in time is done
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:25,376	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	So
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:28,960	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I mean basically all boils down to the same
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:30,752	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Physics of bubbles that we have
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:35,360	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Learn from the shrimp that we can apply to many other
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:37,152	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Applications
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:45,088	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Wicked put it on the radio so you'll hear it.
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:45,856	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	People that like
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:47,648	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Why do people don't like shrimp
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:52,256	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Then they'll just keep it
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:56,864	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I make no promises this is gone on the radio
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:09,920	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Molly Webster this piece was produced by Molly and
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:12,480	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Annie McEwen with help from our guest sound designer
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:18,880	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Jeremy Bloom special thanks to clear the James Byrd Lawrence from Aunt Sophia

EDL	00:22:30,400	00:22:35,776	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Next up a story from our producer Simon Adler who who got interested in bubbles
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:37,056	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Sasha Molly founder shrimpy's
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:41,408	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Got instant Bubbles and you manage to find a guy named Dave Stein
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:43,200	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Who is taking bubbling
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:47,040	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	To a whole new level why is a bigger bubble better
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:51,648	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Really trying to make things bigger is a function of growing up
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:55,744	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I don't know I always thought this was kind of inherent in the
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:57,792	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Human psyche is
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:00,608	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	He's bigger and better and so
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:03,168	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Well we might even make this
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:05,216	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Stein's law
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:06,752	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Okay
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:11,872	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Spain's law
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:13,152	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	A bubble of bubbling
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:15,200	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Stein's law of size
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:17,248	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Turn off the top of my head
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:17,760	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Air Bud
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:19,552	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	For any given
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:20,576	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Object
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:22,624	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	There is
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:23,392	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Hey
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:24,928	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Larger size
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:27,488	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Such that the nature
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:28,512	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	What's the object
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:30,560	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Is transformed
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:34,144	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	In simple English what would that be in the
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:35,680	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	As something gets bigger it gets
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:37,216	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	What
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:38,496	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Okay
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:39,008	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Take
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:40,544	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Jupiter
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:41,568	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Okay gaseous
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:42,080	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Planets
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:43,616	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	All right
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:45,152	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Gates fuel tank
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:46,688	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Jupiter bigger and bigger
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:49,248	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Bigger and bigger at there is a size
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:50,784	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	At which
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:51,296	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It becomes
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:52,320	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Star
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:54,368	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Hagen it ignites
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:55,648	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The Sun
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:57,696	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It transcends what it was
EDL	00:23:58,464	00:23:58,976	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Then
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:01,280	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Can a bubble get so big
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:04,608	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	That it's no longer even a bubble
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:06,912	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Well
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:08,960	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Before the invention
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:09,472	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Of the bubble
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:10,496	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	1980
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:12,288	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Bubbles
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:14,336	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	We always thought of as
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:16,384	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Being relatively small
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:17,920	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And relatively round
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:19,456	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	But
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:20,480	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	As soon as you get
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:23,040	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Up to a certain size
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:24,064	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Say
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:25,344	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	5 foot diameter
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:26,624	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Kind of in that rain
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:29,440	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I know suddenly they're not round any
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:31,488	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:33,280	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	They don't pop in the same way
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:39,424	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	People who would think of bubbles popping instantaneously because they're thinking it was a little round bubbles
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:39,936	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The dime store
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:41,472	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And what really happened
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:43,264	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	In
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:45,056	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Very large bubbles like the ones
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:46,848	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	My friends make
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:49,664	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The Bible doesn't pop
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:50,688	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Instantaneously
EDL	00:24:51,200	00:24:51,968	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It gets
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:55,040	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Punctured at a certain point and then it
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:56,576	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Ripped open like a zipper
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:58,624	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And there's a sound to it
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:24:59,392	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It kind of goes
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:02,464	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Pie tap
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:04,768	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	So it's not
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:06,560	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It's
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:10,656	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	A from 100 this long bubble
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:11,680	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	To the other
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:13,472	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Can we back up to
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:16,800	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Tell me the story of how you like why
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:20,128	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Who were you in 1984 when you're like
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:20,640	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I'm going to make
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:21,920	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	This bubbles
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:23,968	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	What what what what motivated Olive
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:28,832	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Well what motivated all of this was I was in architecture
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:29,856	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The time I was working
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:32,160	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	For Heidi Holtzman Pfeiffer very fashionable
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:35,232	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Affirm downtown and he says he spent his days designing these
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:37,024	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Really intricate building
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:37,792	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Swear like
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:39,072	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Glass staircases
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:41,376	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Meet the stonework of the building at a
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:42,912	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	45° angle
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:43,680	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And the roof is going
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:45,728	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Another I don't have to work down to the
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:46,496	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	16th of an inch
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:48,800	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Wasn't very happy
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:51,104	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	In fact
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:52,384	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I used to worry about
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:53,152	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Structural collapse
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:56,224	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	He said he'd be walking down the streets of Manhattan
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:58,528	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Imagining some building he was building in his mind
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:01,600	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Say the addition to
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:06,464	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Did the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts at he's imagining this building and then all of a sudden his mind with shipt
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:07,488	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Worry
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:08,512	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	About that building collapse
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:11,072	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And he says this just kept happening with every project
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:12,608	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	All these buildings
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:19,008	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Crashing to the ground and just keep you up at night did you wake up yeah I felt I had to
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:21,568	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I felt it as read
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:23,872	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Architecture it's my responsibility
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:25,408	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Imagine all the possible
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:28,992	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Disaster does it became this not-so-healthy
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:30,016	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Occupational obsession
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:33,344	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Y
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:33,856	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	That's good for us
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:35,904	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Let me tell you something
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:39,232	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I'm probably getting some of these details are on but
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:42,048	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	My grandfather
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:43,328	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Clarence
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:44,096	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Balky
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:45,376	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Wasn't metallurgy
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:45,888	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Is true
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:48,704	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Had something to do with
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:52,288	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Building the atomic bomb and so does my uncle
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:53,568	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:56,128	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	My mother was
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:57,920	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Quite traumatized by being a
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:58,688	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Daughter of
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:26:59,200	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The bomb source
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:00,480	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Distance
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:02,016	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Became part of the family Legacy
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:03,552	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Maybe
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:04,832	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	When did way into his psyche
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:06,112	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Poisoned his work
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:08,416	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Oh that's just the way
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:09,696	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I registered it
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:14,560	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I underworld trying to basically trying to say was that I was not really happy
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:15,072	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	He is an architect
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:20,192	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Anyway that summer 1984 my little daughter Kayla
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:21,472	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Who was 1 and 1/2
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:26,080	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Saw a man blowing bubbles with one of those little Dime Store watch and
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:26,848	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	She was just
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:28,128	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Transfixed
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:32,224	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Transported to another Realm
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:36,064	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And so says from that point on
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:37,856	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	We were always blowing bubbles
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:42,720	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	All kinds of small bubbles medium ones large when he says pretty quick he started to wonder
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:44,512	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	How can we make you fall asleep
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:48,096	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Kiwi Hues so you know we cut out the ends of
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:50,656	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The coffee can help dip when it in the soap
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:51,680	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Glue to the other
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:53,728	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Maybe a bubble that might be
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:58,592	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Foot foot in diameter tried getting a coat hanger and bench
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:28:00,128	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Do a circle dipping that into
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:01,152	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Do a frying pan full of soap
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:04,480	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It was that you can make a bubble Maybe
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:09,856	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Truth or Dare or something your daughter getting more and more excited as the bubbles get bigger is this about you
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:12,672	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	She was getting kind of bored with it
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:15,232	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Actually Dave started to get a little upset
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:16,512	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Yes that's
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:18,048	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	True
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:19,072	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And I was thinking
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:23,936	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Yeah this is an interesting design problem maximizing the size of a bubble
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:26,496	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	How you go about initially thought was
EDL	00:28:26,496	00:28:29,056	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	This is kind of everyone's thought when they
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:29,824	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Start thinking about the
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:32,384	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	You just need a bigger Circle
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:34,432	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	A bigger hoop through wish to blow the bubble
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:39,552	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Like a hula hoop with a handle on it and you would need a little one for solar Plastics
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:40,320	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Swimming pools
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:41,856	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Full of bubble soap with starts
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:42,368	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Seemed kind of like
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:44,672	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Soprema design perspective
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:46,208	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	How do you scale that up
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:48,768	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	You can't just keep making the hoop and bucket bigger
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:49,536	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	That seems crazy
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:52,096	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	So at that point I was sort of
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:55,680	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Stuck at whatever he was going on with his life designing buildings
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:28:59,008	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	But then he says one day in the summer of 1984
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:00,544	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I was
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:02,080	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Lying in bed
EDL	00:29:02,080	00:29:03,872	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	One morning I can still remember the
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:05,408	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Pattern of
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:06,176	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Fractions
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:08,736	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	See the idea hit him like a ton of bubble-shaped
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:11,552	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Why not have a collapsible
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:12,832	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:14,368	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Sort of instantly saw his
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:15,136	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Sing in my mind it
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:16,928	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It was what we now know as
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:18,208	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The bubble bubble
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:19,488	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And so
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:23,072	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I hate leaps out of bed heads to the hardware store buys his stuff
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:24,352	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And I bought
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:26,400	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The doll and the chain in the vast
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:28,704	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Freetone start assembling the device
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:32,288	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And what were you and your kitchen where were you when you were doing we don't do this
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:35,616	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	You stepped outside and what he had in his hands
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:37,664	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Was really nothing more than like
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:39,712	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Stick with a loop of chain
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:42,272	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And one of the loop
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:44,576	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Slide up and down on this
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:46,880	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	So that you could expand
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:47,648	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	In collapse the loop
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:53,280	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	That's the beauty of this design to have that control and be able to close
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:54,304	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Back in the backyard
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:56,608	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Close to Luther it was just like a
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:57,376	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Record like
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:29:58,400	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Straight cord
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:30:02,496	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I dumped it in the bucket of soap I raise it up I open the loop
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:05,312	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Right away this huge
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:06,848	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Bubble
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:08,640	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Starts
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:11,200	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Coming out tube stretches for 7 8 ft
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:12,224	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	He's not sure
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:14,528	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	But at a certain point he closes the loop
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:15,296	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Pinch It Off
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:17,344	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And now it's a free-floating bubble
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:19,392	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And it's sailing way over there
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:21,952	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Over the Housetop and through the fog
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:23,744	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Tell me there's a
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:25,536	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Gigantic bubbles floating away
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:27,072	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Biggest bubble ever
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:27,584	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Loan
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:30,912	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I believe since it was somewhere between the size of a
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:32,448	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Refrigerator in a car
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:33,984	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Iridescent is wobbly
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:35,776	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And then suddenly
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:42,432	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	What did you feel in that moment
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:47,296	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Bring your doctor Frankenstein who would just let this monster out in the world
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:48,832	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Hi I got this
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:52,928	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Cold thrill going down my spine I'll never forget
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:54,464	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Desi sent more and more of these
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:55,488	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Into the air
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:59,584	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Pretty soon people started arriving in their cars and trucks
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:02,912	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Everybody was
EDL	00:31:02,912	00:31:04,192	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Totally astonished
EDL	00:31:06,240	00:31:08,800	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I thought this might be my ticket
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:11,616	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	How to draw architecture
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:15,968	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	So day was able to patent the bubble thing made enough money to get out of Arkham
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:20,832	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And in the process he transformed bubble-blowing for the thing that just like
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:21,600	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Kids do
EDL	00:31:22,880	00:31:26,208	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Kind of sport where you have like bubble athlete
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:32,608	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	My name is Gary Pearlman all over the world in Mexico they call me
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:37,728	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I currently am the champion the heavyweight the big boy people are playing like really big
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:44,640	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	You can picture to 18 wheelers stacked on top of one another that's about how big
EDL	00:31:44,640	00:31:45,664	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The bubble was
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:47,712	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	That's a slight exaggeration but anyways
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:50,784	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	There are debates going on about what kind of soap to use
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:51,552	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Which is the best
EDL	00:31:51,552	00:31:53,344	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Polymer to add to that so
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:54,368	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And what kind of
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:55,648	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Fabric to use for the loop
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:31:58,464	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	But despite all this experimentation
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:32:02,304	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Pretty much everyone uses a variation of Dave's original idea
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:07,168	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Read these people are sort of my followers you see I find it very interesting
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:09,472	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	That you had this fear of your buildings collapse
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:13,056	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I'm sure you go into this world where
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:15,360	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	All of the things you're making are meant to
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:16,640	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Collapse
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:18,432	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Well that here's the thing
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:20,736	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It's true that every bubble will
EDL	00:32:21,504	00:32:22,016	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Collapse
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:23,808	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	But there's no blame
EDL	00:32:26,112	00:32:27,904	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Nobody got hurt
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:31,744	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I think we might be able to get
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:32,256	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I'm here
EDL	00:32:36,864	00:32:39,424	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	So that night Dave took me out Bubba
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:43,520	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Baking powder we have thermometer we have test
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:46,848	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Strips for measuring pH humidity
EDL	00:32:46,848	00:32:51,456	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Settings okay but the wind is so amount of wind is usually very difficult. So good
EDL	00:32:51,968	00:32:54,272	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	So we'll go down and try to find some
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:55,808	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Shelter gets around the corner
EDL	00:32:56,320	00:32:57,856	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Of what West End
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:32:59,136	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	106 to EUR
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:01,440	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Midnight in Manhattan
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:02,464	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Pretty much empty
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:03,488	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Couple cars
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:04,768	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Almost no one walking
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:06,304	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	So now I'm going to
EDL	00:33:06,304	00:33:07,584	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Junket in the show
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:10,400	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And now I'm going to raise it up
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:14,496	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And I'm going to open the loop and I'm going to see if I can make
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:18,336	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Pretty good
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:20,896	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It is
EDL	00:33:21,408	00:33:22,688	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Sailing along
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:26,016	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Into the intersection and
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:28,832	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The bubble is not chasing the taxi
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:31,392	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	That's about
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:32,160	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The size of a
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:33,696	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Killer whale
EDL	00:33:33,696	00:33:35,744	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Maybe 20 feet long
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:37,792	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	When you get these giant bubbles
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:39,328	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Sailing around
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:41,376	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Buildings
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:42,400	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It activates the
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:44,960	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Space he says it seems to transform the architect
EDL	00:33:45,472	00:33:46,752	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It definitely did
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:49,824	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Like I made this city
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:51,616	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Look Suddenly Beautiful and
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:53,664	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	A lava lamp
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:57,760	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Alien and we got some people I can buy that are now taking videos of them
EDL	00:33:58,784	00:33:59,808	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Look at that one
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:01,088	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Oh that's a great one
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:05,440	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	That's that's the size of a smallish baby elephant Maybe
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:09,024	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Okay and the taxi is now just done a U-turn to watch sncf
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:11,328	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	We got we got a bike messenger
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:16,960	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Who's rubbernecking is even at midnight an audience with material
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:21,568	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It just incredible like everybody okay New Yorkers are assholes
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:23,104	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	And people are stopping
EDL	00:34:23,104	00:34:25,408	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Richmond
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:28,224	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Stopping with smiles
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:31,552	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	We could detect he had just stopped in the middle of the road to watch you do this
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:34,368	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Zoe
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:38,464	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Do you often stop your taxi to look at a to look at things
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:41,536	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Before
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:45,120	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	This is our life like this
EDL	00:34:47,936	00:34:49,984	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	It's so silly write it very silly
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:51,776	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Very wonderful
EDL	00:34:56,384	00:34:57,664	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Is vacated
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:00,224	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Yeah that's
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:01,760	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The size of a killer whale for sure
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:03,552	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Do you ever feel silly out here
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:06,112	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:08,160	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Sometimes too but
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:10,208	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I also sometimes
EDL	00:35:10,720	00:35:12,768	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Compare myself to my grandfather
EDL	00:35:14,048	00:35:16,352	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Much happier to have invented
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:18,656	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	The giant bubble thing than having
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:20,448	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Invented the bong
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:24,800	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I also think you know
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:27,104	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	I in a way I
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:30,432	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Feel like I have started an art form and that is
EDL	00:35:30,432	00:35:32,736	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Going to go on and
EDL	00:35:34,016	00:35:40,416	| radiolab_podcast16biggerthanbacon |	Evolve
