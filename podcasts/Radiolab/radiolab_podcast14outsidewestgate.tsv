EDL	00:01:21,664	00:01:23,456	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	It was all about a struggle he was having
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:26,528	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Trying to figure out how to tell a story
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:28,320	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	That is true

EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:51,616	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Balmy Saturday afternoon Westgate Shopping Mall
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:53,920	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Crowded with more than a thousand shoppers
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:02:00,320	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Even more families than usual were there that day because there was a children's cooking competition in fact the kids were just sitting up

EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:34,880	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Listening to sounds of gunfire
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:36,160	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Trying to guess
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:41,024	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	What's happening inside because the prices of course not allowed in while this for this battle is ongoing
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:43,584	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Meanwhile I'm getting on the air every hour
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:49,984	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Trying to piece things together
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:51,008	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Coming my way
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:52,032	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	So I'm going to
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:57,664	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Gregory movers you need to move Wyoming
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:03:01,760	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	But my point is that there was no information at the scene other than this gunfire
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:04,320	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	What there was were
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:06,112	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	A whole bunch of Survivor

EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:10,464	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Helpless
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:17,632	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Help us a fact all the journalists were racing around interviewing eyewitnesses
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:22,496	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Buddy was I'm in everybody was really running for their lives
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:24,544	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Pocket dammit officials
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:27,104	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	To get a picture of what happened in the story
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:30,432	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	That emerges from the those interviews is basically.
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:30,944	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Stat
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:38,112	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	The number of terrorist inside that mall or at least in the beginning was 10 to 15 gunmen
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:44,512	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And I'm 15 gunmen 10 to 15 attackers to 15 armed militants with her profile is multi-ethnic
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:50,400	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Cancel the United Kingdom end
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:51,424	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Somalis

EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:59,360	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Mostly men but also including a British woman that young British
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:04,992	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Eyewitnesses eyewitnesses on different floors in the mall all talking about the Dare gun that the people they saw
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:07,040	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And it's this multi-ethnic group
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:13,184	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And then of course perhaps most alarmingly for the both of us living in Nairobi there's reports that at least one gun
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:14,720	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Had
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:19,327	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	After shooting some people thrown away his gun and actually escaped
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:21,631	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	With the fling Shoppers we hear that from a couple Witness
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:24,703	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	So that's the
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:26,239	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Initial story
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:28,543	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	But it's not really until 8 weeks later
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:30,847	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	In November
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:33,407	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	That us officials in fights
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:34,687	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	About
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:35,455	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Dozen
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:39,551	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	British and American journalist into a conference room in the US Embassy
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:41,087	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:43,647	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	We need an official there from the FBI
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:51,583	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Now we've known that the FBI was involved in the post-mortem analysis
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:52,095	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Senora join
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:53,887	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Shazam
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:55,935	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	This is like a global terrorism event so
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:05:02,847	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Can you head invited Scotland Yard and the FBI to figure out who these terrorists were but the FBI had not actual
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:04,127	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Said anything official
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:08,991	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	In this meeting inside the US Embassy what on what's called Deep background
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:15,391	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Which isn't even off the Record it's it's a it's a deeper level of secrecy we weren't at that time even allowed to say that
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:18,975	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	The Us official had said any of this stuff this was just information for us to know
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:25,119	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Since then I can talk about this meeting because everything that was repealed there has now become
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:27,423	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	A part of the public record in fact the FBI's
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:29,215	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Has come out publicly and said all these
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:31,007	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	But at the time this was new
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:32,799	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	End
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:34,591	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	What the FBI

EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:37,663	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Set the time was that his team
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:41,247	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Had access to all the closed-circuit camera footage
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:42,271	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Is the mall
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:44,831	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	The modern moth there's cameras everywhere
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:48,927	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	He seen it from the beginning to the end of the attack from all those different perspectives
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:50,719	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And according to that footage
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:52,255	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Everything
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:54,815	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	That we have reported
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:56,095	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	In those first few days
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:56,863	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Was Roth
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:59,679	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Ronnie running away
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:01,983	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Well friends in 10 to 15 terrorists
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:04,543	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Now they weren't 1015 terrorist it were for
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:08,639	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	For they also said okay you've been reporting this
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:14,271	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	This multi-ethnic Coalition of Arabs Kenyans and somalis that so many eye witnesses told you know
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:17,855	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	They're all somalis are all Somali ethnicity all four of them
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:20,415	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And there's also no evidence in any of the gunmen Escape
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:23,999	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Mcqs from his perspective with words
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:25,535	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	He trying to
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:27,327	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I don't know what we should read on this
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:29,375	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And I actually felt
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:30,143	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	China weather
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:31,935	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	People in that room felt
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:32,703	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Huge
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:34,239	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Sense of relief
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:40,639	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Because here we are all are trying to do the work of Journalism in a trying to get
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:42,431	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Credible testimony
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:43,199	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:45,247	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Suddenly here's a guy
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:46,271	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Saying
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:51,135	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Okay take away all that speculation all those contradictory stories all those different reports
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:53,183	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Here's some objective evidence
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:57,535	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	You can't see this day because it's secret for very Saints terrorism reasons but
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:58,815	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	This is
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:06:59,327	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Solid
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:04,191	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And after that time everybody was reporting the same thing
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:06,239	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Unreleased surveillance video shows
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:12,639	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Four armed assailants for terrorist
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:16,223	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Text are believed to be from Somalia are all somalis will confirm
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:17,759	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	All four were killed
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:22,111	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	So you kind of put a cap on all those kids
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:22,879	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Scary theories
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:29,791	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Speculations that were really feeling the media the slightest bit curious about what might have been left out
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:30,559	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	No I mean
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:32,607	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Well I guess I really felt was
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:35,167	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Was sort of empty
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:36,959	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Because
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:39,775	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And I'm not only a reporter
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:41,055	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	In Nairobi
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:47,455	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I'm also a person living in Nairobi to go to dinner parties I take my kid to
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:48,735	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Birthday parties end
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:53,343	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Special event in the first month after Westgate or so many
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:56,671	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	People in that mall invariably somebody would be there at the party you had
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:57,951	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Their own survivors
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:00,767	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And it's one thing to say oh well
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:03,839	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	That was all this eyewitness testimony no it's not
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:06,399	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Accurate but it's another thing to look into the
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:07,423	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	The eyes of somebody
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:08,447	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Who is
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:09,983	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Sitting there
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:12,031	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	With a paper plate of cake
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:15,359	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	In their hand telling you that the terrorist
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:16,383	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	The base
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,431	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Is not the terrorist
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:24,831	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	They saw on this bit of footage that have been released and was playing and heavy rotation on Kenyan television
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:28,671	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Is that happened more than once he was much more than what I mean

EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:36,351	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	They put my nickname former neighbor Vine in Nairobi
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:38,911	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Saturday morning to the Westgate Mall to get
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:40,703	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Present for her friend's daughter
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:45,055	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I think it was a puzzle a little puzzle for a 4 year old girl
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:47,615	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And I'm standing that I'm just about to pay
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:54,783	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And then automatic weapons
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:09:01,183	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Shooting the grenade tonight
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:06,303	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Competition didn't have much time to think I just ducked under one of those tables and then
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:12,703	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	You could hear people praying muttering prayers
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:17,055	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	She said she had a man gasping for breath
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:19,103	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And she says at one point
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:23,455	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Another woman was under the table with her and I were literally squeezed together
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:24,991	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	She was pregnant
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:27,039	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	She was pregnant
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:30,111	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And that's the first thing she said she's like
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:34,719	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I'm pregnant and I'm shot I didn't have the presence of mind to help her she basically
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:35,999	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Took one of those grapes
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:39,071	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And wrap it around
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:41,887	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	To stop the bleeding
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:43,167	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Later on I mean
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:47,263	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Cuz we were there for quite some time she said to me I'm dying
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:54,175	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And yeah that point of stroking her hair saying no you're not you're fine it's just your leg is just your leg
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:10:01,087	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Increases that while she was under that table she would try to peek up through the cloth and for the longest time I couldn't see anything
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:03,647	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Finally I see
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:04,159	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I see the guys
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:09,791	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	To those two young boys
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:13,119	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Cute little young innocent-looking boys
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:18,495	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	You know it's hard to imagine you can't reconcile what they're doing with how they look
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:25,407	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	One of them was was kind of I don't know maybe a 17 18 year old kid and cute
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,431	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I could just
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:28,735	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	See him as being the son of one of my friends
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:33,599	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	This particular one was closest to us was wearing a red t-shirt
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:38,207	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And here's where you get to a small but significant discrepancies
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:39,231	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Still haunts booty
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:41,023	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	She said she is sure
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:43,327	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	That the two guys she saw and pictures
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,607	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Few feet away from her
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:46,911	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Wearing short sleeve shirts
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:47,935	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And afterwards
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:49,215	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Keep seeing these
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:49,983	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Images
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:50,495	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	4 guys
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:52,543	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	None of them were wearing shorts
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:59,711	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	We're at the beginning if you remember there was saying there was 15 guys so then it kind of made sense that well the two guys that I saw
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:02,271	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	What different from the floor that were seeing on TV
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:05,855	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	But then when people like me start to report that there were only four
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:07,391	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Categorically only for guys
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:09,951	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Then I started to say wait wait a minute
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:12,511	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I saw their arms
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:14,559	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I know I saw a short
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:15,071	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Sleeve t-shirt
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:18,399	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	You know it just does not make sense nothing adds up
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:20,703	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Am I crazy
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:28,383	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Is my mind playing tricks on me I think I saw one thing and then I didn't but I'm quite sure I saw this I mean
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:30,943	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Everyday every moment of the day you're thinking about
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:33,247	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	What happened
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:36,831	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	What happened that day with these parties of your all these story
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:37,599	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Grace like ponies
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:38,111	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Is the word
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:40,159	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	The official narrative
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:40,927	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And yet
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:41,951	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	It felt real
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:44,767	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	All the details seemed weird enough to be true
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:45,791	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Surreal enough
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:48,607	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Picture of you know another person was talking about
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:50,911	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Yeah it's powerful story wear it with
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:55,007	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Man was shooting and then he got a phone call and
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:57,055	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Stop shooting long enough
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:58,591	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	To answer the phone
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:01,407	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And then hang up and
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:02,175	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Start shooting again
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:03,711	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Music
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:06,527	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	You don't make details like that up
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:09,087	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And this is what I think made things so awkward
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:12,671	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	At those conversations because they knew that the terrorists
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:13,439	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	They saw
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:14,463	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Was Jeff
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:16,767	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Then on the video
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:17,791	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:19,839	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	What that left them was
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:21,631	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Was two things one is that
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:24,191	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	That I might think that they were lying
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:27,007	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	End to that the
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:27,775	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Terrorist
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:28,287	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	That
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:30,847	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Haunts them is still out there
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:33,151	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	You know that guy could just be around
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:37,759	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	He could see me again
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:43,647	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And here's where things get a little
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:45,695	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Weird okay so this is 4 months later
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:52,351	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Definitely the new cyclist kind of moved on as a journalist I don't really have to report I must get anymore it's Saturday afternoon again

EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:27,391	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And one of the terrorists
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:29,439	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Came down the opposite way
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:31,231	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Down the escalator
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:33,023	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	What's pushing everybody down
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:37,631	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Somehow he says he got spun around the opposite direction of the crowd
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:40,703	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And then I saw him he gets a good look at this guy
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:41,727	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I saw the person
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:43,263	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Very clearly
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:45,311	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	This person who was an Arab guy
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:47,103	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	He says he's sure but yes
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:52,991	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And then he says that he ran and found a hiding spot and also something he pokes his head out
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:54,527	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And he saw him again
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:55,807	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	When I saw this guy
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:56,831	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Houston Tennis Club
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:01,439	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	April 20
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:02,463	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	What do tomatoes grow
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:04,511	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Then he was wearing another clock inside
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:06,559	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	When do the clocks change
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:08,095	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Basically says that
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:08,863	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	After that
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:09,375	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	First party
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:11,679	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	The guy changed his clothes
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:12,959	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Dropped his gun
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:13,727	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And then
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:15,007	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Insinuating himself
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:18,079	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And when we came out this guy joined us
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:20,127	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	He joined us
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:26,015	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	So when I swim outside and I was telling everybody he's one of them it was one of them but everybody was in shock
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:28,063	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Nobody Cuda
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:30,367	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	See what I'm saying
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:32,159	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	NN do you know what happened to him
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:33,183	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	No I don't
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:34,463	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Midea
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:37,023	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Okay so
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:40,095	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Back to the phone call in January that I was telling you about
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:42,655	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Farooqi calls me out of the blue
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:46,495	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	He says hey I'm sitting at a bar at a place called Diamond Plaza
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:47,263	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Which
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:50,847	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Is interesting because Diamond Plaza happens to be one of
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:52,127	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	The perspective
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:55,967	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Terrorist Targets in Nairobi a known terrorist Target besides West
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:58,783	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And he says across from him
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:00,831	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Few tables away is V
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:03,135	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Gunman the guy got away
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:04,671	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I see him he's at the next table
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:06,975	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And he says
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:08,255	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Can you come
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:15,679	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And you actually what
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:17,471	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	First they told him
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:20,287	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Finish your beer and go home
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:21,311	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I actually
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:21,823	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Hung up
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:25,407	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Then I thought I probably shouldn't blow this guy off
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:32,063	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	If This Were happening in the United States I could have just said that the guy look if you're so sure about this why don't you just call nine one
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:37,695	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	But there is no 911 in in Kenya and so he called me
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:42,303	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And I basically said to him a woody would you want me to do and he said just let the police know
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:49,471	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And then I did I'd I called the source that I know in the police department and he called his people and they did
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:51,263	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	We're going to be right there where is this location
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:58,943	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	You know they treated it seriously so
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:05,343	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Once there was this amazing possibility
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:11,743	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I feel like I'm going to wait downstairs until the police show up and then you know cops style I'm going to rain
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:13,535	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Race up with them and sort of
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:19,935	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Be behind the police so I'll be able to witness it but I'll be safe but I get there in the police are like
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:21,215	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Not there yet
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:23,519	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	So I'm waiting downstairs bar
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:29,919	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Hertz calling me like where are you man and I said well I'm downstairs I'll keep come up
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:36,319	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I don't think this is a good idea
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:42,463	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	As I'm sitting there arguing with
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:45,535	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	We have to hurry because
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:51,167	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I've invited this guy this was supposed terrorist to sit with me at my table
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:52,447	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	What
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:53,471	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Golden City
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:20:01,919	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Yeah I guess the guy was about to leave and fruit in monthly if so
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:05,503	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	He jumped up and somehow convinced this guy
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:06,015	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Stranger
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:12,927	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Did Fitbit have a drink with him at the table
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:19,071	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I think it's going to
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:32,127	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Come up I walk into the bar
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:33,407	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Far past the pool table
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:38,015	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Out outdoor bars will you bring to the table and indict
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:44,159	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Yeah yeah yeah there's this guy late 20s
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:45,695	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Fairly slender
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:47,743	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	He was wearing a t-shirt black jeans
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:51,839	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I detail it stood out to me was that he was wearing two watches
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:53,119	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Really
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:59,775	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	So sit down order beer
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:00,799	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Makeup
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:04,383	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Terribly lame story that why I'm there
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:07,967	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Phone case from my wife.
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:11,295	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	We'll talk to the guy didn't speak English
EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:18,208	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Joey
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:20,512	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	This kind of conversation you didn't really understand
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:22,560	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	What I say except for very basic stuff
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:29,216	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	But within a few minutes my sitting down the police finally arrived
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:42,272	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Brooke jumps up IDs the guy who is completely confused but what's going on
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:48,672	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	He was at the mall the day of the attack
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:49,952	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And so the police
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:53,792	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	The question again
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:55,840	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	It is very suspicious
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:58,400	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	They asked him where he's promises Nairobi
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:22:02,240	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Even though he had told us that he's from Yemen and then
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:08,640	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	They asking for passport and then he says oh I don't have my passport but then he does and then he says I want from Yemen so
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:12,992	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Anyway so that's enough for the police that they put the rubber handcuffs on him and they take him away
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:17,856	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	He didn't say he seemed kind of belt
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:19,136	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	You seem high actually
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:20,928	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Coming ahead and mention with it
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:22,464	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	The guy Ben
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:23,744	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Shooting
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:25,024	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Narcotic leaf
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:25,792	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	It's called Mira
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:27,072	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Cot
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:28,352	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And so
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:29,120	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	He
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:30,144	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	He seemed no
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:32,704	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Like a scared High person
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:35,008	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	You know where you're scared but you're kind of numb
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:35,776	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Do whatever
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:39,872	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Everything is happening all seems like a dream
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:40,896	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	What was not
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:44,224	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Conjectural with it as the police were leading him out
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:46,016	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Farooq
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:46,528	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Just
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:53,440	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Lose it
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:59,840	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	White guy you know
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:05,984	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Anyone anyone at the bar.
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:14,432	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	You still want all we could do to kind of calm him down
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:20,064	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	You know my family saying
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:24,160	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Looking at life in prison I love my life
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:29,792	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I saw him and he was watching me
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:32,608	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	You showed my love man
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:34,656	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	How can I
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:35,168	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Let It Go
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:39,008	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	This is the day
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:45,408	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Under 10%
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:51,808	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	That's when the call to prayer comes out of the speakers from a nearby mosque
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:57,440	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	All the way through it
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:24:00,512	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Directly from the bar to go to the police station to give a statement
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:02,304	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And I
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:04,096	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I felt really bad
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:05,120	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Actually
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:09,984	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I never felt like I was doing something
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:11,520	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Wrong per se
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:12,544	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	But I felt that
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:14,848	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Had come
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:15,616	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	To this person
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:16,896	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And actually
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:20,480	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	At that point I didn't feel that he was a terrorist and I just hope
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:23,040	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	That the system
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:25,088	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	To which I had helped commit him
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:26,368	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Would treat him fairly
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:34,560	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	After that I kept calling the police station
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:38,400	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Every few days about 10 days later I found out
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:39,424	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	The guy was released
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:43,264	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And he hadn't been charged with anything and it's that point I was like
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:44,032	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Alright Grace
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:46,336	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Is all worked out fine
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:51,456	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Poor guy was in the wrong place at the wrong time and you know got falsely ID possibly but
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:54,016	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Book everything is done everything kind of worked out the way it was supposed
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:57,344	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And that's what I sent you know for 4 months basic
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:25:00,672	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Went off to do other kinds of reporting other stories
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:02,464	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	But a few months later
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:06,816	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I was talking to a police Source again
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:11,168	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And I happen to mention we're taking a different story said yeah whatever happened to that
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:13,216	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Black guy from
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:19,616	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Yemen that fellow it was picked up at Diamond Plaza and he said only knows funny that the witness that you told us about
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:21,664	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	You never showed up
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:27,296	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Didn't show up
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:32,928	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I said what fruit never showed up to give his testimony you can hear from the tape
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:36,768	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	The one thing that's so clear
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:43,680	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	He said he's on his way over to police station full barrels blazing and so I called
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:44,192	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Farooq
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:49,568	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Annies phone is off
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:51,104	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And then
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:52,896	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I called his phone still off
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:53,664	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	A few minutes late
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:25:56,480	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	This phone number is no longer in service kind of thing
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:26:00,576	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	So it's actually not until close to the year anniversary
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:03,136	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Of the Westgate that I get a call
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:08,512	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Your number
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:10,816	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Another word for weak
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:13,632	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And it's
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:14,912	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Fruit candy
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:17,728	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Very nervous he says are you alone
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:18,752	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Asking me
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:20,288	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Not to record this
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:22,336	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Conversation natale's me
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:24,640	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	He had gone to the police station just as likes
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:26,176	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Suspected he marched right over to the police station
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:30,016	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And they told him I will know this is being handled by the X terrorism police
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:30,528	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	So
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:34,368	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	You leave your phone number and then it's terrorism police will give you a call
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:35,136	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	A week later
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:41,024	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	He started getting calls several calls from unknown numbers
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:44,352	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Where people who did not identify themselves
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:45,376	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Threatened
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:47,936	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Told him not to say anything
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:49,984	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	About this guy he had arrest
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:52,032	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Not to talk to the Press
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:53,824	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Or
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:55,872	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	He be sorry and his family would be
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:56,896	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Sorry
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:27:02,272	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	He was extremely rattled by these phone calls and ultimately
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:03,040	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	She turned off
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:04,576	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	This phone if I couldn't get a hold of him
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:06,624	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Left the country
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:07,648	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	4 short bed
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:09,184	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	It come back
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:12,256	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Was laying very low and it's
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:13,792	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Why I'm using an assumed
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:15,840	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Name Prim when I'm not telling you
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:16,352	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Full name
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:17,376	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Doesn't want that
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:19,680	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And you believe the stories about
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:20,448	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Threats and
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:24,288	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Absolutely no way of knowing for sure
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:26,592	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	That
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:27,872	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Part of his story though
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:29,152	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Seemed
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:31,712	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	The most likely to be true
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:34,272	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	The fact that the anti-terrorism police
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:36,576	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Had called him
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:38,112	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Allegedly and made threats
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:40,160	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	That does not sound strange
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:46,304	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And fortunately to me I've heard that story from lots of very credible people does this make what he saw.
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:47,072	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Drawer
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:48,608	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Country where we go I don't know
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:51,936	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Suddenly I found myself less willing to discount the story
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:53,472	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:55,520	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I was less comfortable with the
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,056	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Official narrative
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:58,336	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Then
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:27:59,104	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I wanted to be at that
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:00,640	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	So
EDL	00:28:01,408	00:28:01,920	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I called up
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:03,456	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	One more
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:05,760	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Guy a guy who is not a government official
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:07,296	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Who's not the FBI
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:08,832	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And yes quit
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:10,112	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Seen all the videotape
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:13,952	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	From the mall can you just give me your name and your
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:20,352	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And your title and read I'm a producer and director of documentaries most recently Terror the mole which was
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:22,656	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Tonight's HBO and the BBC
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:24,704	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And for that documentary Dan got
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:26,496	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Exclusive access to
EDL	00:28:26,496	00:28:28,800	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	All the surveillance footage
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:30,848	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Inside that mall
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:32,128	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	If there were more to this
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:32,896	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Story
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:34,688	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	You can tell me so how much footage
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:40,576	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Did you get if I can ask him and how many hours are the footage we obtained added up to about
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:46,208	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Mom $2,000 while when we analyze the timeline where the cameras weren't we
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:50,560	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	The offsets between different cameras we really did a huge forensic job
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:53,120	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	It's mind-numbingly tedious to watch a lot of it
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:54,400	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	But if you
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:57,472	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Dugite writ you do get the key to another the mysteries of Westgate
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:02,592	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Like me you got into this project
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:04,896	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Open mindedness very kind of
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:06,176	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Eunice OBO
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:08,480	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Sensible people who said the other was 7 Paris
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:10,272	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I saw 7 Terrace
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:12,320	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I mean you dream of
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:19,232	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Be able to confirm that they were seven government you dream of being able to confirm that they will escape what if that were true what if
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:20,000	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	If we could
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:21,024	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Find
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:23,328	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Evidence some evidence that that were true
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:24,864	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	But in the end
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:28,192	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	He didn't know as well as we
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:30,240	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Progressed further and further with our
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:34,848	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Forensic analysis it became harder and harder to give any credit to some of the wild two pieces of
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:35,872	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Have eyewitness
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:40,224	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	He says what you see on those tapes is what the FBI said you'd say
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:40,992	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	4 guys
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:42,016	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	All Somali
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:42,784	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Xi an
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:45,088	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Exactly was in how does he
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:46,368	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Square of the stories
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:48,416	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	You were hearing with the stories
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:49,184	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	You are reporting
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:52,000	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Well that part was actually fighting
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:57,888	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	We are little people say yeah there was a woman
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:30:00,704	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	When I was going through this footage my wife looked over my shoulder
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:05,056	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Pointed to one of the four terrorists on the screen that won't push it or is that it go
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:11,456	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And we came to the conclusion that that one of the gunmen was in a very slender and he actually does sachet alone in in
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:16,064	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	What is Frankie quite an effeminate way and similarly he says you can
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:21,440	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Justify some of the reports that one of the gunmen was an Arab because one of them did in fact have
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:22,464	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Lighter skin
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:23,744	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Then your average Somali
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:25,792	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And you can explain the people thought that they were
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:29,632	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	More gunmen 10 or 15 gunmen because they were a lot of guys
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:30,912	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Two guns running around
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:31,424	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Pudding
EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:32,704	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Security guards
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:33,472	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And later
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:36,544	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Policeman there were a lot more policemen than they were gunman
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:38,848	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I did speak with one eye witness
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:42,176	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Who said it it that he saw one of the terrorists
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:43,968	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	She may change clothes and Escape
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:49,856	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Well I know that doesn't that doesn't match anything that we saw
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:55,232	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I didn't think the question to ask your eyewitnesses is is how do you know this person with a weapon who changed codes
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:56,000	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Was a terrorist
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:57,792	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	It may have been a policeman recently had
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:31:00,352	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Stories of policemen taking off
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:05,728	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Changing clothes will take note of any any distinctive clothing I don't know if those stories were true but we we had stories
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:09,312	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Uniformed policeman
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:14,944	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Took off their uniform even more fight I guess yeah I mean that but that's feel Greg. Fuel I mean
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:21,856	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Speculation and did not see that on the any of the securities
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:25,952	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I just had so many conversations like people sing to me know their skates and I'm like why do you think that
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:29,536	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	You know these guys don't come to escape if you escape you failed
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:33,376	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	He says take the 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:37,216	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	They had murdered 35 people at the hotel
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:39,520	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	There's a moment in that film where one of the gunmen
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:46,432	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	One of the last remaining gunman in hotel room next to use in the bathtub next to

EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:55,392	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	He's talking to one of his handlers on the cell phone
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:59,232	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Recording that call ended
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:05,632	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	The handlers free call me Satan you know you what your mission
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:06,656	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Successful to you or kill
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:11,008	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And then they say to him
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:15,104	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Please leave your phone on switch on the line open in your pocket
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:19,200	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	So that we can hear when you go out and I'll killed by the
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:19,968	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Enemy security Force
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:32,000	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	So there is a whole script
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:34,816	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	So this kind of operation and it ends with the death
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:38,912	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	All of the gunmen at the hands of the enemy
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:39,424	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Ma
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:40,960	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	That's how
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:42,752	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	He knows they didn't Escape
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:47,104	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Not just because there's no evidence on the film but because
EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:48,896	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	It's the last thing they would have wanted
EDL	00:32:49,920	00:32:52,480	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And yet we don't need these
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:57,856	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	The rumors that the Terrace Escape the Room is that there was a woman amongst in the room is that they got change the room is
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:33:02,720	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	They don't seem to go away even when confronted by quite solid evidence
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:03,232	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	It's almost
EDL	00:33:04,768	00:33:06,304	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Is it the Faxton Masa
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:11,168	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	So I called Farooq
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:13,728	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Still sticking to his story
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:15,776	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	He says he saw a saw though
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:16,800	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	He's really
EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:18,336	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Too nervous to go on tape
EDL	00:33:18,336	00:33:19,872	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	But I did run it by puni
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:20,640	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	My former
EDL	00:33:20,640	00:33:22,432	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Neighbor in Nairobi who's
EDL	00:33:22,432	00:33:22,944	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	100%
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:26,016	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Still pretty sure that the guy she saw in the mall
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:28,320	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Hasn't been accounted for
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:31,136	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I think I'm sure about it but
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:33,696	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	What is the government said
EDL	00:33:33,696	00:33:40,096	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Here's the bodies here the DNA evidence here's the four they'd all die they died on the second day
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:46,496	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Or third day whatever was this is how they died and here's the DNA proof
EDL	00:33:46,496	00:33:48,544	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Really make me happy is if
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:50,592	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	They even asked the questions
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:53,152	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Beat the media beat the government
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:55,200	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Why did we go from 15
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:33:55,712	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	To 4
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:34:02,624	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Quickly tell you how we arrived at 4 cuz I told her about the meeting with the FBI
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:06,464	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And how we got this information then I told her about
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:09,280	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Dan Reed watching 2000 hours of video tape
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:12,096	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I told her about how I investigated Farooq story and
EDL	00:34:12,096	00:34:14,400	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Mostly came up empty I told her not to
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:17,216	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Everything that I know all these facts but
EDL	00:34:17,728	00:34:18,496	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	How I got to
EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:20,288	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Because
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:20,800	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	In the end
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:22,592	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Maybe the facts Aren't Enough
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:25,152	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Fax need to make sense
EDL	00:34:25,920	00:34:27,200	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Especially for people who
EDL	00:34:27,200	00:34:32,576	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	But I can imagine for anybody was not there anybody was reading it yet the evidence says and then you move on
EDL	00:34:33,600	00:34:38,464	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Listen to I feel like I'm I'm learning much more about my job and
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:44,864	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Being a journalist and maybe it's not so pretty because I feel like that
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:51,264	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	That day coming out of that meeting with the FBI and feeling like okay now we
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:56,896	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	We have some solid evidence that can be reported and we can move on felt
EDL	00:34:56,896	00:34:58,688	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Good I mean it felt like
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:35:05,088	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Offering instead of offering shaky as a testimony we could offer Truth at least his
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:11,488	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Best we can understand it but it feels like maybe that was too sudden and too
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:17,888	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Due to an inquisitive in a way to match the emotions that we're still
EDL	00:35:17,888	00:35:24,288	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	In the air in the rub it that time maybe it felt like abandonment even though it was meant to feel like clarity
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:25,568	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Xiaomi
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:28,384	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	It's still there's a little
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:30,176	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Glimmer of maybe that's not
EDL	00:35:30,176	00:35:30,688	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	The full story
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:34,528	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	I am inclined to believe
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:35,296	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	That they were four
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:38,368	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	But then it's like what I saw does not make sense
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:42,464	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	And that I'll never be able to really reconcile and I just kind of have
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:43,744	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Leave it at that
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:49,536	| radiolab_podcast14outsidewestgate |	Lot of people think for the story of course Greg Warner
