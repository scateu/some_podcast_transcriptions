EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:08,576	| radiolab102114 |	Misses the hole
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:09,344	| radiolab102114 |	Spirit of the
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:10,112	| radiolab102114 |	The

EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:18,559	| radiolab102114 |	Catchy
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:21,375	| radiolab102114 |	Little sausage shape on the page the fact that the lines
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:27,775	| radiolab102114 |	Rhyme you know aabbccdd and all the first line
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:30,591	| radiolab102114 |	Is identical to the last line I mean Young
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:36,991	| radiolab102114 |	Disorder has the feel of a palindrome it has the poet's name in the middle of the poem that mound of them all
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:43,391	| radiolab102114 |	Did I say three syllables per line
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:49,535	| radiolab102114 |	28 lines long so all of those things added up to a set of constraints you might say on me
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:51,583	| radiolab102114 |	So Doug sat down and got
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:53,375	| radiolab102114 |	Got to work and quickly became
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:54,655	| radiolab102114 |	Embroil
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:57,471	| radiolab102114 |	In the question of like how do you translate this
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:58,495	| radiolab102114 |	Coming along the way
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:03,871	| radiolab102114 |	Even began to make a little grids of possibilities for different lines of the poem
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:05,151	| radiolab102114 |	For example
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:06,687	| radiolab102114 |	Voske on data boost
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:10,527	| radiolab102114 |	Like this line the basically says don't wallow in bed
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:14,111	| radiolab102114 |	I had a lot of possibilities and I'll just read you the
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:20,511	| radiolab102114 |	Little diagonal display here instead of spurting blood in bed instead of burping in you
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:24,351	| radiolab102114 |	Your bed instead of bursting out in benstead of lurking
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:27,679	| radiolab102114 |	Senior instead of hurtling out of instead of hurting their
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:29,727	| radiolab102114 |	Instead of squirming
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:35,359	| radiolab102114 |	Slurping sloppy head of burning up in bed instead of turning blue in
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:38,431	| radiolab102114 |	On and on and I came up with
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:41,247	| radiolab102114 |	You want me to read my purse translation please
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:44,575	| radiolab102114 |	My sweet dear I sent you all the best

EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:25,791	| radiolab102114 |	But the words
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:30,143	| radiolab102114 |	Represent Concepts in the concept have a kind of a halo around them I mean when you
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:32,191	| radiolab102114 |	Talk about jelly you're implicitly
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:39,103	| radiolab102114 |	Talking about bread and things that you spread it on oh I just think you'd like to stick their fingers in jelly

EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:42,175	| radiolab102114 |	Okay okay fair enough
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:45,759	| radiolab102114 |	Feeling like you hadn't quite nailed it Doug sent the poem to one of the guys at

EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:58,559	| radiolab102114 |	And
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:00,351	| radiolab102114 |	Bob said well I'll give it a try

EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:19,295	| radiolab102114 |	And really quite marvelous
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:20,063	| radiolab102114 |	He got the
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:22,367	| radiolab102114 |	Masonry at the gym
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:26,719	| radiolab102114 |	Clements name in the middle but at the same time it didn't have the lightness
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:29,279	| radiolab102114 |	The tone is much more ancient
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:31,583	| radiolab102114 |	Wish you could argue well it's an ancient poem but
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:35,679	| radiolab102114 |	Text us dinner there's a bigger problem was 30 lines long so
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:36,959	| radiolab102114 |	Extra-long
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:39,007	| radiolab102114 |	And what he ate was a
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:45,407	| radiolab102114 |	Sacrosanct number no no no no no
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:50,527	| radiolab102114 |	28 lines that rhymed wonderfully and the essence of his poem was
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:52,319	| radiolab102114 |	A form rather than
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:53,087	| radiolab102114 |	AR
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:56,415	| radiolab102114 |	Then I message that is the message was Getwell
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:59,487	| radiolab102114 |	Which is pretty simple but Doug would argue no it was the Forum
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:03,327	| radiolab102114 |	That's what made the thing funny and Charming until the question for him was
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:06,143	| radiolab102114 |	Who could get the field but nail the four
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:08,191	| radiolab102114 |	To make a long story short

EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:18,751	| radiolab102114 |	God restores that helped you my little flower
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:24,895	| radiolab102114 |	I noticed that she doesn't
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,687	| radiolab102114 |	Begin the poem
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:31,295	| radiolab102114 |	And in the palm of the same line she doesn't have 28 lines just maybe about 16 lines
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:38,463	| radiolab102114 |	She doesn't pay any attention to syllable count my first reaction was
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:39,999	| radiolab102114 |	Mom come on
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:43,327	| radiolab102114 |	I didn't pay any attention to the Forum
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:49,983	| radiolab102114 |	And I did what I wanted to do this is my feeling and I was just leaving that's what I did
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:53,055	| radiolab102114 |	Actually you know I have to say
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:55,103	| radiolab102114 |	It has stood the test
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:59,711	| radiolab102114 |	The time it has some kind of pizzazz that no other one ever
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:05,855	| radiolab102114 |	But if she respect the forms you didn't do the syllable she didn't rhyme with the way it supposed to rhyme she didn't give you 28 lines
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,135	| radiolab102114 |	Have that track
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:10,207	| radiolab102114 |	Is that a translation then or is that just a
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:13,279	| radiolab102114 |	What are standard flowers bloom
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:16,863	| radiolab102114 |	As I got more and more deeply into this poem
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:18,399	| radiolab102114 |	My Philosophy
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,423	| radiolab102114 |	Started to become
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:21,215	| radiolab102114 |	Chairman Mao's
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:24,031	| radiolab102114 |	Statement let 100 flowers bloom
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:29,919	| radiolab102114 |	Another words you can look at it from so many angles and each new angle in riches
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:36,063	| radiolab102114 |	It is and makes it more fun but you can't read a hundred versions of every poem that you want to read okay
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:42,975	| radiolab102114 |	Okay I agree are you right I guess make me question though that the Rules of Engagement and what are no rules
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:44,511	| radiolab102114 |	There no rules it's all in
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:48,863	| radiolab102114 |	Formal okay but there is Jim in one of the translations and ham in the other
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:50,655	| radiolab102114 |	And they're like they're
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:51,679	| radiolab102114 |	Factually different
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:58,591	| radiolab102114 |	Food substances shouldn't be negotiable
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:03,199	| radiolab102114 |	I mean does a fact about the poem is that it was written by somebody in French
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:09,855	| radiolab102114 |	It's not in French anymore the mission
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:11,647	| radiolab102114 |	What was what
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:12,415	| radiolab102114 |	Was
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:13,695	| radiolab102114 |	He said
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:14,207	| radiolab102114 |	Not
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:21,119	| radiolab102114 |	What do we make of what he's saying what are the flavors of what he's saying what are the variance of what he say when is that like isn't the expectations
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:22,911	| radiolab102114 |	That you as a translator
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:23,679	| radiolab102114 |	AR
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:24,703	| radiolab102114 |	Giving
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:25,471	| radiolab102114 |	Me him
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:28,031	| radiolab102114 |	Like it is this man is lost
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:31,615	| radiolab102114 |	The time and now it's suddenly I get to experience him
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:38,783	| radiolab102114 |	What is a hundred flowers are blooming that's somehow feels like I'm not getting him at all obviously you're getting to the question of what
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:43,903	| radiolab102114 |	What is translation and can it be done my my feeling is that
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:47,743	| radiolab102114 |	Even though these translations that we've heard are all very different
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:49,535	| radiolab102114 |	They all
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:52,863	| radiolab102114 |	Show something about claim on my ho
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:54,911	| radiolab102114 |	Ducks basic point is it like
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:55,935	| radiolab102114 |	Any person
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:57,215	| radiolab102114 |	Kind of universe
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:58,495	| radiolab102114 |	They're too big
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:00,799	| radiolab102114 |	Comprehend in their entirety
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:02,335	| radiolab102114 |	So any translation of
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:04,895	| radiolab102114 |	It's only going to get you at
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:05,663	| radiolab102114 |	Tiny
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:06,431	| radiolab102114 |	Piece of that pie
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:07,455	| radiolab102114 |	Refraction
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:10,527	| radiolab102114 |	I'm in luck we have one photograph of Frederic Chopin
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:12,575	| radiolab102114 |	1
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:13,087	| radiolab102114 |	Photograph
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:16,159	| radiolab102114 |	In that picture he survived
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:16,671	| radiolab102114 |	Scowling
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:19,487	| radiolab102114 |	What did Frederic Chopin really look like
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:20,767	| radiolab102114 |	What was his smile like
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:27,167	| radiolab102114 |	You know you look at a photograph of Chopin and you say all this is what Chopin look like well no
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:28,703	| radiolab102114 |	Chopin look like many things
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:32,287	| radiolab102114 |	Even the very day that that photograph was taken
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:33,055	| radiolab102114 |	He had
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:39,455	| radiolab102114 |	Thousands of different Expressions on his face but then what about a year earlier or 10 years earlier I mean knowing soap
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:42,271	| radiolab102114 |	Open is a very complex thing it's not one thing
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:45,855	| radiolab102114 |	Millions of different things that are united
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:47,647	| radiolab102114 |	By analogy
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:50,719	| radiolab102114 |	Into
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:53,023	| radiolab102114 |	Something that we refer to as one thing
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:06,335	| radiolab102114 |	We should say we looked into it in there are actually two pictures of Chopin
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:08,639	| radiolab102114 |	But he's kind of scallion
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:12,223	| radiolab102114 |	No smiles
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:29,119	| radiolab102114 |	Go to McDonald Cafe

EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:58,207	| radiolab102114 |	It's the word serious
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:15:59,487	| radiolab102114 |	And
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:03,327	| radiolab102114 |	When seriously seriously

EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:16,895	| radiolab102114 |	Your mood
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:19,455	| radiolab102114 |	But serious tends to me

EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:25,343	| radiolab102114 |	Doing some
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:27,647	| radiolab102114 |	And usually doing is like
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:28,415	| radiolab102114 |	Some kind of
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:29,695	| radiolab102114 |	Transaction usually
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:30,463	| radiolab102114 |	AIA Financial
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:31,487	| radiolab102114 |	I've been asked by
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:34,303	| radiolab102114 |	How many East African officials are you going to be serious with me
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:35,583	| radiolab102114 |	And
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:38,143	| radiolab102114 |	It obviously means are you going to
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:39,167	| radiolab102114 |	Can you bribe
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:43,263	| radiolab102114 |	Usually I pretend to misunderstand at the key moment I said yes I'm a very serious
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:45,311	| radiolab102114 |	International journalist
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:45,823	| radiolab102114 |	Send

EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:52,479	| radiolab102114 |	To place a couple months ago
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:57,343	| radiolab102114 |	I'm really pleased to be back in Africa secretary Kerry
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:17:00,159	| radiolab102114 |	Addis Ababa Ethiopia and
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:01,183	| radiolab102114 |	Enormous energy
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:08,863	| radiolab102114 |	Just a few days before Kerry's visit nine journalists had been arrested under this relatively recent anteater
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:10,399	| radiolab102114 |	Tarzan law that basically says
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:13,215	| radiolab102114 |	Any criticism of the government is illegal
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:18,591	| radiolab102114 |	I had a serious a very productive meetings this morning with my foreign minister counterparts and
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:20,895	| radiolab102114 |	Secretary Kerry was giving this press conference
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:22,943	| radiolab102114 |	I shared my concerns about the
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:26,527	| radiolab102114 |	Young Ethiopian bloggers that I met last year
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:28,063	| radiolab102114 |	Not now felt like a

EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:34,975	| radiolab102114 |	And I firmly believe that
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:38,047	| radiolab102114 |	Set the work of journalist whether it's print journalists or in the internet

EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:54,943	| radiolab102114 |	But we remain committed to our partnership with Ethiopia
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:56,991	| radiolab102114 |	Yes, it was also wrapped up in a lot of praise
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:01,855	| radiolab102114 |	And I'd be delighted to answer a few questions
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:03,391	| radiolab102114 |	Cuz I'm not sure how that's even do that
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:05,439	| radiolab102114 |	Adventure Time For questions
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:11,839	| radiolab102114 |	He took some vetted questions from the Ethiopian journalists two more from the traveling press and to carry
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:16,447	| radiolab102114 |	I know he was very impatient
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:20,543	| radiolab102114 |	We left the party music you know what we're just going to try something different we're going to
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:25,663	| radiolab102114 |	Calling an Ethiopian journalist
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:26,431	| radiolab102114 |	Cherry Point

EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:36,415	| radiolab102114 |	I may have invited the hardest question of the day now
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:37,951	| radiolab102114 |	But Minecraft
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:38,719	| radiolab102114 |	Paradise

EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:51,263	| radiolab102114 |	When does guys like well
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:57,151	| radiolab102114 |	Every time a journalist is arrested the US gives a statement about this but you seem so out of
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:59,455	| radiolab102114 |	This keeps happening
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:00,223	| radiolab102114 |	Repeating
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:01,503	| radiolab102114 |	Very much
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,551	| radiolab102114 |	So then he asked
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:04,063	| radiolab102114 |	Question
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:07,135	| radiolab102114 |	Is it leap service or are you seriously
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:09,183	| radiolab102114 |	Concerning Hobbits
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:09,695	| radiolab102114 |	Zerorez
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:13,279	| radiolab102114 |	Is this lip service or are you seriously concerned
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:20,191	| radiolab102114 |	At this point everybody they're all looking at this journalist to
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:26,591	| radiolab102114 |	Obviously it's take considerable personal rest in a place like Ethiopia in a crowd of journalists including state-run
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:32,991	| radiolab102114 |	TV stations guys on camera asking this extremely sensitive question about the arrested journalist
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:34,015	| radiolab102114 |	We really we demand
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:35,807	| radiolab102114 |	Say genuine safronia
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:39,647	| radiolab102114 |	And Terry looks at him
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:41,183	| radiolab102114 |	Like
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:44,767	| radiolab102114 |	You've got to be kidding
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:49,119	| radiolab102114 |	When I stand up in public and I and I and I say something
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:53,983	| radiolab102114 |	I try to be serious about it and I think the fact that I'm doing that is Siri
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,799	| radiolab102114 |	And when I raised
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:19:59,103	| radiolab102114 |	Him by name in my,
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:02,431	| radiolab102114 |	I carry sounds to me like he's sort of
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:05,247	| radiolab102114 |	Insulted by the question and
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:11,647	| radiolab102114 |	So remember serious the word serious in East Africa to be translated very much his are you doing
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:18,047	| radiolab102114 |	Something preferably financial transaction right and so what this journalist is saying is
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:22,655	| radiolab102114 |	Are you just talkin about this or are you doing something
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:29,055	| radiolab102114 |	Maybe threatening Ethiopia with withdrawing a tour with drug support and Carrie says I am very
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:32,383	| radiolab102114 |	Seriously talking about we have previously called for the release
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:34,687	| radiolab102114 |	These individuals in
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:37,247	| radiolab102114 |	That is the policy of our government
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:38,271	| radiolab102114 |	And it's a serious bottle
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:40,831	| radiolab102114 |	Thank you all very very much
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:43,391	| radiolab102114 |	And it seemed to me maybe you know
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:44,927	| radiolab102114 |	You can judge me
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:46,207	| radiolab102114 |	But it seemed like he was almost like
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:53,119	| radiolab102114 |	Look I'm like the most serious politician that's out there I mean I lost the presidential race in 2004 in Paris
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:56,703	| radiolab102114 |	Because I was being too serious by the American public
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:21:00,031	| radiolab102114 |	Like what are you accusing me of not being
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:00,799	| radiolab102114 |	Serious
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:02,847	| radiolab102114 |	We put in a number of requests
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:04,895	| radiolab102114 |	Speak to John Kerry or someone in the state department but they
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:10,015	| radiolab102114 |	You think he was aware of the misunderstanding who carry
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:13,855	| radiolab102114 |	This fellow
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:16,416	| radiolab102114 |	Can you pronounce a name for me

EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:45,472	| radiolab102114 |	About what we're calling tiny moments of brilliance
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:49,568	| radiolab102114 |	Basically I want to hear about those times when I kids you know did something
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:55,968	| radiolab102114 |	It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that maybe it was the moment that a kid
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:58,784	| radiolab102114 |	Did you been reading to 4 month started reading back
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:25:59,552	| radiolab102114 |	To you
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:01,856	| radiolab102114 |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:05,952	| radiolab102114 |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:10,816	| radiolab102114 |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:13,376	| radiolab102114 |	We're interested in the
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:14,656	| radiolab102114 |	Epic moments where

EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:04,064	| radiolab102114 |	Wheeler talk to
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:05,856	| radiolab102114 |	Gopnik about George
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:12,512	| radiolab102114 |	What is George Carlin mentioned biggest Carlin It's a Wonderful sort of folk philosopher of language, the comedian
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:17,120	| radiolab102114 |	And this next thing this next thing is about the English language
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:22,752	| radiolab102114 |	About little Expressions we use we get we all say in the little sayings and expressions that we use all the time
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:27,360	| radiolab102114 |	Is one of his great subject
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:31,200	| radiolab102114 |	He didn't even have a high school education you know so it was not something that he
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:32,224	| radiolab102114 |	Got from
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:32,992	| radiolab102114 |	Cooling
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:37,600	| radiolab102114 |	And one of godnicks favorite Carlin racing I really like this one too is about how Carlin hated
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:43,488	| radiolab102114 |	Euphemism I don't like words or hide the truth I don't like words that conceal reality I don't like euphemism
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:46,560	| radiolab102114 |	American English is loaded with euphemisms
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:49,120	| radiolab102114 |	Because Americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:55,520	| radiolab102114 |	A car that was wonderful about things like that what about book called
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:57,568	| radiolab102114 |	All the way
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:27:59,616	| radiolab102114 |	And we brought in these
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:01,408	| radiolab102114 |	Senior citizen
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:06,528	| radiolab102114 |	The reason we use you for so I just been through
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:07,808	| radiolab102114 |	My father-in-law died
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:09,344	| radiolab102114 |	4 months ago
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:12,672	| radiolab102114 |	And we went through the same horrible business that we all go through in a
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:16,768	| radiolab102114 |	Intensive care Ward where the doctors and nurse practitioners
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:18,560	| radiolab102114 |	Have a language that they've been taught
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:20,608	| radiolab102114 |	We just want your father to be comfortable
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:21,632	| radiolab102114 |	He's Gravely ill
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:27,008	| radiolab102114 |	Greatly I mean she's dying right and we wanted to be comfortable means can we give him enough drug so the hill
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:29,824	| radiolab102114 |	Pass out before he dies in song
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:31,104	| radiolab102114 |	It's certainly true that
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:32,128	| radiolab102114 |	Euphemism
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:34,176	| radiolab102114 |	Can be a repellent thing but
EDL	00:28:34,176	00:28:35,456	| radiolab102114 |	No one is full
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:36,992	| radiolab102114 |	What were mocking is
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:43,136	| radiolab102114 |	The absurdity of the effort to disguise something that you cannot disguise but Carlin's real point was that
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:45,952	| radiolab102114 |	Did like dolls are reactions
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:50,304	| radiolab102114 |	Do it actually has like I have a negative effect
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:53,376	| radiolab102114 |	He has this whole bed it's about shell shock
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:58,240	| radiolab102114 |	PTSD in the first World War
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:28:59,776	| radiolab102114 |	That condition was called
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:00,800	| radiolab102114 |	Shell shocked
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:02,336	| radiolab102114 |	They used to call it shell shock
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:03,104	| radiolab102114 |	Not simple
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:03,872	| radiolab102114 |	Honest
EDL	00:29:03,872	00:29:04,640	| radiolab102114 |	Direct language
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:05,920	| radiolab102114 |	Cool syllables
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:07,456	| radiolab102114 |	Shell shocked
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:11,040	| radiolab102114 |	And then it became battle fatigue battle fatigue
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:11,552	| radiolab102114 |	Porsche
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:13,344	| radiolab102114 |	Takes a little longer to say
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:15,904	| radiolab102114 |	Doesn't seem to hurt as much
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:17,696	| radiolab102114 |	And then after became battle fatigue
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:20,256	| radiolab102114 |	Then it became operational exhaustion
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:23,328	| radiolab102114 |	Paver up to eight syllables now
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:25,888	| radiolab102114 |	Television post-traumatic shock disorder
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:28,448	| radiolab102114 |	Still 8 syllables
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:32,032	| radiolab102114 |	PTSD post-traumatic
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:33,056	| radiolab102114 |	Stress disorder
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:36,896	| radiolab102114 |	The pain is completely buried under jargon
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:43,040	| radiolab102114 |	This was the Orwell notion that you could erase sensitivities if you blend it out the words
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:43,552	| radiolab102114 |	So
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:48,416	| radiolab102114 |	If you stop saying oh yeah we just tortured the guy if you say some
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:54,816	| radiolab102114 |	Phrase interrogation or enhanced interrogation that makes a big difference
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:30:01,216	| radiolab102114 |	PTSD we are not having the appropriate reaction to it emits shell-shocked I'll bet you if we have still been
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:02,496	| radiolab102114 |	Calling a shell shocked
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:08,896	| radiolab102114 |	Some of those Vietnam veterans might have gotten the attention they needed at the time I'll text you that
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:12,224	| radiolab102114 |	Now you putting your finger on the this is where the
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:13,504	| radiolab102114 |	The rubber meets the road
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:16,576	| radiolab102114 |	Does the use of euphemism
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:19,392	| radiolab102114 |	Does that really Rob us of some understand
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:21,696	| radiolab102114 |	Adam gopnik surprisingly says
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:24,000	| radiolab102114 |	The truth is just the opposite
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:30,912	| radiolab102114 |	We actually have more of an apparatus to help people with PTSD
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:33,984	| radiolab102114 |	Then they did in 1915 to help guys with shell shock
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:40,128	| radiolab102114 |	The reason the word gets more abstract is being exactly because you have a much more complicated an abstract system of
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:46,528	| radiolab102114 |	Support it's not because I think that's the reason it's called PTSD is because it's a more complex and
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:47,552	| radiolab102114 |	What that Evolution says
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:53,952	| radiolab102114 |	The initial thing was all these guys are being driven crazy cuz the shelter exploding all around me
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:54,464	| radiolab102114 |	The Western Front
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:31:01,376	| radiolab102114 |	Gopnik says the thinking was you know it was temporary the shell goes off loads in a moment they have a moment of shock and
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:03,424	| radiolab102114 |	They need a moment of rest and then they can go back in
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:05,728	| radiolab102114 |	But I World War II we're thinking
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:08,544	| radiolab102114 |	That's not quite right not just shells exploding right
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:10,592	| radiolab102114 |	It's the whole experience of battle
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:12,896	| radiolab102114 |	It's all the shooting in the death
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:16,736	| radiolab102114 |	BB guns battle fatigue you trying to generalize
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:22,112	| radiolab102114 |	Trying to make it richer as a kind of it also becomes fatigued versus shock there's less violin
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:27,488	| radiolab102114 |	Right because it because you're looking at guys who may not exhibit the symptoms of shock necessarily but
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:29,792	| radiolab102114 |	Overtime it becomes impossible
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:33,120	| radiolab102114 |	For them to go on is a wonderful film from World War II called let there be light
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:35,680	| radiolab102114 |	These are the casualties of the sky
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:37,984	| radiolab102114 |	Cumberland mine
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:40,032	| radiolab102114 |	Men who are damaged
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:40,544	| radiolab102114 |	Emotional
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:43,104	| radiolab102114 |	About guys with what they were then calling
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:44,896	| radiolab102114 |	Battle fatigue in the reason they were
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:47,456	| radiolab102114 |	Calling it that was because you didn't necessarily see it
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:47,968	| radiolab102114 |	Right away
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:54,880	| radiolab102114 |	Ben around Vietnam he says we realized you don't just see this on the battlefield you see it with guys who aren't necessarily directly
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:32:01,280	| radiolab102114 |	Involved in battle until the question became what's the source of it it's you say well it's nervous exhaustion say the human
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:02,560	| radiolab102114 |	Nervous system can only
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:06,144	| radiolab102114 |	Take it for so long and then everybody's nervous system shuts down
EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:10,752	| radiolab102114 |	What's the term operational exhaustion
EDL	00:32:10,752	00:32:14,336	| radiolab102114 |	The guys aren't cowards and they're behaving the way all human beings
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:16,128	| radiolab102114 |	And then
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:18,432	| radiolab102114 |	You get more concerned about them and you say
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:21,504	| radiolab102114 |	The real problem isn't there just their experience on the battlefield
EDL	00:32:21,504	00:32:24,064	| radiolab102114 |	The problem isn't that there in a constant state
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:24,832	| radiolab102114 |	Of

EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:43,008	| radiolab102114 |	Is Justin
EDL	00:32:43,008	00:32:44,544	| radiolab102114 |	It's perfectly possible
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:48,128	| radiolab102114 |	That the language of euphemism grows and becomes more abstract
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:51,712	| radiolab102114 |	As act as people actually are becoming more empathetic
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:53,248	| radiolab102114 |	To the people who suffer from

EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:10,816	| radiolab102114 |	450 Sherri Coca-Cola.
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:12,608	| radiolab102114 |	Now you try
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:18,240	| radiolab102114 |	Pretty good
EDL	00:34:20,544	00:34:23,360	| radiolab102114 |	This is Emily
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:31,808	| radiolab102114 |	Some of you may remember that a couple years ago we did a story about Emily wear
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:33,088	| radiolab102114 |	She been hit by truck
EDL	00:34:33,600	00:34:36,416	| radiolab102114 |	Going into a coma and then her boyfriend at the time Allen
EDL	00:34:36,928	00:34:38,720	| radiolab102114 |	I had brought her back
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:40,512	| radiolab102114 |	My writing on her hand
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:42,816	| radiolab102114 |	She's writing her name
EDL	00:34:42,816	00:34:43,584	| radiolab102114 |	Almost
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:48,704	| radiolab102114 |	All the stories we've ever done I think this one has gotten the most
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:51,520	| radiolab102114 |	And when we left that story
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:52,288	| radiolab102114 |	Emily had
EDL	00:34:52,800	00:34:54,336	| radiolab102114 |	Emerge from the comment again to recover
EDL	00:34:55,104	00:34:55,872	| radiolab102114 |	But she was blind
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:58,432	| radiolab102114 |	Totally blind right yeah
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:35:01,504	| radiolab102114 |	Like no light any good nothing coming in now
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:03,296	| radiolab102114 |	Needless to say was a very big at you
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:04,320	| radiolab102114 |	I just
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:07,904	| radiolab102114 |	I know I just had to develop my own ways to
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:09,440	| radiolab102114 |	Navigate
EDL	00:35:10,208	00:35:11,232	| radiolab102114 |	Throughout the world end
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:13,280	| radiolab102114 |	Just myself and I
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:14,560	| radiolab102114 |	And being a visual artist
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:17,632	| radiolab102114 |	She had to develop new ways to draw pad
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:19,424	| radiolab102114 |	Tryon
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:22,752	| radiolab102114 |	And if you draw the Crayons hard enough you can
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:24,288	| radiolab102114 |	Feel the wax
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:25,056	| radiolab102114 |	On the paper
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:30,688	| radiolab102114 |	Yeah then one day in the summer of 2012
EDL	00:35:30,688	00:35:31,456	| radiolab102114 |	She gets a call
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:32,480	| radiolab102114 |	From the lighthouse
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:34,272	| radiolab102114 |	School in New York
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:37,600	| radiolab102114 |	City Lighthouse school yeah it says School for the Blind
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:40,160	| radiolab102114 |	Her mom had to found out that they were trying out this
EDL	00:35:40,160	00:35:40,928	| radiolab102114 |	Brand new technology
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:46,048	| radiolab102114 |	I think they were doing the study for the FDA experimental
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:50,144	| radiolab102114 |	Long story short Emily shows up the lighthouse school one day and walks into the
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:51,424	| radiolab102114 |	This room in a guy named ed
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:54,240	| radiolab102114 |	Gives her this thing
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:55,520	| radiolab102114 |	He described it I mean is it a big
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:58,592	| radiolab102114 |	No it's not it's just like
EDL	00:35:59,360	00:36:01,408	| radiolab102114 |	A regular pair of sunglasses
EDL	00:36:01,920	00:36:04,736	| radiolab102114 |	Though they were a little heavier than your normal sunglasses
EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:06,784	| radiolab102114 |	Is right on the front
EDL	00:36:06,784	00:36:08,064	| radiolab102114 |	The bridge of the nose
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:08,832	| radiolab102114 |	Was a little
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:09,600	| radiolab102114 |	Camera
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:10,368	| radiolab102114 |	Going forward
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:11,392	| radiolab102114 |	And then attack
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:11,904	| radiolab102114 |	2
EDL	00:36:12,416	00:36:14,464	| radiolab102114 |	The sunglasses was a little wire
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:20,352	| radiolab102114 |	It ran out of the camera and down to this little square piece of metal is made out of titanium
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:21,632	| radiolab102114 |	And it's just like
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:22,912	| radiolab102114 |	The size of a postage
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:25,472	| radiolab102114 |	A little bit thicker
EDL	00:36:25,472	00:36:27,520	| radiolab102114 |	L6
EDL	00:36:27,520	00:36:29,056	| radiolab102114 |	Pizza titanium was filled with
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:30,080	| radiolab102114 |	Thousands of Electro
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:32,640	| radiolab102114 |	And what was going to happen is that the
EDL	00:36:32,640	00:36:34,944	| radiolab102114 |	Camera was going to convert images into
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:36,224	| radiolab102114 |	Patterns of electricity
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:37,248	| radiolab102114 |	Beyond that little square
EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:42,368	| radiolab102114 |	So we told her to take a little square on your town right on the center of your tongue
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:43,648	| radiolab102114 |	And close your mouth
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:45,440	| radiolab102114 |	So
EDL	00:36:45,440	00:36:48,768	| radiolab102114 |	A put it on and they turn it on
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:55,168	| radiolab102114 |	And it was like it started to tickle
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:36:57,216	| radiolab102114 |	Imagine a lot of
EDL	00:36:57,728	00:37:00,800	| radiolab102114 |	Coca-Cola like a lot of bubbles
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:02,592	| radiolab102114 |	On your town and always late
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:08,224	| radiolab102114 |	Prickly prickly feeling the idea behind
EDL	00:37:08,224	00:37:14,624	| radiolab102114 |	Science writer Sam Keen author of the tale of the dueling neurosurgeons is it we actually see with our brain not our
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:18,720	| radiolab102114 |	Or I might seem like our eyes are doing the singing in our ears during the hearing and
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:22,560	| radiolab102114 |	Fingers and thumb touching but that's not how it works
EDL	00:37:23,072	00:37:29,472	| radiolab102114 |	Each of our senses send signals into the brain as electricity little blips on nerves
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:35,616	| radiolab102114 |	And is the brain then converts those little blips into what you perceive as a sight or sound or smell no obviously
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:39,456	| radiolab102114 |	Someone was blind the retina is not sending those signals anymore
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:40,224	| radiolab102114 |	But
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:42,016	| radiolab102114 |	What is there is another way
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:42,784	| radiolab102114 |	To get
EDL	00:37:42,784	00:37:44,832	| radiolab102114 |	Signals for light and dark in color
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:51,232	| radiolab102114 |	Into all of our brains there lots and lots of Pathways going from every part of the brain to every other
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:51,744	| radiolab102114 |	Other part of the brain
EDL	00:37:52,256	00:37:55,328	| radiolab102114 |	Normally your brain isn't using those pass
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:56,864	| radiolab102114 |	Is even though they exist
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:37:59,424	| radiolab102114 |	It's like there's a road there but it's shut down
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:37:59,936	| radiolab102114 |	Traffic cam
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:01,728	| radiolab102114 |	But
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:08,640	| radiolab102114 |	What if you could open up some of those rats he's just let me sit with it on for an hour
EDL	00:38:08,640	00:38:15,040	| radiolab102114 |	Our two hours we just swivel her head around and feel the patterns on her tongue
EDL	00:38:15,040	00:38:18,368	| radiolab102114 |	Young change and every time I looked around he say
EDL	00:38:19,392	00:38:20,928	| radiolab102114 |	Oh that's a chair
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:21,952	| radiolab102114 |	Bassador
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:23,488	| radiolab102114 |	That's me
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:26,560	| radiolab102114 |	That's your mom
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:28,608	| radiolab102114 |	Like this for a while at shoulder a ball and it's
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:30,656	| radiolab102114 |	Square plastic banana
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:31,936	| radiolab102114 |	And nothing's really happening for
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:33,984	| radiolab102114 |	Except for that prickly feelings on your tongue
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:37,312	| radiolab102114 |	Then there was this moment I'd had this
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:39,360	| radiolab102114 |	Really long styrofoam Broad
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:40,896	| radiolab102114 |	And he
EDL	00:38:40,896	00:38:41,920	| radiolab102114 |	Plastic
EDL	00:38:41,920	00:38:43,712	| radiolab102114 |	In front of me he moved it
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:45,504	| radiolab102114 |	Up and down in front of my face
EDL	00:38:46,272	00:38:48,576	| radiolab102114 |	And I was like oh my God what was that
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:50,880	| radiolab102114 |	Suddenly she says you just
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:53,184	| radiolab102114 |	Thought I was like oh my God
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:55,744	| radiolab102114 |	It just happened
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:38:57,792	| radiolab102114 |	I don't know what it look like
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:39:00,352	| radiolab102114 |	So in my mind's eye looks like
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:02,656	| radiolab102114 |	A long way
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:03,936	| radiolab102114 |	Skinny
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:04,704	| radiolab102114 |	Stick
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:07,008	| radiolab102114 |	You see the texture of the sticker
EDL	00:39:07,520	00:39:08,288	| radiolab102114 |	No
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:11,360	| radiolab102114 |	I couldn't see texture I couldn't see
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:14,176	| radiolab102114 |	In three dimensions it was very flat
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:15,200	| radiolab102114 |	It is kind of like
EDL	00:39:15,968	00:39:16,992	| radiolab102114 |	That kids
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:18,784	| radiolab102114 |	Toy Lite-Brite
EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:22,368	| radiolab102114 |	So imagine like a black screen and
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:24,672	| radiolab102114 |	Little tiny white dots
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:25,952	| radiolab102114 |	All arranged in a line
EDL	00:39:28,000	00:39:32,864	| radiolab102114 |	To Emily was allowed to keep the brainport device for about a year-and-a-half and during that time
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:35,168	| radiolab102114 |	Lite-Brite resolution of a did get better
EDL	00:39:35,680	00:39:37,216	| radiolab102114 |	Has your brain learn to
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:37,984	| radiolab102114 |	Speak tongue
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:39,008	| radiolab102114 |	It was awesome
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:41,056	| radiolab102114 |	When I saw the p
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:45,920	| radiolab102114 |	And one of the things that really struck me in our conversation was I asked you about
EDL	00:39:45,920	00:39:46,432	| radiolab102114 |	This video
EDL	00:39:46,944	00:39:48,736	| radiolab102114 |	Her mom had sent me showing her
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:50,272	| radiolab102114 |	Wearing the device in walking down the
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:55,392	| radiolab102114 |	You told me that usually what you know now that she's blind when she's walking
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:39:56,672	| radiolab102114 |	Down the streets of New York City
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:39:59,232	| radiolab102114 |	Especially Uptown where the streets are
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:00,000	| radiolab102114 |	A lot wider
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:04,352	| radiolab102114 |	She said people see her and her white cane and walk a really wide circle around
EDL	00:40:05,120	00:40:05,632	| radiolab102114 |	So

EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:12,032	| radiolab102114 |	Yeah I hardly ever notice other people walking around me it feels like
EDL	00:40:12,800	00:40:13,568	| radiolab102114 |	I'm just
EDL	00:40:14,080	00:40:15,104	| radiolab102114 |	Walking alone
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:18,688	| radiolab102114 |	I can always hear the traffic
EDL	00:40:18,688	00:40:20,224	| radiolab102114 |	And the sound of traffic
EDL	00:40:20,224	00:40:20,736	| radiolab102114 |	But
EDL	00:40:21,248	00:40:22,016	| radiolab102114 |	Not if he
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:22,784	| radiolab102114 |	People
EDL	00:40:22,784	00:40:25,600	| radiolab102114 |	What you says when you put the device on input that was sent to Iran

EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:37,376	| radiolab102114 |	I thought it was amazing like I didn't know this many people were on the street at the say
EDL	00:40:37,376	00:40:43,520	| radiolab102114 |	Same time as me and now they're all they're all there again
EDL	00:40:45,312	00:40:46,592	| radiolab102114 |	Almost like a painting
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:51,712	| radiolab102114 |	Really soft lashes
EDL	00:40:52,736	00:40:54,528	| radiolab102114 |	Everything is really soft like
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:55,296	| radiolab102114 |	Soft
EDL	00:40:55,296	00:40:56,064	| radiolab102114 |	Roshes
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:41:02,976	| radiolab102114 |	Ink that can move their is walking and I can see them
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:04,768	| radiolab102114 |	Legs moving and I can see them
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:05,280	| radiolab102114 |	They're gay
EDL	00:41:06,304	00:41:08,608	| radiolab102114 |	But I couldn't see them clearly like I couldn't see
EDL	00:41:09,120	00:41:10,400	| radiolab102114 |	Defeater tour
EDL	00:41:10,912	00:41:13,728	| radiolab102114 |	Whether they were wearing a shirt or short circuit
EDL	00:41:14,496	00:41:17,568	| radiolab102114 |	Gas repairs I just like
EDL	00:41:17,568	00:41:18,592	| radiolab102114 |	See their Shadows
EDL	00:41:19,360	00:41:19,872	| radiolab102114 |	And
EDL	00:41:20,384	00:41:23,200	| radiolab102114 |	Every now and then I See the Light casted on them
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:29,600	| radiolab102114 |	I've mentioned smell like underwater
EDL	00:41:29,600	00:41:30,112	| radiolab102114 |	Pictures
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:32,928	| radiolab102114 |	Squishy jellyfish like
EDL	00:41:34,208	00:41:34,720	| radiolab102114 |	Yeah
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:38,816	| radiolab102114 |	Yeah like lighting up
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:46,240	| radiolab102114 |	Yeah like that
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:54,431	| radiolab102114 |	And that for Emily is
EDL	00:41:54,943	00:41:56,735	| radiolab102114 |	What it's like to translate the city
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:41:57,247	| radiolab102114 |	With your tongue
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:42:00,063	| radiolab102114 |	New York City becomes is
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:02,623	| radiolab102114 |	Hazy sea of
EDL	00:42:03,647	00:42:04,415	| radiolab102114 |	Walking fish
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:07,487	| radiolab102114 |	Make their way along in the sunshine
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:06,879	| radiolab102114 |	Lesson number five
EDL	00:43:07,391	00:43:11,487	| radiolab102114 |	I feel like we're Futures are going to crash today
EDL	00:43:11,487	00:43:13,535	| radiolab102114 |	What are the best roasts
EDL	00:43:14,047	00:43:14,815	| radiolab102114 |	Now you try
EDL	00:43:16,351	00:43:20,959	| radiolab102114 |	Next up producer Tim Howard so when I heard about this story with
EDL	00:43:20,959	00:43:23,775	| radiolab102114 |	Emily and the Brain Port I immediately called up this guy
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:25,823	| radiolab102114 |	Page on which my foot is it this one
EDL	00:43:26,335	00:43:32,735	| radiolab102114 |	You might remember him I'm David Eagleman I'm a neuroscientist at Baylor College of Medicine called him up because I can
EDL	00:43:32,735	00:43:34,527	| radiolab102114 |	Crosses thing that he's working on
EDL	00:43:34,527	00:43:35,295	| radiolab102114 |	That
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:37,087	| radiolab102114 |	Is sort of like the next
EDL	00:43:37,087	00:43:38,367	| radiolab102114 |	Generation
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:39,391	| radiolab102114 |	Of crazy
EDL	00:43:39,903	00:43:45,023	| radiolab102114 |	It called the vest which stands for the variable extrasensory
EDL	00:43:45,023	00:43:46,559	| radiolab102114 |	Sensory transducer
EDL	00:43:46,559	00:43:51,423	| radiolab102114 |	And it's it's a vest that you wear underneath the clothing in this vest has 24 Motors on it
EDL	00:43:52,959	00:43:55,519	| radiolab102114 |	Little vibratory Motors just like the ones in your cell phone
EDL	00:43:56,031	00:43:57,311	| radiolab102114 |	And the best
EDL	00:43:57,311	00:44:00,895	| radiolab102114 |	Connect to your phone so we pick up sound
EDL	00:44:01,663	00:44:02,943	| radiolab102114 |	Time Warner Cable calling
EDL	00:44:05,247	00:44:06,015	| radiolab102114 |	Valuable
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:08,063	| radiolab102114 |	Through a cell phone
EDL	00:44:08,063	00:44:12,415	| radiolab102114 |	And the cell phone does all the computational work to then convert that sound
EDL	00:44:12,415	00:44:18,815	| radiolab102114 |	Into patterns of vibration on the vest and you feel
EDL	00:44:18,815	00:44:25,215	| radiolab102114 |	Buzzing all over torso different Motors running at different amplitudes
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:31,615	| radiolab102114 |	It actually changes every 20 milliseconds so it's a moving pattern and it might seem impossible
EDL	00:44:31,615	00:44:36,223	| radiolab102114 |	That you could actually extract something useful about what's being said
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:41,087	| radiolab102114 |	When David brings death volunteers into the lab and have them do a particular training on the vest
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:46,463	| radiolab102114 |	He said that over the course of 12 Days people get really good
EDL	00:44:46,463	00:44:47,999	| radiolab102114 |	At word recognition
EDL	00:44:47,999	00:44:50,559	| radiolab102114 |	Somehow they begin to intuitively recognize
EDL	00:44:50,559	00:44:56,959	| radiolab102114 |	This means high for blue or chair if you tried to concentrate on it and
EDL	00:44:56,959	00:44:57,983	| radiolab102114 |	Figure out
EDL	00:44:57,983	00:44:59,775	| radiolab102114 |	How each motor Translate
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:01,055	| radiolab102114 |	Some part of that sound
EDL	00:45:01,055	00:45:02,335	| radiolab102114 |	You would never figure it out
EDL	00:45:02,847	00:45:03,871	| radiolab102114 |	But the good news is
EDL	00:45:04,383	00:45:05,919	| radiolab102114 |	You don't have to do it consciously
EDL	00:45:06,687	00:45:07,711	| radiolab102114 |	The brain
EDL	00:45:07,711	00:45:09,247	| radiolab102114 |	Is a special Aesthetics
EDL	00:45:09,247	00:45:10,271	| radiolab102114 |	Directing
EDL	00:45:10,271	00:45:11,807	| radiolab102114 |	Statistical information
EDL	00:45:11,807	00:45:16,927	| radiolab102114 |	And because of rain is so good at this kind of translation says David what he really wants
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:17,695	| radiolab102114 |	Do
EDL	00:45:17,695	00:45:18,975	| radiolab102114 |	Is used as best
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:20,511	| radiolab102114 |	To create new senses
EDL	00:45:21,791	00:45:27,935	| radiolab102114 |	So what if you fed in stock market data
EDL	00:45:30,239	00:45:36,639	| radiolab102114 |	Converted that into the busing who did you develop in the media
EDL	00:45:36,639	00:45:38,943	| radiolab102114 |	Perceptual experience
EDL	00:45:38,943	00:45:40,991	| radiolab102114 |	Of the economic movements of the planets
EDL	00:45:41,503	00:45:47,903	| radiolab102114 |	And would you without having any conscious awareness of how or why you're feeling a certain way could you have
EDL	00:45:47,903	00:45:51,231	| radiolab102114 |	Having intuition like you kind of feel like oil Futures are going to
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:51,743	| radiolab102114 |	Crash today
EDL	00:45:52,255	00:45:53,279	| radiolab102114 |	You wouldn't be
EDL	00:45:53,279	00:45:55,583	| radiolab102114 |	Analyzing all this information you would just
EDL	00:45:56,095	00:45:58,655	| radiolab102114 |	Feel like we're also working on feeding in
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:45:59,423	| radiolab102114 |	You are seeing a
EDL	00:45:59,423	00:45:59,935	| radiolab102114 |	From minutes
EDL	00:46:00,703	00:46:06,591	| radiolab102114 |	Real time weather data from the let's say 200 miles
EDL	00:46:06,591	00:46:07,615	| radiolab102114 |	Around you
EDL	00:46:07,615	00:46:08,639	| radiolab102114 |	Question is
EDL	00:46:08,639	00:46:11,711	| radiolab102114 |	Would you end up having an intuition Peekskill
EDL	00:46:12,991	00:46:14,015	| radiolab102114 |	That's better
EDL	00:46:14,783	00:46:17,343	| radiolab102114 |	Then what the weatherman can tell you on the news
EDL	00:46:17,343	00:46:17,855	| radiolab102114 |	Or
EDL	00:46:18,367	00:46:19,903	| radiolab102114 |	This one what if we took
EDL	00:46:22,207	00:46:24,255	| radiolab102114 |	500000 tweets per second
EDL	00:46:24,255	00:46:27,583	| radiolab102114 |	Cast it through some natural language processing disorder
EDL	00:46:27,583	00:46:33,727	| radiolab102114 |	A higher level summary of what's going on and pump all that information through the best would you develop a sense
EDL	00:46:34,495	00:46:37,311	| radiolab102114 |	What's happening on the planet where you suddenly say
EDL	00:46:37,311	00:46:38,847	| radiolab102114 |	I feel like something just
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:39,871	| radiolab102114 |	Happened in Nairobi
EDL	00:46:40,383	00:46:41,919	| radiolab102114 |	And oh I think the
EDL	00:46:41,919	00:46:44,991	| radiolab102114 |	Canadians have Justina finalized their election of something in it
EDL	00:46:45,503	00:46:51,903	| radiolab102114 |	I don't know what this will be like yet but there's no reason to expect any limit on on what the brain will be able
EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:52,415	| radiolab102114 |	Able to develop
EDL	00:46:52,927	00:46:55,487	| radiolab102114 |	An immediate perceptual experience about

EDL	00:47:51,807	00:47:55,135	| radiolab102114 |	A little taste of all these different things aren't there happening in the world
EDL	00:47:55,647	00:47:56,927	| radiolab102114 |	It really opens your eyes

EDL	00:48:03,327	00:48:06,655	| radiolab102114 |	Is just remember going to work with my dad
EDL	00:48:06,655	00:48:12,287	| radiolab102114 |	And it was a janitor and my dad said you know he actually speaks another language
EDL	00:48:12,799	00:48:13,823	| radiolab102114 |	Another language
EDL	00:48:13,823	00:48:15,103	| radiolab102114 |	On top of English
EDL	00:48:15,103	00:48:15,871	| radiolab102114 |	And she says

EDL	00:48:22,271	00:48:28,671	| radiolab102114 |	Learn fast forward many many years Natalie goes to college and she just started learning languages Spanish
EDL	00:48:28,671	00:48:34,559	| radiolab102114 |	Please Arabic German Italian whatever I could get my hands on
EDL	00:48:34,559	00:48:36,863	| radiolab102114 |	Connector to The Wider world but what it actually led to
EDL	00:48:37,375	00:48:37,887	| radiolab102114 |	At least initially
EDL	00:48:38,655	00:48:41,727	| radiolab102114 |	It's very strange job called telephone interpreting
EDL	00:48:41,727	00:48:43,519	| radiolab102114 |	This is how I never actually thought
EDL	00:48:43,519	00:48:44,287	| radiolab102114 |	To think about
EDL	00:48:44,287	00:48:48,383	| radiolab102114 |	Until now the basically when anyone calls a business and there's a language barrier
EDL	00:48:49,151	00:48:54,015	| radiolab102114 |	The operator can call switchboard and Patchen someone like Natalie for them
EDL	00:48:54,015	00:48:57,087	| radiolab102114 |	Natalie like a lot of these telephone interpreters work remotely
EDL	00:48:57,087	00:48:59,903	| radiolab102114 |	Which man should be in her house alone in a room and every few minutes
EDL	00:49:01,183	00:49:03,743	| radiolab102114 |	Hello this is interpreter 3940 how may I help you
EDL	00:49:03,743	00:49:04,255	| radiolab102114 |	She get a call
EDL	00:49:04,767	00:49:05,791	| radiolab102114 |	And it could be anything

EDL	00:57:16,799	00:57:18,591	| radiolab102114 |	Like take for example the word
EDL	00:57:19,615	00:57:21,151	| radiolab102114 |	Now that the light
EDL	00:57:21,151	00:57:22,943	| radiolab102114 |	Way to do it with two maybe
EDL	00:57:22,943	00:57:23,711	| radiolab102114 |	Spell it
EDL	00:57:23,711	00:57:24,223	| radiolab102114 |	So f
EDL	00:57:24,735	00:57:25,247	| radiolab102114 |	Uck
EDL	00:57:25,759	00:57:29,855	| radiolab102114 |	Or the regular gesture you could do this
EDL	00:57:29,855	00:57:31,391	| radiolab102114 |	Tear you giving us the finger
EDL	00:57:31,391	00:57:32,159	| radiolab102114 |	Two middle fingers
EDL	00:57:32,159	00:57:34,463	| radiolab102114 |	You know there's quite a few
EDL	00:57:34,463	00:57:40,607	| radiolab102114 |	Getting started and then there's this one that actually shows people doing the action
EDL	00:57:41,119	00:57:43,167	| radiolab102114 |	Two fingers on each hand and
EDL	00:57:43,167	00:57:45,471	| radiolab102114 |	There's that you know this
EDL	00:57:45,471	00:57:48,543	| radiolab102114 |	Play which is even more graphic arms out
EDL	00:57:49,311	00:57:52,639	| radiolab102114 |	Pelvic thrust is receiving the physical
EDL	00:57:53,407	00:57:54,943	| radiolab102114 |	So she had a lot options
EDL	00:57:54,943	00:57:56,223	| radiolab102114 |	But with Jeff Ross
EDL	00:57:56,735	00:57:59,807	| radiolab102114 |	She figured that what was necessary
EDL	00:57:59,807	00:58:01,087	| radiolab102114 |	But this kind of intimate
EDL	00:58:01,087	00:58:04,415	| radiolab102114 |	Graphic tone he was down and dirty down and dirty
EDL	00:58:04,927	00:58:07,487	| radiolab102114 |	You didn't have any discomfort with any of that
EDL	00:58:08,511	00:58:14,911	| radiolab102114 |	Arnetta having such a good time I really I really was enjoying it
EDL	00:58:14,911	00:58:15,679	| radiolab102114 |	You asked
EDL	00:58:15,679	00:58:17,215	| radiolab102114 |	Never occurred to me
EDL	00:58:17,983	00:58:19,775	| radiolab102114 |	She was there for one
EDL	00:58:19,775	00:58:20,543	| radiolab102114 |	Girl
EDL	00:58:20,543	00:58:21,055	| radiolab102114 |	1 Def
EDL	00:58:22,591	00:58:24,895	| radiolab102114 |	So there's fourteen thousand people there
EDL	00:58:25,919	00:58:27,199	| radiolab102114 |	But one ticket buyer
EDL	00:58:27,199	00:58:28,735	| radiolab102114 |	I was deaf and ask for sign language
EDL	00:58:29,247	00:58:30,527	| radiolab102114 |	Just one yeah
EDL	00:58:30,527	00:58:32,063	| radiolab102114 |	Young girls that with their mom
EDL	00:58:32,575	00:58:35,647	| radiolab102114 |	But you know where this client was
EDL	00:58:35,647	00:58:37,183	| radiolab102114 |	Yeah oh yeah she was
EDL	00:58:37,183	00:58:39,487	| radiolab102114 |	In that position on the stage because she was
EDL	00:58:39,487	00:58:40,511	| radiolab102114 |	Near where the client
EDL	00:58:41,279	00:58:42,303	| radiolab102114 |	Inside the whole time she's
EDL	00:58:42,815	00:58:43,839	| radiolab102114 |	Sign into words
EDL	00:58:43,839	00:58:46,143	| radiolab102114 |	The client and see her reaction can you just
EDL	00:58:46,143	00:58:46,655	| radiolab102114 |	Scribe
EDL	00:58:47,167	00:58:48,191	| radiolab102114 |	What your client
EDL	00:58:48,191	00:58:48,959	| radiolab102114 |	What's doing
EDL	00:58:48,959	00:58:53,567	| radiolab102114 |	She was like oh so I figured your hand over your eyes
EDL	00:58:53,567	00:58:59,967	| radiolab102114 |	She said the client when it was like a whole body cramps and I think she thought she was getting a lot of attention
EDL	00:58:59,967	00:59:01,503	| radiolab102114 |	The client was mortified
EDL	00:59:02,015	00:59:04,063	| radiolab102114 |	An intermission
EDL	00:59:04,063	00:59:05,343	| radiolab102114 |	My client
EDL	00:59:05,343	00:59:06,623	| radiolab102114 |	Find back to her
EDL	00:59:06,623	00:59:08,927	| radiolab102114 |	We're going to take off and go home now
EDL	00:59:08,927	00:59:09,695	| radiolab102114 |	So I'm like
EDL	00:59:10,975	00:59:12,767	| radiolab102114 |	Has a Kim left because the client left
EDL	00:59:13,279	00:59:19,679	| radiolab102114 |	Yeah we did you manage to talk to this girl at the email there I got the venue to call her
EDL	00:59:19,679	00:59:20,447	| radiolab102114 |	But she hasn't gotten
EDL	00:59:22,495	00:59:23,775	| radiolab102114 |	I'm suddenly feeling bad for this
EDL	00:59:24,799	00:59:26,335	| radiolab102114 |	Does Similac she got a raw deal
EDL	00:59:26,847	00:59:29,407	| radiolab102114 |	Would you get if you had been her
EDL	00:59:29,407	00:59:31,199	| radiolab102114 |	Have you been Kim would you have
EDL	00:59:31,199	00:59:31,711	| radiolab102114 |	You think
EDL	00:59:32,479	00:59:34,783	| radiolab102114 |	Just enjoy yourself a little less
EDL	00:59:34,783	00:59:37,087	| radiolab102114 |	It's been a little less graphic and been a little
EDL	00:59:37,087	00:59:37,599	| radiolab102114 |	Less
EDL	00:59:39,647	00:59:40,927	| radiolab102114 |	Playing with the comedian
EDL	00:59:41,695	00:59:43,487	| radiolab102114 |	I think I would have dialed it down
EDL	00:59:43,487	00:59:45,279	| radiolab102114 |	Knowing me oh my God yeah
EDL	00:59:45,279	00:59:49,887	| radiolab102114 |	You would have dialed it down he's a good man Jasmine translator
EDL	00:59:49,887	00:59:54,495	| radiolab102114 |	A terrible translator me this is one girl in a crowd of 14,000
EDL	00:59:54,495	00:59:55,775	| radiolab102114 |	Then in the transit Reserve
EDL	00:59:55,775	00:59:58,591	| radiolab102114 |	Her not the 40,000
EDL	00:59:59,103	01:00:03,711	| radiolab102114 |	She came to a comedy but it it was there in any way in which Kim had an obligation
EDL	01:00:04,223	01:00:05,247	| radiolab102114 |	To represent the
EDL	01:00:05,247	01:00:06,015	| radiolab102114 |	The client
EDL	01:00:06,015	01:00:09,343	| radiolab102114 |	Can I see the middle between us I think that's
EDL	01:00:09,343	01:00:15,231	| radiolab102114 |	And I think the correct question I think it's a fair question I mean she's not just their represent Jeff Jeff on
EDL	01:00:15,231	01:00:17,535	| radiolab102114 |	No she's there too to be
EDL	01:00:17,535	01:00:20,095	| radiolab102114 |	Mutual representative of people know
EDL	01:00:20,095	01:00:26,495	| radiolab102114 |	Why do a comedy show she's in the show she's translating the show from the state
EDL	01:00:26,495	01:00:29,311	| radiolab102114 |	Person that's what Kim said and if they're yelling
EDL	01:00:29,311	01:00:30,591	| radiolab102114 |	And screaming
EDL	01:00:30,591	01:00:33,663	| radiolab102114 |	Your signs are bigger your faces
EDL	01:00:33,663	01:00:38,015	| radiolab102114 |	Exaggerated you know I made it clear to the tone that he was
EDL	01:00:38,015	01:00:38,527	| radiolab102114 |	Projecting
EDL	01:00:39,039	01:00:40,319	| radiolab102114 |	But after that
EDL	01:00:40,319	01:00:46,463	| radiolab102114 |	Do you feel bad at all did you do feel like you've lost sight of her and you started translating for the whole crowd
EDL	01:00:46,463	01:00:49,279	| radiolab102114 |	I feel like you went Behind Enemy Lines at all
EDL	01:00:49,279	01:00:52,607	| radiolab102114 |	She just said no she was deaf I would have done this
EDL	01:00:52,607	01:00:53,375	| radiolab102114 |	The same thing
EDL	01:00:53,375	01:00:55,423	| radiolab102114 |	Doing my job yes
EDL	01:00:55,423	01:00:56,703	| radiolab102114 |	Cuz that's what a translator.
EDL	01:00:57,215	01:00:57,983	| radiolab102114 |	A translator is
EDL	01:00:58,495	01:01:01,567	| radiolab102114 |	Making what is happening up there available to me
EDL	01:01:02,079	01:01:03,103	| radiolab102114 |	Not creating a middle C
EDL	01:01:04,895	01:01:08,223	| radiolab102114 |	I guess you could argue that if she had made the choice to fingerspell
EDL	01:01:08,223	01:01:14,623	| radiolab102114 |	So that she protected the girl you could see that from her perspective as I was saying that because she's not giving her the full experience
EDL	01:01:14,623	01:01:16,927	| radiolab102114 |	Weird because in her making the equal
EDL	01:01:17,439	01:01:18,975	| radiolab102114 |	Experience and her doing that
EDL	01:01:19,487	01:01:20,255	| radiolab102114 |	She makes an X
EDL	01:01:20,255	01:01:21,023	| radiolab102114 |	Experience with docker
EDL	01:01:22,047	01:01:23,071	| radiolab102114 |	Wow
EDL	01:01:23,071	01:01:23,839	| radiolab102114 |	Other
EDL	01:01:23,839	01:01:25,119	| radiolab102114 |	Camden tell me
EDL	01:01:25,119	01:01:25,631	| radiolab102114 |	She could have taken it
EDL	01:01:26,911	01:01:28,447	| radiolab102114 |	Pressure intimate
EDL	01:01:28,447	01:01:29,471	| radiolab102114 |	Oh no I did not
EDL	01:01:29,471	01:01:32,543	| radiolab102114 |	No
EDL	01:01:32,543	01:01:34,079	| radiolab102114 |	I did not go there
EDL	01:01:35,871	01:01:37,663	| radiolab102114 |	I didn't casual
EDL	01:01:49,951	01:01:53,023	| radiolab102114 |	Badcock
EDL	01:01:56,863	01:02:00,447	| radiolab102114 |	The song deeper 3D pictures about
EDL	01:02:00,447	01:02:03,775	| radiolab102114 |	Disney chocolate Auntie boots
EDL	01:02:11,711	01:02:14,015	| radiolab102114 |	Lesson number 8
EDL	01:02:14,783	01:02:18,879	| radiolab102114 |	How does it make the ribosomes without a ribosome to make the ribosomes
EDL	01:02:19,391	01:02:25,023	| radiolab102114 |	Motivate Barre bedroom
EDL	01:02:26,303	01:02:27,071	| radiolab102114 |	Now you try
EDL	01:02:29,375	01:02:31,679	| radiolab102114 |	Do you guys mind if in the remaining few minutes
EDL	01:02:33,215	01:02:39,359	| radiolab102114 |	We going on an RNA fishing exposition
EDL	01:02:40,383	01:02:41,151	| radiolab102114 |	What's your situation
EDL	01:02:42,175	01:02:44,991	| radiolab102114 |	OKC recently we sat down with a reporter and
EDL	01:02:44,991	01:02:45,759	| radiolab102114 |	And science writer
EDL	01:02:45,759	01:02:47,295	| radiolab102114 |	Carl Zimmer to talk about
EDL	01:02:48,063	01:02:48,575	| radiolab102114 |	RNA
EDL	01:02:49,087	01:02:51,135	| radiolab102114 |	We were talking about something else in RNA chemo
EDL	01:02:51,135	01:02:55,487	| radiolab102114 |	Cuz here's why ever since we started doing the show Robert got
EDL	01:02:55,487	01:02:56,511	| radiolab102114 |	His
EDL	01:02:56,511	01:02:58,047	| radiolab102114 |	Got his
EDL	01:02:58,047	01:03:03,679	| radiolab102114 |	I got a little in system for
EDL	01:03:03,679	01:03:07,007	| radiolab102114 |	All right I was like what do you want to do and you're like what I do or Nana's like
EDL	01:03:07,007	01:03:11,615	| radiolab102114 |	But is there a story in your garden
EDL	01:03:11,615	01:03:16,479	| radiolab102114 |	That if you understood what RNA does you'd realize that translation is
EDL	01:03:16,479	01:03:21,087	| radiolab102114 |	Profoundly important to our existence that's why I said
EDL	01:03:22,623	01:03:24,415	| radiolab102114 |	As I alright fine let's just try it
EDL	01:03:25,695	01:03:31,071	| radiolab102114 |	So we were talking with Carl Zimmer we brought it up now unfortunately I think this is a day when you were out of town
EDL	01:03:31,583	01:03:32,863	| radiolab102114 |	I think you're at your son was getting married
EDL	01:03:33,887	01:03:37,471	| radiolab102114 |	And I was doing like taking work for me
EDL	01:03:37,471	01:03:38,495	| radiolab102114 |	Okay alright
EDL	01:03:38,495	01:03:41,055	| radiolab102114 |	So the definition of translation in biology
EDL	01:03:41,823	01:03:42,847	| radiolab102114 |	Taking a sequence
EDL	01:03:43,615	01:03:44,639	| radiolab102114 |	In DNA
EDL	01:03:44,639	01:03:46,431	| radiolab102114 |	And using the genetic code
EDL	01:03:46,431	01:03:47,199	| radiolab102114 |	2
EDL	01:03:47,199	01:03:47,967	| radiolab102114 |	Translated
EDL	01:03:48,479	01:03:48,991	| radiolab102114 |	Into protein
EDL	01:03:50,527	01:03:52,575	| radiolab102114 |	Right and the discovery
EDL	01:03:53,087	01:03:54,111	| radiolab102114 |	Of this was
EDL	01:03:54,111	01:03:55,391	| radiolab102114 |	Maybe even more exciting
EDL	01:03:55,903	01:03:56,671	| radiolab102114 |	Then
EDL	01:03:56,671	01:03:57,695	| radiolab102114 |	The discovery of the double helix
EDL	01:04:00,255	01:04:02,303	| radiolab102114 |	It was bigger than the Watson and Crick
EDL	01:04:02,303	01:04:03,327	| radiolab102114 |	Yeah well
EDL	01:04:03,327	01:04:04,095	| radiolab102114 |	At least equivalent
EDL	01:04:05,631	01:04:11,263	| radiolab102114 |	So here's a quick story so what happened was okay to Justice at the table here we all know the DNA is a thing
EDL	01:04:11,263	01:04:13,567	| radiolab102114 |	And that when you're born you get half your DNA from Mom half
EDL	01:04:14,079	01:04:14,847	| radiolab102114 |	Dad
EDL	01:04:14,847	01:04:17,663	| radiolab102114 |	The Francis Crick and James Watson
EDL	01:04:17,663	01:04:18,431	| radiolab102114 |	Figured out
EDL	01:04:18,943	01:04:20,991	| radiolab102114 |	The structure of DNA the basically
EDL	01:04:20,991	01:04:23,039	| radiolab102114 |	The recipe of DNA your recipe
EDL	01:04:23,039	01:04:23,807	| radiolab102114 |	Is comprised of
EDL	01:04:23,807	01:04:24,575	| radiolab102114 |	The four bases
EDL	01:04:24,575	01:04:25,855	| radiolab102114 |	Is in a long string
EDL	01:04:27,135	01:04:27,903	| radiolab102114 |	See
EDL	01:04:27,903	01:04:29,183	| radiolab102114 |	Angie that's it
EDL	01:04:29,183	01:04:32,511	| radiolab102114 |	Pictures of Ramsey like we humans were more than DNA we are these

EDL	01:04:43,263	01:04:46,335	| radiolab102114 |	Different kinds of proteins to the question was
EDL	01:04:46,335	01:04:48,639	| radiolab102114 |	How does all that get generated account of the
EDL	01:04:48,639	01:04:50,687	| radiolab102114 |	4 simple bass has become the amino acids
EDL	01:04:51,199	01:04:53,759	| radiolab102114 |	Hundreds of thousands of proteins that make

EDL	01:04:54,527	01:04:57,087	| radiolab102114 |	Us how do you make the translation
EDL	01:04:57,087	01:04:59,391	| radiolab102114 |	People were thinking of this as just this
EDL	01:04:59,391	01:05:01,951	| radiolab102114 |	Incredibly complicated problem that might
EDL	01:05:02,463	01:05:03,487	| radiolab102114 |	Never be solved
EDL	01:05:03,999	01:05:04,767	| radiolab102114 |	And
EDL	01:05:04,767	01:05:07,839	| radiolab102114 |	The first person really think seriously about this was not a geneticist

EDL	01:05:09,375	01:05:11,679	| radiolab102114 |	Gamo just said wait a minute
EDL	01:05:11,679	01:05:12,703	| radiolab102114 |	This isn't that complicated
EDL	01:05:13,471	01:05:14,495	| radiolab102114 |	This is just cryptography
EDL	01:05:16,799	01:05:17,567	| radiolab102114 |	This is a code 4

EDL	01:05:19,615	01:05:20,895	| radiolab102114 |	I know the DNA
EDL	01:05:20,895	01:05:23,455	| radiolab102114 |	Is contains four bases A T C and G
EDL	01:05:23,455	01:05:28,063	| radiolab102114 |	They somehow create hundreds of thousands of proteins so I just need to
EDL	01:05:28,063	01:05:30,879	| radiolab102114 |	Think of a clever way of
EDL	01:05:31,647	01:05:37,279	| radiolab102114 |	You know creating a little code machine where you put in the DNA
EDL	01:05:37,791	01:05:43,167	| radiolab102114 |	And then out comes the protein. What what simple code could I do to do that
EDL	01:05:43,167	01:05:45,983	| radiolab102114 |	And just sitting there no experiments no nothing just thinking
EDL	01:05:46,495	01:05:49,567	| radiolab102114 |	This guy came out decides I think that
EDL	01:05:49,567	01:05:52,383	| radiolab102114 |	Are cells read our genes three bases at a time
EDL	01:05:53,407	01:05:54,687	| radiolab102114 |	Like instead of 80

EDL	01:05:56,223	01:05:59,295	| radiolab102114 |	AC, thought maybe it's ATA ccg
EDL	01:05:59,295	01:06:00,063	| radiolab102114 |	TCA
EDL	01:06:00,063	01:06:06,463	| radiolab102114 |	In other words whatever it was it was reading the DNA in the cell maybe it was reading it in triples
EDL	01:06:06,463	01:06:12,863	| radiolab102114 |	Not pair cuz if you have sets of three rather than two game of figured
EDL	01:06:12,863	01:06:18,751	| radiolab102114 |	Possibilities and that might put you on the path to making all those hundreds of thousands of proteins
EDL	01:06:19,263	01:06:25,663	| radiolab102114 |	Now this is just a guess but surely after the double helix Duo Watson Crick and a group of other
EDL	01:06:25,663	01:06:26,431	| radiolab102114 |	Other scientists
EDL	01:06:26,431	01:06:27,199	| radiolab102114 |	Work it all out
EDL	01:06:27,967	01:06:30,527	| radiolab102114 |	They they figured out how you get them
EDL	01:06:31,039	01:06:33,343	| radiolab102114 |	Physically get from DNA into
EDL	01:06:33,343	01:06:33,855	| radiolab102114 |	Proteins
EDL	01:06:34,367	01:06:34,879	| radiolab102114 |	You're so works
EDL	01:06:35,391	01:06:37,439	| radiolab102114 |	Inside the cell
EDL	01:06:37,439	01:06:43,071	| radiolab102114 |	The DNA sitting there all coiled up the set of molecules come along attached to it
EDL	01:06:43,071	01:06:46,655	| radiolab102114 |	Unzip it and it got a copy of it
EDL	01:06:46,655	01:06:53,055	| radiolab102114 |	This copy is now made of RNA which is like DNA very similar still in a basic sort of four letter format
EDL	01:06:53,055	01:06:54,847	| radiolab102114 |	On the move cuz it pedals over to the
EDL	01:06:54,847	01:07:00,223	| radiolab102114 |	Big old factory in the cell called the ribosome
EDL	01:07:00,223	01:07:06,623	| radiolab102114 |	This crazy floppy convulsive Collective of molecules
EDL	01:07:06,623	01:07:11,231	| radiolab102114 |	What's the RNA copy is inside this big Factory another kind of RNA
EDL	01:07:11,231	01:07:13,791	| radiolab102114 |	Comes over and begins to
EDL	01:07:15,583	01:07:21,983	| radiolab102114 |	Read my sister eat at I'm like okay ATA well that must be cool
EDL	01:07:21,983	01:07:28,383	| radiolab102114 |	GGC well that's going to be and it begins to create this chain of amino acids
EDL	01:07:28,383	01:07:32,223	| radiolab102114 |	King of proteins and eventually the ribosome will take this chain and
EDL	01:07:34,015	01:07:34,783	| radiolab102114 |	Ejected out
EDL	01:07:36,319	01:07:39,135	| radiolab102114 |	So that they can go grab oxygen or
EDL	01:07:39,135	01:07:41,439	| radiolab102114 |	Cut up your food or make your hair or the

EDL	01:07:52,191	01:07:52,703	| radiolab102114 |	Of you
EDL	01:07:53,215	01:07:59,359	| radiolab102114 |	Cuz I I mean I remember growing up thinking no DNA is my sort of like manual my blueprint or something all of me is in there and
EDL	01:07:59,871	01:08:02,431	| radiolab102114 |	System Outlet opens and then out pops me
EDL	01:08:02,943	01:08:04,479	| radiolab102114 |	But you're saying that there is this
EDL	01:08:04,479	01:08:06,527	| radiolab102114 |	Sting that is reading these three base pairs
EDL	01:08:06,527	01:08:08,319	| radiolab102114 |	Forming any of a
EDL	01:08:08,319	01:08:09,599	| radiolab102114 |	100000 proteins
EDL	01:08:09,599	01:08:13,951	| radiolab102114 |	Suddenly I'm thinking that's where the game is nuts not the DNA but in the thing at 3 Midday and
EDL	01:08:13,951	01:08:18,303	| radiolab102114 |	Well yeah I mean DNA is just a totally meaningless molecule just flopping around
EDL	01:08:18,303	01:08:18,815	| radiolab102114 |	Unless
EDL	01:08:19,327	01:08:20,863	| radiolab102114 |	There is a way of
EDL	01:08:21,631	01:08:22,399	| radiolab102114 |	Reading it
EDL	01:08:22,399	01:08:25,727	| radiolab102114 |	Doesn't the build that they're they're the reader of the DNA come from the DNA
EDL	01:08:26,239	01:08:27,775	| radiolab102114 |	Trip to that's just weird
EDL	01:08:27,775	01:08:29,823	| radiolab102114 |	CW app so you have jeans for
EDL	01:08:30,591	01:08:32,127	| radiolab102114 |	The parts of the ribosome
EDL	01:08:32,127	01:08:35,455	| radiolab102114 |	At this point a producer Tim Howard and Stern wheeler
EDL	01:08:36,223	01:08:36,991	| radiolab102114 |	It's like a book
EDL	01:08:37,503	01:08:38,015	| radiolab102114 |	That
EDL	01:08:38,527	01:08:40,063	| radiolab102114 |	Birth its own reader
EDL	01:08:41,087	01:08:45,695	| radiolab102114 |	That's that will read the book not exactly though because that does you you are certain
EDL	01:08:45,695	01:08:46,975	| radiolab102114 |	Putting DNA pain
EDL	01:08:46,975	01:08:50,815	| radiolab102114 |	That pedal store
EDL	01:08:50,815	01:08:52,607	| radiolab102114 |	Sequential it is it's it's it's first

EDL	01:08:55,679	01:08:59,775	| radiolab102114 |	What you're saying is it in the order of events you begin with DNA and then after that
EDL	01:08:59,775	01:09:00,287	| radiolab102114 |	Get the ribosomes
EDL	01:09:00,799	01:09:01,823	| radiolab102114 |	Events of what
EDL	01:09:02,335	01:09:02,847	| radiolab102114 |	Of you
EDL	01:09:03,615	01:09:06,687	| radiolab102114 |	Okay but but you got to bear in mind that you
EDL	01:09:06,687	01:09:11,295	| radiolab102114 |	I don't know how far back you want to go with you where do we start with you
EDL	01:09:11,295	01:09:12,319	| radiolab102114 |	Do you want to start
EDL	01:09:12,319	01:09:13,599	| radiolab102114 |	Jazz the fertilized egg
EDL	01:09:14,111	01:09:15,647	| radiolab102114 |	Well hello
EDL	01:09:16,159	01:09:17,183	| radiolab102114 |	Sure yeah okay
EDL	01:09:17,695	01:09:19,487	| radiolab102114 |	Chad the fertilized egg has DNA
EDL	01:09:20,511	01:09:21,791	| radiolab102114 |	Annie's ribosomes
EDL	01:09:21,791	01:09:23,327	| radiolab102114 |	House of the Breeders already present
EDL	01:09:24,095	01:09:25,375	| radiolab102114 |	When a cell divides
EDL	01:09:25,375	01:09:27,423	| radiolab102114 |	Two new copies of DNA go into
EDL	01:09:27,935	01:09:30,751	| radiolab102114 |	Each new cell but they also divided up all the ribosomes
EDL	01:09:31,519	01:09:32,287	| radiolab102114 |	From the original cell
EDL	01:09:32,799	01:09:34,335	| radiolab102114 |	So they're taking the factories with
EDL	01:09:35,103	01:09:38,431	| radiolab102114 |	So you the DNA is never without
EDL	01:09:38,431	01:09:39,711	| radiolab102114 |	The code
EDL	01:09:39,711	01:09:41,247	| radiolab102114 |	Okay so it's like Moses
EDL	01:09:41,759	01:09:43,039	| radiolab102114 |	With the tablet
EDL	01:09:43,039	01:09:43,551	| radiolab102114 |	Together
EDL	01:09:48,927	01:09:55,071	| radiolab102114 |	Regular is a Noah can I just have never thought of it that way so I might need to think about
EDL	01:09:57,375	01:09:59,423	| radiolab102114 |	What makes the ribosomes then
EDL	01:09:59,423	01:10:01,215	| radiolab102114 |	Is it come from the DNA I thought you just said that
EDL	01:10:02,751	01:10:05,055	| radiolab102114 |	Yes it is how does it make the ribosome without a
EDL	01:10:05,567	01:10:07,871	| radiolab102114 |	Directions on to help it make the ribosomes
EDL	01:10:07,871	01:10:08,383	| radiolab102114 |	Wait
EDL	01:10:10,175	01:10:12,223	| radiolab102114 |	Translator
EDL	01:10:12,735	01:10:14,783	| radiolab102114 |	DNA code to the ribosomes how do you
EDL	01:10:15,295	01:10:16,575	| radiolab102114 |	Make the ribosome without a
EDL	01:10:16,575	01:10:17,855	| radiolab102114 |	Ribosome to translate
EDL	01:10:17,855	01:10:18,623	| radiolab102114 |	The code to make the rabbits
EDL	01:10:19,391	01:10:21,439	| radiolab102114 |	You couldn't wait a second
EDL	01:10:21,439	01:10:25,279	| radiolab102114 |	I'm so confused right now to take the DNA and the ribosome
EDL	01:10:25,791	01:10:26,559	| radiolab102114 |	Partnership
EDL	01:10:27,583	01:10:28,095	| radiolab102114 |	All the way back
EDL	01:10:28,863	01:10:29,887	| radiolab102114 |	Do billions of years
EDL	01:10:30,655	01:10:31,423	| radiolab102114 |	Zeze
EDL	01:10:31,423	01:10:32,447	| radiolab102114 |	2
EDL	01:10:32,447	01:10:33,215	| radiolab102114 |	Parts of the system
EDL	01:10:33,727	01:10:35,263	| radiolab102114 |	Evolve and became dependent.
EDL	01:10:35,775	01:10:36,543	| radiolab102114 |	Are there very early in his
EDL	01:10:37,311	01:10:39,615	| radiolab102114 |	Fat girl says a lot of biologists think
EDL	01:10:39,615	01:10:40,383	| radiolab102114 |	The life
EDL	01:10:40,383	01:10:41,151	| radiolab102114 |	Started out
EDL	01:10:41,663	01:10:42,687	| radiolab102114 |	As just
EDL	01:10:42,687	01:10:43,455	| radiolab102114 |	RNA
EDL	01:10:43,455	01:10:43,967	| radiolab102114 |	No DNA
EDL	01:10:44,735	01:10:46,783	| radiolab102114 |	And so you would basically have
EDL	01:10:46,783	01:10:49,343	| radiolab102114 |	Little little organisms that would
EDL	01:10:49,343	01:10:51,647	| radiolab102114 |	Have these little kind of Proto genes made of RNA
EDL	01:10:52,671	01:10:53,951	| radiolab102114 |	Eventually
EDL	01:10:53,951	01:10:56,767	| radiolab102114 |	These RNA molecules started to connect
EDL	01:10:57,279	01:10:57,791	| radiolab102114 |	Amino acids
EDL	01:10:58,815	01:11:00,607	| radiolab102114 |	To make a little building blocks
EDL	01:11:00,607	01:11:01,375	| radiolab102114 |	The proteins
EDL	01:11:01,375	01:11:02,399	| radiolab102114 |	So you're saying that
EDL	01:11:03,679	01:11:05,983	| radiolab102114 |	People generally think RNA came first
EDL	01:11:05,983	01:11:09,055	| radiolab102114 |	That is one of a couple leading
EDL	01:11:09,055	01:11:09,823	| radiolab102114 |	Okay
EDL	01:11:10,591	01:11:13,151	| radiolab102114 |	So it's possible that darnay came first
EDL	01:11:13,663	01:11:14,175	| radiolab102114 |	Then DNA
EDL	01:11:14,687	01:11:18,527	| radiolab102114 |	Somehow it suddenly I'm thinking we shouldn't talk about RNA all the all along
EDL	01:11:19,551	01:11:20,319	| radiolab102114 |	Twilight
EDL	01:11:20,319	01:11:23,135	| radiolab102114 |	I mean just in general RNA has been incredibly
EDL	01:11:23,135	01:11:23,647	| radiolab102114 |	Neglected
EDL	01:11:25,951	01:11:29,535	| radiolab102114 |	The Bible instead of in the beginning was the word should have been in the beginning was
EDL	01:11:29,535	01:11:30,815	| radiolab102114 |	The person reading the word
EDL	01:11:30,815	01:11:32,095	| radiolab102114 |	In the beginning was the code
EDL	01:11:35,423	01:11:36,959	| radiolab102114 |	Did you guys feel the earthquake just now
EDL	01:11:37,727	01:11:40,287	| radiolab102114 |	I really know there was there was some kind of vibration happening
