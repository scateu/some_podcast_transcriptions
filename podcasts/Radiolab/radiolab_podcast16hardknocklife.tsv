EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:25,504	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	It would be out of respect
EDL	00:01:25,504	00:01:26,784	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Would be very quiet
EDL	00:01:26,784	00:01:30,368	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Creeping around the house
EDL	00:01:31,392	00:01:32,928	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	And when everyone was really quiet
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:37,792	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	They tear these faint drumming noise coming from the from the Timbers of the hives
EDL	00:01:39,328	00:01:44,960	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	I can try and do an impression of the noise I hear you very well

EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:08,256	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	But
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:11,584	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Wenzhou actually it's the mating call of a tiny little beetle
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:16,960	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	The death-watch beetle
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:18,752	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Before it gets its name
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:21,824	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	So they became a kind of a fan of these
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:26,176	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Yeah it's a widespread species and he's got a house that's
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:27,456	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	It is
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:28,736	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Pretty decrepit is

EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:33,856	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Whatever but is it hiring to a whole host of
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:34,880	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	These little people
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:39,232	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	And in the quiet he can hear the
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:44,864	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	So a while ago he found himself wondering what's this noise really loud
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:48,704	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	At which you might not think would be a great mystery
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:52,544	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	But what he discovered is It's All About Love
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:54,592	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Or at least
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:55,360	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Sex
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:58,176	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	So today

EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:17,888	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	At the beginning of the life cycle
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:21,216	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Yeah so so the female betta lays an egg
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:23,776	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	At peace of death
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:25,312	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Basic he would watch the
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:27,104	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	And the moms we just
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:28,640	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Drop their babies randomly
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:29,152	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Here
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:30,688	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	There
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:32,736	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Usually into a hole in log
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:35,552	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Going to a would be a little tiny boy
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:36,320	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Grub
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,856	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	So you might have to pitch black
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:41,696	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Do you have any time on its own
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:43,488	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	I need stop chewing

EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:48,352	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Very very slightly
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:51,680	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	And eventually
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:58,336	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	10 or 15 years later years it going to shoot for 10 to 15 years
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:00,384	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Yeah it for a decade or more
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:06,016	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Whole thing and eventually it reaches the Magnificent size of about a quarter of an inch
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:08,064	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Which point is
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:12,160	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Heights at turns into a little little chrysalis
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:14,464	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	And a few months later
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:15,744	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Seattle beetle
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:18,559	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Tattoo sizes
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:22,911	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Until finally it crawls out of the log and onto the
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:28,543	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Is that the first time they see light
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:30,847	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Yeah yeah

EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:27,167	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	The male betta Lee kind of braces himself and then he wipes his head 5c

EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:37,663	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	So that's what makes the drumming noise
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:39,711	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Buccaneers head against the wood
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:40,735	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	So
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:44,575	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	He comes out of his
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,415	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Just one day
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:52,767	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Disease little drumming
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:53,279	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Noise
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:55,839	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Now if a human happens
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:56,863	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	To hear him
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:59,423	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	People these days they tend to spray that
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:00,191	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Houses with inside
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:02,495	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	I didn't like the end of The Beatles
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:05,823	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	But
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:08,383	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Lettuce you
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:10,687	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Assume that he doesn't okay
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:14,271	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	He just keeps wandering by banging his head
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:15,295	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Any poses for sex
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:17,343	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	I'm listening to see if anyone reply

EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:25,279	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Unfortunately
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:26,047	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	According to David
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:27,839	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Deathwatch beetles quite rare these days
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:30,911	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Except there is a distinct chance will never find a female
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:34,495	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	This just gets more and more depressing
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:42,943	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Can you tell the same story from the from the female's perspective
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:43,711	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	She just sort of his
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:44,991	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Is she just
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:46,527	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Waits in silence
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:48,319	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	For three weeks and if no one comes she just
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:52,671	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	She just purchased
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:56,255	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	She doesn't she wanted to ride a little bit I spies in the in the hope that she might
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:58,815	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	I might help it that's what that's
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:06:59,839	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	That is all she does
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:02,399	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Tedious life I'm afraid
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:04,191	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	But let's imagine
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:05,471	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Begin for the sake of argument
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:08,799	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	That's after the 15 years of chewing and no fumigation
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:10,335	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	At all
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:11,871	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Really
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:13,407	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	He gets a reply

EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:25,663	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	The ugliest way to try and
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:26,175	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Fine.
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:28,479	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	Restaurant officially changed
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:29,247	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	The weight of the male

EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:57,151	| radiolab_podcast16hardknocklife |	To make them a little bit heavier
