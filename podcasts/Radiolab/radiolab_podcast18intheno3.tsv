EDL	00:01:03,488	00:01:06,304	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Cuz we ended up doing
EDL	00:01:06,304	00:01:07,072	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Zirmed
EDL	00:01:07,072	00:01:08,352	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Sway through the process of
EDL	00:01:08,352	00:01:12,192	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Was gathering together a whole bunch of different groups of men and women college-age men and women
EDL	00:01:12,704	00:01:13,472	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Three different cities
EDL	00:01:13,984	00:01:16,032	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I just asking him general questions about
EDL	00:01:16,032	00:01:16,800	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	How they're thinking about
EDL	00:01:17,312	00:01:18,848	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Are you excited
EDL	00:01:18,848	00:01:25,248	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I ended up interviewing the man song I'll turn this part over to Becca wrestler and she boldly
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:27,808	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	How are you were with women
EDL	00:01:27,808	00:01:33,952	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Yes so the average group that we talked to was maybe a dozen women we try to make it as diverse as possible
EDL	00:01:34,976	00:01:35,488	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	You got coming
EDL	00:01:36,000	00:01:36,768	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Why did it have
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:43,424	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	The first thing that really struck us I think she would tell me if you agree is there was sort of a disconnect
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:48,288	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	On the one hand it seems like affirmative consent for almost everyone we talked to seem
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:49,824	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Like second nature
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:55,200	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	So I sent for high schoolers I'm going to even teaching classes on it
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:58,016	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Yeah okay so you know like ch
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:02:02,368	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	So like a clear and concise yes at every step of sexual activity
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:04,672	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I think that's like amazing that works
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:07,744	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Teaching kids. Now and like I do feel like it's my Generations
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:09,024	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Problem 2
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:10,304	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Change it
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:11,840	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	And change the narrative about it
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:16,448	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	So a lot of them were really committed to actually changing the way consent
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:21,568	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	What's the way that these sexual experiences go and how their navigate it but then when we would
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:23,360	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	You know focusing on
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:26,432	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	What we were actually experiencing in their lives
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:28,736	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	What we saw was much different
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:32,064	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	My friend and I ended up in a bar like the bartender I was really
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:33,856	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Lacuna really flirting and he like
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:38,464	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I don't want to give any identifying information but we are just Levi bang and I like
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:44,608	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	What's up with him and then like immediately after I started hooking up with him I was like oh this is not what I want but like at that point of kind of like
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:49,472	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Signal would be like much more of an uncomfortable situation and just like going through with this and like
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:55,360	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Understanding I've already regretted kind of don't know why I didn't leave but eventually I was just fine
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:58,944	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Like whatever they please we come on please
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:02,528	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	But you know you're turned on a little bit like and I'll be like fine whatever like looks
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:06,368	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Pilot asked me if I wanted sex when I said no
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:12,000	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I'm actually like I just like kind of wanted to be like over with like the entire interaction and I was just uncomfortable
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:13,792	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	And I was like okay like let's have sex
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:16,608	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Just because I thought that like that was the easier way to like
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:19,680	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Make him happy make like get done with it and then like
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:20,960	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	It'd be over
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:22,496	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	We just heard a lot of stories
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:25,056	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	People having sex that they didn't want to have you know
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:28,384	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Where maybe affirmative consent was in effect they did say yes
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:34,528	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	But it was either because the guy wear them down or they were way too concerned with how he was feeling
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:36,832	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Like it would make him feel really really bad
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:37,856	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I know that like
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:41,440	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	If you would have known how I felt that way he would have gone through with it
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:47,840	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	And like I just didn't want to like hurt his feelings and be like and make him feel like he like took advantage of me or whatever when I knew
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:53,984	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	That there would be no possible way that he would know that I was feeling that way some women told us that they say yes sometimes when they don't want to
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:55,008	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Because
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:58,080	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	They're scared heart of the sphere in
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:02,944	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Sing hard no is the. Hard no can then be violated and that's like
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:05,504	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	That's like a terrifying thought like
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:08,064	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	To say like a hard no
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:13,440	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	But that's more traumatizing to me like in my head almost been having like a soft no just sort of like
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:15,488	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Sweat past
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:17,791	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Having fear of future trauma
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:20,863	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	It's like having a fear of future trauma
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:25,471	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	You got to mean if your aim is to stay in control
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:28,543	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	And you feel like you might be out of control
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:34,431	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Then the best way to still be in control is to convince yourself that you are cool with what's going on
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:36,479	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I walked away
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:37,503	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Feeling like
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:40,319	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Many of the young women felt
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:42,623	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Frustrated both with
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:45,183	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Their worlds but also with themselves
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:46,975	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Yeah afterwards I would feel like
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:49,791	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Very disappointed in myself
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:50,815	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Cuz I feel like
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:53,119	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	How to compromise my own needs for other p
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:56,447	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	People that they would walk away from the situation and they would have
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:57,471	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Regretted
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:05:00,543	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Wednesday maybe didn't actually want to do it but didn't
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:02,847	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Pick up for themselves and then I
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:07,455	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	And then you fight like a battle with yourself cuz it's like wait a minute like I'm like strong like I know I can like
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:09,759	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Just stopped are like white but it's
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:11,039	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	So hard I could like
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:12,575	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	In that moment to find like
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:14,879	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I don't know like the
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:20,511	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	The words just to say it you know cuz then it is sometimes you just like yeah it is just easier just to be like let it
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:21,279	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Like
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:24,351	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Just like let him finish that's it like it was clear for
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:27,679	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Most of these women that in the moment of these encounters
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:31,519	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	There was some conversation that needed to happen that was not happening
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:36,383	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	But then it there actually was this one young woman that we spoke to some people
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:40,223	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I think a lot of people talk about consent as if it's like awkward and weird and like
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:43,551	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	She just said consent has really become
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:44,831	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Popularizing is really
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:51,743	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Well advocated for by the BDSM community
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:58,143	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Play something abbreviation abbreviations bondage discipline or domination sadism and masochism
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:06:04,543	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Because you constantly have to make sure that somebody is okay and be like this is broke
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:10,943	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Some Community has this figured out and then she started talking about her experience
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:12,991	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Does that mean that abuse and community health
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:14,015	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Figured that out
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:17,087	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Hello
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:19,391	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:21,183	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	It's like that B-52 bomber Buzz
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:25,791	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Hope that sounds better
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:29,631	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Okay High did it we did it
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:36,543	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Did you feel like I always feel like after these technical snafus there's like a bonding that happens to it actually bought it two guys
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:42,175	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Well I thought it was true thing that people suffering together feel bonded
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:43,199	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	One another
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:43,967	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Well there you go
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:47,039	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Who are you by the way
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:47,551	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	What are you doing
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:51,135	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	My name is Julie Finnell I am an associate
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:56,767	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Professor of Sociology at gallaudet University and I've been studying the BDSM community
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:58,303	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Since about
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:04,191	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	2012 we called Julie because she is one of the things stick to say leading academics
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:06,751	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	When it comes to a BDSM community
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:09,055	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	And all the subcultures she has written
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:11,103	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Papers she has done surveys
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:14,431	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	And she has done from the inside
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:17,759	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Like me pretty much feel like we were sort of Born This Way
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:23,135	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	And it's really common to talk to a lot of kinky people who will tell you the same thing like
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:26,719	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I was five and fantasizing about tying up people genitalia
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:32,607	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Antioch
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:34,655	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	One of the things we heard from Julie
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:35,935	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	And we subsequently her this
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:37,983	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Also from a lot of academics we talked to after
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:40,799	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Is it the whole consent conversation
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:41,823	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	In many ways
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:46,687	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Grew out of BDSM a lot of people trace like the history of BDSM in the United States
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:49,759	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	To the Leatherman community
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:53,599	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	This is World War 2 era by the way

EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:15,103	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	No one had ever really formally distinguish between

EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:07,583	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	So getting back to Julie we asked her okay if it is true as that one woman said that the BDSM community
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:10,143	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	If it is true that they have figured something out
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:12,703	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I had to do a better it will what is it
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:14,239	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Panda
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:15,775	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Show us a couple things first
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:21,151	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Drinking to my way of thinking of incredibly risky very frowned upon in the BDSM world
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:27,551	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	That's what we call Edge player just like kind of the things that people do or you're like
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:33,951	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Like a bad idea negotiating sex when both people are really really drunk with somebody that you never met before
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:35,231	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I just really really risky
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:39,583	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	And speaking of that negotiation another thing that was an interesting contrast
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:40,607	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Between the
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:42,911	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Quote vanilla World in BDSM is that
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:44,703	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	When two people are negotiating
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:45,983	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Trying to figure out if they're going to get down
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:48,031	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	BDSM
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:54,943	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	That conversation is formalized and it's often public generally speaking most of what's happening is is out in the open
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:55,967	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Did you have people called
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:58,527	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Consent monitor is it sometimes roam around these parties
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:10:04,927	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Uncommon to be standing there negotiating with someone where your friend or their friends right next to them
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:06,207	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Laundering mixing safe
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:10,047	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I'll ask her to zoom in on a specific
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:10,815	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Content cop
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:11,839	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	How does it usually go
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:15,679	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	People with different experiences levels are better and worse
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:18,751	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Pacifically like let's say I was going to play with you

EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:22,335	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	You're telling me you've never done anything like this
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:23,871	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Write 0
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:27,199	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Z-Ro so I like the knife top
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:28,991	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Which is a way of
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:33,343	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Describing the fact that I like to do things with knives onto people
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:38,719	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Actual cutting a people or or Alexa threatening event or no
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:40,767	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Dragon knives along people
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:42,559	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Is threatening with somebody like
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:45,887	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Playing with my Pinterest the thing I do to make it more interesting as I liked
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:46,911	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Pick up people's clothes off
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:49,215	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Okay
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:49,727	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	How to cut people
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:52,799	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Are they are they like serrated
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:57,151	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	And it can be some of them have rough edges and some of them
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:59,199	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Don't and that's actually one of the questions that I would ask you
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:02,271	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I would ask you if you
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:06,879	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	You maybe would be more interested in front of a poking type sensation or more of a
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:11,231	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Scraping tight sensation based on just hearing that
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:16,095	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I would select my knives accordingly that point cuz I separate knives for the president
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:18,911	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	And then I would
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:22,495	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	If I was going to cut your clothes off for example
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:25,055	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I would ask you I would I would let you know
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:25,567	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	That there's
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:29,663	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I'm pretty good at what I do but there's no way that I can guarantee you that
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:35,295	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I won't cut something that you don't want me to so if possible it'd be great if you could take off
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:39,903	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	The thing that you wouldn't want me to cut right like a necklace or your socks or whatever
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:46,303	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Okay and I also like when people going into my garden pretty experience of this but I definitely have accidentally cut people before so
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,327	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	So
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:50,143	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	You know I just need to let you know that
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:52,447	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	This is not a 100% guarantee of our
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:52,959	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Is that
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:56,543	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Something that you absolutely cannot tolerate then
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:59,871	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Then we probably can't go forward with this or if you say
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:06,271	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Oh yeah I'm fine with it as long as it isn't on my arm cuz I don't want to show up for work that's a great like we'll all just rest
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:07,807	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Stretch what I do to not your arms

EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:11,871	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	If this stays turtle in I've went a little hard I can come in and stay and again you're talking to me
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:12,383	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Be sexy
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:14,175	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	That's too much for you baby
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:17,503	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Zack needs to go lighter
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:19,295	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Keep it sexy you don't have to say
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:23,391	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Hey was that too hard you can tell they keep it in very sexy and see how it goes
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:24,927	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Staying engaged
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:26,207	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Is very important
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:30,047	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	You're in a space that's loud you can't f****** hear anything cuz I can't hear if she's moaning
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:34,399	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I want to be able to get my ears in clothes say how they do
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:35,679	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Then I tried to sort of cadence
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:37,983	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Play around a little bit more
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:44,383	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	If I'm there I'm combining between using impact play and since play will go a little more in-depth once you guys are playing
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:45,151	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	A little bit
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:46,175	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Elder on the room
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:52,319	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Domino's spent the next hour sort of moving around the room
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:55,135	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Helping people if they paired off with their whips their floggers
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:57,183	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Learn how to better read each other
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:16:00,511	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	And for a moment it felt like
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:01,023	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Oh
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:02,303	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	We should all be doing
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:04,095	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Maybe not
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:06,399	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Using whips and having sex in
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:07,167	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Public
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:11,007	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Nothing but finding ways to help each other be explicit
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:12,543	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Communicative and
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:14,335	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Have a code
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:16,895	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	For what words mean
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:22,527	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	When we talk to college-age Men Women a lot of them were like we need a script we need something written down
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:26,367	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Because one of the things that's been found in surveys
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:33,279	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Is it there's very little agreed-upon language for example of phrase like slow down when surveyed
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:36,095	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Many college-aged women will tell you that means stop
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:37,631	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Many men will say
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:38,911	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Don't we just beats ghosts
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:39,423	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Slower
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:41,727	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Well in the BDSM world
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:46,847	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	They seem to have started some of the South
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:50,175	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	House rules say yellow men's
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:53,247	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Check-in or pause
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:55,295	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Red beans
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:56,063	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Stop
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:58,879	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	And if somebody says safe word that means that
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:02,975	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	You're calling for help from one of the people that surround
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:06,559	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	It all seems so clear and sensible
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:12,447	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	And dare I say uncomplicated but Julie was like
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:16,287	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Let me come back Julie rains
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:17,567	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	On

EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:03,647	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Did you know did something
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:05,695	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	It just means you lean back and say
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:06,975	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Wow
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:07,743	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	How do they do that
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:13,119	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:15,935	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:20,031	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:21,823	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Or maybe the kitchen mat
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:24,639	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Music in the margin of their geometry
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:27,199	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	We're interested in the
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:28,479	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Specific moments where
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:31,039	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Kid does something super smart
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,831	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	It doesn't have anything to do with the test

EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:05,087	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Julie was about to tell us Julie canal
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:06,367	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	That
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:11,999	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Even in the BDSM world it's very clear rules and safe words like red and yellow
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:19,423	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Things go wrong a real problem with that yellow red situation is that in public people almost never end up using
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:20,447	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Red Liquors
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:24,287	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	What are the huge problems with the DSM subculture basically has is that
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:26,079	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	There's Mastiff
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:30,943	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Massive social repercussions to calling read in a public place
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:31,967	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Musically
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:34,271	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Can we talk about this more
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:37,599	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Started to sound a lot like what we
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:39,135	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Heard from the college-aged women
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:41,183	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Cat saying no
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:44,511	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Even when it's much worse by all of these rules and norms
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:46,303	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	He still be really hard
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:47,583	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	There's a cost
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:50,655	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Are the worst situations that I ever personally found myself
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:53,983	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Was Iowa
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:55,263	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Girls tied up and suspended
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:56,543	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	And
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:59,359	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	So all of my feet are off the ground and I'm having a great time
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:03,711	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I had negotiated ahead of time that there was to be
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:08,319	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Nothing genital happen is very clear about that I was like nope
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:09,599	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	There's not there's not a thing
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:12,671	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Then she says the person who she was playing with the tire up
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:14,463	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Decided to try some genitals
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:14,975	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Stuff and
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:18,303	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I was really caught in that moment
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:19,583	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Turn a very public place
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:22,143	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I could yell red
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:23,167	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	But in that place
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:25,983	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Yelling red means the whole scene has
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:30,847	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Stop and I didn't want to seem to stop by like being tied up and I'm also cognizant of the fact that
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:32,639	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	This guy is my friend I really like him
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:34,175	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Aaron's
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:37,247	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I don't want him to get in a ton of trouble
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:40,319	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	What if I yell red really loudly in this public place
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:43,647	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Pretty decent chance he's going to get banned from the event
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:45,439	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	It's pretty decent chance
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:46,463	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	You can get banned from
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:47,231	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	A lot of events
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:50,559	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Look at them in the face
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:51,071	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	He stopped
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:54,911	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Cuz I was going to say you're tied up. That's very
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:21:00,031	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	The whole point is you're in a compromised situation
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:06,175	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Even though she navigated that one fine in the end she says General Lee
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:08,223	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Speaking the BDSM Community is
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:11,295	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Negotiation not
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:12,319	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	A Utopia
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:15,135	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	In fact what she experienced in that moment
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:16,672	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Was for a long time
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:17,696	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Not uncommon
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:24,608	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	So I should explain that the scene actually got its own me-too movement about three months before the me-too movement hit like I didn't have that #b
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:25,888	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Exactly the same thing happened where
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:28,448	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Bunch of high status people got out of
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:30,240	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	The consent violators on the scene
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:31,776	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	These are bunch of dudes or
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:33,056	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Yeah they're all men
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:39,968	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Definitely what I can sit violations that happened with women but people don't pay attention Sarah and I have a whole other rant about that but
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:41,760	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	A lot of attention on them where men and
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:43,552	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Pretty much everyone that they had hurt with women
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:46,112	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	And that's part of the reason that Juliet is
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:48,672	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Any other little suspicious
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:50,464	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Of all of the rules that we were just
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:52,256	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Enamored of
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:54,560	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Or I should say she's a little suspicious
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:56,096	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Placing too much faith in those
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:21:57,376	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	It's not
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:22:01,472	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	About foolproof rightly so I may I definitely know people who
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:06,592	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	They don't want to tell you anymore that they're not having fun
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:10,944	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	So there's a real sense of like I don't want to disappoint this other person
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:18,112	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	It's the one of the things that I also will ask any types of negotiating my version of negotiation is like
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:20,672	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	You feel reasonably certain that
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:22,720	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Will be able to tell me
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:24,512	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	If you don't like what happened
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:28,608	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	The more I
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:29,376	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Thought about
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:31,424	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	That question
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:36,288	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I got to read an interview tomorrow I have certain noodling on that at the creek me like what that's
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:38,080	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	A key question
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:40,384	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Can you say no when you need to
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:42,176	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	To some of us just a people pleaser
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:43,200	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I am one of those people
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:44,992	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Hertz
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:45,504	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Tuseno

EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:55,488	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	So she asks which kind of person are you right now it is situational who are you at this moment if they say yeah right now I'm not
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:23:02,144	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Good with a nose and she goes One Direction if they say no I can tell you that I'm like alright can we both agree that we are
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:02,656	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Adults
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:06,496	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	That we don't have to get into all the stuff about what we don't want to have her
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:09,312	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	And that we will take responsibility for
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:14,176	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Actually communicating how we're feeling in the situation and if we fail to communicate that
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:16,992	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	That we will also take responsibility for that
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:23,648	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	So are you okay with kind of whatever and you're going to tell me if you're not in the other person goes yeah
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:25,440	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	That's how I want that
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:30,560	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Stop playing our conversation changes from what am I not allowed to do to what do you find hot
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:33,632	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	What is things that we kept running into
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:34,912	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Again and again
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:36,448	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Was
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:37,984	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	This sentiment
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:41,568	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	That was maybe best captured by a guy that Becca and she missed
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:45,408	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Michael lissack I'm the director of empowering victims
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:48,480	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	And I'm one of the people who came up with the concept for the week
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:49,248	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Concentra
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:50,016	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	That app
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:53,088	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Was actually the one that a guy last episode
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:55,904	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Search jokingly referred to hello would you
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:56,928	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	B

EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:08,192	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	There's no really good the problem is that we've got a meme in the meme is already well established
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:11,008	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Unfortunately
EDL	00:24:11,008	00:24:11,776	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	That means
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:14,848	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Frames the entire question the wrong way
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:19,712	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Sent means but you giving someone permission to do something to you
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:21,248	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	We don't

EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:18,080	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Extract sex for women that don't want to be there
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:22,176	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Did you call at 9
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:41,888	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	I was a second day I went home with him and I wasn't really sure if I wanted to sleep with him and I was kind of going through the motions
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:45,984	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	And at one point he pulled away guess you could tell that I was like
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:48,288	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Not entirely there and he's like you want to have sex
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:53,408	| radiolab_podcast18intheno3 |	Say yes or no and he just stopped
