EDL	00:01:39,328	00:01:42,400	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Of all the invisible things that
EDL	00:01:42,400	00:01:44,704	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Guide our behavior that we generally don't see now
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:49,056	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	They've been sharing some stories that they've been working on as they're going
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:50,336	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	A lot of it is
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:52,640	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Amazing

EDL	00:01:57,504	00:02:00,064	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	This one they're going to hear
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:04,160	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Comes from an hour that they're producing on the topic of
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:05,440	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Categories
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:08,256	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Like the different boxes that we put
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:12,608	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Things in our world into and the first piece in the show looks at one of the most
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:14,656	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Basic categories that there is
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:17,216	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	The first question that any
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:20,544	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	But he asks a parent who has a new baby is it a boy
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:21,824	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Or girl
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:27,968	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I have to say in my career I have done a number of stories about a blurring between
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:33,856	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Boy and girl but the story I'm about to tell you is that a kind of flooring that I have never heard of
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:34,368	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	4
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:44,864	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	This is a person I met who calls herself Paige abendroth abendroth means the color of
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:48,448	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	The sky when it's that deep red right before the sunset
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:52,800	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Paige had bright blue eyes long black hair in a ponytail
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:53,824	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Good make yourself
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:58,688	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	We were in San Diego by the way setting ourselves up to talk I'm going to make you scoot
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:00,480	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Skit skit skit skit
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:01,504	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Caduceus good
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:04,064	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	So after we sat down I asked page
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:06,112	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Show me some pictures of herself
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:07,648	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	From about a decade before
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:08,416	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	So there aren't many
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:10,976	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	In the pictures
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:11,744	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Was a man
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:14,816	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	A man in a naval uniform
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:16,864	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	He was very buff
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:19,168	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Strapping military
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:22,496	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	High and tight haircut
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:24,288	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And there they were
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,568	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Those bright blue eyes
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:29,664	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	You look very you look pretty conservative here to yes I do
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:35,296	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Page
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:37,600	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	But the first three decades of her life as a man
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:40,160	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	But let me be clear from the top
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:45,024	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Paige's story is not a transgender story that you typically hear
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:46,816	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Typically
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:51,168	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	People who are transgender feel like they are one gender trapped in the body
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:52,192	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Of the other gender
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:57,568	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Their internal gender identity is misaligned with their biological sex
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,360	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	But
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:00,384	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	It's static
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:01,408	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	It stays the same
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:04,224	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	But when I was talking to Paige
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:05,504	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	That
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:06,528	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Didn't capture
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:08,064	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Her experience
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:08,576	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	At all
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:10,624	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Because when I met her
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:13,184	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Paige was flipping
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:16,256	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Flipping between the category mail
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:18,559	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And the category female
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:21,119	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	My foot back and forth multiple times a day
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:23,423	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Snab spend
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:24,191	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	20
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:24,703	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Percent
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:26,239	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Of my time
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:33,151	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	In game mode and the rest of it and female mode one morning page would wake up feeling strongly that the gender at
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:35,199	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Core of her being with female
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:38,015	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	But then suddenly it's just kind of like
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:39,551	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	There was a change
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:41,343	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And Paige
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:42,367	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Was in die mode
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:43,903	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	When that happened
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:46,975	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	All kinds of things about page change
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:49,023	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Her posture changed
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:51,839	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	In my weight kind of moves up to my shoulders
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:56,703	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Like my center of gravity is kind of up here more significantly she told me
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:59,519	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	There was a real psychological ship
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:03,359	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	The way I see the world in the way I interpret the world is different
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:04,639	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	When Paige was in mail mode
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:11,295	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Page was less interested in people and talking to them and making eye contact with them
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:14,879	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	One more introverted him a lot more
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:17,183	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I'm quieter button female mode
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:19,231	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	She was much more
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:19,743	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Expensive
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:24,095	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And sights sounds smells likes dislikes
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:26,399	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	They were all different when I'm female
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:28,447	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	All might
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:30,751	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Emotions are like this really Vivid
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:32,543	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Eye colors
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:33,823	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Basically
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:36,895	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Page with constantly and very abruptly
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:37,919	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Bounce
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:42,527	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Between two starkly different ways of being in in filtering the world
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:45,087	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Paige wasn't able to dictate
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:49,183	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	When or where this happened I really have no control over it
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:52,511	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	She be sitting in her office talking to her boss and
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:53,279	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Damn
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:55,071	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	She'd be walking down the street
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:56,095	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Damn
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:59,167	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Now when this happened
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:04,287	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	It wasn't like page was an entirely different person I'm always the same person
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:06,335	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I experience the world differently
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:10,943	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	But I'm still me I still in the control of myself I still have my same
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:12,479	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Wants and desires
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:15,551	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	There was just as profound
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:16,063	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Difference
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:17,855	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Beneath everything
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:19,903	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	It's just a sense of knowing like
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:23,231	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	The way that you know you're a female right now without having to be told
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:29,375	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	It's the same way that I know that I'm a female and when I'm a guy it's the same way I know I'm a guy it's just
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:31,679	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	This instinctual knowing
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:32,191	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	What I am
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:41,663	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	By the way right now are you male or female
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:43,967	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And how long have you been in girl mode right now
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:45,759	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	About an hour
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:46,271	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I'd say
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:49,087	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	So
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:51,647	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Maybe you're thinking that page
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:53,695	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Seems nuts
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:54,719	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Peter self
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:57,535	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Has had that thought I thought that I was going crazy
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:07:00,095	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Yeah I mean some people first
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:01,119	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Sure about this
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:07,263	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	You don't think me wonder if it's dissociative identity disorder which is formerly known as multiple personality disorder
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:10,335	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Or a form of psychosis
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:11,615	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	This is Laura case
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:16,479	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	A researcher who has worked in the lab of a very famous neurologist a minion
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:22,879	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Vs ramachandran UCSD and a couple years ago they got an email from a woman describing exact
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:25,695	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Actually the same kind of experience that page describes
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:28,511	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Someone who experiences
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:29,535	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	The switching back
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:32,863	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Come forth and while on the one hand they were dubious
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:37,215	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Get a lot of interesting emails and our lab emails from people claiming all kinds of
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:41,311	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Wild sounding experiences on the other hand
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:45,151	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	They study the brain and they have seen brains
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:48,223	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Do all kinds of things they've seen brands
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:50,783	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	That suddenly stopped recognizing faces
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:53,599	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Brands that think their owner has a mysterious limb
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,647	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	So they were curious
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:08:01,535	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Here's a person who goes back and forth in terms of what their brain seems to be telling them about whether male or female
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:05,631	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	How fascinating would that be to look and see what could be changing in the brain
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:08,191	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Or the environment to
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:10,239	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Be causing that shift and identity
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:11,775	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	So they decided to look into it
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:15,103	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	The past couple years case has found
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:17,151	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Dozens of people with experience
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:20,991	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And cheese has started testing them in different ways
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:23,039	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Including getting them psychological screening
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:27,135	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And what she found was that as a group
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:30,463	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	These people are not mentally unstable
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:36,863	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	They simply don't have dissociative disorder none of them had any form of psychosis or anything like that they
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:39,167	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Table that bipolar schizophrenia
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:41,471	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And saw some other interesting things
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:44,031	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	They were actually a little bit more ambidextrous
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:45,567	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	In the general population
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:51,967	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Basically they found enough to suggest that there might be something neurological going on so they
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:58,367	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	They published a very very small study of columnar SRT-4 part in a journal called medical hypotheses
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:02,719	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And then started on another study but we're not not ready to
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:04,255	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Talk about the data from that study
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:07,327	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I did though get one
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:08,095	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Tidbit
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:09,631	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	About this from case
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:13,215	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And again this is very very very very preliminary
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:20,127	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	But she found that the same person will perform differently on certain tasks depending on whether they are
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:21,663	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Are in male or female mode
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:22,687	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	For example
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:25,503	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	She gave the same person these mental puzzles
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:27,039	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	The test
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:29,343	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Spatial and language abilities
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:33,951	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And Lulu you know how men are really good at supposedly
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:35,999	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Men are really good at kind of
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:38,303	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Spatial directions
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:40,351	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	They're like spatial manipulation
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:41,631	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	What does that mean
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:48,031	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I don't know how to explain it exactly but like you're a woman so you wouldn't understand so I wouldn't understand it
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:48,543	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Great Wall right
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:54,175	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Like take a geometric shape rotated in your mind
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:55,199	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Stuff like that okay
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:58,783	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	They found when they gave these tests to these people
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:00,831	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	When they were in their difference
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:03,647	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	States that have different abilities so wow
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:09,791	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	So like when they were men they performed more as men and when they were women they performed more as women
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:12,607	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Yeah we did see some
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:18,751	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Differences between gender states that were intriguing but not conclusive
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:19,775	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Here's the point
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:21,823	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	There's some evidence
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:24,639	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	That the shift these people say that they are
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:25,407	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Experiencing
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:27,199	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Could
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:27,711	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	B-real
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:30,271	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Which brings us back
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:31,551	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	2 page
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:38,207	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And I wake up in the morning like a my male and a female I wanted to talk to her about what it was like
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:39,999	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	To move in this way
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:41,535	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Between categories
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:44,863	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	So let's just start with
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:46,399	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Like your childhood
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:49,215	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Now page didn't start off
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:49,727	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Swag
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:52,543	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	She started off as a he
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,823	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Who really
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:57,663	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Didn't even have that experience that you sometimes hear about
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:00,479	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Where people describe feeling from a very early age like
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:06,367	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	They're trapped in the wrong body
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:08,415	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	He was a boy obsessed with the things
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:11,487	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	That most boys are obsessed with I always thought about women
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:13,279	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	You never thought you were yet
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:17,631	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Paige said there were these strange momentary flashes
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:18,911	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	That were disturbing
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:20,703	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I remember looking at
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:21,471	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Girls
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:27,359	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Not just being attracted to them but thinking that I was supposed to be
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:28,127	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Them
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:33,247	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And wishing that I could kind of go over to the girl group and be accepted because that's the way I felt I should be
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:36,575	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	But these thoughts are really inconsistent it's not
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:38,367	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I didn't always feel that way
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:42,719	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Grows up graduates from high school
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:49,119	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Goes to college and then really starts to struggle the Flash's RC
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:55,007	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Still there college is hard page drops out and begins to feel really really
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:59,615	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And then in a somewhat odd place
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:01,407	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Paige finds relief
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:06,271	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	In the Navy by love the discipline of it the structure of it
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:08,319	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Football for some reason
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,343	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Those flashes
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:11,135	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Go way down
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:12,415	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Why
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:18,047	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I don't know I saw myself as being more of a guy than I ever did before
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,839	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	But really
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:22,911	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	It was while stationed at a naval base in Japan
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:24,703	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	The page found relief
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:31,103	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	In a way that will be familiar to many of you I walked around the corner and I saw her and she's kind of bouncing around and she
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:32,383	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	She's very energetic and
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:34,431	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	It was love at first sight
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:37,247	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Immediately I knew that there is something like special about her
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:40,575	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And even though Cajun never been a very aggressive person
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:45,183	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Page completely went after this girl I was smitten
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:47,743	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I was immediately smitten
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:49,279	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And it worked
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:52,351	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	We're just like this we're so in tune with one another
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:56,447	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I mean we knew each other so good we can communicate like with a series of clicks
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:58,495	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Like what do you mean
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:01,823	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Unlike the other first of an answer back and we know what we are like
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:09,503	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Getting at and sometimes with mean like someone like how are you or it could just be acknowledging that
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:11,295	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	You know you're there
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:19,743	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	So began the best chapter in Pages life
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:24,607	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	They get married
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:25,375	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Skinless cat
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:26,143	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Fornia
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:29,983	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Got a home car at a steady job I had everything
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:32,031	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Did I ever wanted
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:34,591	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	What does that mean
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:36,127	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	It depends on the context
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:51,743	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And then page turns 30
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:53,023	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And all of a sudden
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:56,607	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Start feeling really really tired
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:59,935	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I'd means coming up the steps I would run out of breath
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:00,959	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	So page
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:01,983	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Goes to see the doctor
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:07,871	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And eventually what they finally figured out was that my body thought it'd be really fun joke on me
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:09,919	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	To us stop producing testosterone
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:12,735	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Basically at 30 years old
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:16,575	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I had a testosterone level of an 80 plus year old man
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:19,647	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	To the doctors put page on testosterone replacement therapy
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:21,695	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And very quickly
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:25,279	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	The exhaustion went away I felt like I had before
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:26,303	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	But
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:27,839	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	The flashes
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:29,119	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	They're back
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:30,911	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	With a vengeance
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:34,495	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I would have those feelings again where I thought I was supposed to be female except
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:39,359	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	It wasn't there isn't anything subtle about it it was very strong
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:43,199	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Feeling that something had gone terribly wrong
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:46,783	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And that
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:50,111	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I was not supposed to be male
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:56,511	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	In these moments page would look down at her body this hard
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:58,047	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Torso covered in hair
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:15:04,447	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And feel better discussed imagine you woke up in your body was
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:10,847	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Cockroach it was really unsettling did you so did you start talking to
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:12,383	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Your wife about it
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:14,943	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	No I was terrified
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:16,479	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I thought I was going crazy
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:19,807	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I didn't want her to think less of me
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:27,743	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And that is something that I kept inside
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:32,607	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Page started telling me that occasionally during this.
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:39,263	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	He's this feeling of disgust that came over her when she flipped into female mode but had a male body
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:43,103	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	She would secretly put on women's clothing
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:47,455	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	She felt the need to cover this body that felt so wrong
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:49,503	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	With clothes from the right side
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:52,063	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	It's just I was just trying to do anything I could to
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:54,111	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	To make myself feel more female
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:55,647	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	So
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:57,439	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I started asking questions about the
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:16:00,511	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Remember the first time you decided to do that
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:02,559	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	But suddenly
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:05,887	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	The whole tone of the conversation changed
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:06,655	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I want to talk about it
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:10,751	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	The wind was so after that one
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:20,735	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Do you need to take a break
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,039	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Uncle
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:27,391	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Yes you're cool you want to do
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:29,951	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Paige got up
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:31,487	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And disappeared around the corner
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:34,303	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I could hear the faucet running in the bathroom
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:40,191	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And when she came back she wanted me to know something if it matters I flipped back into game mode
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:43,519	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Okay so that is that why you don't want to talk
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:45,055	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	It's just kind of like
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:48,639	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	It's different now
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:52,479	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Live in Tagalog I mode
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:56,063	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Was it when your eyes closed that you flip into car mode
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:57,087	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I don't know
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:02,975	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	So are you in a bad mood right this second
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:05,791	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	So is it hard to answer questions
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:08,863	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Okay
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:10,655	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I'll be okay I just need like
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:15,519	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	We sat awkwardly for a while neither of us
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:16,543	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Quite sure what to do
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:20,127	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	It did feel like there was a difference in
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:22,431	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Even in the way that she talk
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:24,991	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	How to how are you doing I'm good
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,271	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Are you male or female

EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:35,039	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Page explained that the next chapter of her life involved finding a name for what was going on with her
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:36,575	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Bigender
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:39,647	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	People who consider themselves both female and male
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:41,183	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	At the same time
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:43,743	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	She found it in the by gender website
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:46,047	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And though only a small portion of
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:47,327	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	People on the website
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:48,095	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Describe
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:49,119	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Flipping like page
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:50,911	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	It felt like
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:53,215	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	This could be an explanation
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:54,495	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	The way I felt was
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:20:00,895	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Other people felt that way and it was it was real it wasn't you know just some weird psychological constructs
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:03,199	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	But with this validation
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:04,991	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Came a horrible realization
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:06,527	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Page
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:08,063	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Had to tell her what
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:13,439	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I told her that we needed to talk and so sat down and separate chairs
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:15,743	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I think I was on the couch and she was on a
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:17,279	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Recliner
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:18,559	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Paige was terrified
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:20,607	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	She was certain that our marriage would be over
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:22,911	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And she was very visibly upset
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:25,471	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Sorry
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:28,287	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I was just
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:32,895	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Begging her to
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:34,431	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Not believing
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:36,991	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Accept me for who I was
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:43,135	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I couldn't live for her for so long
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:47,999	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I didn't know I could love
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:55,423	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	But two pages surprise
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:57,471	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Her wife said it's okay
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:21:00,287	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	She told me that everything is going to be okay
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:01,567	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And that
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:03,359	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	You know we're going to make this work and
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:10,015	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	She wasn't going to give up on me
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:18,208	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Paige couldn't believe how lucky she was
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:19,232	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Together
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:22,560	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	They walk into the space between categories
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:27,168	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Some mornings pagewood wake up male
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:29,472	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	The husband her wife and married
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:32,288	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	That man would put on male clothes
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:33,312	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Go to work
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:35,360	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Other mornings
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:37,664	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Pagewood wake up female
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:40,224	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	A woman trapped in this strange body
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:42,528	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And they were doing it
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:45,344	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Helping each other through life in this odd space
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:49,440	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	But one problem
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:56,352	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	As much as the two of them could get used to the idea of flipping
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:58,144	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Page
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:22:01,472	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Couldn't get used to the physical experience of it
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:06,080	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I came out of the shower one day and I'd gone in and game-mode I came out and female moan
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:10,432	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	She was standing there beginning to dry off and I saw myself in the mirror
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:14,272	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And I was so disgusted that I threw up
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:16,320	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	These kinds of feelings
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:17,856	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Happened all the time
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:21,952	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Had come across a potential cure for this
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:27,328	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I sort of Homespun remedy that some of the bigender folks handwritten about online
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:29,120	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Involves hormones
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:31,936	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Page would go on estrogen
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:34,496	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	To make her body more androgynous
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:36,288	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Bring my body to
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:38,848	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Androgynous point
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:40,640	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Or I could resent
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:44,992	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Both as either male or female it would reduce the shock
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:48,320	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Of being thrown between category so violently
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:51,392	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	If her body was in a permanent state of in between
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:53,184	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	So page
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:54,976	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Decided to try it
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:57,280	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	She began estrogen treatments
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:22:59,328	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And it worked
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:02,656	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	That the first time I got my first injection
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:06,752	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I just felt this immense relief like I was finally on the right track
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:10,336	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	There was no longer the same physical discomfort
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:10,848	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	But
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:16,224	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	As page finally was becoming comfortable in her own body
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:18,528	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Page's wife
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:19,808	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Started to turn away
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:25,184	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	The begin sleeping in different bedrooms it was almost like we're becoming strangers
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:29,792	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And the point where I realized that
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:32,352	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	You know she wasn't suddenly going to
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:35,168	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I don't know
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:40,544	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Tried really hard
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:47,712	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	But it's really difficult
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:51,040	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	When things don't have a clear category
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:52,064	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	That's scary
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:53,344	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	For us all
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:56,160	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	There a ship we don't recognize
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:58,720	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I felt like
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:00,256	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Monster
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:04,096	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I felt like
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:08,960	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Who is terrible like alien creature that
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:11,008	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	It come down
EDL	00:24:11,008	00:24:12,544	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And take it over
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:15,616	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Her husband's life in
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:18,944	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Taking him away from her
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:28,416	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	One night I heard a crying in the bathroom
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:32,000	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And I asked if everything was okay and she said no
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:34,816	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	She said it's over isn't it
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:37,888	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And I think the next day she told me to move out
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:43,008	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I am mourn for my marriage the same way I would mourn for like
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:45,056	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	You know the death of
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:49,920	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	None of my mother or someone who I was really really close with
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:55,296	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	In Tennessee right now
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:57,600	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	It's really hard to talk about still
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:25:00,928	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Sitting there in Paige's apartment
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:03,488	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	The afternoon light fitting in the window behind her
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:05,536	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I was just struck
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:08,096	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	My how hard her situation was
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:11,168	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	It's not just the fact that page
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:13,984	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Wasn't in one clear gender category
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:17,312	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	She was stuck between categories in other ways as well
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:20,896	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	In the weeks before and after our visit
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:22,432	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I had called around
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:25,504	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Trying to get a handle on how to make sense of this experience
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:27,552	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	The people like page describe
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:30,624	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I had spoken to all kinds of people
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:33,696	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Therapist historians gender researchers
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:38,560	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	But it seems like a lot of the people that I spoke to
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:40,352	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	We're convinced
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:42,656	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	The experience I was describing
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:44,448	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Didn't
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:45,216	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Really exist
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:51,104	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	There's no way they're actually flipping between genders I was told
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:55,200	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	By two different gender researchers into different European countries
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:57,248	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	These people are just psychotic
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:00,320	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Both of the men who told me this
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:02,112	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And worked in gender research
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:04,416	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	For their entire professional careers
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:06,720	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And they sounded extremely confident
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:11,584	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	A gender therapist in San Francisco with also skeptical
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:13,120	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	But she had a different reason
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:20,288	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	These people are actually just normal transgendered people she explained in the sense that the Earth
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:24,128	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Experiencing the same thing that any transgender person experiences
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:26,944	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	They've just developed a different way of describing it
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:28,736	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Same experience
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:31,040	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Different label seem to be her argument
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:32,576	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	In other words
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:35,392	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	It's not just the page
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:37,952	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Was existing between genders
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:40,256	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Problem was even more
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:44,096	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Most of the people that I talked
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:44,608	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	2
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:48,448	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Didn't seem to believe that the experience that page
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:50,240	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Was saying that she had
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:51,776	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Was real
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:59,200	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Why do you think this happened to you
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:02,016	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Where does this come from in you
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:04,832	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I don't know
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:09,696	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I have stopped asking myself that because it doesn't matter anymore
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:13,536	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I just kind of animal I am
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:15,328	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	When we talked
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:18,912	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Paige seemed as mystified by what was happening to her than anyone else
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:20,960	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	But her experience
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:21,728	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	She concluded
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:23,264	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Was her experience
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:25,568	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	There wasn't that much he could do about it
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:29,152	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	But my biggest worry is that I'm never going to really fit in
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:34,528	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Tell a female spaces or male spaces are afraid that I'm going to be
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:39,392	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Living the rest of my life and some kind of weird gender Twilight Zone
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:44,256	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	What will you do then
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:46,560	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I don't know
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:49,888	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I keep on doing my best
EDL	00:27:51,168	00:27:57,568	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	More than a year after we first met I called
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:58,848	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	On page app on the phone
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:28:01,152	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I wanted to check in and see how she was doing
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:05,504	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	It was clear from the very first moment she answered
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:06,528	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	But something was different
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:08,832	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Her voice sounded different
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:09,600	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Higher
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:11,136	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Hi can you hear me
EDL	00:28:12,928	00:28:16,000	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Turns out about six months after I went to San Diego
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:18,048	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	The flipping started to fade
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:19,072	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And eventually
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:21,376	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Paige had settled full-time and being a woman
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:23,424	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	The last time page and flipped
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:25,472	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	In tubing psychological email
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:27,776	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Was in the fast food restaurant Five Guys
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:30,848	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And she said it took her completely by surprise
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:32,384	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I've gotten so used to
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:35,456	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Country sayings like I am
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:37,504	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I like a woman that
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:39,296	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I thought it had stopped
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:41,344	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And I remember I slept really hard
EDL	00:28:41,344	00:28:44,160	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	It was it was really bizarre felt like I was wearing
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:47,232	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	I really uncomfortable sweater or something like that
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:53,888	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	The page couldn't really explain why the flipping had stopped any better than she could explain why it it started
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:59,264	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	She said she saw the estrogen hormones you taken to make your body more androgynous
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:00,800	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Probably had affected her
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:07,200	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And Laura case the researcher who's been studying people like page agrees that hormones do effect
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:07,712	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Brain
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:11,040	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	But still there was no way to be absolutely certain
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:13,344	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	But it was one thing
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:15,648	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	The page seemed absolutely clear about
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:18,464	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Living in one category
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:23,072	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Even if it's a category that's often discriminated against like transgendered women
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:25,120	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Is way better
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:26,656	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And having no category
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:28,448	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Oh my goodness
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:33,056	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	It's so much easier it's so much more manageable
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:34,848	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	The world
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:37,408	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Tumi just in makes so much more sense
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:40,224	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Now page new which was supposed
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:40,992	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	To do
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:42,272	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Where she could place her foot
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:44,064	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	She didn't have a wife
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:46,112	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	But she did have that
EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:12,480	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	What I really want to know since I have never heard of anybody like
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:18,880	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Like I didn't know this was this was in the inhuman experience are there a lot of these
EDL	00:30:18,880	00:30:25,280	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	People is is there at 3 so I have spoken
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:31,680	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	To maybe six people who have alternating gender incongruity who flipped their by gender and they kind of
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:35,776	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Move between their genders in this white cuz there are lots of different ways of being bigender right
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:42,944	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And click thing is I differ
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:43,456	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Yes
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:44,992	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	So they they had that too
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:46,016	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Yes
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:47,808	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Any idea what
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:52,160	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Causes those sudden flips at exactly what lowercase is trying to understand
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:56,768	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Think she has about 26 of these people that she has been talking to and
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:31:00,608	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	So she has been talking to these people but I don't know that it's
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:03,168	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Clear yet it could be biological or
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:04,448	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	It could be
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:09,312	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	A different kind of disorder it could simply be a different way of
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:15,456	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Conceptualizing and experience that a lot of different people have we can't even say
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:20,832	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	This is a condition with a strong in Sharpie marker
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:23,648	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Declaration of now there's a name
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:26,464	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And now this exists like there could be
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:29,280	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Hundreds of thousands of people privately
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:30,304	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Sitting with this
EDL	00:31:30,304	00:31:30,816	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	And if
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:33,120	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	If that name came out
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:37,472	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Maybe they'd suddenly have a place but the name right now itself is like
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:43,360	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	In Gray translucence what is the name again it's alternating gender incongruity
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:46,432	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	Boy you're saying is this is really a mystery
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:48,992	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	You don't really know what happened in the story really
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:50,016	| radiolab_podcast15invisibilia |	What is the scientist
