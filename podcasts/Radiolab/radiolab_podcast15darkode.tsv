EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:38,943	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	I was curious
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:42,015	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	I decided that I will try
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:44,063	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	So she clicked the button that said yes
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:46,879	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	And one
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:47,647	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	File back
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:50,463	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	But as soon as I did

EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:12,223	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	So you decrypt a thing and then suddenly it's a countdown to the yes they say if you won't pay by this
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:15,551	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Is this them Define

EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:37,471	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	And then he was there talking and he was
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:40,287	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	He was like yeah you know he knew my mom

EDL	00:15:56,927	00:16:01,535	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Vendors and we are number one or two the introduction with a bad introduction
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:02,815	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	What's a bitcoin
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:07,423	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Like we're going to hold you ransom for all your information until you
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:10,239	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Yeah we use this new currency to pay house off

EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:16,127	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Coincafe
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:16,895	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	A few weeks back
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:17,663	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	The grandmother
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:21,247	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Who was in tears she was going to lose all of her family photos
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:22,271	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Because the deadline is come
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:24,063	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Crying on the phone to me
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:25,343	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Got it
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:32,511	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Acrylic people who sell Bitcoin just believe that there should be a digital currency that is decentralized
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:33,791	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	It doesn't rely on the banks
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:36,607	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	But unfortunately has become the currency of choice
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:39,167	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Ransom
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:42,751	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Hey there in this weird position so it's a tricky thing because
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:49,151	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Like I can't sell Bitcoin to someone who I know is going to do something illegal with it right that's will wheeler who run the Bitcoin exchange
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:52,991	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Call Express he says he and the other exchanges are really worried right
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:55,807	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Is it they keep helping little guys pay the ransom
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:57,599	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Nor to get their files back
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:59,647	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	They are in effect making themselves
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:03,231	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Accessories to a crime I finally got a call back from fencing
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:06,303	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Which is the federal Authority for
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:08,095	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Financial crime enforcement Network
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:09,119	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	They said that
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:11,423	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	We could perceive
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:12,703	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Paying a ransom
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:14,751	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Unlawful activity
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:16,031	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	And so
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:18,079	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	They might choose to use that against
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:18,847	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	The company
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:20,127	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Who helps out right
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:21,151	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Unlikely
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:25,503	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Until we get a straight answer from Vince and we'll take the overly cautious approach and
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:27,039	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Start the cleaning these transactions
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:29,855	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Even though in your heart you want to help
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:33,695	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Do you want to risk being indicted for helping you get your travel route
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,207	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Reimbursed
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:37,023	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	And I mean to me answers now
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:39,071	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	In any case
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:47,007	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	After Alina deposits the extra 25 bucks in her mom's
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:51,359	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Bitcoin account Nina the mom goes online
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:52,895	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	And it was gone
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:55,199	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	But
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:55,711	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Then
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:57,503	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	About an hour later
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:00,575	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Went to my computer
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:02,623	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	And there was another message
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:05,951	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	That you're late
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:09,535	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	No doubt that I was doing the half
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:13,119	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	You have to pay
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:14,399	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	1000
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:15,679	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	$300
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:16,447	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Roughly
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:20,031	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	I did not have anybody to turn to
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:22,335	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	So she went to that same website where you can write them
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:29,247	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	I wrote them that I was laid but I mentioned the snow storm
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:32,319	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	The things given which they probably
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:35,135	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	And the
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:38,719	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	The wonderful us
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:40,511	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Mail service
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:44,863	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	I said that I tried and I was only two
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:46,143	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Hours
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:46,655	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Late
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:49,471	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	And then all of a sudden
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:52,543	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	I'm getting the message
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:53,567	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	You paid

EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:09,183	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	They took pity on her
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:11,487	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Maybe I found
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:12,255	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	That it's

EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:53,504	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Particular site actually the biggest
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:55,296	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Of these kind of sites
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:25:01,696	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	It's out there it's called Dark code the way it has been described by law enforcement is sort of an amazon.com
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:04,768	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Phone for hackers specifically how us attorney David Hicks
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:06,304	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Describe to her in an interview
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:07,584	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Darkode
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:10,144	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Is the largest English-speaking

EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:16,544	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	When did I think most people know Silk Road and they know for example
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:17,824	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	So you could get a contract hit
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:19,872	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Silk Road drugs
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:21,152	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Some guns and everything else
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:25,248	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	So would it be right for me to say that this was sort of a silk road for hackers
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:31,392	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Yeah I wouldn't want to drive that direct comparison I think it's probably accurate I would say that all measure of cybercrime
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:32,160	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	That you see and watch
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:35,744	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Around the world was in some form or fashion connected to it
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:40,608	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	So we got really interested in this world of this site darkode into

EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:42,400	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	And so with Dina
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:45,728	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	We started calling around trying to find anyone that would talk

EDL	00:27:58,592	00:27:59,360	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	It started with fam
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:01,664	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	One of the easiest ways
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:03,712	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	How to make money on the internet back pre-2000
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:05,760	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Was
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:08,832	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Spam is in a penis extension
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:10,368	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	What happened was that the
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:11,904	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	In the olden days most
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:13,440	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Servers mail servers
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:14,720	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	I acted is open relay
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:18,048	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Meaning the mail people wouldn't really pay attention to who was sending one
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:21,376	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	To the spammers with Spam with abandon
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:22,912	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	And then spam got to be enough
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:23,424	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Sofa problem
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:25,472	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Is that the techies of the world
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:26,240	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Decided
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:28,032	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	They started to block
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:29,824	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Like if they found a guy who is
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:32,640	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	They thought was standing too many product emails or whatever
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:34,432	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	They would block his IP address
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:35,712	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Couldn't send any more
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:39,552	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	So what the spammers and their contractors that need
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:41,344	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Needed to do was to have a bunch of
EDL	00:28:41,344	00:28:42,112	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Clean IP address
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:45,184	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Ants in Spanish
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:46,976	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	From that so what they did
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:48,256	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Totally genius totally evil
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:51,328	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Is a hired a bunch of programmers to create a bunch of virus
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:54,144	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Disseminated those viruses across the internet
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:55,424	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	People with
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:56,960	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Accidentally clicker open something
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:28:58,240	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Get them onto their
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:28:59,776	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Computer
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:03,360	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	And then suddenly the spammers couldn't remote control
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:04,384	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	ARROW computers
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:05,408	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	At a distance

EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:38,592	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	To be honest
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:39,616	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	I think at that age
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:40,128	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Guy

EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:42,944	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Think about it
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:44,992	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	It's the Internet it's
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:46,272	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	It's a lot harder.
EDL	00:30:46,272	00:30:46,784	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	2

EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:56,000	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Wrong but it's not like going up to someone and punching them in the face
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:56,512	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	There's no
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:31:00,096	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Human connection there you don't see these people are feel these people
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:03,424	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	He said at the time it was just sheer curiosity
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:05,984	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	So he says he asked
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:07,264	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Ask this Pied Piper guide
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:08,288	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	To send him somewhere

EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:11,104	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	And that really intrigued
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:14,176	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	No digging through the source code trying to understand
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:16,480	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	What is this thing doing how does it work how does a tick
EDL	00:31:16,480	00:31:17,504	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	This guy was you could koetter

EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:43,616	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Going to take some tools and software that other people have
EDL	00:31:43,616	00:31:44,128	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Created in
EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:46,688	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Fast forward
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:50,784	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	As Dan went the opposite direction of the script kiddies and God

EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:54,368	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Start making me the spot Nets that could
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:55,136	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Literally
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:57,440	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Spy on people as they were using their computers
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:32:00,512	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Thing to see all the pouring that people are watching that type of thing
EDL	00:32:00,512	00:32:03,328	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	He says he found himself in another chat
EDL	00:32:03,840	00:32:04,608	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	That was called
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:12,288	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Place where hackers swap tips Bragg take a look what I did by 2face this website take a look and he says Monday
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:13,568	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	He was talking with a friend of his
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:15,360	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Is there. We were talking and
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:17,408	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Why do we set up a community
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:19,456	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Where we can really filter who gets the
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:22,784	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	What all is script kiddies in idiots
EDL	00:32:23,296	00:32:24,320	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	I actually chose the name
EDL	00:32:25,088	00:32:26,368	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	I came up with that
EDL	00:32:26,368	00:32:27,904	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	My slime name
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:31,232	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	I just think it's pretty good what's the name again

EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:36,096	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	I think right seems cooler with a k
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:39,424	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Yes so you chose the name and started getting the site set
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:41,472	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	The rules were it would be invite only
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:45,312	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	She had an invite and each new person would be required to demonstrate their skill
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:46,592	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	He's a piece of software that I created
EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:49,408	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Here's a video of my botnet and action
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:50,944	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	And at some point
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:51,712	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	I'm not too long after
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:54,272	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	It was decided for one reason or another that
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:57,600	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Hey we got all these programmers on here that's great but
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:59,392	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	They also want to be able to
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:00,416	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Sell some stuff
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:01,440	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Think so
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:05,792	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Let's invite some people who would be willing to buy
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:09,376	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	This sound like a fairy so I have

EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:32,928	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	It could be buying a bond that itself
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:34,720	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	You know if you don't want to build one yourself
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:36,256	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Someone that somebody else

EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:59,040	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Now this is some sort of surprising to us then when it comes to find that there's this whole rental

EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:24,896	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	I can rent a botnet for 20 bucks a month if you could
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:29,504	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Like renting space here you want to use this to go do damage somewhere or you want to make a statement or

EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:49,984	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	More of this kind of activity on the site
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:55,104	| radiolab_podcast15darkode |	Like some kind of a botnet of 5000 computers another guy would have some software like the ransomware
