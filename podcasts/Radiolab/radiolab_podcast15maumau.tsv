EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:18,303	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And a much better living standard in Kenya than they ever could back at home

EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,271	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	They had
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:11,551	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	What's the word for the white people
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:15,135	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And that's how it went for four decades
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:16,671	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Until
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:17,695	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	The Second World War
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:24,607	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Ask the question has started 1939 suddenly.
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:30,751	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Thousands of men Canyon Manor forced into war
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:43,807	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Came in contact with ideas of Independence and they anticipated when they return
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:50,207	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Turn the day is Big Bear in Europe day after that
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:54,815	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	They would have access to land that the conditions will be getting better but
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:55,327	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Nope
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:59,679	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	They may find their condition is not only
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:01,215	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Not gotten better it's gotten worse
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:04,543	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And so after the war a few of these vets
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:07,615	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	From the largest ethnic group in Kenya
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:08,895	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Call the kikuyu
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:09,919	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	They get together
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:11,711	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And they decide to take an oath
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:16,575	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	No Odin is traditional amongst
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:17,855	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	The kikuyu
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:19,647	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	So for example men
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:25,535	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	A hundred years ago or more would take an oath pledging allegiance to their ethnic group as they went to war with somebody else
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:27,583	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	This case they take an oath
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:30,655	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Pledging themselves to kick all Europeans out of the colony
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:38,335	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Then the earthquake today that I pledge to take all Europeans out of the colony out of Kenya and if I don't met this earth kill me
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:42,687	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I pledged to take up arms against the Europeans if I don't buy this house kill me
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:47,039	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	No question last thing that was said always was if I reveal the contents of this Earth
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:48,575	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	May the South killed
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,415	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	She said the first thing they did

EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:15,199	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Blood things that absolutely repulse the local European settlers and put Terror into them
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:21,599	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Why do they end up calling themselves the mammal that is much debated
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:24,159	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	But nobody quite agreeing on on how it
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:26,207	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	How it came to pass but the mailman hours
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:27,743	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Many tickets

EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:21,567	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Okay so here's our we get to the part of the story that is in deep
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:23,359	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Flux after the
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:24,639	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Murder of the rock family
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:25,919	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	The settlers demanded
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:28,223	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	That the colonial government do something
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:30,527	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And they did they pursued the male Fighters
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:31,295	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Supposedly
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,831	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Small band of Fighters into the forest
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:35,391	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	There were skirmishes
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:36,159	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	The last
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:39,743	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Four years Story Goes the Mal Mal movement never quite gained
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:41,023	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Traction
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:43,839	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And ultimately the British quell the Rebellion they handled it
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:46,399	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Now that's for how they handle
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:48,447	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	For the longest time
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:49,983	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	People would look back it was this
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:50,751	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Giant
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:51,519	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Blank Spot
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:53,311	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	No one quite knew what
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:53,823	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Happened
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:55,359	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And here's why
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:56,383	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Cody David Anderson
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:59,199	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	By the time the British finally decide to leave
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:00,991	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	1963
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:04,063	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	By that time Kenya is around the 20th
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:06,111	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Different Colony that Britain will leave
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:08,159	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	So it's about halfway down the list
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:10,975	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	So there's already in place
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:12,255	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	A protest
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:18,655	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	At the stadium the articles of Independence
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:24,799	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	The formal stage of powers they set off fireworks and then
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:29,407	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	The Ritz roll out of the woods daytrana smooth
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:31,199	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And colorful and happy
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:32,479	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Exit
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:38,879	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And at some point in that well-worn exit process either right before the exit right afterwards there was
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:41,695	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	David calls it the weeding of document
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:45,535	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I mean the British government
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:46,815	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Conducted
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:51,167	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Very very sophisticated Purge operations and all of its former colonies
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:58,079	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Katie Engelhart again she says it everywhere you look Uganda Palestine Rhodesia Zanzibar Nigeria Jordan Malaya Hong Kong
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:11:58,847	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Their stories of
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:00,383	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Paper is being
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:03,711	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Kind of tightly packed into boxes and drops it
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:07,039	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	See a lot of papers were burned as a joke
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:08,575	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	In Hmong engine historians
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:11,391	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	On the day that India treat its independence
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:14,207	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	When the celebrations were taking place in Delhi

EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:20,607	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Does the wattage of smok playing across from the bone fires are burning.
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:24,703	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	All of which is to say that it was snow soon for 30 years that that Blank Spot
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:29,311	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Aphmau emergency with just a blank in the story of the evil now or just continue
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:31,871	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Because there were no documents to say otherwise
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:33,663	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Then
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:34,943	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	We get to Caroline Elkins

EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:19,487	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	So Carolina would wake up every morning and would walk

EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:59,455	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	We should say that as we were
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:02,015	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Reporting the story we really kind of fell in deep
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:04,575	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	To the point where Jamie York
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:08,927	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Put Oregon to London to get hassled by those guards at Hansel Park
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:12,511	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	He then decided to spend part of his vacation
EDL	00:19:12,511	00:19:13,279	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	In Kenya
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:16,351	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Basically following in Caroline Elkins footsteps

EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:27,615	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And driven about three hours into the countryside
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:30,175	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And okay after what felt like
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:36,575	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	5 right turns 37 last we finally wind up in this completely replace it really
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:37,599	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Just feel like the middle of nowhere
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:45,023	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	It's like a little village or something little cluster of houses in Rolling Hills in a county called me area

EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:45,951	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Most of the men have died of old age so you thought you were going to meet anybody
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:46,975	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Exactly
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:47,487	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Curious
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:48,511	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	For myself
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:50,303	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	But I thought okay I'll
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:51,327	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I just asked

EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:08,735	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And then started to sort of chuckle
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:11,551	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Because it's obvious you are supporting mom
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:15,391	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	They were like of course we were supporting the mama we were the mama

EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:17,184	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	That was everybody
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:20,256	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	So interesting so it wasn't just like a small band of militants
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:23,072	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	It wasn't a small band of militants amongst the kikuyu it was
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:24,608	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Almost everyone
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:30,752	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	This is one of the first things that caught Caroline Elkins attention made her really question that official narrative
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:33,312	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Cuz when she was doing interviews 15 years ago
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:36,640	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	She said everyone she spoke to everyone
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:37,408	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	To a person
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:39,712	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And we're talking hundreds of interviews
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:42,016	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Started with I took the oath
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:43,040	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	On such and such a date
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:44,064	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Very interesting
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:46,368	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Seemed to her what you had here was not
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:48,672	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	A small Insurrection this was a mass move
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:52,000	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And she would discover the British response to it
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:53,792	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Was also massive
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:56,352	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	1953
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:59,424	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Shortly after the murder of the Rock Family the white settlers marched
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:02,496	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Demand that the colonial government do something
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:06,336	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Until what happened
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:11,712	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Speak into the village Bazaar going to Villages across Kenya they rounded everybody up know each other
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:15,040	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Slaughter cattle slaughter their goats burned down their Homestead
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:16,320	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And put them into these
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:17,088	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Prison Village
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:21,184	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	800 barbed wire Villages throughout
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:22,208	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Central Province Kenya
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:31,424	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	The Village was like a concentration camp
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:35,520	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	The thing the thing to grasp. This is very carefully designed
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:36,288	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I'm very
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:37,312	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Practical
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:40,384	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	David said there was a very carefully planned system
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:43,968	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Work the barbed wire Villages were primarily for women and children
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:47,040	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Men were usually sent to these detention camps are true based
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:47,808	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Prison
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:49,344	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	The logic of those camps
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:52,928	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Was actually thought up by a group of British academics
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:55,488	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Who met in 1953
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:23:00,352	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Turn emergency meeting to discuss the quote mouth problem and they decided at that meeting
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:01,120	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Clearly
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:04,704	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	The real reason the Mau Mau Rebellion was it that way
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:07,264	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Captured by some kind of mental illness
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:13,664	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Had nothing to do with the fact their land has been taken away from them know it was said they were temporarily crazy and the committee decided at
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:14,944	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Must have something to do
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:15,712	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	With those
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:19,808	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Host Machine by the British as a primitive way
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:21,344	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Capturing a kikuyu mine
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:24,672	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I'm making the person unreasonable and insensitive
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:27,232	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	The only way they all could you get rid of the oath
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:30,560	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Was to convert the person back to sanity
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:34,144	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Part of that involved a confession of what
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:34,656	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I done
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:37,472	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Once confessions were made
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:39,264	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	It would then be rewarded
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:40,288	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Buy a better prison regime
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:42,592	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Baby movement around the compound
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:43,872	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Given privileges
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:45,152	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Given better food
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:49,760	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	You moved along the system too cold for pipeline you would along the pipeline Until You released
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:51,808	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	But you first have to confess
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:53,856	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	To confess
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:55,648	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	To confess
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:58,208	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	This is get to walk hungari

EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:02,560	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I joined to the MoMA Freedom struggle
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:05,888	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	When I was 17 years of age
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:08,192	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Quickly became an organizer
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:08,704	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Recruiter
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:10,240	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And therefore Target
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:11,008	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	They had to
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:13,568	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Search for men
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:15,104	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And they caught me
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:19,456	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	They put me into a detention camp

EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:59,456	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	There been a lot of different estimates to try to pin down the scale
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:00,480	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Of the British campaign
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:02,784	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	They range from 160
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:05,856	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Thousand people killed named torture detain
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:10,464	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Too much much higher numbers Carolina consider own calculation
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:16,864	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And according to her all the time it was done nearly the entire kikuyu population of a million

EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:26,336	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And you have to look at scale
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:28,896	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And if you are the balance sheet of this
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:31,200	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	How many Europeans died
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:32,736	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	32

EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:37,600	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Like why isn't this until everybody in the world now
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:39,904	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	In the event say of

EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:45,536	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	They were slaves in Egypt

EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:48,608	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	It becomes
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:50,400	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	The national story
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:51,424	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Of the Hebrew people
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:53,472	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	In this situation
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:55,776	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	You have done working out of I believe is it
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:56,800	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Kikuyu becoming the first
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:58,592	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Why wouldn't I
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:28:00,896	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	He make this the national story
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:03,200	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Well Kenyatta comes out of detention
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:06,016	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And one of the first things he does
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:07,296	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Is he denounces malmo
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:11,904	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	The same organization that accelerated Independence
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:15,744	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	She says the same movement scare the British
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:16,256	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Scared him
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:19,328	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	He didn't want them suddenly organizing and taking his
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:21,120	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Soap for
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:21,632	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Decades
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:27,264	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	From 1948 until 2002 the ban on Mal Mal that have been put in place
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:29,312	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	By the British colonial government remained in place
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:31,360	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Meaning it was illegal to even talk about it
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:40,576	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	But eventually in 2005 Caroline publishes her book
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:43,648	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Imperial Reckoning concluded the hundreds of interviews
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:46,720	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Picture of Justice systemic violence
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:51,072	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	The book was well-received which says
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:52,608	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	A lot of critics told her
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:53,632	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Nice story
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:54,656	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	But
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:56,192	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Now
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:56,960	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	This is an active fiction
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:28:58,496	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Actor fiction
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:28:59,008	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I made it up
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:01,568	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	But you had all these interviews
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:02,592	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	But one of them lines
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:05,920	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Was that is all based upon oral test
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:08,224	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Oral testimonies are usable
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:09,760	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	There is no story here
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:11,296	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	She said love that was
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:13,856	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Blatant racism you know Africans makeup
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:14,624	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Stories
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:15,648	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	But buried in there
EDL	00:29:16,160	00:29:22,560	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Is sort of legitimate concern of memory is faulty we know that oral histories are notoriously unreliable
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:24,608	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	If you're going to rewrite entire history
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:26,912	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	You need to get Beyond personal anecdote
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:28,192	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	You need documents
EDL	00:29:31,776	00:29:33,568	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Tequila straight improve-it Beyond.
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:36,896	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	As you mentioned that you found the documents
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:38,176	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Didn't seem to exist
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:40,736	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Nonetheless
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:44,320	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Fast forward 2009
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:49,696	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Caroline's Imperial Reckoning became the basis of a very large lawsuit
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:54,816	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	In June of 2009 5ml veterans representing over 5,000 Mouse
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:58,912	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Flew to London
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:30:05,312	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And filed a lawsuit against the British government the first time the British government had ever been sued by a former colonized population
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:07,360	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Veterans want an apology
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:13,504	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Some form of recompense for what happened are you at all nervous going into the court
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:22,720	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I was not at all convinced that we're going to go anywhere but down that smart day he represented amount veterans in court
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:26,048	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And the reason he was so sure that the case was going to go down in flames
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:28,096	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Most same issue
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:29,888	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	You just didn't have the documents
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:30,912	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	All we had were stories
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:32,960	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	When exactly Rock Solid
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:35,008	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Yeah that it was a nightmare
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:39,360	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Old canyons in the late 70s 80s
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:42,688	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Africans in my experience Van Dyke's extremely difficult
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:45,504	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	The people in that seventies night she's almost
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:50,368	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And this is actually a huge problem because in the British system if you're going to bring forward an old
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:51,136	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Old case
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:57,536	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Like one that's more than 6 years old the key question to the judge is can you still get a fair trial the government
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:30:58,816	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I can plausibly argue no
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:00,352	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Too much time has passed
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:04,704	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	We really worried that the judge would say well look that count be a fair trial because
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:05,728	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Actually these
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:07,008	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Witness is a cell wall
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:09,568	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	So up and down just in Tim's that memory
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:12,128	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	It really that evidence is worth it right now
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:15,456	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	So to recap I wasn't really optimistic
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:16,480	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	But then
EDL	00:31:16,480	00:31:18,016	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	It's kind of a last-ditch effort
EDL	00:31:18,016	00:31:20,320	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	He contacted historian David Anderson
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:21,856	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Tonight tonight to witness
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:26,208	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Because David has written a book about African history that was chock-full of legal documents
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:27,744	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And they approached me to ask
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:30,816	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Whether that was material in the legal cases are dealt
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:32,352	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	That might
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:33,120	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Be useful to
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:35,680	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And that's what he told him something that
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:36,960	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	What ultimately lead
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:40,032	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	All of us back that scary building a secret he told them
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:41,568	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	For the past 20 years
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:43,360	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	He has had this hunch
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:45,408	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Well so long before the my my
EDL	00:31:45,408	00:31:46,432	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Trial came to court
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:50,016	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I and my brother story ends
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:50,784	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Believed
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:54,368	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	The documents being brought back from Kenya to Britain
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:32:00,768	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	David said in that same Nairobi archive where Caroline Elkins found the talking about the tension
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:07,168	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Gosh you know what's going on in that same place somebody else who found another document that it also
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:13,568	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	This one is a simple packing slip listing of documents for transportation packing up and removed
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:19,968	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Now it's for where those documents were moved to well
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:26,368	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	The ocean from 1997-98 99 like starving man with a single Pringle David kept.
EDL	00:32:26,368	00:32:32,768	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I eventually bought documents from the national archives in Britain that confirmed the stuff from Kenya actually landed an error
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:35,072	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Airport in Britain Independence
EDL	00:32:35,072	00:32:40,448	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And then was able to find out who took them with Van they went in the car's registration number
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:40,960	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Thought
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:43,008	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	That's in the trail went cold
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:46,848	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Defile document request after document request that we get nowhere
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:47,872	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Then
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:49,920	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Something totally unexpected app
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:56,832	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Do historians working on Southern Africa actually got access to Hounslow
EDL	00:32:56,832	00:32:59,136	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	They got inside
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:05,024	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	One of them was the former Colonial administrators Zoe
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:07,840	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Networks and connections to get its way in any out
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:08,352	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	After work
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:11,424	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	He sent David Anderson a text message
EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:14,240	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Telling me the enhancement parking scene
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:16,288	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Miles and miles of shelving
EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:17,824	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Of documents
EDL	00:33:17,824	00:33:18,592	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	From other colonies
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:19,872	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Including Kenya
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:24,992	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Was that a figure of speech miles or was that I think you meant it literally
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:28,576	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Heat seat scene of vas a hanger is he
EDL	00:33:28,576	00:33:29,344	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Describe it
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:31,392	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	With row upon row upon row of.
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:36,768	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	So when Martin de the lawyer contacted David Anderson and asked him can you help us with
EDL	00:33:37,280	00:33:38,304	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Arcades David said
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:40,096	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Yes I can do
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:43,680	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I can actually give you any documents cuz I don't have any but I can outline for youth
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:44,960	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	The documents that I think
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:45,984	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Might be out
EDL	00:33:46,496	00:33:48,288	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	The documents I believe
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:49,824	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	The bass, Whiting way
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:54,944	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	So he wrote a witness report for the judge summarizing everything he knew giving all the details I had
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:58,784	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I didn't mention Huntsville Park I didn't say what I thought they were
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:01,344	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I just said I knew they coming to Britain
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:06,720	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I want to know what happened to the judge read that report and then basically asked the government
EDL	00:34:06,720	00:34:08,256	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Do you have them or not look
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:10,304	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	If you can't answer this question
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:11,584	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	You'll be held in contempt of court
EDL	00:34:12,096	00:34:15,168	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I will interpret this is you withheld information
EDL	00:34:15,168	00:34:16,448	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I'm at basic means you lose the case
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:19,776	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	That decision was the turning point
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:27,712	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Half a century on from Britain's withdrawal from Kenya documents detailing Yelich brutality employee
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:29,760	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	By the British colonial authorities
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:31,040	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Have finally been released
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:37,952	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I'm suddenly having spent years denying these documents existed but in 4 days they found them
EDL	00:34:37,952	00:34:41,280	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Canyons will wasting in Nairobi today for the news from London
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:46,656	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	You can see the reaction of these people here today
EDL	00:34:46,656	00:34:47,424	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I mean we're talking
EDL	00:34:47,936	00:34:49,216	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	We're talking something like
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:51,008	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	300 boxes of files
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:53,056	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Tons of missing documents
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:55,616	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	15000 papers relevant to the case
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:59,200	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	This again is Katie Engelhart of Vice news she reported on the trial and the
EDL	00:34:59,712	00:35:00,992	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Tencent number of
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:01,760	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	House of the government
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:05,088	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	100 linear feet I think those those files held
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:09,184	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And it contained really really damning
EDL	00:35:09,184	00:35:15,072	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Evidence of Britain's conduct in Kenya government in London did no
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:18,400	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	What was happening in Kenya there was specific documentation
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:20,192	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	A rounding up with Mama Fighters
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:26,592	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	It was even a memo about a Kenyan being roasted alive feeding letter written by detainees at then smuggled
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:27,104	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Set up a cabinet
EDL	00:35:27,616	00:35:32,736	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Hurry hurry hurry in order to save our souls I mean absolutely damning evidence
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:35,296	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	The government ultimately agreed to pay a bounty
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:36,576	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	20 million pound
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:38,112	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	List of people who brought this lawsuit
EDL	00:35:38,112	00:35:40,928	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Which works out to roughly $4,600
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:42,208	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Yes
EDL	00:35:42,208	00:35:43,232	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	He said I understand
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:45,536	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Why would they even save those
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:47,328	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Well
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:49,888	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Looking through the collections of no emerged
EDL	00:35:50,656	00:35:52,192	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	It's quite clear to me
EDL	00:35:52,704	00:35:53,216	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	That
EDL	00:35:53,728	00:35:54,496	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	They want
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:57,312	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Get to save documents that showed
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:36:00,640	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Not all European stuff in Kenya
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:02,944	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Hyping happy about compulsive Force
EDL	00:36:03,456	00:36:05,504	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Who the letter written in 1953
EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:07,552	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	By the colonies Attorney General
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:11,136	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	He observes that detention facilities in Kenya or quote
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:15,744	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Distressingly reminiscent of conditions in Nazi Germany or communist Russia
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:20,864	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	So you think the people some of the British officers in Kenya save the files
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:22,656	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Precisely because they were damn
EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:24,192	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Yes
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:25,984	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	They save stuff that would demonstrate
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:27,520	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	That we didn't like that
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:34,688	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	What are the reason why the memo case has become so much bigger than
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:35,200	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Just amount
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:41,088	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	As soon as journalists and historians learn about the existence of those files they started to relentlessly poke
EDL	00:36:41,088	00:36:47,232	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And request more documents and soon those 1500 8800 files
EDL	00:36:47,232	00:36:49,792	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I meant 20,000 files and then
EDL	00:36:50,304	00:36:52,096	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	1.2 million files
EDL	00:36:52,864	00:36:55,936	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And at the time the estimate was at the files occupied
EDL	00:36:55,936	00:36:57,728	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	About 15 miles
EDL	00:36:57,728	00:36:59,520	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Floor-to-ceiling shelving
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:00,800	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	15 MI
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:03,360	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	The process that is being invoked
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:04,896	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Biting my my case
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:09,248	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Is going to have even wider repercussions than people yet
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:09,760	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Realize
EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:12,576	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	We got a little
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:14,880	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Infloo laugh
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:18,208	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	When we're talking with a woman named Mandy Banton
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:23,072	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	A senior research fellow at London University national archives in London
EDL	00:37:23,072	00:37:24,352	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And we call Hertz to help
EDL	00:37:24,352	00:37:27,424	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Parse all this stuff and it one point I asked her if it's just a Kenya thing
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:29,728	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	And she said oh no no no
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:31,776	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	It's not it's not by any means
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:34,592	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Explain the after the mammoth case the
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:37,664	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Foreign Commonwealth office which is the technical name for the place
EDL	00:37:37,664	00:37:38,688	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Holding those document
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:40,224	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Almost immediately afterwards
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:46,624	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	It admitted that he actually had documents from 37 former
EDL	00:37:46,624	00:37:47,136	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Colonist
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:50,720	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Yes exactly
EDL	00:37:50,720	00:37:57,120	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	You mean that there could be dirty stuff from Malaysia dirty stuff from Palestine dirty stuff from
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:59,168	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Cypresside Morgan Isaiah
EDL	00:37:59,168	00:38:00,448	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Sofia Soto
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:04,288	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Couple spots if you like I mean it's like a rewriting of history is that
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:09,664	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I don't mean to run now Questlove to pay for
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:13,760	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I'm looking at these you know comparatively newly-released records
EDL	00:38:13,760	00:38:15,808	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Now both David and Katie
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:20,160	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Cautioned us that the new stuff when it comes out might not be
EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:21,952	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	White is revelatory as
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:23,744	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	All those Manuel files
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:26,304	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I think their nuggets
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:27,840	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I think their nuggets and I think
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:30,656	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	I mean I think historians will find them
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:33,728	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	For David Anderson one of those nuggets might be the documents about
EDL	00:38:33,728	00:38:34,496	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	The Cold War
EDL	00:38:34,496	00:38:37,824	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Those could be historically really very very important
EDL	00:38:37,824	00:38:41,152	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Fort Caroline Elkins israel-palestine that Malaysia
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:47,552	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Singapore and I want to know what time does Hong Kong files there is over 250,000 documents on Hong Kong
EDL	00:38:47,552	00:38:48,320	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Just Hong Kong
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:48,832	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Which
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:52,416	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Sort of brings us to the situation that we are in now
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:57,792	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Just the most ridiculous ridiculous stupid situation imaginable
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:39:03,424	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Which is that for the moment the British government's policy is that all documents must be reviewed
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:04,192	| radiolab_podcast15maumau |	Aerodactyl
