EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:46,304	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I was actually tricked into debating
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:48,096	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I really had
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:50,144	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	When was it when it when was this so we're talking about
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:51,936	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Oh well

EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:07,552	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I ended up getting tricked into the bay
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:12,160	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I'm almost definitely a more of an observant person which is why I like to play the game of chess
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:12,928	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Because
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:15,488	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	You know how people move their pieces the time
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:17,280	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Listen to move their pieces all gifts
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:18,559	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	You know something
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:19,839	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Fairy tales
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:21,887	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And so I was tricked into the babe
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:24,447	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	By playing chess
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:28,287	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And I ended up winning the school chess tournament that we had and
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:31,359	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	This little short German redhead lady
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:32,639	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Name Jane Reinhardt
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:33,663	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I came to
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:35,455	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Chess practice I ended up being present
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:39,295	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Temperatures practice one day and put me in the hallway on
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:45,695	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I understand you you know you were chess champion and that's a really good thing and we had this debate program and I thank you
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:46,719	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I'd be really good at it
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:49,791	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	You know anybody who can critically think a chance to critically think
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:53,119	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Yeah yeah I don't even know what to say was
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:54,655	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	No no
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:56,447	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Fat
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:59,007	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	So over this
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:04,383	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Next year she kept on telling me it's just like I thought I told you to join the pain I thought I told you to join today and I was like
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:05,663	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I thought I told you know
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:07,455	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I can spot a debater at
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:08,223	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	20 pesos
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:13,343	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Okay you think I'm playing so 1 Monday I came to school she handed me a p
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:17,183	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Piece of paper it was a revised schedule she had my schedule changed
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:18,463	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	To where I had the bait first
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:20,767	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Sour
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:25,119	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Here you are
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:26,399	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	A lot of eye debater
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:28,191	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I just come and kind of days
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:31,263	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	My schedule got changed
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:32,543	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Okay that's fine
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:38,175	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	That was first day of classes Ryan's learning the basics of
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:41,503	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And in this kind of debate that he's doing school policy debate
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:43,807	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	There's two teams and two people in need
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:47,647	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Usually the debate is about some kind of national policy
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:49,439	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Like
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:51,487	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The United States government should increase
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:52,511	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Economic engagement in
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:57,375	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	One team at the beginning of the debate is randomly assigned to be affirmative
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,423	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And that means they're supporting
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:00,703	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	.
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:03,519	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Who sang yes the United States federal government
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:04,799	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Should do that
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:05,567	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Here's why
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:08,639	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The other team is the negative
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:11,711	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And they're arguing against
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:12,479	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Different
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:13,759	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Both of those ice maker
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:16,831	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The judge decides
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:17,855	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Who made the better record
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:20,927	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I mean I get him up debating
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:21,951	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Almost daewon
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:25,791	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	We ended up having mock debates in class like Pepsi verse
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:27,071	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Cisco can you know
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:28,095	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Family Guy versus
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:28,607	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The Simpsons
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:34,495	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	But that sucks it wasn't very fun it made us learn how to do impact
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:36,031	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Impacted
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:36,799	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Analysis
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:39,103	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	So for instance
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:40,639	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Let's say you're debating apple versus orange
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:42,943	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	If I say the rinds
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:45,503	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	If apples are necessary for the fertilizer
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:46,783	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Produce Orange
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:49,087	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Just so you must go for apples

EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:42,847	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The thing that helped me out was that
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:43,615	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	My first
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:44,127	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Tournament
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,407	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Was
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:46,687	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Anime canvas in eternal
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:48,479	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Debate Kansas City is urban debate league
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:52,063	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And so we were debating other kids from the same neighborhood
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:53,599	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	What's the difference
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:54,367	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Schools
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:56,159	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And so that environment
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:57,183	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Of debate was
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:59,487	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	To me very different like yeah we wanted
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:00,255	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Knights win
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:03,327	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	But there was a lot more, ratterree in the debate
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:06,655	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And so to me by the time I went to my first national
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:07,423	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I was very much
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:11,519	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	But once I went to that national tournament for
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:12,543	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	First timeout
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:14,335	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Okay I don't know
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:17,407	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	National Tournament
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:19,455	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	You're up against what I call name brands
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:25,343	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Predominantly private schools and so we were really excited about that but I will dress clothes on
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:31,231	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Bakugan the bus started kicking a little bit just by going to the Bay tournament got off the bus went inside
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:31,999	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And then
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:36,351	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	We went to the cafe
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:36,863	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Syria
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:42,495	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And when we open the door to walk
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:43,519	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	.
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:48,639	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The room
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:49,151	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Pilot
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:53,503	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I mean when I tell you the talk
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:54,527	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Wingstop literally
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:57,087	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	300 other Plus student
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:59,647	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Stopped and stared at us because a bus
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:00,159	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The Blockheads
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:04,511	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	MAA like watch
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:05,535	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	That's the whole time
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:10,143	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	At least that's how I feel
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:10,911	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	You know but
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:12,703	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	We walked over to our table
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:14,751	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Look like
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:16,031	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Do not worry about them
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:17,055	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Pull out your things
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:17,567	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Get warm.
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:20,383	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And so
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:21,919	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Got our stuff pulled out
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:22,943	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Starting to practice
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:24,479	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	They started
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:33,439	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Yeah whether they were Whispering about the bait stuff for about us I don't know I wasn't in there
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:37,279	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I can definitely explain to you what that felt like
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:39,327	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	It was real
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:47,519	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And making things even more awkward and more uncomfortable
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:51,871	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The ball is that when the debate actually got going and this is particularly true at the national level
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:53,151	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	This
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:54,431	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Is wet debate
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:54,943	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	It sounds like
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:12,095	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	What is it
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:13,887	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Sped up
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:15,679	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	This is what do they sound like today
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:21,823	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	What the goal of speed-reading are spreading if you Willis to get more arguments
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:27,711	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And apparently and this is like
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:28,479	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Digression
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:31,039	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	This kind of thing actually started in like a 19
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:33,599	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	60th and the students are actually the ones
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:34,367	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Uber driving
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:39,487	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	What are things that makes debate such an interesting intellectual game is that it's much more of a bottom
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:42,559	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Up driven activities in a top-down
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:45,375	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Activity director of debate at the University
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:46,143	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Arkansas
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:46,911	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	In the case of speed
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:49,215	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	We evolve the situation where
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:52,031	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	One team decided Well I'm going to
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,567	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Presente Target
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:54,335	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The other team
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:56,383	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Talk slower and Aaliyah
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:59,711	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	You didn't answer two of these argument
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:00,479	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	So
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:06,623	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	You lost a debate because you didn't answer those really well we need to answer all eight of those arguments
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,839	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Has gone way too far
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:19,423	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	It's not as if you didn't know how to do that
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:21,727	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	That's the way I've debated I did try to
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:23,519	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	But he says
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:26,591	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Somewhere around the first national tournament
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:27,615	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Just kind of stopped making
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:31,199	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Like the fast-talking
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:32,479	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The fact that
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:36,319	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Yadada babies super you know highfalutin topic
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:38,367	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I felt as if
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:40,159	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I could never take any of
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:40,927	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The stuff that I learned
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:41,695	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Intubate
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:43,487	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And take it back to 33
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:44,255	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Askew what
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:44,767	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Where I live
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:47,071	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And this isn't just you need to ride
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:51,935	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I mean what you say at the stage in debate is that a lot of kids like especially Inner City
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:54,239	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Kids from public schools black students
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:57,311	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	You know they just start to drop out of debate at a certain point
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:58,591	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Ryan
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:00,383	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Brian didn't do that
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:02,687	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Now something big is going to happen
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:05,503	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Somebody's going to say
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:11,647	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	No what happened was it stay at a student from University Academy and she was a senior
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:13,439	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Her name was marshawna
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,463	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And she went
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:18,047	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	She came over and asked around heart
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:21,119	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	She needed a partner there was about to be this tournament called

EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:29,567	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	She needed a heart
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:30,335	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	So
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:35,199	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Changing Rinehart and Jane said well

EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:55,071	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I didn't get it
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:58,655	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	But she was kind of told me you know let her
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:13:59,679	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And I'll drive the ship
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:00,191	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	You just ride along
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:01,215	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Okay
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:02,751	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	So
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:07,359	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Next day we get to the first debate I still was very unclear when we arrived at the tournament
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:08,639	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Just was going on
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:12,223	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Get to the classroom and standing
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:13,759	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Other side of the room
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:14,527	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Are there two of them
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:17,599	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Are they white kids mostly yeah they were white guys in
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:19,135	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Suits with Republicans
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:23,743	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	If you want to know if you wanted images
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,815	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The other team there affirmative
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:27,327	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	So big
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:33,983	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And they're like
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:34,495	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Service programs
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:36,543	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Broad
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:41,919	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	SI she gets up to give this speech in that starts with this like
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:48,319	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	4 minute long piece of spoken word
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:54,719	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Speech kind of about her personal experiences to be this way of speaking
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:55,999	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Was very
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:57,279	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Passionately Force
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:15:00,607	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	It made people.
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:03,679	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	They stop writing they stopped talking
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:07,007	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	In the middle of this riff
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:08,543	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Marshawna laid out this Ark
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:10,335	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	That the style of debate
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:12,127	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Did they engaged in that fast pace
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:13,151	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Form of debate
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:16,479	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Was exclusionary because it demotivated minority
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:18,015	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Students from participating
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:20,831	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And not only that like it also creates this
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:21,599	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Resorts in Bali
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:23,391	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Because if you're going to start
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:24,927	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Debating with
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:25,695	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Ton of argument
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:34,143	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Help researching those arguments so you pay people and you paid coaches help you make those arguments and that's clearly favors
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:35,679	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Rich and affluent schools
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:37,471	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And beyond that
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:38,239	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Marshawn argued
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:41,823	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Even the language itself setup a norm of what counts
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:42,847	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Intelligent
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:43,359	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Authoritative
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:50,271	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	For instance like men's voice to be held up over women black people to always seem angry and rude
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:52,831	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I'm going to just being passionate as if they don't
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:58,719	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I feeling you know it was a criticism of the auctioneer style of debate it was a criticism of the insular lingo up
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:15:59,999	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Debate over the criticism
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:04,351	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Of the way in which debates were decided socially and politically as a
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:05,375	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Opposed argumentative
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:09,471	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	So
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:14,079	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I was like I was like okay I can use it with you
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:20,735	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	No I wasn't shocked I was like I was like I was like damn ever the greatest
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:25,599	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Slaps like we was at the poetry slam but I was sitting to myself thinking like
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:28,671	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Am I going to extend this like when it got to be his turn
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:32,511	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	What's left for him to say I don't know what more what other words
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:33,023	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Back at you
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:38,399	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And so it wasn't until the second person from this team got up and he started
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:39,679	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Speak and he was like
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:40,447	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	You know
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:44,543	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Debating about to say this Brave this is a this is disrespect
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:47,103	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Go to the state of debate and he turned to her it was a
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:48,127	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	This moment he turned to her
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:50,943	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I he said it like from
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:51,967	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	So
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:54,527	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	You should go down the hall because
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:57,599	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	That's where portrait poses help visit academic
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:58,111	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Debate
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:00,159	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	What
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:04,767	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And he basically his argument was that what we were doing was
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:07,583	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	We will we were having one
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:08,095	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Talent show
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:12,447	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I was just like
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:13,471	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I get it
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:19,871	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I can maybe it was a study and I had done all night but everything kicked in that moment what happened came into the room
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:26,271	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Like I get everything that she was trying to say what
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:30,879	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	She was saying about the structure of debate because I had felt those things before I just didn't know how to articulate them
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:32,671	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	What's it like I get
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:34,463	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Did I can
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:35,231	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	What's it like
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:37,535	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Commissioner get what she saying like the bay
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:43,679	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And let's just say we definitely went on to
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:45,471	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	You won this match
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:48,287	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Yeah we won the debate because
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:50,591	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Let me just explain what happened in the
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:52,383	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Judges
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:54,943	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	In this kind of situation have a choice
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:55,711	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Price Rite
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:58,527	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Like they can hear the arguments that Ryan and Marsha on arm
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:01,343	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Making and they can think of
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:02,367	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Really about the piece
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:04,159	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Peace Corps or about armed services
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:04,927	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Is so
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:05,439	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	You lose
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:08,511	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Or they can do what the judge in the state
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:11,327	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	They can say all right
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:12,351	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Topic has kind of ship
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:14,655	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	But let's look at what we haven't
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:16,191	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Let's look at the argument
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:19,519	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Ryan marshawna saying.
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:21,567	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The structure of debate is
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:22,335	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Racist
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:26,943	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And then you've got the other team not really responding in any kind of like
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:29,759	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Counter argument attempt way
EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:32,575	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Ryan in this debate what does is he
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:37,695	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Key points of thought he points it when this other team says leave the room and he says Hey like
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:39,231	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	What they just did
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:39,999	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Cruzar
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:42,047	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	That we are
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:42,559	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Excluded from
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:44,607	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And the judge agreed
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:48,703	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Oh so you use you use his sort of you use his you don't belong here as
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:49,215	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	A kind of
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:53,311	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	As a as an article about our evidence in
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:55,359	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Came for a lot from what happen
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:56,383	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	In the debate
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:19:03,039	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Fascinating let me just take that guy site like so that you're changing the whole
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:09,951	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Really gets going there's no racism hegemony like I'm a racist
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:11,743	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Going to be what is he supposed to do like
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:13,791	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Wingstop
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:14,559	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The first off
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:17,887	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Diesel stop
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:22,239	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I mean I mean you don't have to say you're right this ain't nobody going to want to admit that they're racist
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:23,775	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	But you can definitely
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:28,383	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Admit that you've been gation races Praxis or you can have a debate about whether or not that was erased
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:30,687	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	There's a healthy debate to be
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:31,455	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	We had about that button
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:35,039	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	What he said was that you all do not belong here
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:36,063	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Leave the room
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:40,415	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Like if you walk in and you say what you just said
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:42,207	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And you say it forcibly in eloquent
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:49,119	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I hate you're changing the rules here you're breaking things down to leave the room and then in the leave the room they'll even so
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:50,399	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Kohl's open to this counter
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:51,167	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Talk to you give
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,959	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Like it's still it's still
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:56,031	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I just mean that you'd wear a vest and so this is a thing there
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:19:58,591	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Very few rules
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:19:59,359	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	To the Bay
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:00,127	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	But there is
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:01,407	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Kinds of norms
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:02,431	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And depending on
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:03,711	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	You know
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:04,991	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Community of debate
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:07,295	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The space of debate that you're in those Norms May differ
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:11,903	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	But I only know of a few rules like there must be a winner and a loser
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:16,511	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Time limits with an obscene that be debatable at times
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:19,071	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	There must be
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:21,119	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	An affirmative and negative
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:22,911	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Other than that how one
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:23,679	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Approaches debate
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:25,727	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	You know how one approach
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:28,543	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Just the topic how one approaches themselves in their house
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:29,823	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Position all of that stuff is
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:31,359	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Debatable and arguably should be
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:33,151	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	What is it there's no like
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:35,455	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Bible
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:38,015	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Of the of debate to there's no like
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:39,551	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Okay so they eat
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:42,879	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Put out things like the NDT rulebooks like affirmative teams

EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:24,096	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I thought we talked about the Peace Corps
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:26,656	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Like they walked into the wrong room
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:31,776	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Or something but that was one of our argument was that how do you do debate how do you prepare
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:34,336	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Just made them activity for hours and hours and hours

EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:37,920	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Arguably years are years and years
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:39,712	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And not ever think about
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:42,016	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Why you debate the way that you
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:44,576	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	That was what we were press

EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:54,208	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:57,280	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Basically I want to hear about this
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:23:00,096	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I kid you know did something
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:02,144	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	It just means you lean back and say
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:03,424	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Wow
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:03,936	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	How did they do
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:06,240	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Maybe it was the moment that I
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:09,312	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Kids started reading back
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:10,080	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	To you
EDL	00:23:10,080	00:23:12,384	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:13,920	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:19,808	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:21,088	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	In the margin of the geometry
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:23,392	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	We're interested in the
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:24,928	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Epic moments where
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:26,464	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	A kid does something
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:27,232	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Super smart
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:29,024	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	But it doesn't have anything to do with it
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:30,816	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	If you have a story

EDL	00:23:54,880	00:24:01,280	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Hey I'm Jenna Cam'ron I'm Robert krulwich Radiolab and it's back to our story again from producer Abigail keil
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:02,304	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Which is story about
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:04,608	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	A guy named Ryan wash and about
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:05,376	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Debate
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:06,656	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	How we debate
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:07,936	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Yeah so
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:09,216	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Just to kind of like
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:11,520	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Pull back from that moment with Masha and the
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:12,288	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Katrina all that
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:14,848	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	This kind of thing wasn't just happening in a back
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:16,896	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Like it actually
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:23,296	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Came from all kinds of different places all at once and one particular interesting person
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:24,320	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	He was influencing it was
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:25,856	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	George Soros
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:34,304	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Soros Soros was fascinated by the bait that's Dr schnierow Reid Brinkley
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:36,352	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	She's a scholar and a big figure in the so-called black tube
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:43,520	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Soros thought that debate was one of those kinds of activities that was incredibly
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:45,312	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Important to the production of democracy
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:47,872	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	So he started funding debate programs over
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:51,200	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Four Seasons a place is like Eastern Europe and here in the US keyboard
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:52,480	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Pundmann
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:54,528	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Like millions and millions and millions of dollars
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:56,832	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	To start urban debate
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:57,856	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Program
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:25:02,976	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	First started with New York City 1997
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:09,376	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Literally you know went out to all these New York high schools talk to a bunch of Administrators and Soros Justice
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:10,656	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Pump money into
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:13,984	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	New York City to start an urban debate league
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:15,264	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Baltimore and 2
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:16,032	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Chicago
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:17,056	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Detroit weather
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:22,432	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	City of Newark 23 or 24 City
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:24,480	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	So
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:29,088	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	You know if you take a step back and look at it all suddenly really within just a few years
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:31,904	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	You have all of these new black debaters
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:36,768	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Would go through the exact same thing that Ryan went
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:43,680	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	At the regional level you can imagine get a bunch of African-American students a bunch of teachers who are supporting them in a very positive
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:44,960	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Environment they build relationship
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:48,032	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	In friendship and so debate Feels Like Home in the
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:50,592	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	That face. First National Tournament
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:51,104	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Culture shock
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:53,664	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Because there is a c
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:54,176	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Of white
EDL	00:25:55,456	00:25:57,248	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And according to dr. Reid Brinkley
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:26:00,064	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Influx of black Debaters into a
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:01,600	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Primarily white space
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:05,440	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Started to create some tension and pressure and
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:09,024	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Not all built up and eventually resulted in something called the Louisville
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:11,584	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Louisville project
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:13,376	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Started its goal was to increase
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:19,776	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I mean for participation.
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:24,640	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I know that there's a baseball bat associated with my
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:26,432	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Queso
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:27,968	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Early 2000s
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:30,784	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Down at the University of Louisville
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:33,344	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	There was a debate team or predominately african-american team
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:36,928	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And so they were having a hard time finding
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:38,208	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Traction
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:39,744	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	He says they were going to be
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:41,536	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Tournaments
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:47,936	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	You know no matter what they did if they try to accommodate the more traditional style there was always something that they did wrong
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:49,984	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The students would try to make argument
EDL	00:26:49,984	00:26:50,752	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	It's about race inside
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:52,032	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Topix
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:53,824	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	But usually it didn't work
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:54,592	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And so
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:27:01,504	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	At a certain point but they decided that they were done with that they were like no we are unwilling
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:05,344	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Going to play your game in the way that you have defined it should be
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:10,976	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	P-play Debaters what they would basically do is they would show up and they would force a conversation about race
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:15,072	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Basically saying like we're not going to talk about China or global trade
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:19,424	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Until we deal with this this is Louisville's famous pray they said
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:20,960	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	We can't change the state
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:22,496	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	But we can change
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:23,008	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The state of debate
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:29,664	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	So they can you end up developing this whole new methodology which is actually a throwback
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:30,688	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	To Aristotle
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:32,736	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And in his idea yeah you need
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:33,760	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Three things
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:37,600	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Ethos pathos and logos
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:42,464	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Books is like logic so you know getting research and
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:44,512	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Scholars and evidence and things like
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:51,168	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Pathos that's where emotion comes in so maybe a personal story or sharing something that will connect with.
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:53,472	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And then eat those
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:54,240	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Switch
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:58,848	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Pinned down you can think of it like as credibility or
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:27:59,616	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Is sort of like
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:02,176	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Speaking in tune with
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:04,224	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Like the spirit of your culture
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:08,064	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	That's where you get the introduction of the use of Hip Hop
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:14,720	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Spoken word

EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:29,568	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	What was the reaction when this first started
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:33,152	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	They would say things to Lewisville like you know this isn't

EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:43,136	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	That's right they would say things like hip-hop does not belong
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:46,208	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I'm here your argument style doesn't belong here
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:48,256	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Here in Dayton and I'm saying
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:51,072	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Do things in really nice ways you know what I mean but there

EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:58,496	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Would you have an objection to a Prohibition as a coach
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:28:59,520	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	If you sit like look for the next

EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:10,528	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And stay entirely in the brain
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:15,392	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I doubt that you would do that but I'm wondering why you wouldn't I wouldn't think that's
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:16,672	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Black
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:22,304	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Nothing is anti-black to everything BND gay and did you Auntie
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:25,120	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	It's right it's it's
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:26,400	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	It would be anti-black
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:32,032	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And the reason why that's important for me is because these students don't get to leave their Blackness at
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:32,544	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The door when they are
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:37,152	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Write fake and pretend that they're not black
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:39,968	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	But that does not mean that everybody else is going
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:42,016	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Pretend that they are not black
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:43,552	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Even when they speak
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:46,112	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	What arguments they made when they open their mouth
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:47,136	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Make an argument
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:48,416	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	People are paying a
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:49,696	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Attention to the fact that it is
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:51,232	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Coming out of a black body
EDL	00:29:51,232	00:29:52,000	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	They don't get this
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:53,536	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Speak without race being a factor
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:54,816	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Nobody gets too
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:56,352	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Without race
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:29:58,912	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	A factor in a nation where race is a factor
EDL	00:30:01,728	00:30:05,056	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	So he's 16 years old and he sees marshanda do the spoken word poetry
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:07,616	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	First read more about Louisville and he's just like
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:14,528	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Die dedicated mother a career to discussing the bay every debate every every single one and every single
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:16,576	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Fast forward
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:23,232	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	He graduates high school isn't sure he's going to go to college I was first generation college student so I really didn't know much about the process
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:24,256	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	But then
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:26,304	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Early August 2008
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:29,120	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Get the message from a debate coach at a small school in Kansas
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:30,912	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Just called Emporia State University
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:31,936	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Ben
EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:33,984	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	August 14th I was driving up to Emporia for
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:37,056	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Soap
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:43,456	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Brian gets there get paired up with a sophomore LaToya Williams green
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:47,040	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Start debating together and
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:48,832	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Over the course of a couple years
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:50,624	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Brain starts to get recognized
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:52,672	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	He's winning speaker Awards he's
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:54,976	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	You know making it into the ground hit tournament
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:55,488	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	But
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:58,560	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	It was an uphill battle
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:31:01,632	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	She says the rain kept bumping into a judge's who
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:04,448	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Weren't really into the whole three-tier approach
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:05,984	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Yes I lost it
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:06,752	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	A lot of debate
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:07,776	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	It's before I want any
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:12,640	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	At this point he has graduated and he's debating with a freshman on the team
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:14,688	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	He's halfway into his senior year when
EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:16,736	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I had therefore
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:17,760	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	His new debate partner
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:20,320	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Fontana School
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:23,648	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	At this point it was either find somebody to the Bay with or I'm going to be career with over
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:26,720	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And so what happened
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:33,120	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Is Ryan is also close to one of my best friend's who's one of my contemporaries Rashad
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:35,680	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Evans who was then a coach Chad West
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:36,448	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Connecticut University
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:37,984	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And
EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:39,520	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Basically Rashad hat
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:40,800	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	What is bombshell idea
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:42,592	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	One day they called Ryan up and they were like
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:46,176	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	What if you partnered up with this guy from Rutgers
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:47,200	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Elijah Smith
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:49,248	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And the reason particular which I thought this was
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:53,856	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Does a good idea first Elijah is with an astoundingly good debater he just had excellent
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:54,880	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The old and traditional
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:57,184	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	But the other reason was
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:31:58,976	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	That
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:32:01,280	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Both Ryan and Elijah were queer black man
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:06,400	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The thinking was that you got two guys kind of standing at the intersection of
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:07,936	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Tulak marginalized
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:14,336	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And if they're going to try to make an argument about feeling excluded and invisible in the debate World well
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:16,128	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	They can own that argument
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:18,176	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Better than almost anyone
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:18,944	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	So
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:19,968	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I called him
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:22,272	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	When I'd it was 9:30
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:25,856	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Do you want to come to bed with me this is a lot
EDL	00:32:26,368	00:32:29,952	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I can't really answer this right now and I was like I understand
EDL	00:32:29,952	00:32:34,816	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I'm asking you to come move to Kansas for a semester or what have you and Lee in Newark
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:35,584	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Newark New Jersey
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:42,496	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	He called me back the next morning and it was like 8 a.m. my time he was like I've already applied
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:46,848	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And so the next couple weeks he was down in Emporia
EDL	00:32:46,848	00:32:51,200	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Elijah not debated for tournaments together first tournament matches
EDL	00:32:51,968	00:32:52,736	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Lost four
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:57,600	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I was very upset I was heartbroken because I was a senior and I was like I don't really do to 4
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:33:04,000	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	But it's fine you know it's okay and dr. Reid Brinkley was actually at that tournament and she said that
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:07,328	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Ryan and Elijah debate was a hot mess
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:10,144	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	They just didn't have any chemistry there was nothing
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:11,680	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Persuasive about a nothing
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:14,496	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Popped about it no I didn't really speak to the judges
EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:18,848	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	She remembers a time when Ryan came over to her apartment to talk to her and
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:21,664	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And he was just like you know I don't know what we're doing wrong
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:27,552	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	You know he hit you know he just didn't know why things weren't clicking what's not working I don't know what happen
EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:31,648	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The three of them were all talking and Rashad
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:33,696	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Ryan really looks up to Rashad because
EDL	00:33:33,696	00:33:35,744	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Rashad is also a queer black guy but
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:42,144	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	He's also like a really really great debater and it was Rashad who said you're not being a
EDL	00:33:42,144	00:33:42,656	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The queer black man
EDL	00:33:43,168	00:33:44,192	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Right you're being a debater
EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:51,104	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And so Richard would say things like you need to push it out you know what I mean you need to you know
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:56,992	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Sometimes sometimes you need to duck walk on them you know I mean sometimes you're going to have to do you know if he's playing
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:33:59,296	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Be black you always be black and
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:02,624	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	We're in the spaces so rather than attempting to
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:04,416	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	High parts of yourself
EDL	00:34:04,416	00:34:06,464	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Instead you should be fully you
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:10,048	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Ryan with this and his head went back to Elijah
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:11,072	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And within a few weeks
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:19,008	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Things started to click who are just like here is what our roles are this is what you do
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:25,152	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	This is what I do I would start the debate
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:40,512	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Expected rain in the choir if you will
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:46,912	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Elijah who did the middle speech
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:53,312	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Logic counter-arguments things like that he was better at the game of
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:59,712	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Brian said they went from practicing ethos pathos logos to being it
EDL	00:34:59,712	00:35:06,112	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Methodology
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:12,512	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	MN
EDL	00:35:12,512	00:35:18,912	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	In their second tournament they made it to the finals and they lost in a close decision but
EDL	00:35:18,912	00:35:22,240	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The third tournament was actually a national tournament called Cita
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:24,032	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Cross examination debate Association
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:25,056	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	It's kind of
EDL	00:35:25,056	00:35:27,616	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Call Beth people's tournament
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:29,664	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I was able to give her pretty good
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:31,456	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	2ar and we ended up squeaking little
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:34,272	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And then there 4th tournament
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:36,064	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Their final tournament together
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:37,344	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	But actually
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:39,392	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	That's the whole reason we're telling the story
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:41,952	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	NDT National debate tournament
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:44,512	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	That would be tournament
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:50,912	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	My decision not to go for the NDP is this marathon of a debate tournament
EDL	00:35:50,912	00:35:57,312	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	It's like you know March Madness or something if held every year it's last for
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:59,616	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	4 whole days and stairs
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:00,640	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	13 Rounds of debate

EDL	00:36:02,176	00:36:03,968	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Fancy NDT is where
EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:07,552	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Harvard is
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:08,576	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Northwestern

EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:11,296	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Oklahoma who they beat and that
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:15,136	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Put them into
EDL	00:37:15,136	00:37:15,648	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The finals
EDL	00:37:16,416	00:37:17,184	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	It was
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:19,488	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I can't everything's very surreal to me
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:21,792	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	We're in the finals of the NDT
EDL	00:37:22,560	00:37:24,608	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Never happened before
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:26,912	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	We're also
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:32,288	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Potentially about to unite the crowns and what that means is Wednesday than the NDT no team in history had ever done that
EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:34,336	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	It and who were they up against
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:37,920	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Well they were going against a team that Ryan had already faced
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:39,200	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Like twice that year
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:44,576	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	14 time National debate champions
EDL	00:37:45,344	00:37:46,880	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Northwestern University

EDL	00:37:52,768	00:37:55,328	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	One of the things that we've described it as is
EDL	00:37:55,328	00:37:56,352	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The Clash of civilizations
EDL	00:37:59,168	00:38:03,264	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	She says that about Northwestern because they have one of the biggest debate programs in the country
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:07,104	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	They've got an entire hive mind you know with a
EDL	00:38:07,104	00:38:10,688	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Hotel war room for them to strategize in
EDL	00:38:11,200	00:38:11,968	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And then
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:15,552	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	It was us this
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:17,088	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	To queer black guys

EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:25,024	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	School with not a lot of resources so it is like a David David
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:25,536	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Goliath

EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:29,184	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And it's taught me more than I could ever dream
EDL	00:40:30,720	00:40:31,744	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Forgot
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:35,072	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	To all of you every part of this community
EDL	00:40:35,584	00:40:36,864	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	In particular
EDL	00:40:37,376	00:40:38,656	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Special people in my life
EDL	00:40:39,936	00:40:40,704	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Wow
EDL	00:40:40,704	00:40:41,728	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	It was able to lie
EDL	00:40:43,264	00:40:49,408	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	So the topic for the year was whether or not the United States federal government should
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:56,320	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Increase incentives for certain forms of alternative energy sources nuclear power solar power wind or
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:40:59,392	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Reduce restrictions on other forms of alternative energy
EDL	00:40:59,392	00:41:01,440	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Is coal natural gas and oil
EDL	00:41:01,952	00:41:05,024	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Okay so Ryan and Elijah where affirmative
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:07,584	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	So they were supposed to argue like
EDL	00:41:07,584	00:41:10,400	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Something positive about the how the US government should
EDL	00:41:10,400	00:41:12,448	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Solar energy production or
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:14,752	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Strict coal usage in energy or whatever
EDL	00:41:16,032	00:41:17,056	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	They're not going to debate
EDL	00:41:17,056	00:41:17,824	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	That we had
EDL	00:41:17,824	00:41:20,128	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Figured out that we want to talk about the idea of
EDL	00:41:21,152	00:41:22,176	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	In other words
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:24,736	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Energy isn't the most important conversation that we need
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:25,248	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Need to have
EDL	00:41:25,760	00:41:29,088	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The conversation we need to have is whether this community
EDL	00:41:29,088	00:41:30,880	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Can include people like Ryan
EDL	00:41:31,392	00:41:33,952	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Like Elijah can we find home in Dubai
EDL	00:41:33,952	00:41:38,560	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	That's how the community feels about itself that this is a home place for a lot of heat
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:45,472	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Right there people who grew up in the bay people who started dating when they were 12 and 13 went all the way through college
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:47,520	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	To the people that you often developed
EDL	00:41:47,520	00:41:49,568	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The tightest friendships with people that
EDL	00:41:49,568	00:41:55,967	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	You know how some of your coolest memory is cuz you all spent the summer together going to the Bay camp those people makeup
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:42:00,063	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Your family there are people who make friends in debate when they're 13 that they
EDL	00:42:00,063	00:42:00,831	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Keep until they die
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:07,743	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	So rise up first and to make his argument about home
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:13,631	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	He starts talking about a movie
EDL	00:42:14,655	00:42:15,935	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Have you all seen The Wiz
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:16,703	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I have
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:17,983	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I have not okay
EDL	00:42:19,007	00:42:19,519	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	So
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:22,335	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	All right real quick synopsis 19
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:23,359	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	78 film
EDL	00:42:23,359	00:42:24,127	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And what
EDL	00:42:24,639	00:42:30,271	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	It is just like an all black cast version of The Wizard of Oz so like Michael Jackson
EDL	00:42:30,271	00:42:31,551	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The Scarecrow Richard
EDL	00:42:31,551	00:42:32,831	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Pryor as the Wiz
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:33,855	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And Diana Ross
EDL	00:42:34,623	00:42:37,183	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	It was that movie was just like
EDL	00:42:37,183	00:42:43,583	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	To me you know it was the fear that Dorothy felt that the beginning of arrival
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:44,095	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Going to Oz
EDL	00:42:49,727	00:42:53,311	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	An appointment is making is that like that's how he felt to
EDL	00:42:53,311	00:42:56,895	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	When he came into the babe when he was walking into that cafeteria
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:42:59,199	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And there's a line where you say
EDL	00:43:01,503	00:43:07,903	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	When the Dorothy's of this world think of energy they don't think of thorium reactors but the energy required to get out of bed and navigate
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:08,671	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The struggle
EDL	00:43:08,671	00:43:09,951	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Yeah so that's like kind of
EDL	00:43:10,463	00:43:12,767	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	How is that how you were like tying it
EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:16,095	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Energy for US Mint what it meant to get out of bed in the morning
EDL	00:43:16,095	00:43:18,911	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	What it meant to thrive in the world and what you were never meant
EDL	00:43:19,423	00:43:19,935	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Survive
EDL	00:43:20,447	00:43:23,007	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And for Dorothy was able to reach a place of
EDL	00:43:24,543	00:43:30,687	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Is there a way for me to get home where you realize that all you ever needed in the first place was yourself
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:31,199	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Home
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:32,479	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Sidemen
EDL	00:43:32,991	00:43:34,015	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And that you have
EDL	00:43:34,015	00:43:35,295	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The power all along
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:38,367	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And that's part of what our argument was and I was part of what I was
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:40,671	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Trying to say was that I had been in debate
EDL	00:43:40,671	00:43:41,695	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	For eight years that that
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:47,071	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And I was so sick and tired of people telling me that what I had to say about the bathing what I thought of

EDL	00:43:51,423	00:43:56,799	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	That I have just as much to say about this topic as you do and your claims are not any more valid than mine and my person
EDL	00:43:57,567	00:44:00,895	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Bryan ended his like eight and a half minute speech

EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:07,551	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	All together

EDL	00:44:30,335	00:44:32,127	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And then after a few minutes
EDL	00:44:32,127	00:44:36,223	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Argent the sophomore from Northwestern I got up and I gave the first
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:42,623	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Negative speech
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:49,023	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Documents the one that they had beat us with every time called topicality which basically says the topic has
EDL	00:44:49,023	00:44:50,047	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Posited a question
EDL	00:44:50,047	00:44:52,607	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Should the US government alter its
EDL	00:44:52,607	00:44:53,887	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Approach to energy policy
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:59,519	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And we think that the affirmative should have to answer that
EDL	00:45:00,031	00:45:04,895	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	First of all I don't think the resolution is a question second of all like know where the roles has it's a
EDL	00:45:04,895	00:45:07,455	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	That you have to be topical butt
EDL	00:45:07,967	00:45:14,367	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Our position was debate should be theoretically Fair both sides should be able to win
EDL	00:45:14,367	00:45:15,903	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Argue that racism is bad
EDL	00:45:15,903	00:45:16,927	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Ebates
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:23,327	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Like we can't argue against that I'm not going to say Debaters in the home for me I love it
EDL	00:45:23,327	00:45:27,679	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Who is the baker for now who's debate inclusive
EDL	00:45:27,679	00:45:34,079	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	For now is it actually fair if an order to win a debate you need to have like a whole research team and debate
EDL	00:45:34,079	00:45:36,639	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Great camps that cost thousands of dollars to put
EDL	00:45:36,639	00:45:43,039	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Participate in a topic that's democratically voted upon by all the schools of the beginning
EDL	00:45:43,039	00:45:46,623	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Something about the topic should be mentioned just to give the negative
EDL	00:45:47,647	00:45:48,671	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Basically
EDL	00:45:48,671	00:45:49,183	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	SPAC
EDL	00:45:51,999	00:45:53,535	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Respect for the
EDL	00:45:53,535	00:45:58,399	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Thousands of hours that my partner and I in the Northwestern debate team and other people in debate
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:46:01,727	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I've spent researching energy and being prepared to talk about
EDL	00:46:01,727	00:46:04,543	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The intricacies of energy policy in the United States
EDL	00:46:04,543	00:46:06,079	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	This went on for over an hour
EDL	00:46:06,079	00:46:07,615	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	It was it was a lot
EDL	00:46:08,127	00:46:12,735	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Eventually Arjun and Peyton are like Focus their argument on
EDL	00:46:13,247	00:46:14,271	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Their version of
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:16,575	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The traditional version
EDL	00:46:16,575	00:46:18,111	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	This is how you actually changed
EDL	00:46:18,623	00:46:25,023	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Not by focusing on yourself but doing research is being able to argue the affirmative side of something and
EDL	00:46:25,023	00:46:28,351	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The negative side of it because people who learn those kinds of skills
EDL	00:46:28,351	00:46:29,631	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	They can actually go and do things
EDL	00:46:30,143	00:46:30,655	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Outside of the
EDL	00:46:31,167	00:46:33,215	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Like dealing convoluted globalize training
EDL	00:46:33,983	00:46:35,007	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Spell global warming
EDL	00:46:36,031	00:46:36,799	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	So after
EDL	00:46:37,311	00:46:39,359	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	2 hours of this it's almost midnight
EDL	00:46:39,871	00:46:40,895	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Feels
EDL	00:46:41,407	00:46:41,919	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Exhausted
EDL	00:46:43,199	00:46:43,967	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Yeah
EDL	00:46:43,967	00:46:47,039	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	But I felt it in the room that people were like we're not out of the debate
EDL	00:46:48,063	00:46:48,575	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	You can still win
EDL	00:46:49,087	00:46:51,135	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	At this point there's only one species left
EDL	00:46:51,135	00:46:52,159	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And it's Ryan
EDL	00:46:52,159	00:46:58,303	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I was nervous I knew it was my last speech I knew everybody in the audience was waiting on me but I like I just felt pressure
EDL	00:46:58,815	00:47:00,863	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And I had maybe
EDL	00:47:00,863	00:47:03,935	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Five sentences written on a piece of Yunnan
EDL	00:47:03,935	00:47:06,239	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Copy paper
EDL	00:47:07,007	00:47:07,519	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Like whoa
EDL	00:47:08,799	00:47:09,823	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	That's all I got
EDL	00:47:11,615	00:47:14,431	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The audio quality of the speech is kind of terrible but
EDL	00:47:14,943	00:47:16,223	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	We're just going to let it play
EDL	00:47:26,207	00:47:32,351	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Really answer this argument
EDL	00:47:51,807	00:47:57,951	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And change our relationship to the world
EDL	00:48:01,791	00:48:05,887	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Ryan says early on that piece of paper he was holding through it
EDL	00:48:07,935	00:48:08,959	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Start speaking for my phone
EDL	00:48:09,471	00:48:11,007	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Where what I will call the Sean.
EDL	00:48:11,775	00:48:15,615	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Shantae the Sunday at the place that encapsulates your soul
EDL	00:48:15,615	00:48:16,383	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	In your loins
EDL	00:48:17,151	00:48:23,295	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Well alright
EDL	00:48:30,719	00:48:36,863	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Wendy Williams
EDL	00:48:49,919	00:48:56,063	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Diana Ross and Michael Jackson
EDL	00:49:18,079	00:49:24,223	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Especially when they don't have another place to go
EDL	00:50:00,063	00:50:04,159	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	There was portions of the speech that I don't remember giving
EDL	00:50:05,695	00:50:08,767	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I was just like oh apparently I said there was a part where I must have
EDL	00:50:08,767	00:50:09,279	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Shirt off
EDL	00:50:09,791	00:50:12,095	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Shirt off
EDL	00:50:12,607	00:50:13,887	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Like I don't remember that
EDL	00:50:15,167	00:50:15,935	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Can I have
EDL	00:50:15,935	00:50:20,543	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Pause cuz what I was I was trying to just get out of that so I mean come back
EDL	00:50:20,543	00:50:22,335	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	It's a kind of life provide a voice of
EDL	00:50:22,335	00:50:28,735	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	But as I kind of slow down to do that but
EDL	00:50:28,735	00:50:35,135	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	50 seconds left
EDL	00:50:35,135	00:50:40,255	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I still have to answer this last thing I still have to extend a piece of evidence ocean I didn't say anything about warming
EDL	00:50:41,023	00:50:46,655	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	What do I do what do I do what do I do if I just look like this is reason enough to vote affirmative
EDL	00:50:46,655	00:50:47,167	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Forget it
EDL	00:50:51,007	00:50:56,895	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	MN
EDL	00:50:56,895	00:50:59,199	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I walked over and shook their hands
EDL	00:50:59,967	00:51:02,271	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I gave Elijah a hug and then I walked
EDL	00:51:02,271	00:51:03,039	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Got the room and went into
EDL	00:51:09,183	00:51:11,231	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	At that point is a judge I took a deep breath
EDL	00:51:11,743	00:51:14,559	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I packed up my notes
EDL	00:51:14,559	00:51:20,959	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I put headphones noise-canceling headphones on my head I found a room where there was no one else
EDL	00:51:20,959	00:51:22,495	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Surrounded I could have total quiet
EDL	00:51:23,519	00:51:24,799	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Think about what had been said
EDL	00:51:25,823	00:51:28,127	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Scott says that he felt like the debates
EDL	00:51:28,127	00:51:28,639	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	What's close
EDL	00:51:29,407	00:51:31,455	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Is going to be a tightrope so
EDL	00:51:31,455	00:51:32,991	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I sit down and look at my notes
EDL	00:51:32,991	00:51:35,551	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Irie listen to the last couple speeches that I had
EDL	00:51:35,551	00:51:36,575	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Recorded several times
EDL	00:51:37,855	00:51:39,647	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Wenwen Han Northwestern
EDL	00:51:39,647	00:51:41,183	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Presented a lot of good research
EDL	00:51:41,183	00:51:42,463	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And a lot of it he agreed with
EDL	00:51:43,231	00:51:44,511	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	On the other hand like
EDL	00:51:45,023	00:51:47,327	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Eleanor Jenner saying if you have these
EDL	00:51:47,327	00:51:49,887	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Skills and you're going to be better prepared to go tok
EDL	00:51:49,887	00:51:50,655	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	In front of
EDL	00:51:51,167	00:51:51,935	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Congress or something
EDL	00:51:52,447	00:51:58,847	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	But Scott says if you just listen to like Ryan and Elijah like they sound more persuasive
EDL	00:51:58,847	00:52:03,455	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Like you can't convince me that somebody who sounds like that isn't actually also prepared to do those
EDL	00:52:03,967	00:52:04,479	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And Toad like
EDL	00:52:04,991	00:52:07,295	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Ryan Elijah School presentation
EDL	00:52:07,295	00:52:09,855	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Is actually proof that Peyton and Argent argument
EDL	00:52:09,855	00:52:10,879	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Is invalid
EDL	00:52:12,671	00:52:14,207	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Are the same time he thought
EDL	00:52:16,255	00:52:18,559	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	There have to be things that we all
EDL	00:52:18,559	00:52:20,607	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Just agree on as our starting point
EDL	00:52:21,375	00:52:27,263	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And if the alternative is a world in which the affirmative can come into a debate and talk about anything they want to talk about
EDL	00:52:27,263	00:52:31,871	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Then the ability to make that a fair competitive environment seems a little problematic
EDL	00:52:32,383	00:52:33,407	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I think Scott
EDL	00:52:34,943	00:52:39,295	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Was kind of torn took me about 45 minutes to an hour to decide
EDL	00:52:41,087	00:52:42,367	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Do I thought won the debate
EDL	00:52:43,647	00:52:46,207	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Ryan says that when he was sitting there waiting for them
EDL	00:52:46,207	00:52:48,255	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Decision to be announced
EDL	00:52:48,255	00:52:48,767	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	That we lost
EDL	00:52:49,279	00:52:52,351	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And eventually decision
EDL	00:52:53,119	00:52:56,959	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Three judges voted for Emporia into for Northwestern
EDL	00:52:57,471	00:52:57,983	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Emporia
EDL	00:53:05,151	00:53:11,551	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	My partner Elijah jumped out
EDL	00:53:11,551	00:53:13,855	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	If you could have seen this room
EDL	00:53:14,367	00:53:17,439	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Erupt into Joy I was in tears
EDL	00:53:18,463	00:53:24,863	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Watching this historic moment happened because I've been around for so long and I've watched so many black Debaters failed
EDL	00:53:24,863	00:53:25,631	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	How to make it to
EDL	00:53:26,143	00:53:27,423	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	That pop point
EDL	00:53:27,423	00:53:28,703	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I stood there and I was like oh my God
EDL	00:53:32,543	00:53:35,359	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	All I can say I said it like a million I was like oh my God
EDL	00:53:39,967	00:53:42,271	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	What sweets got in the end
EDL	00:53:42,271	00:53:47,391	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	He actually published like 11 page essay all about you know his decision explaining why he voted the way he did
EDL	00:53:47,903	00:53:49,695	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	There's a lot in there but
EDL	00:53:49,695	00:53:51,743	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	What are you trying to take away from it is bad
EDL	00:53:52,255	00:53:53,535	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	In a while
EDL	00:53:53,535	00:53:55,583	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Well maybe he didn't like that
EDL	00:53:55,583	00:53:56,095	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	There was a
EDL	00:53:56,607	00:53:58,143	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	So disregard for the topic
EDL	00:53:58,655	00:54:00,447	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	He would have liked it a whole lot less
EDL	00:54:00,447	00:54:02,239	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	If Ryan and Elijah hadn't been in the room
EDL	00:54:02,751	00:54:03,263	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	I mean
EDL	00:54:04,031	00:54:09,151	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Debate is itself is incredibly important to me debate has been the greatest
EDL	00:54:10,431	00:54:11,455	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Influence
EDL	00:54:11,455	00:54:14,271	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	In shaping who I am as a person
EDL	00:54:14,783	00:54:17,087	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And so in many ways I view
EDL	00:54:18,111	00:54:19,903	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	Debate as my home
EDL	00:54:19,903	00:54:20,671	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	And given that
EDL	00:54:20,671	00:54:21,695	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	It was a debate
EDL	00:54:21,695	00:54:23,743	| radiolab_podcast16debatable |	The challenged and criticized
