EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:42,208	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Voting Indian should be denied a
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:47,328	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Place to vote at a convenient location. It's a it's a kind of
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:53,216	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Beautifully Noble idea why do you waste money
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:58,080	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Because I believe that every single workout
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,104	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	But

EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:37,471	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	You conveniently omit the fact that there were three Revolutions in the prior 80 years
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:41,567	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	One vote gave rutherford Hayes the presidency
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:47,199	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	So this is true ish disputed election so it went to the special committee

EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,775	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Still lost by one vote
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:57,055	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Why is weird
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:59,615	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Then he called up a second time
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:03,967	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Requesting for the recirculating the totals from the machine
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:06,015	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Meaning recounting all the electronic

EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:21,887	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Now that is
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:27,263	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Brutal that is brutal to lose by 1 but it actually get to even more brutal and
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:28,287	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Personal because
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:30,847	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	People started talking about his wife
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:32,895	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Biblia
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:34,431	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Rumors went
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:35,455	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	On the day of the election
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:37,247	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	His wife had gone to a temple
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:37,759	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	To pray for
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:40,063	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	And because she was praying at the

EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:45,951	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	She didn't vote
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:48,511	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	That's
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:49,279	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	What's the difference
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:50,047	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	That's a difference
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:53,119	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	He looks at his wife he can look as I say you didn't

EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:14,879	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	The most important Temple is the police station
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:17,183	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	The most important Temple
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:17,951	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Is the polling
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:25,119	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	But this is CP Joshi I am the person who lost by one vote
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:25,887	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Columns
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:27,935	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	To check this one. Because of

EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:52,159	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Shortly after the election
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:58,303	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Some of Joshi supporters started coming to him and saying
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:01,375	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Yeah and pretty quick and videography
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:04,191	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	They had proof that one particular woman had voted

EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,199	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Actually took
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:50,015	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	4 years for them to figure all of this
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:50,783	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	The stuff out
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:52,063	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	And the term
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:55,647	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	That they were being liked is a five-year term
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:16:00,767	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	So then what happened did they did they let him serve out his term or did they
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:04,095	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Let it be like this that said because you destroyed me that's expiring
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:08,191	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	If it was me I think I would be so bitter

EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:19,455	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Sexy was not able to talk to us
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:22,015	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Being beaten by that
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,039	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Guy Joshi

EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:27,647	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Because
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:29,183	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	6 months after his loss
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:30,719	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	There was a special election
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:31,999	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Not the
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:35,071	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Street-level in Rodger time but the federal Universal like Indian level
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:36,607	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	So he ran for this election
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:39,679	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	And not only did he win
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:41,471	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	But eventually he got tapped
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:43,775	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Tubete minister of railways
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:46,591	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Which in India that's a big deal.
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:48,127	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Destiny I decided

EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:01,567	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Explain I should back up a little bit
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:05,151	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	In 2009 Alan had just finished up grad school he was living in Dallas
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:06,687	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	With his parents
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:07,455	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Yep
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:13,343	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Yep then one day I was actually on my way back from a ski trip
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:16,928	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	And I get a call from the man I know
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:18,976	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	You know he said he was looking for
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:21,024	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Somebody that needed
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:25,120	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Change in their housing situation and had an opportunity to discuss
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:27,168	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	And so
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:28,192	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	I called him back
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:31,264	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	And he said I've got this Thousand Acre Ranch up north of Dallas
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:32,800	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	What's the time trying to develop
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:34,080	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Nothing up there right now.
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:35,360	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Cows in field but
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:38,176	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	I need someone to live up there for awhile in a mobile home
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:39,968	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	And if you do it
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:40,992	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	I'll make it worth your while
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:47,392	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	So for $150 a month I got a three-bedroom trailer with the kitchen in the living room
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:49,952	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Room and bedroom and office and all that
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:55,840	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	You got his utilities paid for free internet and put in that satellite dish so I can get high speed in a
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:57,120	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	And he's like
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:21:59,168	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Yeah I'll do it handshake deal
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:00,192	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	And
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:04,800	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	The next thing I know you know he's ordering a trailer and I'm changing my residence
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:08,128	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Can you describe what it looks like it here
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:09,920	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	We got fields
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:11,456	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	As far as the eye can see
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:14,528	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Ripley at Allen give reporter Stephanie kwolek with tour of the ranch
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:18,112	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	And for those cowpatty honestly it was refreshing
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:19,648	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	To do
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:20,416	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Campfire
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:23,488	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Man gets hot I would go for a dip in the
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:24,512	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	The watering hole
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:28,352	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	If I didn't want to see another human being I could go
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:29,632	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Days or weeks
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:35,008	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Without seeing another human beings probably in the biggest piece of shape and got
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:39,616	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	So if he's getting all these
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:40,128	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Goody's
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:47,040	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	What's his buddy to developer getting in return well well it is basically required me living
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:50,368	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Up here as the only legal resident
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:52,672	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	In other words the only eligible voters
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:53,696	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Voting
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:56,768	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	What you going to vote for
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:57,536	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	So
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:01,632	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Allen's buddy and his crew they want to put houses on this
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:05,472	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	The first they have to put in a bunch of utilities you know
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:09,824	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Streets and sewers all things that normally taxpayers
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:14,432	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Of course these guys are private businessman not a government that can Levy taxes
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:16,224	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	But according to
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:20,064	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	It's law property owners and residents can get together hold an election
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:22,112	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	And decide to create a
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:23,392	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Special district
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:25,952	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	It's like a tiny little government that can love you
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:29,024	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Which would be ideal for these Developers
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:32,608	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Is then they could just get a loan to build the streets and stuff
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:35,168	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	I didn't pay the loan back through that tack
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:36,704	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Problem is
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:43,872	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	There aren't any residents on this land there's no one to vote this whole deal into existence
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:44,384	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	In the first place
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:45,920	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	And that
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:47,200	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Is where Allen
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:54,880	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Once he's living on this land
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:57,440	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	And pay the tax
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:00,000	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	So they told him
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:03,584	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	You can live up your cheap with all utilities and internet paid for
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:05,888	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	You just have to vote in this
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:10,496	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Election didn't push me in any One Direction but it was
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:16,896	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Clear one if there's one issue on the ballot there's a reason that one issues on the ballot and
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:23,296	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Woman named Angela comes in she brings me my voting booth which is basically a little table it says like a
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:27,136	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Folding table along with an electronic voting machine and a whole list
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:34,048	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	You have to open pause and 7 a.m. you have to close you have to be the election judge have to sign this things like that
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:38,912	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Does that mean that this guy is going to be the motor in the election was going to run the election
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:39,424	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Can you go vote
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:42,496	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Manage his own vote
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:48,896	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Exactly had to be aware of the perimeter and cuz if if somebody could come up with a
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:55,296	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Political poster or something and tried to put that up within a hundred feet of the polling location I would have had to ask them
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:25:01,696	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Stop

EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:06,816	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	I wouldn't want my kitty cats to know how I voted on that election
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:18,848	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Get Arena and Lucius then Valley question because they were I was the election judge but they were my

EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:03,296	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Will a severe back

EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:18,400	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Paramount and if I remember correctly I want to say it was
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:20,960	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	340 million dollars
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:25,312	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	240 it was something like that
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:30,944	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	371270000
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:34,272	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Which means that the future resident
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:35,040	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	It's of this
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:35,552	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Property

EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:42,208	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Is this
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:45,536	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Practice at this point there are
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:47,840	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Right now at the moment I just got this email from the
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:49,888	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	The government there are
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:55,008	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	1237 of these types of Utility District
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:57,056	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	To cross Texas right now they cover
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:58,336	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	2.9
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:27:59,872	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Million Acres
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:00,640	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	So that's basically
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:07,552	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	To Delaware's and according to the Houston Chronicle you've got two million Texans right now
EDL	00:28:07,552	00:28:08,320	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Living
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:09,600	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	It is kind of utility
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:11,904	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	How much money has been raised
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:13,952	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Jamaica's government
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:18,560	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Ballpark figure again from Houston Chronicle okay outstanding debt
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:19,840	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Of these types of utilities disk
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:21,376	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	60
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:22,400	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Billion dollar
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:25,472	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	60 billion billion dollars
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:27,264	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	60 B billion
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:28,032	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	This feels
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:30,080	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Wrong to me
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:31,360	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Like these
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:31,872	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Taxes
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:34,432	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	What created by individuals
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:36,224	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Who squatted on property
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:37,760	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	For a while and mostly laugh
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:38,784	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Didn't have to pay the
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:42,624	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	It just feels a little unfair to
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:46,720	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	To me anyway for the people who will live there when they will pay the
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:47,744	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	The taxes and never go
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:48,512	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Got to vote
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:52,608	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	If somebody you know lives in their $300,000 house
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:58,240	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	And every year that they have to pay $3,000 in tax
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:29:01,312	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	That they wouldn't have if I had not
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:03,360	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Voted the way that I did
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:06,432	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Would they resent that
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:07,200	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Maybe
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:08,480	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	But
EDL	00:29:08,480	00:29:12,832	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	People complain about about paying their taxes
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:17,440	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	And yet they get in the car and they drive on the road that's supported by federal tax
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:19,488	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Dollars
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:20,768	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Dysuria
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:23,584	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	This is Republican state senator Jane Nelson
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:26,144	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	And she argued that these
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:30,240	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Fish and chips but way too much power in the hands of a single voter
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:32,544	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	When she brought the committee a bill
EDL	00:29:32,544	00:29:33,312	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	That would fix
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:34,592	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	The problem
EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:35,616	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Is required minimum
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:36,640	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	40 Motors
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:40,224	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Basically she said these election should require no fewer
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:41,248	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	10:45
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:44,064	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Which would help ensure the actual residence
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:45,600	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Community wild horses
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:56,096	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	But at least for now the state legislators in Texas have decided
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:29:57,632	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	They're all you need to pass
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:29:59,680	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	The tax of this kind is one vote
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:09,920	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	That's the story
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:13,760	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Wework coming to celebrate
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:19,648	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	One vote matters in a glorious wave the flag sort of like
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:20,672	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Not enough
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:22,720	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Fraud in India and
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:26,048	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	And taxation without representation what I wanted
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:32,960	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	You wanted some yay or something okay I have one I have one more I have one final score

EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:28,832	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	So not only
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:30,112	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Does Apple 18th Amendment
EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:31,648	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Spell

EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:39,072	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	It's specifically
EDL	00:33:40,864	00:33:43,168	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	It's real right we're starting back at
EDL	00:33:43,168	00:33:44,704	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Square one so
EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:50,848	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	At that point some women are like God damn it like all right we're just going to go vote and so for instance

EDL	00:33:58,016	00:34:01,856	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	What are we going to do I can't wait to do it.
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:03,904	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Is it raining right now
EDL	00:34:04,416	00:34:09,536	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Ladies it's so cute that you thought you were included in the Cubs

EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:18,496	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	And then in 1878 Susan B Anthony proposed another amend
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:24,896	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Address for the right to vote people laughed about it and then put it aside for the next 40 years
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:25,920	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Has no movement
EDL	00:34:25,920	00:34:28,224	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	At all on this amendment
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:29,760	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	June 4th 1990
EDL	00:34:30,272	00:34:31,552	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Just after World War 1
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:32,320	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	After centuries of
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:33,600	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Suffering suffrage
EDL	00:34:33,600	00:34:38,464	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Both houses of Congress finally passed the 19th Amendment
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:40,000	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	To give women the right to vote
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:43,840	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Amendment came after months of women protesting
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:48,960	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Outside the White House and years of working jobs that before the war it only ever belong to men
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:49,728	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	But
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:51,776	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Force it also came with a constitutional
EDL	00:34:51,776	00:34:54,336	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Catch it had to go to the state
EDL	00:34:54,336	00:34:55,872	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	To be ratified
EDL	00:34:55,872	00:34:58,432	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Was just means that each state had to vote to approve it
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:35:04,064	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Three-fourths of the state legislatures have to ratify the amendment
EDL	00:35:04,064	00:35:08,672	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Well 36 in this particular instance had to vote for it
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:14,560	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Now they got Wisconsin Illinois Michigan and then after that it's just like dominoes
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:17,888	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Then we got to 35 States
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:19,168	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	And
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:19,936	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Stopped
EDL	00:35:19,936	00:35:20,704	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	It just got
EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:22,240	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Stuck at 35
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:26,592	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Knowing that the suffragists were only one vote shy
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:27,616	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	The anti-suffragist
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:29,152	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Beefed up their camp
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:30,688	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	At which made it
EDL	00:35:30,688	00:35:32,992	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Harder and harder to get that final
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:34,528	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Allstate it was looking grim
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:36,064	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Until
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:37,600	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	There was a Wednesday
EDL	00:35:38,112	00:35:39,904	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Just one state that seemed
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:42,976	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Like it might be.
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:43,488	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Teetering

EDL	00:36:56,448	00:36:57,984	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	One goal
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:36:59,776	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Getting women the right to vote
EDL	00:36:59,776	00:37:04,896	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	So she's up she's the big Washington to Bigfoot from Washington is really much like

EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:15,648	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	And they are trying to convince as many Tennessee legislators as they possibly can
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:22,048	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	To come over there so it was all kind of high Jinks and you name it eavesdropping

EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:41,248	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Daniel's room where there was some Jack Daniels being dispensed
EDL	00:37:41,248	00:37:42,784	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	By the anti-suffrage people
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:46,112	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	And supposedly Pro suffrage legislators
EDL	00:37:46,112	00:37:50,208	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Could be heard through the hotel walls singing anti-suffrage song
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:55,840	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Tennessee is supposed to be dry
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:38:01,728	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	And yet the aunt has are flagrantly violating prohibition

EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:17,856	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	The closer and closer they got to the final day of voting it became apparent that paper
EDL	00:38:17,856	00:38:24,256	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	People who had come to town saying they were in favor of ratifying this amendment wearing yellow
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:27,072	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	LaRosa's started wearing red

EDL	00:38:45,504	00:38:48,320	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	That's exactly right way to stop you here for a second
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:52,928	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Sure is it now clear to everybody that if the legislature of Tennessee
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:57,536	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	They will become part of the US Constitution
EDL	00:38:57,536	00:39:03,680	| radiolab_podcast16onevote |	Absolutely absolutely you know you didn't have any cushion states that you could go to
