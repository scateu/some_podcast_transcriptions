EDL	00:00:30,976	00:00:34,304	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Aren't I guess I could admit this could be too many details but
EDL	00:00:34,816	00:00:36,352	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Story starts for us
EDL	00:00:36,352	00:00:38,400	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	With reporter David Conrad
EDL	00:00:38,400	00:00:42,752	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	So for me it was back in late 2014
EDL	00:00:42,752	00:00:45,056	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I was living in Philadelphia as a grad student
EDL	00:00:45,056	00:00:46,592	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	It's time David was
EDL	00:00:46,592	00:00:47,360	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Applying for jobs
EDL	00:00:47,872	00:00:53,504	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And one of the jobs he's applying for was at a radio show that was doing the series about International women's issues
EDL	00:00:54,016	00:00:56,832	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And so I had this on my mind and I was taking a bus
EDL	00:00:56,832	00:01:01,184	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Southern University and I just overheard somebody talking about their recent trip to Venice
EDL	00:01:02,464	00:01:03,488	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Of course
EDL	00:01:03,488	00:01:09,120	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	The classic tourist thing to do when you go to Venice is to take a ride on the canal boats the gondolas
EDL	00:01:09,632	00:01:12,960	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And go down the canal maybe someone sends you a famous song
EDL	00:01:15,264	00:01:16,544	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Very romantic
EDL	00:01:17,056	00:01:17,824	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	In case
EDL	00:01:18,592	00:01:21,664	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Person sitting on the bus next to David was telling their friend
EDL	00:01:21,664	00:01:23,200	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	That they had
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:25,248	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Taking a gondola ride with this
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:27,296	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	First ever woman Gondolier Venice
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:33,440	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Yeah it really cooking around me realize like how how does it become a we
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:39,584	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	How are you I'm Kristen Kristen Clark also a journalist radio producer
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:42,144	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And she and David are partners and collaborator
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:44,192	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I mean this is it was interesting is like
EDL	00:01:44,192	00:01:47,776	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	We realize how big a deal it is to be female Gondolier is like
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:53,664	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	900 year old tradition and it's always
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:02:00,064	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Father son father son father son or like uncle nephew down the line
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:04,672	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Now nobody's there no ladies Evernote 900 years
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:05,696	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Think about that for a sec
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:10,048	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Almost a thousand years of all men men men men men men and then one day
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:12,864	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	You get a woman write as a headline
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:13,888	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Woman breaks
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:17,472	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	To 900 year old glass ceiling I thought that sounds like a good pet
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:24,128	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	It sounds like God kissed you on the lips exactly it sounded it sounded like the perfect
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:30,528	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Empowerment story I guess it's all over
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:34,624	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	What from the Guardians of the New York Times to the financial times to the Cedar Rapids Gazette
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:40,256	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Time music made it all the way to Cedar Rapids newspapers in Germany and in China and Australia
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:44,608	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	They all all the Articles laid out the same basic story
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:46,912	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	It was this Algerian woman from Germany
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:47,936	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Name Alexei
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:54,336	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Tulip in Venice 20 years ago got around a gondoliers Association that never wanted to see a woman become a Gondolier
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:58,176	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And eventually became the first ever female Gondolier Venice
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:03:01,248	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	The whole thing of course parking this giant gender War
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:01,760	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	But
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:04,064	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	That was sort of it
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:07,392	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Pretty much the headline in the picture was the story
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:10,464	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Many of the Articles didn't actually have all that many quotes from Alex
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:13,024	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And so for me it sounded like a great
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:19,936	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Simple opportunity to go back and tell a deeper story
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:21,728	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Hell-bent on getting into this club
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:26,080	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Just so clearly does not want them to
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:27,104	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	We evil Alex just
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:32,224	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	We're we're interested in your story were wondering if you might be willing to spend a few days with us this summer
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:36,320	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And I was hoping it would just be like yes I'm happy to meet with you for a couple hours
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:38,368	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And that would have been great but
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:40,416	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	We got an email back right away that said
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:47,328	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	If you come do the story you have to spend a week with me a week and then there are these questions about like who
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:49,888	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	We were as journalist what our purpose was and
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:56,288	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	A bunch of Demands you have to stay in the city you can't stay in like one of the suburbs and margary even though it's cheaper that you have to be in
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:04:02,688	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	In the city jerseys found at this time at a vision for things
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:05,760	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I mean the message was definitely I want to tell a different story
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:09,088	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Did you have any idea what that meant
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:10,112	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	No idea
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:12,416	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	But we had that
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:14,720	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Echo I had that come into my head
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:22,911	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	So we flew to the Venice Airport. Took a bus to city center
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:26,751	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Stepped off the bus
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:30,079	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And you can smell the salt in the air from
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:32,127	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Come from the Grand Canal and it was
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:34,175	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Kind of rain a little bit was around midnight
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:37,759	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	We're kind of you know getting our bearings grabbing our bags and we
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:39,295	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	We look up
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:41,855	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Across the parking lot
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:44,415	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	There's Alex
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:48,511	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Standing under a Lamppost just leaning against it with a cigarette
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:49,279	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Smoke
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:51,839	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Kind of curling up into the light of the streetlamp
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:55,167	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Short hair dark
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:56,191	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	It was slick back
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:58,495	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Do you think you were in a Fellini movie
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:01,055	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Honestly I didn't know what to think
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:03,359	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	This person
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:05,151	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Was legit under a lamp
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:06,431	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Smoking
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:14,623	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Absolute Alex
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:16,671	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Taller than I expected
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:17,695	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	The strong build
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:23,327	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Afisa was a little weathered like someone who works outside all day on the water
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:27,167	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Quite late so when you called I just finished school
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:28,447	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	How was your flight

EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,335	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And since it was late
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:39,455	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	We made a plan with Alex to meet up at 5:45 p.m. the next day
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:42,015	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	On the steps of Latin DJ Opera House
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:47,391	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Okay beautiful Opera House
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:49,439	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I loved all the mess in the
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:57,375	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	So anyway the the plan was to go out on a gondola ride which was one of Alex's demands in the first email
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:05,311	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	So we walk around the corner to where there gondolas Park
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:07,615	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Hand
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:11,199	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Taobao is like Shining
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:15,551	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	So the gauntlet was made for three people
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:21,951	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Narrow jet black
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:23,743	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	750
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:25,023	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Allison had about 12 years
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:31,423	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	What's up already quite a bit when I got it had a name

EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:40,639	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	So we climb into the boat
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:41,663	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Perfect
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:47,039	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And Alex stands at the back

EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:54,719	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	We're down sitting in the in the lower seats kind of just like pointing the microphone up
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:59,327	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	If I take photographs every once in awhile
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:07,007	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	He came here to study it first
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:09,567	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	It's not what I said
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:10,847	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:14,175	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	It was pretty much immediately cleared
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:15,199	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I mean
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:19,807	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	But it was not going to be an easy interview
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:27,487	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	You came here when you said I know I know that was wondering right right

EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:34,399	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	That pretty quickly became useless
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:42,847	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Whenever I asked about being the first female Gondolier and they're the first woman in 900

EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:35,487	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Pittsfield
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:40,095	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	At one point a gondola cut through this rectangle of light
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:45,471	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Shining from an open kitchen door
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:52,383	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	It was nice I mean the side of Venice was
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:54,431	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Unexpected and really beautiful but
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:56,735	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	The whole time we were sitting on their notepads in
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:59,039	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	We're definitely quietly panicking
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:03,903	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Well you know
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:12,095	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Didn't know this at the time but you know I was like maybe you're a little too young and I think
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:12,607	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Alex
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:14,143	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Testing us
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:15,935	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	It may be a little bit too
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:19,263	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	You don't have enough experience Maybe
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:22,079	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	That was my concern but I like the
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,871	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I like the enthusiasm
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:25,663	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And I like the
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:29,247	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	There was an honesty which I like
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:39,487	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Did you ever figure out what you were being
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:45,375	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Sussed out for what was going on there for sure not on the boat
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:49,471	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	But we we actually made plans to go out to dinner that night
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:52,799	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Considering how the boat ride we thought at this point we should return to square one
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:54,847	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And leave the record at home
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:11:01,247	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Alright then just trying to have a conversation anyway we sit down outside and very few people are in the restaurant where were the only tape
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:07,647	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	People outside they had to open when we got there too we should say we met Alex's girlfriend right now we're making
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,671	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	How to making small talk

EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:27,359	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Like one of them Alex is just like drowning under the water there's one that's just like Alex's back is to
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:33,759	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Set the camera at this trip to muscular back like looking out the window over the city of Venice
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:36,831	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Venice's loan Defender

EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:57,567	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	You know we thought
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:59,103	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	We thought it was so clear
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:06,015	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Wait like the photos were so like they emphasized every masculine quality on Alex's body
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:07,807	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	We
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:12,927	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	You know an artist statement you know we used all of the mail forms in Italian
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:14,463	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Little Lake Louise which means
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:20,863	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	He instead of Les which means she but everybody at the photo exhibit was like oh must have been a typo or you made a mess
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:26,751	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Mistake and she's like which is funny because I'm Italian so I should know and I was like
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:28,543	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Pro pronouns

EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:49,791	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	What I thought that meant
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:52,095	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Was
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:53,631	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Alex was
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:55,423	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Probably born in the body
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:58,239	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	That he didn't identify with
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:12:59,775	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Mine was
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:01,567	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Hey I didn't think transgender I didn't think
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,383	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Alex is the guy of course
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:11,295	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Alex at the guy I wasn't I wasn't that surprised
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:14,367	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I would say that like flipping into heat not a thing
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:17,183	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Like like it was like Alex is
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:18,463	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Alex is a he
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:19,231	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Alex is he
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:21,535	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	He is sitting at the table with us
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:23,583	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Alex and his girlfriend
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:25,631	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Very quickly it was like him
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:27,167	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I'm looking at him
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:30,239	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And then I start thinking about the story that we had come here to tell
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:37,151	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	That was about all of the women things that she had done her her her her woman here
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:41,759	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Hero heroine first female in 900 years International symbol of female power
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:44,575	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	You start thinking about that and then it's like
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:49,695	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Those things are really hard to square in your head
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:52,255	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	This real person
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:52,767	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Is
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:56,351	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Also the stories and how did that happen
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:14:01,215	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	What is it been like for 20 years to be inside of that story
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:03,263	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	When you're actually a man
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:13,503	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	After who knows
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:16,831	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	How many articles have been written about Alex this the first time that he is
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:19,135	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Publicly telling his story
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:21,439	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	As a man and so we should probably just stop for a second
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:23,231	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And talk about pronouns
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:26,559	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Because this is really important for many transgender people
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:28,095	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	In moments when Alex
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:30,911	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Publicly understood as a woman and was getting
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:31,423	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Price for it
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:34,239	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	We've decided without permission
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:38,591	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	To only use his name or his title of first female Gondolier
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:45,759	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	While some of the people interviewed for the story were unaware that Alex is transgender and do use female pronouns
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:47,551	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Or do you refer to him as a woman we
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:49,599	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	When were talking about him we
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:50,623	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Will only use male pronoun
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:15:00,351	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	So after that dinner we made plans for the next day
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:06,751	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	On his motorboat he would just take us to a quiet spot and we would
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:09,823	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	What's the agreement on the water on the water
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:11,615	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Shut up
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:15,711	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Stop it Basta
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:18,527	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Okay
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:21,855	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	A lot of false starts
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:27,487	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Guadalupe baby I can
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:28,511	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Ask
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:30,815	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	As if it has anyone ever asked
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:31,327	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	What
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:33,375	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Pronoun you prefer
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:34,399	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	No never

EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:37,983	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Ever
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:40,799	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	So after getting some of the basics out of the way
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:43,359	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Alex kind of started at the beginning
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:45,407	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Well you know
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:46,943	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	It's a long story
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:49,247	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I was born twist in De
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:54,111	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Zoos in Germany Alex tells us he was born with a female body
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:58,207	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	But at a pretty early age knew himself to be a little boy
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:16:01,279	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I knew you were ready before I went to school
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:05,631	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Whiskey yes I was standing on the toilet to pee inside

EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:15,103	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	That wasn't there I was praying for a penis every night
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:22,271	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	My my parents knew about it his parents were actually both doctors
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:23,807	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	But they
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:24,575	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	They will not
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:25,087	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Supportive

EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:27,295	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Could wear whatever I wanted
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:31,391	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Do whatever I wanted
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:35,743	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	A little brother was born in
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:38,303	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	That was a shock
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:43,935	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	That was a terrible shock because
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:47,263	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Basically it confirmed
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:49,823	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	That my mother wanted
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:51,871	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Desperately
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:53,407	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	A boy
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:55,711	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	But she didn't accept me as her son
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:57,503	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	That's what it was
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:18:00,831	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Alex said basically you know that was the first time he saw what like
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:04,671	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	It should look like basically when a parent loves their kid
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:19,007	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	So when he was 15 he ran away from home
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:23,103	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Pembroke and the number if you have a huge
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:27,711	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	District Court employee where they have all the prostitutes
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:31,039	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	All the bad things and that's exactly
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:37,439	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Well I win some people kind of took him under their wing got a job kind of figured out how to take care of himself
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:37,951	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I got lucky
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:40,511	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	But I know also very unlucky
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:41,279	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Gay stories
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:41,791	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	But I got lucky
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:44,351	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Did he ever think about
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:46,911	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Transitioning to
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:47,679	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Male body
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:51,263	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	He says he thought about it at one point but
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:53,823	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	In the 80s when I was 15
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:58,431	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	The opportunities you have had to become a man were very very
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:04,575	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	In particular if you wanted to go down the road of surgery I can remember for my family was
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:09,183	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Constantly talks about how operations went wrong
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:12,255	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	How they went wrong and what went wrong answer
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:14,815	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	For me to go to the hospital to do an operation
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:19,679	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And of course many transgender people don't end up having surgery
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:22,239	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	But anyway after homburg
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:28,639	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	At some point Alex fell into filmmaking and ended up in San Francisco working in in the filament
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:30,687	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	History and so 1996
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:37,087	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	He got involved in a production that sent him abroad to go scope out locations for a film that was going to be shot in Venice
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:46,559	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	The shows up in Venice in 1896
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:50,911	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	He's not a kid at this point originally he's just supposed to say a few days
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:56,031	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Kind of just enough time to do some research and scope things out but somewhere along the way
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:59,871	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	He sees these guys rolling their boats down the canal and
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:02,175	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Reasons Heat
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:03,967	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Can't entirely explained
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:05,503	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	He's just
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:12,159	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Transfixed by this kind of
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:16,767	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Bored and I was fascinated by The Rolling star
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:18,559	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	That you will forward to you
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:20,863	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Actually see where you going
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:26,239	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	So was just fascinated and I just wanted to try it out myself
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:27,263	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Eventually
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:30,079	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Alexandra Bachelor meeting a Gondolier
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:31,103	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And asks like
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:32,895	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Do you think I could do this and
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:36,223	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Actually ended up down at the gondola station isn't a princess
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:42,879	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Did they ask you to they ask you why you wanted to study I remember the first day
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:44,671	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I was introduced by the
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:48,255	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	The head boss of the group Okay so
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:50,815	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Alex she's going to be all mascot
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:56,191	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Because this all Alex's a woman and there never been a woman Gondolier muscles them sought
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:58,239	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	For sure
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:21:00,031	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	This was like kind of a joke
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:01,823	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	There was a very old man
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:05,407	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Who is the latest hit now we have a Gondolier with tits
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:08,735	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	For the first several months
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:15,135	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Alex says he basically just picked up after the guys you wear the Busboys for everybody so you needed to
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:16,416	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	To clean that potent
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:17,440	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	To ship out the water
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:20,256	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Like 10 20 *
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:21,024	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	A day
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:23,840	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	He says it's really backbreaking grueling work
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:28,448	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Somebody that everybody everybody sees as a woman you think this would be like the worst place on Earth
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:34,592	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	But you know actually first those first months in the city just kind of with the boys dirty jokes
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:36,384	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I saw this is great
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:46,880	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Alex Newell the gondoliers nicknames walked and talked and acted like them and Kirsten the same way and
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:52,768	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	He says he felt like he was part of this tradition of new learning from these old guys work mentors to him
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:57,120	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Really like maybe the best time of my my life
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:04,032	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	It was like he was home
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:07,872	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And then the the trouble began
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:16,832	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	It started with a journalist
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:18,368	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Reporter Consuelo Turin
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:24,768	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	We met in the noisy Cafe with a translator
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:31,168	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	She was a cub reporter in Venice working for a very politically Progressive newspaper and
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:32,448	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	She Was Out
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:35,008	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Looking for her big story and she runs into our
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:41,408	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	How did they encounter each other
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:44,224	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	She was like
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:48,576	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Whoa it's obviously did this is struck her attention
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:51,136	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Araminta santalo here
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:54,464	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	It looked at her like there was this woman rolling among men
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:56,256	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	In Lake Stevens.
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:23:00,096	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Cotton blend right in the mega
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:03,168	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Unusual addition to tennis
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:10,080	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	So she looks like a whole morning and basically just
EDL	00:23:10,080	00:23:13,664	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	What's Alex's Behavior
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:21,600	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Alec didn't want to talk so I can talk about it later basically I'm just a student they're teaching me
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:28,000	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Don't make this into a thing
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:34,400	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Recognize that you don't want to talk to me that you're apprehensive and that this might be difficult and I get this my TV
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:36,704	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Can damage your reputation with the other Gondolier's
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:43,104	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	But this is an important story
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:49,504	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Your Pioneer I can't ignore you and so Consuelo said the two options
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:54,880	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I'm going to write the story no matter what so you can either talk to me and we can do the story together or I can write what I think
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:23:59,232	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Leadville Co
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:06,144	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	You know I said he can't go out now and she said it will
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:07,424	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Edible
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:08,448	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And why wasn't Consuelo
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:10,752	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Persuaded that she should wait
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:14,080	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	They will join this coming from all over the place
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:17,152	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I think the story was going to get out there and somebody was going to write it
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:20,992	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And Alex never started stopped and was like listen
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:21,504	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Consuelo whoever
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:23,552	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Let me just tell you the real
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:28,928	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	The way out of this is to speak and yet he stays quiet right
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:30,208	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Would you ever since why
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:30,976	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I mean
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:36,096	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Just like some blank data points that might be helpful in understanding kind of where we were
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:37,888	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	So we're talking 1987
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:43,264	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Just to give you like a corollary thing
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:48,128	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Where we were in our discourse around LGBT issues was like Ellen DeGeneres I think that year
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:49,664	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	This is this is so hard but
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:51,200	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Came out on her show
EDL	00:24:51,200	00:24:52,480	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I think I've realized
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:54,272	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	That I am
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:56,832	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I can't even say the word
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:25:00,672	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Why can't I say the word like shortly after was canceled
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:07,584	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Caitlyn Jenner was just a few years ago like we we didn't even really have a grip on what transgender was that wasn't a conversation that we were have
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:08,352	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Having in public
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:14,752	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Can you imagine what it would be like to be like guys guys guys don't worry though I'm actually a man
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:18,848	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	That wouldn't have gone over so well with the dudes at the gondola station
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:22,176	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	So what ended up happening after
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:22,688	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Consuelo in Allen
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:24,992	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Add to Showdown about the article
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:30,880	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Well couple days later Alex is on the way to the gondola station I found it in the
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:32,416	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Newspaper
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:33,696	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Stop
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:39,840	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	The headline
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:44,960	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	A woman is challenging the gondoliers
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:46,496	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	So I was like I was on my God
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:48,032	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Going to be hell
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:54,944	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	So it's in the newspaper stand Alex shows up at the Gondolier station of course is a big hello
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:26:01,344	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Big unfriendly hello hello
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:04,416	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	We do everything
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:06,464	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Teach you well and you know
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:12,864	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Alex has one of the gondoliers stopped talking to him they wouldn't even let him watch their boats and then the
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:15,680	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	The ones who said
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:22,080	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I told you in the beginning told you she's just going to blab to the Press
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:25,920	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	The whole thing you know what's like a little Stone becoming like that huge
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:27,200	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Huge sink
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:34,368	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	By the way this is right this is coming right before Alex is about to take the very first exam
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:39,232	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	There's actually a series of exams and it gets a little complicated but eventually
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:42,048	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Anybody who wants to be a Gondolier has to take this rolling test
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:43,072	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And by all accounts
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:43,840	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Alex was
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:44,864	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Good
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:51,520	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Let me talk to the guy who is ahead of the gondoliers association at that time
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:55,872	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	This guy phobia Scarpa was like
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:57,664	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Is it more
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:27:00,480	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Google the other manga
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:04,064	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And this is the head of the guild
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:09,952	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	We also talked to this legendary rower named Franco kreia
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:16,352	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Alex is better than most of the guys
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:19,424	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Alex takes the test
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:21,728	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And I failed the
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:22,240	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Exempt
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:24,288	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Which wouldn't have been
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:30,432	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	That by itself would have been such a big deal cuz a whole bunch of people fail the first exam but the thing was
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:33,760	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	There was a feeling that like something deeply unfair was happening
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:39,904	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	She had analog recording to Consuelo a lot of people started to think
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:41,696	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Maybe the fix was in
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:43,232	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	So what other boys there
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:44,000	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Field
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:50,400	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Who are better than other boys who did not fail suspiciously pretty much all the people that passed
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:54,496	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Four sons of gondoliers are from Gondolier families cuz if that's the right last name
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:28:00,384	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Then I got angry I got a lawyer
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:06,784	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Alex. This is going to be attention to how corrupt the license practices how crap this Association is I wanted that they exist
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:12,416	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Repeat it for everybody and this
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:18,816	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	We let everyone retake the test that will basically be admitting that we favor certain families over other families
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:21,376	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	That was exactly what I want but it's not what they wanted
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:23,680	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	They said we don't want the bad press of this
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:25,984	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	But then this is another moment
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:28,032	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	According to Alex where his story just gets
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:28,800	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Hijacked
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:32,128	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Myeloid negotiated without my permission
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:33,664	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	According to Alex without
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:38,784	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Telling him the lawyer together with the gondoliers association dug up this old law that says
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:44,160	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Cuz Alex is a woman I mean he's not he's a man but they thought he was a woman and
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:46,208	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Is law says that as a woman
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:50,304	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	He had the right to take the test again this time with women judges in the boat
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:53,120	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	When she came back and said okay here's what we're going to do
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:55,168	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Do you remember what you said
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:55,936	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Boston
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:28:58,496	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I was so very upset
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:02,848	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	That was not what I wanted nothing to do with man or woman
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:03,616	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Do you think she
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:09,760	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Was your champion because she identified with you yeah for sure I was not my so it's faster
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:10,272	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	But
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:14,624	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Unfortunately for Alex as soon as the lawyer did that
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:17,184	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	It became everyone's story
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:18,976	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Oh yeah because
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:20,768	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Is there rain with it
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:27,680	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	In the next 2 months every paper in town was writing about it
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:34,080	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Show me statistics, then the story went global
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:40,224	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Happy to become Banks first woman on the sink first female Gondolier
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:45,088	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Build Gondolier blames chauvinism
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:48,672	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And then things escalate into a full-blown gender battle
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:54,816	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	The gondoliers record super pissed because of all the stress that they're getting we talked to a couple of he likes Gondolier guys
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:01,472	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	She didn't
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:03,008	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Disaster
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:05,312	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Alex is it 1.6. So bad
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:11,712	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	That was one of them was saying you're not going to wait for you in a smaller than the street with a knife
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:13,504	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	2 Yuan
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:16,576	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	So I grabbed the guy I said where's your knife I'm here
EDL	00:30:17,344	00:30:18,368	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Get it out
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:20,160	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Can do it
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:23,232	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	That was one episode how many Oz's
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:27,584	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	So on the one side Alex said he has Gondolier's wanting him
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:33,984	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	On the other than feminism kicked in and Alex said he had all these women
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:34,752	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Need to see them
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:41,152	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Do you want me to lie because they thought he was a she read in the paper that she had
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:42,432	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Try to
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:44,736	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Take the test and had failed
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:51,136	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And head cold fowl saying that the venetians remain and the United States system wouldn't let women become Gandhi
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:57,536	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Is this is Jane Capital she was active in the community of Venetian women rowers of the time
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:31:03,936	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Women gondoliers at that time but there's a whole community of female rowers they have teams
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:08,288	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Isn't a race being doing Venetian Ryan for over 20 years
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:10,592	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And being a female rower in Venice
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:18,272	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Who is very difficult Elena this woman roar I was talking to
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:24,672	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Was like I'm routinely when I'm out on the water like old men yell at me and say
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:25,952	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	In the kitchen
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:31,584	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Cooking or cleaning your house why are you here
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:38,496	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	You're just a side dish table told me when it comes to racing there's a big discrepancy in the prize money
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:39,520	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Getting like
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:41,824	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Full times as much prize money
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:42,592	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	As the women
EDL	00:31:42,592	00:31:44,640	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	We are now trying to
EDL	00:31:44,640	00:31:48,224	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Convince the city of Venice who gives prices
EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:49,504	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	We are
EDL	00:31:49,504	00:31:50,528	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Make men
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:56,928	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	We are not less than them busting their ass to try to be taken seriously in the sport
EDL	00:31:56,928	00:32:01,792	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	We are here we can do this when I saw this press about Alex fighting the gondoliers
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:08,192	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	They reached out I sent one of the other considered as down to speak to her when I come to
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:13,824	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Bob and come and work with us and help us out help us teach people who got your back but she wasn't injured
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:15,104	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	No
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:19,968	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Because Alex there are two problems first of all that you cannot compare
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:23,040	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	The golden robots with racing Ross
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:26,112	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	They're two different styles of rowing and second of all
EDL	00:32:26,112	00:32:30,464	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Listens I got was it was kind of like I don't want to roll with you you guys all wear matching white skirts
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:32,000	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Like not my thing
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:34,816	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Say I remember there was a lot of
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:37,632	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Resentment
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:41,728	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Be one of us in this battle for equality
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:44,800	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	They see me and then they are convinced
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:46,336	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	The times feminist
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:48,640	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	But I am one of them and I'm not
EDL	00:32:50,688	00:32:52,480	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And all of this comes to a head
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:33:00,160	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	In October 2004 when Alex has to retake the test
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:02,720	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And this time with champion women rowers in the boat
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:04,000	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Judging them
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:05,280	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	There was a lot of pressure
EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:12,448	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Everything about the test is supposed to be a secret location of the test the path that Alex is going to row of at no clue
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:13,216	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	We going to go
EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:16,032	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Suspiciously as Alex stepped into the boat
EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:23,200	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	He noticed that there was a huge crowd wind up all the way down the canal and then difference
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:26,528	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And they're shouting and yelling screaming what kinds of
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:31,392	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Swear words in all kinds of go home and
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:34,976	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Canada messenger hate
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:41,888	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Female rowers in the boat glaring it and there's press lined up along the entire way
EDL	00:33:41,888	00:33:44,448	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Every everybody has a Bus full of people
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:46,496	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	It feels like I'm going to in a ring
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:54,688	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I tried to block it all out because I needed to do it next them
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:02,624	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I wanted to do a good performance
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:11,584	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I wasn't able

EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:37,760	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And that's an international feminist hero sensation and so we now find Alex being painted by everybody

EDL	00:36:48,000	00:36:54,400	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I'll tell you as we were doing the interviewing in the reporting I'm like I'm feeling like I have a good grip on Alex Asta
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:37:00,032	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I'm feeling like I know what it feels like to be inside of a narrative it feels really achy and so I feel like
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:06,432	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I'm kind of getting it and I'm like understanding the full Alex and like it's about all of these other things that have nothing to do with j
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:09,248	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Gender so Alex's story isn't about gender at all
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:15,392	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	An end for me that made sense because I was like in my life gender has been a box like even even when you're in the right
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:17,440	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Even when you're in the right box
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:22,048	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Gender is a box and it can feel shity to be in that box since I was like yeah let's
EDL	00:37:22,048	00:37:28,192	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Bust open those boxes together we're going to show you were going to show people who you are Alex
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:32,544	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	We would have these moments where I would be like
EDL	00:37:32,544	00:37:33,824	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Wait a second
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:38,176	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Like one night when we were in Venice
EDL	00:37:38,176	00:37:44,576	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	We're like trying to park our boat on the way to a restaurant and end like this guy is like trying to parallel park is by
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:50,720	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	About and Alex's kind of sitting there like chuckling at him
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:57,376	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And so the two of them are like me or joking about it and then Alex says like he drives like a woman
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:38:04,544	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I know it's like you know and the kind of rolled my eyes at it
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:05,824	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	But then later at the dinner
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:08,128	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	He was like he was like
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:09,408	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	You don't like
EDL	00:38:09,920	00:38:12,736	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I don't really think that like a real woman could do this job
EDL	00:38:13,760	00:38:20,160	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Minions like all like Macho about it too much a thing
EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:21,952	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Remember this
EDL	00:38:22,464	00:38:25,536	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Of course you are very right
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:27,840	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	A woman can do everything but
EDL	00:38:29,376	00:38:30,912	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	This job
EDL	00:38:30,912	00:38:33,728	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Just going to be very tough because
EDL	00:38:34,240	00:38:36,800	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	It's a real cool
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:38,080	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Community
EDL	00:38:38,848	00:38:40,128	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Images very cool
EDL	00:38:42,688	00:38:47,552	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	But when you said that but when you said that I got so I was like I'm so frustrated
EDL	00:38:47,552	00:38:49,344	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And it was because
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:52,160	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Think I was attached to the idea of like
EDL	00:38:52,160	00:38:53,440	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	It being equal
EDL	00:38:53,440	00:38:56,768	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	You know I mean I was I was just like super confused like
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:38:59,072	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I don't know I just
EDL	00:38:59,840	00:39:01,120	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I just want to know what you think
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:08,288	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I'll admit in the moment I asked
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:10,848	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Clumsy question
EDL	00:39:10,848	00:39:14,176	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Do you feel bruised because you seem to be almost like
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:18,272	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Prodding me you know I having fun and winking at David and do you feel like
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:21,856	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	You're fundamentally on a different team from me
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:25,184	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Okay
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:30,560	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I am on David's team
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:33,376	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	But you can't see that
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:36,704	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Because he's you identify as me
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:40,032	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	But that does not that I can help that
EDL	00:39:41,312	00:39:46,688	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	How can I explain it to you let's put it this way when I'm in a group of woman
EDL	00:39:47,456	00:39:49,504	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	For example and they start to talk
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:51,808	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I feel uncomfortable
EDL	00:39:52,320	00:39:54,112	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	The check thing says
EDL	00:39:54,624	00:39:55,904	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I caught a chicken check
EDL	00:39:56,416	00:39:58,464	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	It's not really my cup of
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:39:59,488	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	TN.
EDL	00:39:59,488	00:40:02,048	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I like it you can amuse me
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:03,584	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	But
EDL	00:40:04,096	00:40:05,120	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	The minute
EDL	00:40:05,120	00:40:08,704	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	They think that I am one of them it doesn't amuse me anymore
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:11,008	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And if you uncomfortable
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:12,544	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Like I don't I'm a man
EDL	00:40:13,056	00:40:14,336	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I'm a little alien there
EDL	00:40:14,848	00:40:17,152	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Cuz they think I am one of them and I'm not
EDL	00:40:17,920	00:40:19,456	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	When I'm with the boys
EDL	00:40:20,224	00:40:21,248	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Comfortable
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:23,808	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	If it is a nice
EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:29,696	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Voice which I liked and we have the same type of humor and you know the same
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:30,976	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Stupid jokes about women
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:32,512	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	For Alex
EDL	00:40:32,512	00:40:38,400	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I think it was really striking is it whatever it is that makes him feel comfortable being seen as a man but not as a woman
EDL	00:40:38,400	00:40:42,752	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	It runs very deep for me there is a difference between men and women
EDL	00:40:43,264	00:40:49,664	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Not everybody or even every transgender person would feel this way but the way that he sees it if there were no differences
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:56,064	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	But is there would be no but no wish to do Transition and there would be no transexuality
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:40:59,392	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	It's like that if if it would be the same
EDL	00:41:05,280	00:41:05,792	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Yeah
EDL	00:41:06,816	00:41:10,912	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I see you were singing is like a gender doesn't matter kind of Icon and he was
EDL	00:41:10,912	00:41:11,424	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Saying
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:12,448	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Actually it does match
EDL	00:41:13,472	00:41:13,984	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Yeah
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:17,056	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Obsessed with simpler question when
EDL	00:41:17,568	00:41:20,640	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	When does he actually become the first female Gondolier
EDL	00:41:22,432	00:41:24,992	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Also Alex couldn't get one of these
EDL	00:41:24,992	00:41:28,064	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	400 or so special Gondolier's licenses because he failed
EDL	00:41:28,064	00:41:30,880	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Protest in 2005
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:32,672	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I open up my own business
EDL	00:41:32,672	00:41:33,952	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	He figured out that
EDL	00:41:33,952	00:41:37,536	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	If he Partners up with businesses in Town Lake hotels
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:43,936	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	He can actually real for them privately is the time I was looking at those olores and I found that it was false
EDL	00:41:43,936	00:41:47,264	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Possible to open up my own business without having a license so I did
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:48,032	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And so
EDL	00:41:48,032	00:41:50,080	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	For years he was just kind of doing this
EDL	00:41:50,080	00:41:56,479	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Quietly then Alexandra
EDL	00:41:56,479	00:41:57,759	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Square Hotel
EDL	00:41:57,759	00:42:04,159	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Some of the gondoliers began to notice that Alex was throwing passengers without a license and of course they did
EDL	00:42:04,159	00:42:10,559	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	You can't do that
EDL	00:42:10,559	00:42:16,959	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	You have to be a member of this organization you have to have a specific license in order practice
EDL	00:42:16,959	00:42:18,495	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I got some frets
EDL	00:42:18,495	00:42:19,775	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Bubba fretzin
EDL	00:42:21,055	00:42:25,919	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Damaging the gondola and six kinds of stupid little boys
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:32,063	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	So when they understood they cannot threaten me this way then they
EDL	00:42:32,575	00:42:38,975	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Fish at City Hall to change the lot City Hall basically it's like you can't roll
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:45,375	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	You can't roll with Taurus in it without a without a license
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:49,215	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Yeah it's a one-day Alex is out on his boat and he just gets pulled over
EDL	00:42:50,239	00:42:53,055	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Basically told you're breaking this new law
EDL	00:42:53,055	00:42:59,455	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And so I wanted to defend myself so we went on trial in
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:05,855	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Court it was Alex is one lawyer City Hall in the gondoliers association there for lawyers for lawyers
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:12,255	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I thought this was a lost case any already City Hall
EDL	00:43:12,255	00:43:13,023	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Lust
EDL	00:43:13,535	00:43:15,071	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	City Hall fights back
EDL	00:43:15,071	00:43:17,119	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Case goes to the highest court in the land
EDL	00:43:17,887	00:43:18,655	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	The lost again
EDL	00:43:19,167	00:43:21,471	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Influence of a quart
EDL	00:43:23,519	00:43:26,847	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	With me a little stranger from out of nowhere
EDL	00:43:27,359	00:43:33,759	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Technically the decision just said hotels can provide for their customers away that they need you so if they want to hire a chauffeur
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:39,903	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Who happens to Rowena Gondola they can do that but what that actually meant was it now for the first time
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:40,927	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Alex
EDL	00:43:41,439	00:43:47,583	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Could be considered a Gondolier
EDL	00:43:51,167	00:43:57,567	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	There was a huge deal massive
EDL	00:43:57,567	00:44:03,967	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Fix on Venice Gondola cartel
EDL	00:44:03,967	00:44:10,111	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	This is where we get all of those articles we read before we came to Venice
EDL	00:44:10,111	00:44:11,903	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	The story went all over the world
EDL	00:44:11,903	00:44:15,999	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	And and every single one the message was the same
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:18,303	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	We have our first woman Gondolier
EDL	00:44:34,687	00:44:40,575	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I did that was something it was Unstoppable could not go in there and say excuse me
EDL	00:44:41,087	00:44:44,671	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	You know I'm not really identifying
EDL	00:44:44,671	00:44:45,951	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	No it was gone
EDL	00:44:46,463	00:44:47,231	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Okay
EDL	00:44:47,231	00:44:47,999	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	It was done
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:56,959	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Alex at this point in 2007 doesn't have any other income except for being able to Market
EDL	00:44:56,959	00:45:01,311	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Himself through hotels and eventually online in Seoul
EDL	00:45:01,311	00:45:07,711	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Of course I need to have a website people are actively seeking out this person who has broken the gender
EDL	00:45:07,711	00:45:14,111	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Barrier and become the first female Gondolier in Venice so did would have been stupid to try to go
EDL	00:45:14,111	00:45:14,879	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Against all this
EDL	00:45:15,391	00:45:21,791	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Was already written so Alex decides to make his email his Facebook page and his wife
EDL	00:45:21,791	00:45:22,303	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Website
EDL	00:45:24,095	00:45:25,887	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Call Prima gondoliera
EDL	00:45:25,887	00:45:27,679	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Or the first female Gondolier
EDL	00:45:30,495	00:45:31,519	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I'm wondering if
EDL	00:45:31,519	00:45:33,055	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Trading website with that name
EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:36,895	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Did that feel like you taking control of that narrative
EDL	00:45:36,895	00:45:40,223	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Always that narrative taking control of your decision on that website
EDL	00:45:40,223	00:45:43,295	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Has nothing to do with what I want
EDL	00:45:43,295	00:45:44,063	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	It's a label
EDL	00:45:45,087	00:45:49,183	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	You know I cannot change the label who has seen on 20 years of History
EDL	00:45:49,183	00:45:50,207	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Shut up
EDL	00:45:54,815	00:45:57,631	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Alex told us he was talking to his therapist one day at this
EDL	00:45:58,143	00:46:03,007	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Transgender Center they have near Venice and she said you're like in the cage
EDL	00:46:03,007	00:46:06,079	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	This is like a cage for you you can't get really out of this
EDL	00:46:06,591	00:46:07,103	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	You know
EDL	00:46:08,639	00:46:10,687	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	It's the it's a difficult
EDL	00:46:10,687	00:46:11,199	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	Situation
EDL	00:46:12,223	00:46:13,759	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	It's a very difficult situation
EDL	00:46:18,111	00:46:18,879	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	I'm tired
EDL	00:46:39,871	00:46:46,015	| radiolab_podcast17gondolier |	By the time we met Alex he been living almost 10 years like this you know just kind of
