EDL	00:00:46,080	00:00:47,360	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Because
EDL	00:00:48,896	00:00:51,200	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Well I've thrown more than one cell phone
EDL	00:00:51,200	00:00:53,248	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Into the ground
EDL	00:00:53,248	00:00:56,832	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And whenever having breakfast one day and he pitched me on this idea of doing the story
EDL	00:00:57,600	00:00:58,368	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	About Facebook
EDL	00:00:58,368	00:01:00,672	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Remember iron on a huge
EDL	00:01:00,672	00:01:03,744	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	No believer in doing stories about Facebook
EDL	00:01:03,744	00:01:04,768	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Mystery
EDL	00:01:04,768	00:01:05,536	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Wickedly interesting
EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:07,328	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Profound in its way
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:09,632	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	So he and I've been falling for a couple years
EDL	00:01:11,168	00:01:12,448	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And down to this roller coaster
EDL	00:01:12,448	00:01:15,264	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Events it really begins in 2011
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:16,800	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Will let me back up for me
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:18,592	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	One of the challenges talking about Facebook
EDL	00:01:18,592	00:01:19,104	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	What is just
EDL	00:01:19,616	00:01:20,640	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	The scale
EDL	00:01:20,640	00:01:21,920	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Of the thing
EDL	00:01:21,920	00:01:24,736	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	So you know there's there's
EDL	00:01:24,736	00:01:31,136	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	1.3 billion people on Earth as of March 2014
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:37,536	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Active monthly users there's a billion people who access the site through through mobile
EDL	00:01:37,536	00:01:38,048	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Devices
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:42,656	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Just to put that in perspective there's more Facebook users than there are Catholic
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:44,448	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	That camera is real
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:45,984	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Yeah yeah yeah
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:47,264	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It turns out it
EDL	00:01:47,264	00:01:47,776	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Is true
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:49,056	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	But they're neck-and-neck
EDL	00:01:50,336	00:01:56,224	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	When you have one out of every seven people on the planet in the same space
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:57,248	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Trying to connect
EDL	00:01:57,248	00:02:03,648	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Across time and geography you're bound to create problem sometimes
EDL	00:02:03,648	00:02:05,440	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Again tonight the issue this time
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:07,744	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Before we go there
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:11,584	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	We should introduce you to the guy in our story who is the problem solver
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:13,120	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	My name is Arturo Vega
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:15,680	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And I'm a director of engineering at face
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:18,752	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Story begins Christmas 2011
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:26,688	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	People doing what they do every holiday season they're getting back together with their families and they're going to family parties in there taking lots and
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:28,224	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Lots of pictures
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:32,576	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Inderal uploading them to Facebook and at the time
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:37,184	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	The number of photos that were getting uploaded what's going pretty crazy
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:41,024	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	In fact in just a few days between Christmas
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:43,584	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And New Year's there are more images
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:45,120	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Uploaded
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:47,168	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	The Facebook then the word of the entirety of liquid
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:50,752	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	You say more images are uploaded in a week
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:53,056	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Two Facebook in all a flicker all time
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:56,640	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Which created a
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:03:00,992	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Situation the number of photos what's going on along with a number of photos going up
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:02,528	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	The number for Portsmouth going up
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:06,880	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	What do you mean by reports is this
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:11,488	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Back in 2011 if you saw something on Facebook that really upset you
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:12,256	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	You
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:14,048	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Could click a button
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:17,632	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	To report it you can tell Facebook to take it down which from their perspective
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:19,936	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Is it really important
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:20,960	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Mechanism
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:22,240	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	If your Facebook
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:29,152	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	You don't want certain kinds of content on your site you don't want nudity you don't want like drug use hate speech things like that
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:35,552	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Fatso a day or so after Christmas thereabouts Facebook Engineers come back to work and they find
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:36,320	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Waiting for them
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:38,624	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Literally millions
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:40,672	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Photo reports
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:44,000	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	The number of people that would be necessary to review everything I was coming in
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:46,560	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It kind of boggled
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:47,328	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Mine
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:48,608	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	How many people would you need it
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:53,984	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I think at the time we were looking at it for just two years ago and I can all this has grown so much since and we're looking at like thousand
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:56,032	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Sounds like some
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:58,592	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Giant facility in Nevada
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:01,152	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Filled with nothing but humans
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:03,712	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Looking at Christmas board
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:06,784	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	We're actually joking about this but we found out later
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:08,064	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	There actually are thousands of P
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:09,344	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Across the world
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:10,112	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Who do this for internet
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:11,392	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	All day long
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:13,184	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Clearly warrants
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:14,464	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Don't show but for our purposes
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:18,559	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Just know that when a photo is reported a human being has to look at
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:23,935	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Tattoo right because there needs to be a judgment on the image and humans are the best at that
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:25,471	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	So Archer decided
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:27,263	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Before we do anything
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:29,567	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Let's just figure out what we're dealing with
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:31,871	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And so we sat down with a team of people
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:34,943	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	We started going through the photos of people were reporting
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:38,271	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	What they found was it about 97% of these
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:39,551	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Millionaire so photo
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:40,319	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Reports
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:41,855	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	We're drastically
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:43,391	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Miss calligraphist
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:49,791	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	They're sitting moms holding little babies reported for harassment
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:53,887	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Pictures of families in matching Christmas sweaters reported for nudity
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:56,703	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Pictures of puppies reported for hate speech
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:58,239	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Puppies reported as hate speech
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:04:59,519	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Don't like
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:01,311	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	What's going on right
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:03,103	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	So they decide to invest
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:05,663	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Okay so step one for Facebook
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,967	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Ask if you are these people
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:08,991	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Why don't you like this photo
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:10,527	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Why did you report this
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:13,855	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Responses come back and the first thing they realize is
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:16,671	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Is it almost always the person complaining about the image
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:19,231	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Within the image they were complaining about
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:20,767	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And it just hate the picture
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:25,375	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Maybe they were doing a goofy dance someone snapped a photo and that why do you post that
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:30,239	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Maybe they were at a party they got a little too drunk that you hooked up with their EX
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:32,543	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Somebody took a picture and
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:36,383	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	That person says of you know that's a one-time thing us never happen again take it down
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:39,711	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Arturo said they were definitely a lot of reports from people who used to be couple
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:40,735	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Sending Dave broke up
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:44,063	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And then they're asking to take the photos down
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:50,719	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And the puppy what would what would be the reason for that Poppy maybe it's your ex-wife's puppy
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:51,999	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	You see it makes
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:52,511	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	She said
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:53,535	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Take it down
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:57,119	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	So once we've begun investigating you find that there's a little bit
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:06:02,239	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Relationship things that happened that are like really complicated
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:06,847	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	You're talking about stuff that's the kind of natural to try to sue
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:11,199	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Human dramas
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:12,223	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Plicate speech
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:12,991	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Because
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:14,015	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	That was one of the only option
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:18,879	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	They were just picking because they needed to get to the next screen to submit the report
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:20,671	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	So we added a step
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:26,303	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Archer and his team set it up so that when people were choosing that option
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:31,167	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Facebook some of them would see a little box on the screen
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:31,935	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	That's sad
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:33,983	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	How does the photo make you feel
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:38,847	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	In the Box gave several choices the options where
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:44,991	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Embarrass embarrassing that name setting bad photo and other
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:46,783	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Where you can write in whatever you want
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:48,319	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	About the image
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:52,927	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And it worked incredibly well I mean like 50% of people with select an emotion like
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,463	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Princess embarrassing
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:57,023	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And then 34% of people would select other
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:58,303	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:07:00,351	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	We read those we sit down and we're waiting the other
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:03,679	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I'm what was the most frequent thing that people were typing in
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:05,471	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	To other it was it's embarrassed
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:09,823	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It's embarrassed but you had embarrassing on the list I know
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:11,103	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	That's weird I know

EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:16,223	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Okay
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:18,015	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Maybe we should
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:18,783	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Just put
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:19,551	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It's
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:20,575	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	What are the choices
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:22,879	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	As in please describe this piece of content
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:26,463	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It's embarrassing it's a bad photo of me it makes me sad
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:29,023	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Etc and when they brought out the choices that way
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:33,375	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	That extra words we went from 50% of people selecting an emotion to
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:35,167	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	78% people selecting an emotion
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:36,703	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	In other words
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:37,727	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	The word
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:38,239	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It's
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:40,287	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	All by itself
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:42,079	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Boosted the response by
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:42,847	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	20
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:43,871	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	8%
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:45,407	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	From 50 to 78
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:51,551	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	In Facebook land that means thousands and thousands of people and we just a sort of what could that be
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:54,623	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It to people like full sentences
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:55,391	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Your stinking
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:59,231	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It's always good to mirror the way people talk
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:07:59,999	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Arturo's ideas
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:02,559	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Define conditioning is that
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:04,351	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	When you just say embarrass
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:05,375	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	There's no subject
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:07,679	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It's silently implied
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:08,959	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Yuan
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,007	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	But would you say
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:14,335	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It's embarrassing one that shifts the sort of emotional energy to this
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:15,615	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Photograph
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:17,919	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And so then it's less hot and it's
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:19,455	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Either deal with no interest
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:24,063	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	That thing is embarrassing I'm fine it's embarrassing
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:25,599	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It is responsible for lost me
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:26,623	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Good writer
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:33,279	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	But it still doesn't solve their basic problem because even if Facebook now knows
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:34,303	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Why the person flag
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:36,351	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It was embarrassing and not act
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:36,863	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Hate speech
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:42,495	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I still can't take it down I mean there's nothing in the policy to terms of service that says
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:48,639	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	You can't put up embarrassing photos in fact if they took it down if you violating the rights of the person who posted it
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:50,431	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Like there's nothing we can do I'm sorry
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:53,759	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Oh so they actually fence themselves in a little bit.
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:55,039	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	For me I always put it in
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,575	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I would just be like
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:57,855	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Go deal with it your
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:09:00,415	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Yourself
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:03,999	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Shock to the bird that's the solution
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:05,535	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I he wouldn't put it that way but
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:07,583	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	What he needed to have happened
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,607	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	For the person who posted
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:10,655	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Picture in the person who is pissed about it
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:12,191	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	To talk to each other
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:13,215	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	To work it out themselves
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:20,127	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	So are true and his teammate at week where if you said this photo was embarrassing or whatever
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:21,919	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	A new screen would pop up
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:25,247	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I would ask if you want the front to take the photo down
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:26,527	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	If you said yes
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:27,807	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I would like my stupid
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:30,367	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Boyfriend to take the photo down an empty message box
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:32,415	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Just an empty box
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:39,071	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It's sad we think it's a good idea for you to tell the person who upset you that they upset you
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:43,423	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Only 20% of people with type something in and send that message
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:45,215	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	They just didn't do it they just said
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:47,519	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I'd rather you deal with this
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:48,543	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Sartorius email
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:50,591	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Let's take it one step further
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:55,711	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	When that message box popped up we gave people that default message that we requested
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:56,479	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	2 *
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:57,503	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	That conversation
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:10:00,831	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Just get the conversation going and it's going to be the first version of the message that we did
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:02,367	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Was like
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:05,183	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Hey I didn't like this photo take it down
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:07,999	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Hey I don't like that photo that's a little aggressive
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:09,279	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	But
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:11,839	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	When they started presenting people with a message box
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:15,679	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Senate pre-written in you're almost immediately we went from
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:17,727	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	20% of people sending a message
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:20,031	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	To 50% of people sending a message
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:23,871	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Really that's surprising expecting to see that pick up a shift
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:26,431	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And so this music people just don't want to write
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:29,247	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Dell sign up for pretty much anything
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:31,807	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Not necessarily maybe it's just that
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:33,087	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It's so easy
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:35,391	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	To shirk the responsibility of
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:36,927	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Confronting another person
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:43,071	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	That you need every little stupid nuts YouTube
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:44,863	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Have an effect
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:45,887	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	So they're like okay
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:47,679	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	If that works so well
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:49,727	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Why we trust different wording
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:51,263	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Instead of
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:52,031	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Hey
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:53,311	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I didn't like this photo
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,079	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Take it down
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,871	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Why don't we try hey Robert
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:57,663	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I don't like this photo
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:58,431	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Take it down
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:10:59,711	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Just putting in your name
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:03,039	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Works about 7% better than leaving it out
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:08,671	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It means that you're 7% more likely either to get the person to do what you ask them to do take out
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:11,743	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Turn photo to start a conversation about how to resolve your feelings
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:18,655	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Over now measuring the effectiveness of the message so if I'm objecting will the other party pull
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:20,447	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Pull it off the computer for just talked
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:24,287	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Okay they also tried variations like a Robert would you please
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:25,567	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Take it down
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:28,127	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Please or would you mind
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:32,991	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Take me to town. Would you please performs 4% better than would you mind
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:36,319	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Not totally sure why but there they tried dozens of phrases like
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:39,135	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Would you please would you mind I'm sorry to bring this up
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:42,975	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Would you please take it down and start bring this up but would you mind taking it down and at a certain point
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:49,119	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Andrew Nygaard true
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:52,191	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	We just wanted to see this whole process they're going
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:52,959	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Threw up close
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:57,055	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	So we took a trip out to Facebook headquarters Menlo Park
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:12:00,639	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	California and somebody year ago
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:07,039	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Just for the hubbub we met up with Arturo
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:11,903	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Let's hang out one of these sort of like a socialist Utopia Silicon Valley campuses were
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:18,815	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	People are like in hammocks and their this volleyball happening
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:25,215	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Did foxes running around at one point to be there on a Friday because every Friday afternoon
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:28,031	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Arturo assembles this really big group
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:33,151	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	To review all the data
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:35,711	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	15 people crammed into a conference room
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:39,551	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Technical folks
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:43,135	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Dan Farrell I'm a data scientist
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:44,415	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	A lot of these guys called themselves
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:51,071	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Trust Engineers that you trust Engineers are joined by a bunch of Outside song
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:57,983	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Professor psychology UC Berkeley Mac Killingsworth I studied the causes and nature of
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:59,775	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Human happiness emiliana Simon Thomas
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:01,567	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	My background is neuroscience
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:05,663	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	This is the meeting where the team is reviewing all the data about
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:08,735	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	These phrases so everybody's looking at a giant graph
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:11,295	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Projected on the wall
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:12,575	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	You're slightly u-shaped
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:14,111	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Curve there in that
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:16,159	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Numbers
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:18,719	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	The hand with this photo take it down
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:22,047	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And the hand like this photo would you please take it down
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:26,911	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Our kind of the winter is here
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:33,055	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	That you see the person that's receiving a more direct message is higher 11% vs 4%
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:37,663	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	When is think they noticed is it anytime they use the word sorry in a phrase like a Robert
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:43,039	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Sorry to bring this up would you please take it down. Yeah I'm sorry doesn't actually help it makes the numbers go down
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:44,831	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Really 7 and 9
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:48,159	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Are the some of the low points and those are the ones that say sorry
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:48,927	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Tillich.
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:49,695	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Don't apologize
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:51,999	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It's like it shifts
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:55,071	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	The responsibility back to you I guess it doesn't it's just
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:55,839	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It's just
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:14:01,471	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	If it's like it says it's a linguistic psychology subtle thing
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:03,775	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	But one of the things that really struck me at this meeting
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:05,055	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Different subject
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:08,383	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It is at the scientist in the room and they're looking at the graph taking in the numbers
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:10,431	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	A lot of them had this look on their face
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:12,223	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Holy

EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:19,519	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And sitting there that meeting you know this was awhile ago we both were like
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:22,079	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Did we just hear that correctly
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:25,919	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Kind of blew me back a little
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:26,687	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I was like

EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:33,599	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I had that

EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:38,207	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And literally
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:40,511	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	The next day Saturday
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:44,607	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	This is scary the world had that experience
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:51,007	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Facebook using you and me as Lab Rats for a Facebook experiment On Emotion
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:56,383	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Barely a day after we gotten off the plane from Facebook headquarters the kerfuffle occurred
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:19:02,783	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Facebook exposed as lab rats Lab Rats
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:04,063	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Nothing with your emotions
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:10,463	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	You may remember the story cuz for a hot second it was everywhere was all over Facebook
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:16,863	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	There was an academic paper had come out that showed that was scientist the company had intentionally manipulated you
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:23,263	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	User news feeds to study a person's emotional response
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:29,663	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	They basically tinkered with the news feeds about 700 thousand people
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:36,063	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	React if they saw more positive versus negative post and vice versa and they found an effective people saw a more positive
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:42,463	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	They would post more positive things themselves and vice versa effect
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:48,863	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Tiny affect the results weren't really the story the real story was there Facebook
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:55,263	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Who's messing with us
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:20:01,663	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	People went apoplectic
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:08,063	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Very uncomfortable and some people went so far as to argue
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:12,671	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Different person
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:19,071	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Had a psychological psychiatric disorder manipulating their social world
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:24,191	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Could cause him real hard make sure you read those terms and conditions my friend that's what that's the big takeaway
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:27,519	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	What you hear is a sense of betrayal
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:31,103	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	The I really wasn't aware that this space of mine was being
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:33,663	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Treated me twice and I was part of your
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:34,687	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Psychological experiments
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:37,759	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	That's Kate Crawford principal researcher at Mike's
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:41,855	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Visiting professor at MIT strong critica Facebook throughout the
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:43,647	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	There's a power imbalance
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:48,255	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I think when we look at the way that experiment was done it's an example of
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:51,839	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Highly centralized power and highly opaque power at work
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:55,679	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I don't want to see it's been a situation where we just have to blindly Trust

EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:57,983	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Here I'm thinking of
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:21:00,543	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I want to know your face book study actually
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:05,151	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Back in 2010 where they did a study looking at whether they could increase
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:05,663	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Voter turnout
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:08,991	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Quite simple design they
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:09,503	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	They came up with
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:11,039	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	You're a little
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:12,319	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Fox
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:14,367	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Pop and show you what your nearest voting booth
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:15,391	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	What is an MA
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:21,792	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Ditto in addition to that when you voted he's a button you can press it says I voted and then you'll also see the pictures of six of
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:23,072	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Your friends
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:24,608	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	What this change
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:25,632	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	The number of people who went
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:30,240	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And Facebook found that it did that if you saw a bunch of pictures
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:31,264	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Have your friends
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:32,032	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Who had voted
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:34,592	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Can you sell those pictures on Election Day
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:37,408	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	You were then 2% more likely to click the I voted
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:38,944	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Yourself presumably
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:40,736	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Because you two had gone out and
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:43,552	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Not 2% might not sound like a lot
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:46,880	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	But it was not in Tagalog and I think by the order of
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:48,928	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	340000 V
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:51,488	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Device that they estimate they actually
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:53,024	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Shift
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:59,168	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	These are people who wouldn't have voted and who they have said in there in paper and toilet paper
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:01,728	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	They increase the number of I said I buy
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:02,496	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	A340
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:05,056	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Simply by saying that your neighbor has a tattoo

EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:40,128	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Clearly because we already have that political preferences
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:41,664	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I want to come to agree with us
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:43,200	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And the people who disagree with
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:45,248	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	They weren't get this little nugget

EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:01,888	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Fact when when Andrew mentioned to her
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:08,800	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Arturo had this group and the group had a name called the trust Engineering Group
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:10,848	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	His job is to engineer
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:11,616	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Trust
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:13,408	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	When Andrew told her that Facebook
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:19,808	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	You smacking your forehead
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:22,112	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Hard these ideas that we could somehow
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:24,160	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Engineer compassion
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:26,208	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I think to some degree have a kind of
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:26,976	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Hubris in them
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:31,072	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Who are we to decide
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:33,888	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Whether we can make somebody more compassion or not
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:41,056	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	How to do highlights
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:45,920	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Couple months after a first interview we spoke to Arturo Behar
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:46,432	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Again
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:48,736	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Kerfuffle is dying down
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:50,784	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	We asked him about
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:51,552	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	All the Uproar
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:53,088	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I know this is not your work
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:54,112	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	List emotions contagious
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:56,672	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Literally like
EDL	00:23:56,672	00:23:57,696	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Hours
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:58,976	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	After we got back from that meeting
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:00,768	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	That thing erupted
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:02,304	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Do you understand the backlash
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:04,352	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	No I mean I think that
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:08,448	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	How many we
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:12,032	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	We really care about the people for you
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:13,568	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Facebook
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:18,432	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I don't think there's such a thing as
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:19,200	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	As
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:22,528	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	How many finishing up learned in this world
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:23,552	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Is that
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:25,088	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	You really have
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:25,600	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	2 respect
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:27,136	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	People's response
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:27,904	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Emotions
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:29,440	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	No matter what they are
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:31,744	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	He said the whole thing definitely
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:33,792	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Made them text
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:37,632	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	There was a moment of concern of what it would mean to the world
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:39,936	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I thought there was like this is this going to
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:41,984	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Is this going to be in that
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:43,776	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Happy Cow
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:44,288	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Do this
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:46,336	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Part of music
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:48,640	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Big Al's, here is actually one
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:50,688	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Reclaim back the word emotion
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:52,224	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And reclaim back
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:54,528	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	The ability to do
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:59,136	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Very thoughtful and careful experiment want to come back to work experiment
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:00,416	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Where you want to reclaim it
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:01,184	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	From
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:02,208	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Rimowa
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:03,488	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Well
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:08,352	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Suddenly like the word emotion in the word experiment on these things became really charged
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:10,144	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Oh yeah because I almost thought that Facebook
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:10,912	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Focus manipulator
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:11,424	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Emotion in there
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:16,800	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It's right in in in in in the talking about right now
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:18,592	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	All of the work that we do
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:19,872	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Begins
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:21,408	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	With a person asking us
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:23,200	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	For help this is Arturo's
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:25,504	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Most emphatic point he said it over and over
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:27,040	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	You know
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:28,576	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Facebook isn't just doing this for
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:31,392	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	4fun people are asking for help they need help
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:37,792	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Which point the one of the biggest challenges of living online just that you know offline
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:41,632	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Can we try and engineer trust offline for at least
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:48,032	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Read one another we do it in the super subtle ways using eye contact and facial
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:52,896	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Expressions in posture and tone of voice all this nonverbal stuff and of course when we go online
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:25:57,248	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	We don't have access to any of that in the absence of that feedback
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:25:58,784	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	How do we
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:04,672	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Communicate what what does communication turn into
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:09,280	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Best thrift on this I got to say is a Louis CK on Conan
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:11,072	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It's just this thing
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:11,840	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It's bad
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:14,912	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Is a scrape bit about technology and kids
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:15,936	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Your kids are mean
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:17,472	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And it's cuz you're trying it out
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:21,312	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Fat
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:24,640	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Anime see the kids face scrunch up in the doesn't feel good too
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:25,408	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	McPherson
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:27,712	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Do that tonight that you put together start with doing the mean
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:29,248	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	When they write your
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:30,016	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Bat
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:33,600	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Religious cult that was fun I like that
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:35,648	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Antioch
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:37,184	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Back to Arturo I mean I think
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:38,464	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	How about
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:41,280	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Like what it means to be
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:43,840	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	In the presence of a friend or a lover
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:46,656	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:49,984	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And how are you build experiences
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:52,544	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	That facilitate that
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:54,080	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	When you cannot be physically
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:54,592	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Together
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:57,408	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Arturo says that's really all he's up to his just tryna nut
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:58,432	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	What tiny bit
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:26:59,712	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Senator
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:02,784	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Online sales are a little bit closer
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:04,064	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	To how they are off
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:05,856	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And I got to say if he can do that
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:12,256	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	By engineering a couple of phrases like hey Robert would you mind etcetera etcetera will them I'm all for it
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:14,048	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Why not take the position
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:16,608	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	That to create a company
EDL	00:27:16,608	00:27:18,656	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It stands between two people who
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:21,216	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Who are interacting
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:26,592	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And then giving them boxes and statuses and and a little
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:30,432	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	An advertising until this is now
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:34,016	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Doing a service this is just
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:34,528	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	This is
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:39,904	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	This is a way to win yourself into the ordinary business of social intercourse
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:41,184	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And make money on
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:44,512	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I know you're acting like this group of people now is going to try to
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:46,560	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	To create a vehicle
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:52,960	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	The moral equivalent of an actual conversation if it's probably not engineer above and second I don't believe
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:56,288	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Leave that for a moment cuz they're going to just
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:28:02,176	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Going figure out other ways in which to make a revenue enhancer no I don't think it's one of the other I think they're in it
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:03,968	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	For the money in fact if
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:06,016	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	They can figure this out and make
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:07,296	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	The internet universe
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:09,600	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	More inclusive
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:10,368	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	To trust
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:11,392	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Less annoying
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:14,720	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It could mean trillions of dollars so yeah it's the money
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:17,536	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	But still that doesn't negate the fact that we have to build the system
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:21,376	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Right that we have to make the internet a little bit better that's fine
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:23,680	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	This idea however
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:25,216	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	That
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:26,496	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	You're going to have
EDL	00:28:26,496	00:28:27,520	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	How to coach people

EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:30,080	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Use of the relay
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:32,896	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Tell him you're sorry
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:35,712	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Tell him to do so here's the formula for this
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:39,040	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	He doesn't want he did some of you you need
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:42,880	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	To repair the here are the seven ways you might repair that to do all that
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:44,416	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It's
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:46,976	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It's as if the Hallmark card company

EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:56,448	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Father's Day and birthdays just spread its wings out into the hole
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:28:56,960	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	First of July
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:29:00,288	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I don't think that's a wonderful thing
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:02,336	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I think you know I was like I didn't offend you
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:06,176	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I mean yeah I keep in mind how this thing came about I mean they tried to get
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:08,224	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	People to talk to each other they gave him the blank to
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:09,760	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Xbox One nobody used it
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:13,344	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Right today like okay let's come up with some stock phrases that yes
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:14,368	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Are generic
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:15,904	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	But think about the next step
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:18,208	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	After you send the message
EDL	00:29:18,208	00:29:19,744	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It's saying you know Jab
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:24,096	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I like the photo please take it down presumably then you and I get into a conversation maybe I
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:25,632	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Explain myself I say
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:27,424	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Oh my God I'm so sorry I didn't realize
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:28,192	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	You didn't like that
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:28,960	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	But I just thought
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:31,008	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	That was an amazing night
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:33,824	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I just thought that was a great night I didn't realize you thought you looked
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:35,616	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	So sorry I'll take it down
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:37,152	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	School signal
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:41,504	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Unfortunately we're having that conversation as a Next Step
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:44,832	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	How many of the birthday cards that you sent to first cousins
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:46,624	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Have resulted in a conversation
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:53,280	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Maybe I'll see that's the thing I'm actually not they're really the opposite of what you're saying their conversation substitute
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:55,072	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Maybe
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:56,352	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Maybe their conversation starters
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:29:59,168	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Maybe that's the Deep experiment
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:01,728	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Are they conversation starters or substance
EDL	00:30:01,728	00:30:03,008	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	I hope their conversation starters
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:04,288	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Yeah
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:05,568	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Cuz maybe that would be a beginning
EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:07,616	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	It kind of my mind goes back
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:08,128	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	2
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:10,688	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Like the beginning of the automobile age
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:14,528	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	This is how we interpret
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:15,808	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	There was a time
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:17,856	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	When automobiles were new
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:19,648	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And you know they didn't have
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:20,928	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Turn signals
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:23,744	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	The tools they did have like the horn
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:25,792	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Didn't necessarily indicate
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:32,192	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	All the things that we use that indicate wasn't clear what the horn was actually there to do was it there to say hello or is it the
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:33,984	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	There to take it out of the way
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:37,056	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And overtime
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:38,592	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	We created norms
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:41,408	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	We created roads with Lanes
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:42,432	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	We created turn signal
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:43,968	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	That
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:45,504	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Primarily there for other people
EDL	00:30:46,272	00:30:48,576	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	So that we can coexist in this great
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:50,112	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	Flow without crashing into
EDL	00:30:51,392	00:30:52,416	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And we still have road rage
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:56,256	| radiolab_podcast15trustengineers |	And we still have road rage we still have places where those tools are incomplete
