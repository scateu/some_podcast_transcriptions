EDL	00:00:20,992	00:00:21,760	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Anyhow
EDL	00:00:21,760	00:00:24,320	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So what have you been up to any microphone
EDL	00:00:24,832	00:00:27,392	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I think we're going to share cuz what else are we going to do
EDL	00:00:27,392	00:00:27,904	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I think

EDL	00:00:35,072	00:00:41,472	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Go like this and today that's like that story about when things for
EDL	00:00:41,472	00:00:42,752	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Far far away
EDL	00:00:42,752	00:00:43,264	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Combiner head
EDL	00:00:43,776	00:00:44,800	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Hit very close
EDL	00:00:45,824	00:00:47,360	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Just put your hand on his forehead
EDL	00:00:47,360	00:00:52,992	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Or over my bowel satisfying comes to us from producers Simon Adler
EDL	00:00:52,992	00:00:53,760	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And anemic
EDL	00:00:55,040	00:00:56,576	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Okay okay
EDL	00:00:56,576	00:00:58,368	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So you're going to tell something about something
EDL	00:00:59,392	00:01:01,184	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Who should I start
EDL	00:01:01,184	00:01:02,208	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Okay so
EDL	00:01:02,720	00:01:05,024	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	We've been exploring what happened on May 18th
EDL	00:01:05,536	00:01:06,560	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	2003
EDL	00:01:06,560	00:01:08,096	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	In the great city of Brussels
EDL	00:01:08,608	00:01:10,400	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Specifically
EDL	00:01:10,400	00:01:11,168	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Skarbek
EDL	00:01:11,168	00:01:11,680	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Starbucks
EDL	00:01:12,704	00:01:15,008	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	When is mr. Gatti's in Brussels story starts with this
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:16,544	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So
EDL	00:01:16,544	00:01:18,336	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It was it was around
EDL	00:01:18,336	00:01:21,408	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	11:30 p.m. and I was
EDL	00:01:21,408	00:01:22,944	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	With one of my colleagues
EDL	00:01:22,944	00:01:25,504	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Add a restaurant to have one of the good meal of the day
EDL	00:01:25,504	00:01:26,272	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	This
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:28,320	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Is Emmanuel Emmanuel Williams
EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:33,952	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I am the the one everybody calls when should hit the fan now let's put it that way
EDL	00:01:33,952	00:01:37,792	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And that evening Emmanuel along with much of the rest of the country
EDL	00:01:37,792	00:01:40,608	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Was waiting around for that day is national election
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:42,144	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The results
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:43,424	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	For all the
EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:45,216	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Difference parliamentary assembly
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:47,776	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Manuel's mind was on something else
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:52,384	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Because across the country that day millions of people had just voted on computers
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:56,992	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Belgium was in the early days of experimenting with electronic voting
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:01:59,040	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And so instead of filling
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:04,416	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Paper ballot in the voting booth with a touch screen computer and and folders with walk-in
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:05,184	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Insertive
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:06,464	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	White credit card size
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:10,048	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Car tinting machine and then vote by selecting names on that
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:15,680	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And I it was a manual job to make sure that all these hundreds of computers
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:16,448	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Work proper
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:17,984	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I'm an IT guy
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:20,032	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Something like that at that point
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:24,384	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	At 11:30 at night after the polls are closed besides the usual
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:25,664	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Computer glitches
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:30,016	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It seems like everything has gone well and so we were there were two of us
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:31,552	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	He and one of his fellow ID
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:33,344	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	If you guys waiting for the others I guess
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:39,488	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	To talk about the other on the back for a job well done and that's when the
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:42,816	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	That's when his
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:43,328	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Phone ring
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:44,608	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It wasn't
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:48,192	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And it was one of the officials of the ministry
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:51,008	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	They said that they had a problem that they had detected a problem in sky
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:53,568	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And so some okay we're coming over
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:03:00,224	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And so you pay the the check you hop in the car and I hope we paid the check.
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:08,416	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	15 minutes later they arrived together Black Escalade cuz I like to imagine and they they enter the polling
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:13,536	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Station townhouse of Sky building with big tall ceiling
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:17,888	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It's a very old building filled with this crowd of confused looking people
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:23,520	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Well they explained to us that going through the numbers they noticed one of the contestants
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:29,664	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Relatively unknown Communist Party candidate Maria vendaval gold had a very high number of votes
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:30,688	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	From this one
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:32,736	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Polling station
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:34,528	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And taking a closer look
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:38,624	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	They noticed that the number of votes for this contestant was
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:40,416	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Impossible
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:42,976	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Impossible
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:49,120	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Yeah if mathematical impossibility essentially she received more votes than there were voters who could possibly vote for
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:56,800	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And so as a manual hearing this some serious is this just a fluke is there an explanation fraud
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:57,824	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Thinking fraud
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:58,336	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I'm smelling
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:00,128	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It could have been tampering
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:04,992	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I could have been a bug it could have been a hardware glitch could have been you could be anything
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:06,272	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Yeah absolutely
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:09,088	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	First thing first they got all of the ballads
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:10,112	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Does white
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:12,928	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Plastic magnetic cards that the voters had loaded their votes on
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:14,976	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Recount it
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:17,024	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Reinserting every single
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:19,071	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Magnetic card one by one
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:22,655	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Several hours so now it's like 1:30 in the morning and they print out
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:24,191	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The new recounted
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:27,775	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Hold it up against the old one and they
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:30,079	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	How are the exact same results
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:31,871	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	For every single contestant
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:32,895	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	To the vote
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:36,991	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Except the contestants which had had this
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:39,039	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Abnormal number of folks
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:41,087	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	This time around Maria had far fewer
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:44,415	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And at that point one of my college did the math
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:50,047	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And set the difference between the number of votes she had in the first count and the number of votes she had in the
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:53,119	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It's exactly 4090
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:55,935	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	4096
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:56,959	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Fewer votes
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:58,751	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Does that mean anything to you
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:02,079	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	4096 know it means nothing to me
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:05,663	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Well 4096 is not a random number
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:08,223	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Is a
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:13,087	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It's something about the number at this like I don't know. I don't know the answer but I have
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:14,367	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	This a deep sense
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:15,135	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I'm feeling tingly
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:20,255	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So if you guys are it people and you heard the number 4096 you feeling
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:24,351	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Woodruff
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:26,655	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	To every it guy in the room
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:29,215	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Number 4096 West was very meaningful
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:29,983	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	In fact
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:36,383	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It was a clue a clue to a cosmic culprit capable
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,151	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Is there a Bigfoot
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:43,551	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Computers of swinging our elections
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:49,695	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I can't float crashing our cars
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:53,023	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:56,863	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Reminding us just how small and at the mercy of the universe
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:05:59,423	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	We really are
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:06,591	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So it so it so why why is 4096 so important
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:08,639	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Okay well to explain
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:11,967	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I'd like to backup
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:14,783	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Potato salad
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:16,575	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Do the morning of the alarm
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:20,159	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Okay so cold open and at some point
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:24,255	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Live there white card through that card reader in
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:27,583	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Maria vendaval received her first book
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:30,911	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The registers booth number one for Maria
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:34,751	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Yeah now when that happened inside the computer in its memory
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:36,031	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Is 0 switch to A1
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:41,407	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And I mean that both in terms of her vote total and also in in how a computer
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:43,199	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The way computer works
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:44,991	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Is that everything is stored in memory
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:46,271	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I memory is binary
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:48,575	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It's either a 0 or a 1
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:49,855	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Either on or off
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:50,879	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Tear It Off
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:51,647	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	In one
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:53,951	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I think we all know this right there
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:56,511	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Setmore we've heard it at least that deep down
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:58,303	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Computers is everything one
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:01,375	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Enter in this specific case what what that means is
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:04,703	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	All these individual votes that Maria would get throughout the day
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:07,263	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	They were all stored as as just once
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:09,055	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	As these individual ones
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:13,663	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Not when you're limited to Counting with just one way to do it is to tally
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:16,223	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Like you doing groups of 5 on a truck
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:17,247	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Diagonal line
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:21,599	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	But when that Telly starts to get high
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:23,647	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It becomes incredibly inefficient
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:24,159	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Hope that way
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:27,743	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So instead to save time energy and computing power
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:29,279	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Computers do a little bit of math
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:31,583	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	8 Day Count using powers
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:33,631	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Powers of 2
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:35,679	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Remember powers of 2
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:37,471	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Made something squared
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:41,567	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Exactly two squared or two to the second power 2 x 2
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:42,079	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Is 4
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:44,639	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	3rd power 2 X 2 X
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:46,431	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	2 is 8 to the 4th
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:47,711	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	16
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:52,319	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Set a Rosetta Rosetta Rosetta so how is it a computer is doing that right
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:57,183	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	LP visualizes imagine inside a computer's memory there's this
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,719	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Dreaming of 13 Light
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:02,047	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Light bulbs that it people called
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:05,119	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Each one representing a different Power of Two
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:07,423	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Stick with me here first
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:14,591	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	First light bulb represent anything to the zero power equals 1
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:18,687	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Second light bulb
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:19,455	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Which is 2
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:21,503	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The third bulb
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:25,087	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Etcetera etcetera etcetera
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:29,695	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	When Maria received her first book
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:31,487	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	A little bit of electricity
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:33,023	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Was sent to that first light bulb
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:37,887	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	2 to the 0 is 1
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:44,287	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Now what you got her second vote this time some electricity was sent to that second ball
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:46,335	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Turning it on representing two
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:52,479	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Because two votes are stored in that second light bulb what what the computer does simultaneously
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:54,015	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Is turn off that first
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:57,855	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So to be clear when she got her second vote the first bald was turned off
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:09:01,951	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Which represents ^ 1 with turn.
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:04,255	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So it's now using only one bulb
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:05,535	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	To represent tube
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:07,071	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Oh okay
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:13,471	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Now in order to represent numbers that aren't powers of to all the computer does is turn on mulch
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:14,495	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Will bulbs at 1
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:15,519	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	A sequence
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:21,663	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Of power to for example when Maria got her third returned on the Earth and
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:28,063	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Second light bulb because one plus two equals three when she got her fourth
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:33,439	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It turned off the first and second light bulb and turn on the 3rd
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:37,023	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	V boat turns on the 1st and 3rd
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:43,423	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	What you got to say her 17th vote it is turned on V bald
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:45,215	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	16 + the first ball
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:48,799	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Equaling 70
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:53,151	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And so on and so on adding up these powers of 2 and with that respect
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:54,687	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	4096
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:55,711	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Is a power of two
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:10:00,063	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	C2 that number is one that they're like
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,599	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Is that what that is
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:03,391	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Yeah it's the 13th
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:04,927	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Bit of memory
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:05,695	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Which meant
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:10,047	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	That at some point during that day something somehow turned that bit off
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:12,607	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Flipped what should have been a 02 A1
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:14,399	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Yeah it was It was a
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:15,423	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	A binary flip
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:18,239	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Your mind just went there and he shouldn't
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:21,823	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Yeah I love that you call the IT people are like
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:27,199	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Oh and all the non it people are like what
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:29,247	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Well do he just trade
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:32,319	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Okay so you know that it was just one bits
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:33,087	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Flipped
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:35,135	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	What will what does that mean
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:37,439	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So we knew that
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,207	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The results
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,487	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Could be
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:41,535	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Trace back to the 13th bit
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:47,167	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Flipping what we didn't know was what caused the bit to flip okay so what would that's your next question what what
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:48,447	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	What could cause if it
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:48,959	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The flip
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:49,983	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	No idea
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:59,199	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	What did you spend it could have been a could have been in any number of things
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:05,087	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And so we each in the following days we got access to absolutely everything
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:07,391	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	First thing they checked could have been
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:08,159	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Software
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:10,463	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So we carried out random tests on
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:14,047	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Source code for any bugs that could have caused this bit to flip
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:15,071	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	But there was nothing
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:18,911	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So we were fairly confident that it wasn't a software error
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:20,959	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Okay so if it's not software
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:22,751	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It Hardware right well
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:29,151	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	We got the machine that was actually used in that polling station on the day of the election
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:33,759	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And Counting and they ran a bunch of memory tests on it to see if something came up
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:36,831	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	To see if some defect in the physical memory could have caused
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:38,623	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Respectively what came back on that
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:40,159	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Nothing
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:41,951	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Not a single error
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:45,279	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So the memory on that computer was working fine
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:47,071	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	What's up what the heck are you left
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:49,119	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Not much
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:55,263	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	As far as we were concerned this one computer had a glitch which called
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:55,775	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Give wrong answer
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:12:02,175	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Unsatisfying answer that's the way things go we just simply had no proof
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:03,967	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	What caused the bit to flip
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:05,247	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	We just don't know
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:08,575	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	That's the way it it turned out
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:13,439	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I'm so over the next couple of days Emmanuel and his
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:15,487	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Team sat down to write up defined
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:18,047	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Half expecting that once finished
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:20,095	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Report would be filed away
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:21,375	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Never mention
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:25,727	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	However hello hello Brussels can you hear us
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:26,495	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Hyzaar
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:27,007	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Simon in Smash
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:28,799	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	That was not
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:30,591	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I have a
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:31,359	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Your guest here
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:32,639	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I arms
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:34,175	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	He was plenty of tea
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,991	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Thank you
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:38,015	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Yeah thank you Natalie
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:43,647	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Hello
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:44,927	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Hello is this Zoe
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:48,255	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Yeah yeah it's me hello
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:49,023	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	All thanks
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:50,047	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Tibet flight
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:57,471	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Zoe's you know I'm a member of the volume and and back in 2003
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:13:01,311	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Young and freshly elected to Parliament Iowa's 28
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:03,103	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	429
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,639	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	What's the age of most of the MPC
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:06,431	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Yeah it's that
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:10,015	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	She was generally aware of what went down in scar back that there was a
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:12,319	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	This computer problem someone got some extra votes
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:13,343	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It was read
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:14,111	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Trench
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:15,135	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And for me
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:16,159	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It was really
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:17,183	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Concern
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:23,583	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Because our most concern is the people can trust the electronic system and wisdom
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:24,351	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	DeSoto
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:27,423	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	We are not sure the people can trust the system
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:30,239	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Tok we waited for the report of the specialist
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:31,263	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And finally
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:32,543	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	But three weeks after the election
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:37,663	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Yeah we only what we ended up writing that at some point during the day
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:39,455	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The 13th bit
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:39,967	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Netflix
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:42,783	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	That's how we roll
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:44,319	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Basically
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:45,343	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Means nothing
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:49,951	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Means nothing then that's what you think it no no no no there there must be more
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:53,535	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Nobody can understand this sort of vocabulary
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:56,095	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I was confused with explanation
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:59,167	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Because way down at the bottom of the report in the final paragraph
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:03,263	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The only thing they said about a possible cause was
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:03,775	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And I quote
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:07,871	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	This phenomenon is extensively described in these specialized illiterate
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:09,663	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Yes we did right
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:11,967	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And what were you referring to their
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:13,503	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Nothing in particular
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:16,575	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	What's this
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:17,599	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Why
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:18,879	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Did not
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:19,647	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Explain what
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:20,927	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Really happening
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:24,767	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So Zoe went to her fellow parliamentarians and was like there was a
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:25,535	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Problem
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:29,119	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	We don't know what really happens like we got to look into this
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:30,399	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	What can we check
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:32,191	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Who can check
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:33,215	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	WeChat
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:40,127	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	But the people do older member of the parliament to say oh yeah she know she's
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:40,895	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Daryl
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:41,919	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Fringe
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:45,759	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Style and she's speaking about problems basically
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:46,271	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Forget about
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:52,415	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It's done we are elected election our girl there was no problem
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:55,487	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	But I said no no
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:58,047	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	We must find out what
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:59,327	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Where is really
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:00,351	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The problems
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,375	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Unspeakable
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:04,191	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:07,263	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Zoe contacted me and she did send me the paperwork
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:11,103	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Scary stories about to the guy named David
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:11,871	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Cologne
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:14,431	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	He is a member of a group called
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:21,855	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And we are fighting for ethics into electronic voting
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:28,255	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Against voting machine yes but interesting way he's also like a Hotshot ikigai works for the European Parliament
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:31,327	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Yeah and that's an IT people I tell you don't trust her
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:38,239	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Don't put everything in or on for a long time you reached out and asked
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:44,639	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Can you help me understand what are these random bitten versions like what is it called
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:51,039	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I did computer science and bits are not flipping what are they talking about
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:57,439	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So I needed to find out so I guess I started to
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:16:03,839	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Google to ask what could explain the Articles or blog post
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:10,239	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	These are the things could always be traced back to some software bug
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:16,639	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I'm eating something else totally satisfied comprised of new Search terms blah blah
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:22,527	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Articles that made this strange claim
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:23,807	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Good shape
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:25,087	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	A bit of memory
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:26,879	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Wait what
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:29,951	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	They said yes
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:33,535	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	If the cosmic ray touch your computer the right way at the right spot
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:34,815	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It could change
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:35,839	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	A bit
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:37,375	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	From zero to one
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:39,167	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Gamma rays
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:41,215	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Ain't that Belgium
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:43,007	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	In favor
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:45,311	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I'm a particular Waterloo
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:49,919	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	We're not going to be able to use any of this statement
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:52,223	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So you're saying that
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:53,503	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Created this effect
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:54,783	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	In Belgium on that day
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:57,599	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Was a Zing from deep space
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:59,647	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	That was the theory
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:00,671	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The David kmak
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:02,463	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	My
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:06,303	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	First reaction West
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:08,863	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	But then it became a bit
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:11,679	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Pizza because I found out about
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:14,751	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Is IBM IBM research
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:15,775	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Freeman's mind
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:20,383	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	IBM paper from the 70s
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:21,407	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	In in it
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:27,551	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Electronic data processing center give me the latest news about random bit flipping and
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:29,855	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Problem with computer memory
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:32,159	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The report explain how in the 60s
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:36,767	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	NASA had noticed these random bit flips in their satellite
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:43,167	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And then more recently how IBM itself Problems by the computer can be displayed and had studied their computers
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:46,239	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	At higher altitude so closer to
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,263	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	A space that's it
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:49,311	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Closer to the sky
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:50,335	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Closer to God
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:53,919	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And I found out that they were more bit flipping
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:55,967	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Hope they're all down at the sea level
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:18:00,063	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	In the only explanation they could come up with for for what
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:00,831	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Be causing this
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:02,111	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Weather
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:04,159	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	With cosmic rays
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:08,511	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Yes when they investigated they found out that it could have been cosmic rays causing problems
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:11,071	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Okay
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:14,143	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Ghost cosmic rays essentially
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:15,423	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Charged particle
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:17,215	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Enso electronic systems
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:23,615	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Can get affected by the way is Professor Bharat electrical
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:28,991	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Jaringan computer science department Endwell brat wasn't involved in that specific IBM paper
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:31,551	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	He has essentially dedicated his life
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:32,831	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	To studying the effects
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:33,855	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The cosmic rays
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:40,255	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So we started noticing on the surface of the Earth this problem started around 2001
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:42,303	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	1 mm to time frame
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:43,327	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Recent
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:46,143	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Right and they helped me get me
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:50,495	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Is this a thing that people know about me is just like a first time I hear of it
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:55,359	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I don't know if she should continue on this road go to the cosmic ray land
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:58,687	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Narrative or do you want cosmic ray land
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:19:01,247	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Oh I like I loved it that that's a choice
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:02,527	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Place where we get to decide
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:03,039	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I am torn
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:04,831	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Well I don't know it maybe
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:08,415	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I think we dive in that we get we give some
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:10,719	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Okay okay okay
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:14,047	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I said so according to bharath to understand what happened that day in Belgium
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:16,607	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	We have to go back to a long time ago
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:18,399	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Wait for it
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:20,959	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	In a galaxy far far away
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:30,175	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I'm going to General Life way too much
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:33,503	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Is in the distant galaxies there was a very very old star
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:41,183	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	That exploded and went to star explode it sent out the huge amount of
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:44,511	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Material all sorts of little tiny charged particle
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:45,279	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Discharge
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:47,327	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Thrown into space
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:53,215	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And this particles are going to travel through space
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:55,263	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	For millions of light years
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:15,743	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Xiamen
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:22,143	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	These particles are passing through other galaxies they get disconnected they get prepped going or
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:24,191	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Around songs by gravitational pull
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:27,007	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Until finally on May 18th
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:28,031	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	2003
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:32,127	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	One of these particles with lots and lots of energy
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:33,151	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Entries are solar
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:40,319	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And not long after that comes into the atmosphere
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:42,623	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Ashes into an Earthly atmospheric Park
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:44,415	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And in that moment
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:50,047	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Energy transferred to most free particle potentially in hands off a little bit of energy
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:52,607	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Causing that newly energized atmospheric Mart
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:59,519	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Just started heading towards Earth on its way down its Max into a couple other part
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:04,127	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Passing some of that energy on again causing those particles to fall
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:06,687	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And crashing other particle
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:12,319	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And this happens again and again as the particles and the cosmic energy catapult towards the surface of the Earth
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:16,159	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And stop you get this Kaskade it's a shower of all these particles
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:18,976	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	From the doorway to look like a Christmas tree
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:25,376	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Down at sea level
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:27,936	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Down on the surface
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:28,960	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Define discount
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:29,984	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Belgium
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:32,288	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Bose Electronics
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:34,336	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	System that was counting the world
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:40,736	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	In Belgium coming along humming along annoying its own way of telling the votes by
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:41,504	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Turning on those lights
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:48,672	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The switch that turns on those light bulbs is called a transistor but then start turns on or off
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:50,208	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And that creates
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:52,256	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	-31 + 0
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:55,584	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	When it's on it sends out a little bit of electricity switching on a bulb
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:56,608	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	But the thing is
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:58,400	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Different sisters can be tricked
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:21:58,912	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Into turning on
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:00,704	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So imagine
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:03,776	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Suddenly this particle from outer space
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:10,176	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Come zooming down and enters that voting machine getting precisely the transistor that
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:11,200	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Troll that 13th bit
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:18,624	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	That instant the transistor is tricked and sends out a burst of electricity to that 13th
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:21,184	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	212 powder
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:22,208	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And the bits

EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:25,280	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Is 0 with change to A-1
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:26,560	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And from the heavens
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:29,376	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Does 4096 vote

EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:37,824	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Again David glow
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:39,104	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I don't know I mean
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:41,152	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Like if I took both cosmic ray
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:42,688	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	O on one side
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:44,992	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I'm afraid that people will
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:46,528	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Take me for somebody crazy
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:48,064	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	But
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:52,672	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	You can read it too if you Google those words you will find a lot of
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:54,720	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Scientific stuff talking about that
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:57,536	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Inside out not long after David and Zoe met up
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:59,840	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Anne and David told her what he'd found
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:01,120	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	That that is pause
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:02,912	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Who knows
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:05,472	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	That the vote was changed by the cops

EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:09,824	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Cosmic ray
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:12,128	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Put down in the computer
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:13,152	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And it's making me
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:16,224	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It's not possible you are really sure
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:21,856	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I've got no clue if that's the true explanation or not and there is no way to prove
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:23,648	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	That is a cosmic ray
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:25,696	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	But I mean it
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:28,256	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The only thing which match their explanation
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:31,328	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I will never can
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:35,168	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Explain that in the party or going to laugh
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:43,104	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Aware of all of this
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:45,664	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	At the next
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:46,432	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Session of Parliament
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:48,992	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I just decided
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:52,576	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	To ask a question to the new minister
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:54,368	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Who was responsible for the election
EDL	00:23:55,392	00:23:57,440	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Session gets underway
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:58,976	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And eventually
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:01,280	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The agenda turns design
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:03,584	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Nope there's no audio recording of this
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:05,120	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Possession but based on transcript
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:06,400	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It went something like
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:09,984	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	She walked up to the podium at the front of the chamber
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:12,032	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	NBA
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:19,200	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	We should proceed alone but should be nice
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:21,504	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	She summarized but it happened in skarbek
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:26,112	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And then explained what David had told
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:27,648	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Better
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:28,416	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Distr
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:29,440	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Which inversion
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:30,976	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Cayo Costa
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:33,024	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Cosmic ray
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:35,584	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Coolest program in the computer
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:41,984	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The the room was that joking hahaha
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:44,288	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So you should know come here with
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:45,568	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The little green man
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:47,872	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Dumb dumb
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:49,152	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And the minister
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:51,968	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	You say yeah yeah poop worried was
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:57,600	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Morrow are off somewhere but we see he has no problem with the results of the election
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:00,416	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Without the minister
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:01,696	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Serta motion to move on
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:04,256	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	But before her time could expire
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:06,304	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Avant
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:08,864	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Don't jump back in basically said
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:09,376	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Wait a second
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:11,424	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Think about what this could mean
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:13,472	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	If this is true like
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:14,752	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Can we trust these machines
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:16,544	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So I asked
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:17,824	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Are you sure
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:19,360	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	There was no other
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:21,152	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Cosmic rays somewhere
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:23,968	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Change some of the results of the election
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:26,528	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And the minister
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:30,112	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	After pausing for a moment
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:31,648	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Admit
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:32,672	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	You was not sure
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:39,328	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And when the minister said yeah press the other problem we don't know
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:41,888	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	There was a strength silence
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:46,752	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And nobody can't laugh anymore
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:53,408	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Democracy and stars do not get along
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:56,736	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Apparently Debbie dips efecto dingo dingo I think
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:59,040	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Someone here needs to hold the skepticism
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:05,440	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I'll be scampi the skeptic what is what are the odds questions
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:06,720	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And that this does happen
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:09,536	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	That that a cosmic ray can hit a computer and goofed
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:10,560	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I mean
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:12,608	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The only thing I can say is
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:15,424	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I mean even a manual will concede that
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:19,008	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Cosmic radiation can have an effect on electronic computers
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:24,384	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And brats and his team have actually sympathized is happening this respect the mid flip
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:27,712	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	We will actually put the computer engineer accelerator
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:34,112	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It's usually say cyclotrons which is basically this mini controlled supernova
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:40,512	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I told magic to me but what they do within cyclotron bacon get you the.
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:41,536	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Is concrete bunker
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:43,584	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Point the particle beam added
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:49,728	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Electronic systems working read drag all the wires out of the room blender few buttons to post
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:52,800	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	B21 the light comes on alarm sounds
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:54,080	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Meantime
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:27:00,480	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It's called Beantown
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:06,880	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	They blast a computer with these tiny particles a million particles
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:10,464	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Or II just like those cosmic rays flying through space
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:16,096	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And as is happening Bharat says you can sit there and watch the big flips
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:20,448	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And given this fact would so he was really asking was
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:22,496	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	If the
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:24,032	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Extrovert where I'm at
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:25,568	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Photos of 96
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:27,104	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Small bit sleeping
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:29,152	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Then would you notice
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:34,528	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Like what if a candidate just got 32 extra votes that invisibly changed and out
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:36,832	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	That that's the pot
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:41,696	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It's only when the computer produce an impossible result
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:44,256	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	That you can tell
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:45,792	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	That day was something wrong
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:52,448	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The tip of the iceberg
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:28:01,664	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	You want us to just throw the breaker do you guys want to come in and
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:03,968	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Cintas is here what you do and then we'll come in and ruin it

EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:17,024	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Can we come back we are driving full-steam ahead into that iceberg
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:19,328	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Figure out just how deep it goes
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:27,520	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	What an interesting metaphor that the mixture going to drive a car
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:33,920	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	You have to ask mrs. Vanderbilt your third grade teacher to go back to the

EDL	00:29:12,576	00:29:18,976	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:22,048	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:25,888	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Basically I want to hear about this
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:27,680	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I kid you know did something
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:31,008	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It just means you lean back and say whoa
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:31,776	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	How do they do that
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:36,384	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:37,152	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Back to you
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:43,808	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:48,672	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:51,232	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	We're interested in the
EDL	00:29:51,232	00:29:52,512	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Specific moments where
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:56,864	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with the test

EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:23,232	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Hey Betty
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:26,048	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Jad and Robert Radiolab
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:28,864	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So I so we just heard that 8 is that a single
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:30,656	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Cosmic ray from deep space
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:33,472	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Flipped a particular election result
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:36,544	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I guess the next question is like you know why is this happening
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:43,456	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	All the time some of the I'm well if you mean like how often do those charged particles hit Earth
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:46,016	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	We are bombarded by this particle
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:47,040	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Quite often
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:50,368	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Is cosmic rays
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:53,440	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Back having the coming
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:31:01,632	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Yep they're coming for you right now
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:05,728	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Somebody you are getting thousands of these particles going through
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:13,152	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	What an animal inside a building you're still going to get all those particles cuz most of these particles
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:16,736	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Cannot be stopped Pages go through anything and everything
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:19,296	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So Pratt seems pretty sure of
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:20,832	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Yes yes
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:22,624	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Simon Iver like weight
EDL	00:31:22,624	00:31:23,904	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	We got to see this
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:26,464	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Parcels
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:32,608	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Apparently Elder these particles are just too small to be seen with the naked eye
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:37,472	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	We are currently in the studio lacking the place out brought did tell us there's something we can build
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:42,592	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Something called a cloud chamber with which is basically just an upside-down cup you filled with vapor
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:46,688	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Yeah that might let us see the trails these particles leave behind
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:49,760	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	If you can make one that would be really really good
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:51,808	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Here's what you're going to need
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:53,344	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Make your very own at home
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:32:00,256	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Cloud chamber now it turns out there's a lot of YouTube videos showing you how to do this
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:04,096	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Chamber 1 starting a kid who looks about 4 years old
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:05,632	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Outer space
EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:12,032	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So we had a pretty good chance of making it work
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:18,432	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	We got dry ice cast iron pan on my kitchen flipped it over
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:19,712	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The chunks of dry ice
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:25,600	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The metal cooling down
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:33,024	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Most beautiful
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:34,560	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Hazing
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:36,608	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	A metal pan was singing
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:37,376	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Listen to
EDL	00:32:37,376	00:32:38,400	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Puretone
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:39,936	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Shut up next
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:45,824	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Take a see-through plastic cup 24 oz
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:46,592	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Friends
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:49,152	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Had a little bit more red and purple
EDL	00:32:49,664	00:32:55,552	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Thick adults in the bottom of the cup hold it in place with magnets on either side of the south magnets Chad
EDL	00:32:55,552	00:33:00,416	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So that felt and rubbing alcohol pretty thoroughly soaked
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:03,232	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Turn the cup upside down under the Nile very cold
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:06,816	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Cast iron pan replace with modeling clay
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:10,144	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Overhead lights off flashlight on Amite at the base of a cup
EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:12,192	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And then
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:15,008	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Wait let's watch for it
EDL	00:33:18,848	00:33:21,920	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	How is this thing going to work or what are we trying to see here
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:24,224	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So what we're looking for what should happen
EDL	00:33:24,736	00:33:27,040	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Is that that cold metal is going to make
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:28,320	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The alcohol vapor
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:29,856	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Inside the cup condensed
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:31,392	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And I turn into a cloud
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:37,792	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Michigan to make a cloud
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:38,560	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Sissy
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:44,960	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Tiny little particles shooting through and we won't be able to see the particle itself but we will be able to see the trail they leave behind
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:48,032	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And it's supposed to be very similar to
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:51,360	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The trail that an airplane leaves behind in this country
EDL	00:33:51,360	00:33:57,760	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Contrail exactly so what so what we're going to see is he's like tiny little airplanes are tiny little contrails inside this
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:33:58,272	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Asbury Park
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:33:59,808	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Exactly
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:02,880	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	All three of us are on our knees in the studio
EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:07,232	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It's black at the moment the only light is emanating from a headlamp on the inside
EDL	00:34:14,656	00:34:16,192	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	But maybe it's one of those like
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:18,240	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Watched pot never boils
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:21,056	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Nothing happened I don't think there's enough fog in there
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:22,336	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Tomorrow
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:31,040	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	After about an hour of this
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:33,600	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Halo around
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:38,208	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Pulling up YouTube on our phones
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:44,608	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Checkered scientific method to work via things to do
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:45,376	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Okay
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:47,424	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I see behind
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:49,728	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Just in case
EDL	00:34:52,544	00:34:53,568	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Alone in the dark
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:55,872	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The little beam of light
EDL	00:35:16,608	00:35:18,400	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I thought one
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:24,544	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Very very tiny white thin thin thread
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:27,104	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Materialize
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:31,712	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	They're there I'm seeing a bunch of offended in the cloud
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:33,504	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Holding a shape for just a moment
EDL	00:35:34,016	00:35:38,880	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	How do you spell disappearing
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:43,488	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Oh well
EDL	00:35:43,488	00:35:46,560	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	We couldn't not see them
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:50,144	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Film
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:51,680	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Three there
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:53,728	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Doan's coming right through me
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:12,672	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Okay I can now tell you not just because someone told me
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:14,208	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Because I saw it for myself
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:16,512	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Things are definitely real
EDL	00:36:16,512	00:36:17,792	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And there are definitely a lot of
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:21,632	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So I guess the next obvious question is
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:23,680	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	You know they're here
EDL	00:36:23,680	00:36:25,728	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Besides that voting booth in Belgium
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:27,776	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Like what else are they messing with
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:30,592	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Has my phone ever
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:33,920	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Is the probability such that my phone has likely been
EDL	00:36:33,920	00:36:36,480	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Goof by a bit flip caused by a cosmic ray
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:42,368	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Afternoon systems are getting big flakes on a daily basis
EDL	00:36:43,392	00:36:44,416	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Okay
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:46,208	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	For example the routers
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:50,304	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Let me hear when the internet hit parts of the internet get shut off by these things
EDL	00:36:50,304	00:36:52,352	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Yeah I routinely even today
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:58,752	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Whoa whoa whoa whoa down for five minutes
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:36:59,776	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Cisco Systems
EDL	00:36:59,776	00:37:02,592	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	They already keenly aware of this problem
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:04,640	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Apparently in the early 2000s
EDL	00:37:04,640	00:37:07,968	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Google indexing system was down for 5 months
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:09,504	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Okay what what what else
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:11,552	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It has been approved by the
EDL	00:37:11,552	00:37:14,624	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Lord of manufacturing plants have been goof Bible
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:18,464	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Really expensive custom manufacturing plant which made custom machine
EDL	00:37:18,976	00:37:19,744	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And one of the bit
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:22,048	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So they were making things
EDL	00:37:22,048	00:37:23,840	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Wrong
EDL	00:37:23,840	00:37:25,120	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	What's a real example of that
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:36,128	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Not sure I can discuss what kind of
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:36,640	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Machine
EDL	00:37:39,968	00:37:43,040	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Not sure
EDL	00:37:43,808	00:37:45,856	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Sorry something that the route was able to tell
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:48,672	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Is that the higher up you are in our atmosphere
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:51,744	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The number of particles with higher energy is higher
EDL	00:37:51,744	00:37:54,048	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And that means the chances of a bit flip
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:38:00,448	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Are also Electronics in airplane is always bombarded
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:05,312	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	By this particle in one thing the plane is flying it's on autopilot
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:09,920	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And suddenly one of the bit flips that takes it out of the autopilot
EDL	00:38:10,432	00:38:11,200	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Yeah
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:12,992	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	What airplane
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:14,016	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Where
EDL	00:38:15,040	00:38:15,552	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Transport site
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:18,624	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Air flight
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:21,952	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	In about 2018 passenger
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:26,560	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Send one crewman but was seriously injured when the Qantas Airbus noise.
EDL	00:38:27,072	00:38:29,376	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Plummeting more than a thousand space
EDL	00:38:29,376	00:38:35,776	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	She's essentially dropped like a rock and it was all because of a one bit flipping weights
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:36,800	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Caused by a cosmic
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:38,080	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Wait it's just
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:43,456	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Beaches nosedive 4015 people like Hitler had just turned off and have nobody
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:44,224	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Oh my God
EDL	00:38:44,736	00:38:45,760	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Because of a bit
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:51,648	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Holy s*** now we should say that like even though bit flips are happening frequently
EDL	00:38:52,160	00:38:54,208	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The vast majority of those flips
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:59,072	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Behr midnight we don't even notice them flipping only Eve
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:39:00,864	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It's right there in the right position
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:03,424	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So for example in the Parliament that beat
EDL	00:39:04,448	00:39:09,056	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Deadbeat flip method only if they were taking a wart at the time
EDL	00:39:09,056	00:39:14,176	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And actually telling the world so the likelihood of a backflip having any consequence at all
EDL	00:39:14,944	00:39:15,712	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Rare
EDL	00:39:15,712	00:39:16,224	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Okay
EDL	00:39:19,552	00:39:25,696	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Hello this message is for either Grover or Barbara
EDL	00:39:28,256	00:39:34,656	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The strange call to receive I'm sure even crazier
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:36,448	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Want to reduce my credit card interest or
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:42,592	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Get me something for my pain this is Barbara Walton we reached her in Boiling Springs North
EDL	00:39:42,592	00:39:47,968	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	South Carolina one stop light town where she lives with her husband growth we've been here since
EDL	00:39:47,968	00:39:53,344	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	We got married 53 years ago
EDL	00:39:53,344	00:39:56,160	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	In one of those cars my gosh
EDL	00:39:58,208	00:40:04,608	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Do you mind is just like telling me what you were doing the morning of the accident we live in North Carolina
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:11,008	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	We have a son that lives on the coast and South Carolina so we were going to visit to put a 4 and 1/2 hour drive
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:17,408	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	See through some pretty good-sized towns area we were in was more or less a rural area
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:23,808	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	2008 Prius Grover is behind the wheel in the back seat because I was on my computer and I didn't like to do that in
EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:30,208	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	In the front seat because of the possibility of the airbag coming out and throwing the computer my face
EDL	00:40:30,208	00:40:34,304	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I can ask what were you doing on your computer in the backseat
EDL	00:40:34,304	00:40:36,096	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Probably solitaire
EDL	00:40:36,096	00:40:38,400	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Something to occupy my time I usually
EDL	00:40:38,400	00:40:39,936	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Snooze Orpheum
EDL	00:40:39,936	00:40:42,752	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	We've made that trip many times so I've seen the
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:43,264	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Scenery
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:46,336	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	For the first three and a half hours at the drive
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:47,616	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Everything is totally normal
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:51,456	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Grover calmly at the wheel driver on a laptop
EDL	00:40:51,456	00:40:52,224	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And then
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:57,856	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Barbara looks up from a computer if my husband is speeding
EDL	00:40:59,648	00:41:02,208	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And I I said are you doing
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:05,024	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	He said I can't slow down
EDL	00:41:08,096	00:41:09,120	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:14,240	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I said will you have to play that he said I'm applying the brake it is not slowing down
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:22,688	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	When how did you guys remember exactly how fast you were going better judge of that than I would
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:29,088	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	When are when are car
EDL	00:41:29,088	00:41:30,368	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Ran away with us
EDL	00:41:30,368	00:41:32,672	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	How fast would you say the car was going
EDL	00:41:36,768	00:41:38,304	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I'm sure it was more than that
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:44,192	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	He's saying 65 I'm saying 6570
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:46,752	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I can imagine feeling like
EDL	00:41:46,752	00:41:48,288	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Really panics

EDL	00:42:05,695	00:42:06,463	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And
EDL	00:42:06,975	00:42:13,119	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I didn't want to go down into the swamp husband the driver
EDL	00:42:13,631	00:42:14,399	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Break
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:18,495	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It's quick as I took my foot off the brake it was start

EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:29,759	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The way they describe that it was almost like one of those Hollywood movies where you're like

EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:49,471	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Grover fought
EDL	00:42:49,471	00:42:51,775	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	With the car. I can't remember if
EDL	00:42:52,799	00:42:54,335	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	How how did you stop
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:56,895	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I know we cross that swampy Bridge

EDL	00:42:58,943	00:43:01,247	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Brake pads and the rotor
EDL	00:43:01,247	00:43:03,039	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Okay so that's what stopped
EDL	00:43:03,039	00:43:05,599	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	By just applying the brakes so long and
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:06,623	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It's so hard
EDL	00:43:06,623	00:43:08,927	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It wore the brakes on the road around that's how
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:10,463	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The car finally came to a

EDL	00:43:43,231	00:43:45,279	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	From the driver point of view what was happening
EDL	00:43:45,791	00:43:47,071	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Was that the car would take off
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:49,887	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Sometimes at low speeds but sometimes at high speed
EDL	00:43:50,399	00:43:52,191	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And the drivers would say
EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:55,519	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	My foot was on the brake pedal but my car kept going faster

EDL	00:44:10,879	00:44:12,927	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Was the same time that Toyota cars
EDL	00:44:13,439	00:44:14,719	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	All cars really
EDL	00:44:14,719	00:44:16,767	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	We're starting to become computerized
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:21,119	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	That's right before this moment cars are mostly mechanical and you feel like you don't pop the hood
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:24,447	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Basically figure out what was going on but after this moment it's
EDL	00:44:24,447	00:44:25,727	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Mostly computers
EDL	00:44:25,727	00:44:28,287	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And not just me engine your car has
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:32,127	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Dozens or in some cases more than a hundred little boxes
EDL	00:44:32,639	00:44:36,223	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	DELL Electronics inside it has small small books
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:40,575	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Like a paperback book in the wall and floor and ceiling of the

EDL	00:44:42,111	00:44:45,951	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	They do all sorts of little things you take out your keys in your press the button and your doors unlock
EDL	00:44:46,719	00:44:48,767	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	There's a computer inside that key
EDL	00:44:48,767	00:44:50,303	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Sending a message
EDL	00:44:50,303	00:44:51,583	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	To a computer inside the

EDL	00:44:57,983	00:44:58,751	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	At least
EDL	00:44:58,751	00:45:00,799	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	In the responsible for some
EDL	00:45:00,799	00:45:01,823	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Pretty important thing
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:04,383	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Things like now when you press the gas pedal
EDL	00:45:04,383	00:45:07,199	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I instead of it being this direct physical link
EDL	00:45:07,199	00:45:07,967	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	To the throttle
EDL	00:45:08,479	00:45:12,063	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Make the car go that pedal is now basically just an input
EDL	00:45:12,575	00:45:13,855	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Computer why do they want to do that
EDL	00:45:14,367	00:45:18,719	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	What you can get better fuel economy you know it's a it's a more pleasant Drive
EDL	00:45:18,719	00:45:21,791	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So that part is great it's a better driver experience but
EDL	00:45:21,791	00:45:23,327	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	You just trusted your life
EDL	00:45:23,327	00:45:24,095	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	2 software
EDL	00:45:24,095	00:45:25,375	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And that's a new thing
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:31,775	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Was that talked about or known or was this sort of a silent transition that you as the driver would never really know unless
EDL	00:45:31,775	00:45:33,311	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	You looked it up in Popular Mechanics
EDL	00:45:34,335	00:45:37,407	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I don't think that you would probably have known as regular driver
EDL	00:45:37,407	00:45:42,271	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And so when this whole thing broke because most people didn't know that their cars were now
EDL	00:45:42,271	00:45:43,807	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Computers and because most
EDL	00:45:43,807	00:45:49,439	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The victims were on the older side
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:52,255	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	People

EDL	00:46:00,959	00:46:04,031	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Telling us he didn't find anything wrong
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:05,055	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	With the car
EDL	00:46:05,055	00:46:08,127	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	If you're on the car company side you say so you press
EDL	00:46:08,127	00:46:10,431	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The pedal and it kept going faster which pedal does that
EDL	00:46:11,455	00:46:14,783	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Damn I've been driving since I was 15
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:21,695	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	What is a difference in the accelerator and Brake

EDL	00:46:22,719	00:46:27,327	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Until August 20th 2009

EDL	00:47:29,791	00:47:32,095	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Just broke that driver error narrative
EDL	00:47:32,095	00:47:38,495	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Toyota has a problem pieces and so that's what launched all the inquiries in the recall

EDL	00:47:58,719	00:47:59,487	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Started to form
EDL	00:47:59,999	00:48:01,535	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And when the experts
EDL	00:48:01,535	00:48:04,351	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Still being one of them giving full access
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:08,447	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Do Toyota's software and Hardware they found a number of things wrong
EDL	00:48:08,959	00:48:10,751	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	But the key in all of this
EDL	00:48:10,751	00:48:11,263	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Was
EDL	00:48:11,775	00:48:17,151	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	You guessed it if you had a bit flip the test that controls the throttle position could die
EDL	00:48:17,151	00:48:18,175	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Causing it to stick
EDL	00:48:18,175	00:48:20,479	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	In some open position that would happen
EDL	00:48:20,479	00:48:23,551	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	They reproduce that on a car willing in in the first of those
EDL	00:48:23,551	00:48:24,831	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Death and injury cases what
EDL	00:48:25,343	00:48:26,111	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	What happened
EDL	00:48:26,111	00:48:28,159	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The tree said that they
EDL	00:48:28,671	00:48:31,487	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	But I have to make sure I only say things I'm allowed to say
EDL	00:48:31,487	00:48:36,607	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Actually big deal after
EDL	00:48:36,607	00:48:37,631	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I wanted the experts
EDL	00:48:38,399	00:48:39,167	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	African time
EDL	00:48:39,167	00:48:40,703	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So you have to be careful
EDL	00:48:40,703	00:48:42,239	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Wow okay
EDL	00:48:42,239	00:48:43,775	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Start
EDL	00:48:44,543	00:48:46,335	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The jury found
EDL	00:48:46,335	00:48:46,847	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	That
EDL	00:48:47,359	00:48:48,895	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Toyota was liable

EDL	00:48:49,919	00:48:53,247	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And the only Theory presented in the case was that the computer
EDL	00:48:53,759	00:48:54,527	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Kill people
EDL	00:48:54,527	00:48:55,807	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	A temperature agreed
EDL	00:48:55,807	00:49:02,207	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Toyota settle that case immediately and begin to settle all 500 other cases in the queue
EDL	00:49:02,207	00:49:05,023	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Hey everybody let's not drag this thing out and put it through
EDL	00:49:05,023	00:49:09,119	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The public I can't speculate as to the motive spend right I think the facts speak for themselves
EDL	00:49:09,887	00:49:10,911	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	God humming this is
EDL	00:49:11,935	00:49:15,007	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Yeah and I'm like one quick crazy side.
EDL	00:49:15,007	00:49:20,127	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Is ruling actually led to the freedom of a Minnesota man named cool if only
EDL	00:49:20,127	00:49:21,151	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	We already spent
EDL	00:49:21,151	00:49:22,687	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Two and a half years in prison

EDL	00:49:35,999	00:49:36,767	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Is acceleration
EDL	00:49:36,767	00:49:38,303	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	That's not enough
EDL	00:49:39,839	00:49:43,167	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Winfred like in your opinion and your experience
EDL	00:49:43,679	00:49:47,775	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Do you think this specific case and other cases were in fact caused by Justice
EDL	00:49:47,775	00:49:48,543	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Frazee
EDL	00:49:49,055	00:49:50,847	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Cosmic chain of events that led to

EDL	00:49:58,271	00:49:59,551	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	As amazing as it sounds
EDL	00:50:00,063	00:50:04,671	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	These type of events are almost certainly caused by that now was that the primary
EDL	00:50:04,671	00:50:06,463	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Contribution to the toilet
EDL	00:50:07,743	00:50:09,023	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I don't know and
EDL	00:50:09,023	00:50:09,791	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Probably no one will ever know
EDL	00:50:17,471	00:50:22,847	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I think the way you're painting the world almost as looks like it they're just smoking wrecks everywhere they crashed
EDL	00:50:22,847	00:50:23,615	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Planes and
EDL	00:50:24,127	00:50:28,991	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Tarzan 2 light poles and the internet's not working it how are we
EDL	00:50:29,503	00:50:30,527	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	How are you functioning
EDL	00:50:31,039	00:50:37,183	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	We went back and we started fixing the prompts
EDL	00:50:38,207	00:50:43,071	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Once we know that autopilot is the one that's causing the problem been respect
EDL	00:50:43,071	00:50:49,215	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	How do you fix it so you get three copies of everything the same electronic system that three of them
EDL	00:50:49,215	00:50:54,335	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And at least two of them have to agree to do anything
EDL	00:50:54,335	00:50:55,103	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Smart
EDL	00:50:55,103	00:51:01,503	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So today like tripling and doubling redundancy is a norm and planes and cars with any other life
EDL	00:51:01,503	00:51:02,015	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Trending technology
EDL	00:51:02,527	00:51:07,903	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And actually the same thing was done in skarbek at after that incident in 2003
EDL	00:51:07,903	00:51:09,183	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So now when they haven't
EDL	00:51:09,183	00:51:11,743	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Election vote is actually counted twice by the
EDL	00:51:12,255	00:51:16,607	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	One of the tallies doesn't match the other that they know something's gone wrong and media
EDL	00:51:17,375	00:51:18,143	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So that's cool
EDL	00:51:18,143	00:51:19,679	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	But here's the thing
EDL	00:51:19,679	00:51:23,263	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Is doubling and tripling is just too expensive to do with mosto
EDL	00:51:23,263	00:51:24,031	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Thanks
EDL	00:51:24,031	00:51:30,431	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And as our Electronics gets smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller
EDL	00:51:30,431	00:51:31,711	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Just going to happen more and more
EDL	00:51:32,223	00:51:32,735	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Why would that be
EDL	00:51:33,247	00:51:39,647	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	The smaller the transistor the less energy you need to flip that bit
EDL	00:51:39,647	00:51:41,695	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I need the housing electrons
EDL	00:51:41,695	00:51:46,047	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	30% of 1 or 0 how many electrons did you need back in the 70s
EDL	00:51:47,071	00:51:48,607	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I'll probably million
EDL	00:51:48,607	00:51:50,399	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Oh and now you just
EDL	00:51:50,911	00:51:52,959	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And transistors made today
EDL	00:51:52,959	00:51:53,471	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I like
EDL	00:51:53,983	00:51:54,495	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Tiny Thai
EDL	00:51:55,007	00:51:58,079	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Your hair is 50 Micron in diameter so take your hair
EDL	00:51:58,591	00:52:00,127	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Inflated thousand times
EDL	00:52:01,151	00:52:03,455	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So that gets you down to 15 m
EDL	00:52:04,479	00:52:06,527	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And we are looking at 7
EDL	00:52:06,527	00:52:10,111	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	So you want some pretty much slices down 7 more times
EDL	00:52:10,879	00:52:12,415	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And what you are left with
EDL	00:52:12,415	00:52:15,743	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Easter size of transistors that are coming
EDL	00:52:15,743	00:52:17,023	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	In the market
EDL	00:52:17,023	00:52:17,791	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	In the neck
EDL	00:52:17,791	00:52:18,303	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	2 years
EDL	00:52:18,815	00:52:21,375	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Baby in cell phones and laptops and things like that
EDL	00:52:22,399	00:52:23,167	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	They would be everywhere
EDL	00:52:29,055	00:52:33,663	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Show as we get better and better and better than miniaturizing our technology
EDL	00:52:33,663	00:52:35,967	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	You're more and more and more
EDL	00:52:35,967	00:52:37,759	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	At risk to these tiny flying
EDL	00:52:39,295	00:52:41,599	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Through our technological advancement
EDL	00:52:41,599	00:52:44,159	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	We have invited this problem upon herself
EDL	00:52:45,439	00:52:49,279	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	That is one way to look at it did you go back to those big cell phone
EDL	00:52:49,279	00:52:52,095	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Being 5 kg each
EDL	00:52:53,119	00:52:53,887	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Footlong
EDL	00:52:54,399	00:52:55,167	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Then you won't hear this
EDL	00:53:27,423	00:53:30,751	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Thanks Annie Simon
EDL	00:53:30,751	00:53:32,287	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Yeah actually have one more thing
EDL	00:53:33,055	00:53:33,567	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Sure
EDL	00:53:34,079	00:53:39,711	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Well we've been doing some research into this and we talked to a bunch of electrical engineers
EDL	00:53:39,711	00:53:42,271	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And this is going to sound very very strange
EDL	00:53:42,783	00:53:45,855	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	But what these researchers are saying
EDL	00:53:45,855	00:53:47,391	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	A likely cause
EDL	00:53:48,415	00:53:49,183	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Was
EDL	00:53:49,183	00:53:52,767	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	A cosmic ray hitting one of the computers could cause
EDL	00:53:53,279	00:53:57,375	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	At the driver to lose the ability to control the gas
EDL	00:53:58,399	00:53:59,167	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Oh my Lord
EDL	00:54:03,007	00:54:05,311	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Well I am not a scientist
EDL	00:54:05,311	00:54:06,079	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Sick person
EDL	00:54:06,847	00:54:08,383	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Anything's possible
EDL	00:54:09,151	00:54:12,735	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Now you're saying we're bombarded by cosmic rays all the time
EDL	00:54:14,271	00:54:16,575	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	If that's so perhaps
EDL	00:54:16,575	00:54:17,599	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Maybe we just
EDL	00:54:17,599	00:54:21,183	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Maybe we just got baptized
EDL	00:54:21,183	00:54:26,047	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Do you think Grover would be if I'm just curious to hear his reaction to the possibility
EDL	00:54:27,071	00:54:29,887	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Your car accelerated because of cosmic ray hit
EDL	00:54:30,399	00:54:31,679	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	What is he think about that
EDL	00:54:32,959	00:54:33,727	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	There is one
EDL	00:54:33,727	00:54:39,103	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Siri said an engineer came up with that there
EDL	00:54:39,103	00:54:39,871	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Engineer's hat
EDL	00:54:39,871	00:54:40,639	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Come up with us
EDL	00:54:40,639	00:54:41,407	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Siri
EDL	00:54:41,407	00:54:42,943	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	You know we're bombarded with
EDL	00:54:42,943	00:54:44,223	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Cosmic rays all the time
EDL	00:54:45,503	00:54:46,783	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	What's Cosmo
EDL	00:54:46,783	00:54:48,063	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Raise all the
EDL	00:54:48,063	00:54:48,831	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	What time
EDL	00:54:48,831	00:54:50,111	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	And it's possible
EDL	00:54:50,879	00:54:52,415	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	That a cosmic ray
EDL	00:54:52,415	00:54:53,183	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	If it hit
EDL	00:54:53,183	00:54:55,231	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Just at the right time in the right place
EDL	00:54:57,535	00:54:58,047	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	On board

EDL	00:54:59,583	00:55:00,607	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Possibly that
EDL	00:55:01,119	00:55:01,631	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Accelerator
EDL	00:55:02,655	00:55:03,679	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	He wants to know how you
EDL	00:55:03,679	00:55:04,447	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I feel about that
EDL	00:55:11,103	00:55:13,919	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	I'm so bored open-minded but
EDL	00:55:14,431	00:55:16,223	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	At this point in time
EDL	00:55:16,735	00:55:18,783	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	You know I question that but
EDL	00:55:19,807	00:55:21,087	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It's not that big a deal
EDL	00:55:22,367	00:55:22,879	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Okay
EDL	00:55:23,647	00:55:24,671	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	Alyssa
EDL	00:55:26,207	00:55:27,743	| radiolab_podcast19bitflipfix |	It's home and
