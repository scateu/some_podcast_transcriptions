EDL	00:00:38,912	00:00:39,936	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Thinking about the
EDL	00:00:39,936	00:00:42,240	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The thing we're about to talk about a lot
EDL	00:00:42,240	00:00:43,776	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Because of
EDL	00:00:44,288	00:00:44,800	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	This
EDL	00:00:46,848	00:00:50,688	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	This moment several months ago where I should have got caught between to my closest
EDL	00:00:50,688	00:00:52,224	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Friends I got
EDL	00:00:52,224	00:00:52,736	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Caught
EDL	00:00:54,272	00:00:55,296	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I get caught
EDL	00:00:55,296	00:01:00,928	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	All the time it's really like a political is really hard
EDL	00:01:00,928	00:01:02,208	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Number one
EDL	00:01:02,208	00:01:02,976	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Is it
EDL	00:01:02,976	00:01:03,744	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Guy
EDL	00:01:03,744	00:01:06,816	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I call him a bit of a contrarian politically
EDL	00:01:06,816	00:01:09,632	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And we ended up getting a few arguments by this guy named Jordan Peterson
EDL	00:01:10,144	00:01:12,960	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Precisely the sort of danger that people who are really looking
EDL	00:01:14,240	00:01:15,008	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Who
EDL	00:01:15,008	00:01:20,384	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	You probably know he's just come with figures I figure Canadian psychologist to is gotten
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:23,712	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Set a lot of things that are very controversial about
EDL	00:01:23,712	00:01:28,320	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Gender and race
EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:35,488	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Like he thinks White Privilege is a myth and I said we should somehow enforced monogamy he certainly commands
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:38,816	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Movement is Big with dudes he's really big with white dude
EDL	00:01:38,816	00:01:40,608	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Yeah and
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:42,144	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Best friend of mine is white dude
EDL	00:01:42,656	00:01:46,752	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And so we were arguing about them things Jordan Peterson had said that my friend has liked
EDL	00:01:47,264	00:01:48,288	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And it one point he was
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:52,640	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	He said to me he would have called me out he was like you've never even listened to the guy talk
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:55,200	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Thank you you were having all the arguments about as ideas
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:57,760	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And that you've never even listened to
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:01:59,808	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Tulsa okay
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:00,832	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	FairPoint
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:02,112	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I tried to tell her listen to him
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:04,416	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And then
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:06,720	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Enter friend number 2
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:11,584	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	We're hanging out couple days later and I told her I'm having a fight with friend number one
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:12,352	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Again
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:15,424	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	He wants me to listen to this guy Jordan Peterson I told him I do it
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:16,704	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Just to be fair
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:17,472	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And she
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:18,752	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:20,288	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I got this look on her face
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:22,592	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And was like
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:24,640	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Why would you
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:26,944	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And like why would you do that
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:28,736	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And then she said this thing to me that
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:30,528	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I that really
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:32,320	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Stuck with me afterwards
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:33,856	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And she said
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:35,648	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	His ideas are Dane
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:38,208	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And remember thinking like
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:41,024	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	What makes an idea dangerous
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:47,936	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Even stepping down politic in my scientific thinking about the law all these Realms of ID
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:49,984	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Yes what makes one so
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:50,752	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Dangerous
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:54,336	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Or threatening or risky that
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:55,872	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	We shouldn't even talk about
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:58,176	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And so I
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:00,480	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I decided to have a staff meeting
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:02,016	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	With off the radio my people
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:05,600	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And ask everyone to bring their most dangerous
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:06,112	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Idea
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:08,928	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	This is a diagram
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:14,304	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	People brought all kinds of weird stuff that I have a amaryllis and fight them eating their worth
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:15,584	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Yeah it's a little tight
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:16,864	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Maybe there's
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:20,704	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	One species that we should just like agree we're going to let go
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:23,776	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	We only have a limited amount of time energy and money
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:26,080	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Stop worrying about the elephant let them all die
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:28,128	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	In February to just focus on that.
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:31,456	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Recycling is pointless
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:34,272	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Probably just true
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:36,064	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Someone brought a lake
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:40,416	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The idea that boys are better at math than girls right
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:46,816	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	A female staff member brought that one in cuz she heard it from her daughter's math teacher kratoville think that still
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:48,864	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Breast cancer screening is pointless
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:54,496	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	There was something about a law in Nebraska that allows you to drop off a baby that you didn't want
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:04:00,896	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	God is dead assisted suicide psychiatric euthanasia
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:04,992	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Britain arguing that I like mass incarceration is a tragedy
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:08,832	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Ino end of solution would be instead of putting people in prison
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:10,112	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	We should bring back
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:11,392	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Public whippings
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:18,559	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	So like instead of that's what it was that being sent to prison that's what that's what that's what things evolve to tiny bit yeah
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:19,839	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	But before they did
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:21,119	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	More than one person
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:21,887	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Brought the same idea
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:23,679	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And then this
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:25,215	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Idea really
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:26,495	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Stuck in my head
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:27,263	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I'd like it
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:31,103	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	We we a group of us kind of became obsessed with that and then
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:33,919	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	That's the idea that we decided to base the series on
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:35,455	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Anna McIntyre
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:37,247	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Yet
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:46,463	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	All right
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:49,535	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Radiolab
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:55,167	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Over the next five episodes were going to turn things over to our senior editor Pat Walters
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:58,751	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	It's going to explore this mysterious dangerous idea
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:00,543	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	You know all kinds of weird places
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:04,127	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Wakanda series let's make sense in a little bit

EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:15,391	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	There's nothing I love more than picking the lint off my phone
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:16,927	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Well
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:19,999	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	It's like a little game built into my clothing
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:21,535	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	You're so easy to please
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:27,935	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Before we get started I should say I produced this whole series with Rachel Cusick as she's been a true partner on the whole pie
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:29,727	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Project so you'll be hearing from her Bunch 2
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:35,615	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Infants first episode began with a discovery that she made one day when she was looking around the theater
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:38,431	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	One of my favorite pages is today I learned
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:44,831	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I'll I do love that I love a good if you don't know this is a section of read it and so I went there

EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:49,183	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Just a general page and then I see a today I learned
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:52,511	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Badmind that kind of stopped me in my tracks
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:53,023	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Okay
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:57,375	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	T i l
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:58,399	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Today I learned
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:03,263	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	That it is illegal in state of California to administer an IQ test
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:08,895	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	To child if he or she is black even when dispensed by school psychologist as part of a professional assessment
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:14,015	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Wait it says it's illegal to give an IQ test to a black kid in California yeah that's what it said
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:14,783	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Do you cook on it
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:17,855	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I totally click on it because I'm looking
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:21,183	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	To find out that it's fake for sure so I start reading the comments
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:23,743	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And they're really bio
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:25,279	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Are Reese's
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:28,863	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	They mostly came from a group of people who call themselves race realist
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:33,727	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And those are people who basically say let's just all agree
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:37,567	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	That white people are inherently more intelligent than black people
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:42,431	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Okay so you see these responses you're like

EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:57,599	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	What is nonsense he said really from the very
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:59,647	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The very beginning
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:06,047	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	He said he did fine in math but he could not keep up with the reading when I look at
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:08,095	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	It's something and I'm trying to read it
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:09,375	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And if I can't
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:11,167	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Pronounce it I'm looking at it back
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:17,311	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The reality was that he had a reading issue sure it's fair to call it like a reading disability
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:25,503	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	What is nitroglycerin are you okay would you like some water

EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:37,023	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Kidding me
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:39,583	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	So Daryl goes home
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:42,143	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Not really sure what happened but
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:44,191	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	He feels like he didn't do well at it whatever
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:46,495	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And eventually
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:49,311	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Someone from the school approaches Daryl's mom
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:50,079	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	It says
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:52,383	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	We need to put your son in a different class
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:54,943	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	So the way she describes it in her testimony
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:59,295	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Says well I was told that Larry was a slow learner and he needed help you know in his
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:00,063	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	School work
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:01,855	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And by putting him in this class
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:06,463	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I was under the impression he was put there so he could get more attention
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:07,487	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Started going down
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:07,999	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Heal

EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:23,359	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	A straight-up
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:24,127	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Headache
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:26,175	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Custom kids was loud

EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:29,503	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Some kids
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:31,807	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Just in care
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:34,367	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Dell says they spent about 10 minutes then reading
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:35,391	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Pennsylvania map
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:37,695	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And about five and a half hours
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:38,975	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Outside
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:39,743	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And they thought
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:42,559	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Calm us down
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:44,351	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	So they went on a lot of field
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:47,167	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Going to the zoo Golden Gate Park
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:47,935	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	What is this
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:49,727	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	You know
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:51,775	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	They wouldn't teaching this

EDL	00:18:58,431	00:19:00,223	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	In what about time I got
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:02,015	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Close to the school I straighten up

EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:07,903	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And that was it
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:13,023	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	It was that bad
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:19,679	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Darrell was in that class for more than a year
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:21,215	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And then
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:22,751	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Fast forward
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:25,311	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And when they Darrell's mom is at home
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:30,175	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And I should get the phone call but she gets a phone call apparently from
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:32,223	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	One of the n-double-acp attorneys
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:36,063	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And the lawyer tells her that a man named Gerald West
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:37,087	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Is going to pay her a bit
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:43,999	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	He says at West is a member of the association of black psychologists and it's in the way she describes it in her chest

EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:45,279	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	She
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:48,351	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	She said okay and and then Gerald West
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:50,911	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Came over that with Daryl getting a few tests

EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:53,983	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	She says you know
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:20:01,407	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	She says then he turned to me and he says well there is nothing wrong with this child and I said what do you mean nothing wrong with him I'm his mother
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:02,175	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I should know
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:03,199	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Time is Mom I know there's
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:07,551	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	You know there's nothing wrong with him even if she did know that you needed reading help
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:10,879	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	She says naturally I didn't feel good about it and I got angry about it
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:13,951	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	This is when I really found out what was really going on you know
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:16,767	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And then she's asked what did you find out
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:20,351	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	SNL mom says that he's been designated mentally retarded
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:26,495	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	That's how she learned that he was in a class
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:28,799	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Educable mentally retarded kids
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:30,847	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	She never known that
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:39,295	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	What had happened to Daryl when he got brought into that room with the man with the briefcase is that they giving him and I cute
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:42,111	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	That's what I've gotten him designated
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:46,207	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And that this is the term that was used at the time until we're going to use it in the story
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:47,231	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Educable mentally
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:50,047	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And his mom said he wasn't
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:51,583	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	But the test was wrong
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:54,399	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And that I've been wrong about a lot of blackheads
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:55,935	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And so
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:57,215	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Darrell's mom
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:59,263	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And the parents of five other little kids
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:00,287	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:04,127	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Got together and filed a class-action lawsuit against the
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:04,895	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The school district
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:07,199	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Arguing that their kids had been
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:08,991	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Scituate denied their education
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:12,831	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Viking putting these classes inappropriately because of my IQ test that
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:14,623	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Deem them mentally retarded
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:15,647	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And that's
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:18,976	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Yeah that's her to the beginning of
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:19,488	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Rabbit hole
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:23,840	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	So what ends up happening is like
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:26,144	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	In the mid-1970s
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:27,168	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	These parents
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:28,704	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The IQ test
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:29,472	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	On trial

EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:12,224	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	You were saying that the IQ test was put on trial that's
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:18,624	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	It sort of seems to be where we're driving to Super interesting but
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:20,160	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Before we jump into that
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:23,232	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I think it would be helpful to put the trial and the test
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:25,536	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	In a slightly larger context
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:30,144	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Okay I answered you that I want to tell you where the IQ test came from in the first
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:31,680	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	You mean like
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:34,496	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Who invented all the way back to the beginning of the
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:36,800	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And to do that
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:39,104	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	If you go back to France
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:41,408	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	In the early nineteen hundreds
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:42,432	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	1904
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:46,784	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Yes this is Siddhartha Mukherjee I'm an oncologist and I'm also a writer

EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:51,392	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Out of when I describe them as
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:54,976	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Benign intentions
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:23:00,352	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	At the turn of the century in France there was a lot going on
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:04,960	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The church and state were separating Prime scrape this equal Society
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:11,104	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	By the way is David Robson senior journalist. BBC future and the Wolf of the intelligence trap
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:15,968	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	David says one of the things that happened at this time is the government took over the
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:19,808	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Schools public education was growing Universal education with pots
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:22,624	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Suddenly all kids required to go to school
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:28,000	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And within the first few years of this the government noticed that some kids were falling behind
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:31,328	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And so
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:33,632	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	To figure out what to do
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:34,656	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	They called this cycle
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:37,472	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Alfred Pinay in Paris
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:39,776	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Set the time we've actually the director of it

EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:45,408	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	But he spent the past
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:46,432	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	20 years or so
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:46,944	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Studying child
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:50,784	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The French government gave him an assignment
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:53,344	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	They said we want you to come up with a test
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:58,208	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Predict which kids are going to struggle in school just to identify with

EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:00,768	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	What moves OneRepublic SMS
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:02,560	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	So that we can give the next
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:08,960	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I can put them in three years and then when I say Dad is like 3 years
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:10,496	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I know we didn't notice that
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:16,128	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	He's having a really hard time learning to read or do math Albert but I saw it as a chance to benefit

EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:31,232	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Came up with this test 2
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:32,768	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Look for
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:34,560	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	A whole bunch of different cognitive ability
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:36,864	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Starting with simple ones bike
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:38,912	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Can a child hold a conversation with the teacher
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:41,984	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Moving onto slightly more complex
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:42,752	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Such as I'm
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:46,336	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	He would give the children a list of what
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:47,104	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Like how
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:47,872	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Fork
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:48,384	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Mother
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:54,272	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And ask them to kind of recite them back to him from memory middle children draw pictures
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:56,320	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And then he had a few harder ones
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:59,648	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Like name three rhymes for at the French
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:00,160	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Word

EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:04,256	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Which is like a bow or curtsy
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:06,816	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Anyway these questions
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:08,608	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Summer easy summer card
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:11,168	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The next thing you did is to give this test
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:12,960	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	To a whole bunch of kids
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:17,824	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Crypto page
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:19,104	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And then he compared how they did
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:20,896	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Like for all the six-year-olds
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:22,688	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	How many questions did they get right
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:24,224	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	On average
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:27,040	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Seven year olds same thing 8 year olds
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:27,808	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	On and on
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:34,208	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	For each age he calculated the average score basically I Norm normalization as it were
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:35,232	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Calling the normal
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:38,048	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And then you would compare each kids at Newark
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:43,680	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	So if your six-year-old and you got the average number right and wrong for a six-year-old
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:45,984	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	That's your mental age
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:51,104	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Sick if you score higher than the average for six-year-old your mental age might be seven or eight
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:52,896	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And if you scored lower
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:59,296	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	It might be lower ultimately that would be to a simple math equation mental age divided by the
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:00,320	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Chronological age
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:01,600	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	* 500
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:04,416	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	K-50 IQ intelligence question
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:11,328	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	So that's how they do it yeah it's a little different now but generally how it works is like if your six-year-old
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:14,912	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And you get the number of questions right and wrong that the average
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:18,240	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	6 year old got right and wrong your IQ score is 100
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:21,312	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And if your mental age exceeds your physical age
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:22,592	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	You get higher than 100
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:23,872	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	What is your mental age
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:26,432	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Is less than your physical age you get lower than a hundred
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:27,456	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Sabetha basic idea
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:34,624	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Felt before Bonet teachers and parents and lots of other kinds of people had been trying all different things to figure out how
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:36,928	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And to compare them to their peers
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:40,000	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	But this is the first time someone tried to measure
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:43,840	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Input a number on it
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:51,008	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	He was very clear that he didn't think

EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:58,432	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Measuring
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:26:58,944	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Something
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:01,504	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	About these kids that helps me figure out
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:03,552	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	How they going to do school
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:06,368	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Explicit about the fact that he didn't think the
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:09,696	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Mark and his staff should be considered a covenant thing about
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:11,232	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Someone tickles
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:14,048	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Brutal pessimism if you type. 1 School
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:15,072	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I do think of it as
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:18,400	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Defining someone he said brutal pacifism
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:22,752	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	He believed that intelligence was malleable and that the human mind had
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:24,800	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Eunice so many different
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:25,568	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Facets
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:27,104	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	But had to be considered
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:28,896	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	He was apparently adamant about the
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:31,712	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	But
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:34,528	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	As We Know
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:37,600	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Good intentions are the devil's toilet paper
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:47,328	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	It's right around the time but name was doing his thing Charles Spearman who is a statistician who and where it where was he in
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:50,656	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	What was he doing he was in England it was another psychologist
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:53,216	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Neuropsychologist that's different doing research on this topic
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:58,592	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I need Charles Spearman who came up with the theory of intelligence that the name
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:27:59,104	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Would not
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:02,176	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Look at your hand by the way my name is
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:07,040	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Sure Richie I'm a psychology lecturer at King's College London he's the guy who told me about all this
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:09,088	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And according to him Charles Spearman
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:09,856	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Li keqiang
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:10,880	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	How to work with kids
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:11,904	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Given lots of tests
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:13,440	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And he noticed
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:16,512	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Describe counterintuitive thing that in a Hadith
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:22,912	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	You know I mention that IQ tester asked me many many little test salt lamp together
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:25,984	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Like you got vocabulary math all these different subtests
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:27,520	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	What time
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:30,080	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Human shows in his
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:31,616	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And I will see you solved
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:36,480	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The tests where they all seem to correlate positively together people who to one type of test
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:38,272	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Tend to be good at the mall
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:40,320	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Say I want to see how many words you know
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:44,160	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Listen carefully and tell me what these words mean what Spearman notice
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:46,976	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Is the kids were good at vocabulary tests
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:48,512	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	What is a bicycle
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:52,352	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Do kids were also likely to be good at reasoning test I am going to show you
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:54,400	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	In which there is a part missing
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:55,936	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Tell me what is Miss
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:29:01,312	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And pattern recognition look here and you will see a star a ball a triangle and other things
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:02,848	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Speed test
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:05,408	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Memory tests I'm going to say some numbers
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:06,432	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Listen carefully
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:08,224	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	All the different kinds of death
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:10,016	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	People who are good at 1 or are good at the mall
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:13,856	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And he saw this as evidence of
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:17,184	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Sensor underlying mental energy underlies
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:18,208	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Their comfortability
EDL	00:29:18,208	00:29:24,608	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Instrument called the the concept of
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:30,752	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	G
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:39,200	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And this idea that
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:42,528	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	This sort of general intelligence Spearman notice
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:45,344	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Did other scientist noticed it to know yeah yes
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:51,744	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Verses in the decade since Spearman first noticed this phenomenon has been proven
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:53,280	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Again and again
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:54,304	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And again
EDL	00:29:54,304	00:29:58,912	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	To be true is essentially one of the best replication findings in the psychological which
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:00,448	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	In the moment
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:03,776	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	GID I got walked out into the room by Charles Spearman
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:07,616	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	This is the moment that Pandora's Box
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:09,920	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Ripped wide open
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:16,320	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Because out there were lots of different kinds of intelligence is intelligence wasn't
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:16,832	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Complicated
EDL	00:30:17,344	00:30:18,624	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Do justice one kind
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:22,464	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Spearman believed we each had a certain amount of it
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:23,488	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Sometime we were born
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:25,792	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And if that could somehow be measured
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:37,824	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	We're now being used as a social construct
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:40,128	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Classified people
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:42,176	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Rather than help individuals
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:47,296	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	This is exactly the same thing they warned against this is that brutal pessimism
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:51,136	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Keith never got a chance to speak out against the testing use this way
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:53,184	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	He died in 1911
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:55,744	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And in the years after his death
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:57,792	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Got the teens and 20s and 30s
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:31:00,352	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	IQ tests were given to millions of people
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:07,264	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Used to decide who should get which job
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:12,896	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	We should be allowed to immigrate to one country or another
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:14,176	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And eventually
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:16,224	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Who should be institutionalized
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:18,016	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And forcibly sterilized
EDL	00:31:18,016	00:31:23,904	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Get the thing we haven't mentioned about Charles Spearman and a lot of these early intelligence scientist is
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:24,672	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Are you jealous
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:29,792	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And so the whole early history of IQ testing is wrapped up in this ideology
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:34,656	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	These guys thought they could selectively breed people to create some kind of Master race
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:39,008	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And we're going to go deep into that part of the history and future episode
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:39,776	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Out with that
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:42,592	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Avila Miller what are the creators of invisibilia
EDL	00:31:42,592	00:31:46,432	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Type to say once I Q tests were being used to pick people to be sterilized
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:49,248	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	It just
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:50,528	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Kept getting worse
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:31:58,464	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The measurement
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:31:59,744	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Was Central
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:01,792	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Do the Nazi Doctrine

EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:16,896	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	When did begin forcibly sterilizing and then executing thousands of people that they've classified as
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:17,920	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	As mentally ill
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:19,456	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Disabled or
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:20,736	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	What they called feeble minded
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:23,040	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Meaning that they scored low on an IQ test
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:26,112	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	This program was called T4
EDL	00:32:26,112	00:32:32,256	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And it was a precursor to and essentially a training ground for the mass executions of Jewish people

EDL	00:32:58,368	00:32:59,392	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Given that history
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:02,720	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I kind of expected that after World War II

EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:21,312	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Has a problem
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:23,360	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Not only because of its history
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:25,664	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	But because of the way it's made now
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:26,944	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The test did not
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:30,016	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Consider the experiences
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:33,600	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And the backgrounds of minorities or black children or
EDL	00:34:33,600	00:34:34,112	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Children who
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:39,744	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Did not have a white middle-class background they were culturally
EDL	00:34:39,744	00:34:41,280	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Pacific to European American
EDL	00:34:41,792	00:34:48,192	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	That psychologists Brandon gamble again for him Harold Dent who's one of those young black psychologist who started pushing back
EDL	00:34:48,192	00:34:48,960	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Back in the 1960
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:51,520	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And think that the problem was
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:56,384	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Remember how I told you that I Q test is normed where they give the test to a whole bunch of kids
EDL	00:34:56,384	00:35:00,480	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Encounter scores together to start to figure out the average score for each age
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:03,296	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Well at the test makers
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:04,576	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I only use white kids
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:06,368	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	If you'd set up one standard
EDL	00:35:07,648	00:35:11,488	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Everybody doesn't meet that standard enter these black psychologists would like
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:12,768	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	What about 9
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:17,120	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Skip that child is not from that cultural framing at cultural experience
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:19,168	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	They may give different answers
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:22,240	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	IQ test scores did not
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:25,312	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Deal with the background and experiences of black children
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:28,384	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Which is what this lawsuit ended up being about
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:34,272	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I just filled in California today about intelligence quotient test a lawsuit has been filed
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:35,808	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	When says that IQ tests
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:38,880	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Discriminate against black children because these tests
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:44,768	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Okay take a picture to try to imagine ourselves into day 1 of this trial like what do we know
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:51,168	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	We don't lose a federal case so it was in US District Court this is Lee running again downtown San Francisco
EDL	00:35:51,168	00:35:57,312	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	You know just a couple of blocks from City Hall do you know what the room would have looked like we know from the court sketch
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:36:00,384	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	That right behind the witness stand with a giant American flag
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:03,968	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	You know that the the judge seated there next to the witness box
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:06,528	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Robert Peckham hiza
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:08,064	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Mostly ball
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:12,160	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Gentleman wire rim glasses spoke
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:17,024	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Someone quietly you got pick them up at the front and then the lawyers for the families
EDL	00:36:17,024	00:36:18,304	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Number of attorneys
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:19,840	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	One thing you just heard
EDL	00:36:19,840	00:36:21,376	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Armando menocal
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:24,448	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Extend the trial Armando had only been aware for about 4 years
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:27,008	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I was the only lawyer that was in court everyday
EDL	00:36:27,520	00:36:28,544	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Myself
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:34,688	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And the chief lawyer for the state Rose 12th of October of 1977
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:36,224	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Pokemon for 7 months
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:39,296	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	10000 pages of witness testimony
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:41,600	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	10114 pages
EDL	00:36:43,392	00:36:43,904	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Turn
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:48,000	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Oh my god did you go through all of it
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:54,912	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I did but like I whipped through some of it one of the first big things that happens is the plaintiff called this guy named AC
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:55,424	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The halyard
EDL	00:36:55,936	00:37:02,336	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The late dr. ASA Hilliard he had been the dean of the school of education at San Francisco State University
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:05,408	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The big expert on racial bias in education until
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:08,224	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Yep yep so Hilliard gosip
EDL	00:37:08,224	00:37:10,528	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Dan get sworn in and Hugh
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:16,160	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	You have a second I'll try to find and one of the family boyars stands up and picked up this body exhibit
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:17,952	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Pete 66a
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:18,976	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And walked over to the Sea
EDL	00:37:18,976	00:37:24,096	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And then he says let me hand you this black box and ask you if you can identify this for the court
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:27,168	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Says this is what the actual Beast looks
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:28,704	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Books like because of the Beast
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:29,728	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Yeah
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:33,056	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And so Hilliard says right this is a kit for the wisc
EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:35,872	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The wechsler intelligence scale for children
EDL	00:37:35,872	00:37:36,640	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	AKA
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:38,944	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The Whisk which was the main
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:40,480	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Test that was being used
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:41,504	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	In schools
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:42,272	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Okay so this
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:47,392	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	This is Madden again you're just like explain what this test
EDL	00:37:48,416	00:37:50,720	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	But what exactly is it at Connecticut
EDL	00:37:50,720	00:37:51,744	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Hilliard says
EDL	00:37:51,744	00:37:52,512	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Right
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:53,792	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Let me try one
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:59,168	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	There's going to be an actor right so do you want me to reserve a round
EDL	00:37:59,168	00:38:02,240	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	But the actors going to come by just have you read a butter stuff okay
EDL	00:38:03,264	00:38:06,336	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Maybe I shouldn't pick number
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:10,176	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The Columbus Day but take this question from a section called general information
EDL	00:38:10,176	00:38:12,992	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	One of the items about general information is
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:14,784	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Who discovered America
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:18,880	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And the only two possible answers here on Columbus and Leif Erikson
EDL	00:38:19,392	00:38:22,720	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And of course there are some people would have a little disagreement with that
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:28,096	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Any answers just being like wrong Hilliard brought this one up
EDL	00:38:28,096	00:38:30,912	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Went out that this isn't a test of like
EDL	00:38:30,912	00:38:31,680	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Thinking
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:32,960	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Ability this is a
EDL	00:38:32,960	00:38:33,984	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Acquired knowledge
EDL	00:38:34,496	00:38:35,264	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	We give it another day
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:38,080	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Who wrote Romeo and Juliet
EDL	00:38:39,616	00:38:40,896	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Shakespeare
EDL	00:38:40,896	00:38:45,504	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Yeah good job thank you and they say Tchaikovsky
EDL	00:38:45,504	00:38:47,808	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Tchaikovsky's also acceptable
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:50,624	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Tchaikovsky Romeo and Juliet
EDL	00:38:50,624	00:38:51,648	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	See I didn't know that
EDL	00:38:51,648	00:38:57,024	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I didn't know that the people make these tests what explains you at the point of a question like that
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:38:59,328	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Is that a lot of kids won't know the answer
EDL	00:38:59,840	00:39:02,656	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	A question number 16 so it's supposed to be hard
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:05,472	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The point being on there isn't that like
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:09,312	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Knowing that information in particular is especially important
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:13,152	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	But the Pacemakers have figured out that the kids who get that question right
EDL	00:39:13,152	00:39:17,504	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Are more likely to do well on all the other parts of the IQ test
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:18,784	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Because that G Thang
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:19,296	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	We talked about before
EDL	00:39:21,856	00:39:22,624	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The problem is
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:25,440	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	There are all kinds of other variables at play here
EDL	00:39:25,952	00:39:29,280	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Like where do you know who wrote Romeo and Juliet
EDL	00:39:30,304	00:39:32,096	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Say something about your intelligence
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:36,448	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	But it might also just be an indication of whether your parents told you about Shakespeare
EDL	00:39:36,448	00:39:42,336	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Or whether you learned about him in school what right do we have to expect children from some areas of the country of
EDL	00:39:42,336	00:39:43,872	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Some areas of cities
EDL	00:39:43,872	00:39:46,944	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	To spend time studying about Romeo and Juliet
EDL	00:39:46,944	00:39:51,296	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And who argued this acquired knowledge problem affected a whole bunch of different parts
EDL	00:39:51,808	00:39:54,112	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	That would be the same thing here on math
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:57,952	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Show me children and not had the opportunity to have good math instructor
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:40:01,536	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	They are going to be compared with children who have had good math
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:02,048	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Instructions
EDL	00:40:02,816	00:40:06,400	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Then to me you have an economic cultural bias that's represented in there
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:09,472	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The same thing would be true with similarity
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:10,240	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Vocab
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:11,776	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	For example
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:14,080	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	For example you're supposed to be able to answer the question
EDL	00:40:14,080	00:40:16,640	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	In what way are salt and water alike
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:19,968	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	In what way are salt and water alike
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:21,248	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Okay
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:24,320	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	In what way do they have to
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:25,088	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Comcast
EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:25,856	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Compounds
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:30,976	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	That make them a thing H2O + NaCl
EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:37,376	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I mean I would say I mean the first thing that comes to mind for me is like
EDL	00:40:37,376	00:40:40,192	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Together Rachel you actually
EDL	00:40:40,704	00:40:45,312	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Got the high score right out of the gate okay so here it is
EDL	00:40:45,312	00:40:46,848	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	You get two points
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:47,872	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	If you give this answer
EDL	00:40:48,384	00:40:52,224	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	A response that indicates that they are both necessary for life
EDL	00:40:52,224	00:40:55,296	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Or that they are both chemical compounds
EDL	00:40:58,112	00:40:59,904	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	So those are the only two answers
EDL	00:40:59,904	00:41:01,440	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	That you get two points for
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:05,280	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	If you say that they are both in the ocean you didn't know point
EDL	00:41:05,280	00:41:05,792	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	What
EDL	00:41:06,304	00:41:12,704	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	How do you say that you can drink both of them you get no poi
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:16,800	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Points if you say salt comes out of the water there isn't a single right answer
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:18,848	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I'd argue that my answer was just fine
EDL	00:41:19,616	00:41:23,456	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	But Hilliard explained that the Whisk favors a certain kind of

EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:38,304	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Andy asked
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:41,120	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Why is that any more intelligent
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:42,656	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Been saying salt
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:43,680	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	It's from the ocean
EDL	00:41:43,680	00:41:45,216	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	This is where the cultural bias
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:45,984	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Comes in again
EDL	00:41:45,984	00:41:49,568	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	In point wise thinking abstractly in this way
EDL	00:41:49,568	00:41:51,360	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Is as required as
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:52,384	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Knowing who wrote
EDL	00:41:53,151	00:41:58,527	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	They argue there are big parts of the test that do measure things that feel way more like
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:41:59,551	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Your thinking ability
EDL	00:42:00,063	00:42:02,623	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Did the memory test work and just have to read back at you

EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:10,815	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	There's a picture completion test where kids test appointment with missing from a drawing
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:12,351	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	But
EDL	00:42:12,351	00:42:14,655	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	For every part of the test like that
EDL	00:42:14,655	00:42:17,471	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	There's another part that feels way squishier
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:21,567	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And are the test where you see racial bias most blatantly
EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:23,103	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Is this one called comprehension
EDL	00:42:23,615	00:42:28,479	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	This is Brandon gamble again in with comprehension they may ask somebody kind of a moral Quest
EDL	00:42:29,247	00:42:33,599	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Kid is given a hypothetical social situation and asked how they should respond
EDL	00:42:34,111	00:42:36,415	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Like what should you do if you cut your finger

EDL	00:42:45,887	00:42:52,287	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Lorenzo's like a lot of the parts of this nasty questions don't have a single right answer which means they can be biased
EDL	00:42:52,287	00:42:53,311	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Towards people
EDL	00:42:53,311	00:42:56,127	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Answer the question in the way the people who made the test
EDL	00:42:56,127	00:42:57,151	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Think it should be answer
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:43:02,271	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Which is a big problem if you don't think the way the people made the test thing
EDL	00:43:02,783	00:43:07,135	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Brandon told us about one of these questions that he I ran into when he started working at the school
EDL	00:43:07,135	00:43:09,439	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Psychologist if you found somebody's wallet
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:15,839	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Like sitting on a shelf in a store what would you do with it would you give it back to them you know try to search the mountains
EDL	00:43:15,839	00:43:16,863	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Find out how to give it back to them
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:18,655	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Or would you
EDL	00:43:18,655	00:43:20,447	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Leave it alone or
EDL	00:43:20,447	00:43:23,519	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Keep that money need correct answer is
EDL	00:43:23,519	00:43:25,567	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Find the store manager and give them the wallet
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:27,615	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	But Brandon Tony
EDL	00:43:27,615	00:43:29,151	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	He would not have answered it that way
EDL	00:43:29,663	00:43:32,735	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I've waited said you don't have and I'm not touching cuz they probably accuse me of something
EDL	00:43:32,735	00:43:33,759	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Because you're black
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:36,063	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And you know what I've been in that situation
EDL	00:43:36,575	00:43:40,415	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I went with a scouting group and my mother was director of The Scouting group
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:41,439	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And we were at
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:43,999	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	A science museum
EDL	00:43:44,767	00:43:47,071	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I'm a nerd I didn't realize it back then how much
EDL	00:43:47,583	00:43:48,607	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	When I was
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:51,935	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	But I was wearing my scouting uniform which had this shiny belt buckle
EDL	00:43:52,447	00:43:53,471	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	So I keep
EDL	00:43:53,983	00:43:55,775	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Try it it but I get smudges on it
EDL	00:43:56,543	00:43:57,311	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	So
EDL	00:43:57,311	00:43:58,591	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I'm looking at my belt buckle
EDL	00:43:59,359	00:44:00,895	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And they're thinking I'm stuck in my pants
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:04,223	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	So are you ready gets call
EDL	00:44:05,759	00:44:06,783	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Oggi's
EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:09,087	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And I have no idea what's going on but my mother does
EDL	00:44:09,855	00:44:11,903	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	My mother thinks you're not strip searching
EDL	00:44:12,415	00:44:13,183	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	My job
EDL	00:44:13,183	00:44:14,463	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	When is Brendon says
EDL	00:44:14,463	00:44:16,767	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	If your blackhead and you see that question
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:17,535	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	You might think
EDL	00:44:18,047	00:44:19,839	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Clearly the correct answer is
EDL	00:44:19,839	00:44:21,631	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Leave the wallet where it is
EDL	00:44:21,631	00:44:22,655	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Really what the
EDL	00:44:22,655	00:44:24,447	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	With is measuring is
EDL	00:44:24,447	00:44:28,799	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Assimilation into American culture and how well you assimilate as a predictor
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:29,567	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Not so much
EDL	00:44:30,079	00:44:32,639	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Your actual intelligence and what you know
EDL	00:44:33,151	00:44:37,503	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	So at the family's footboard a bunch of argument saying the test is racially biased
EDL	00:44:38,271	00:44:39,295	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And then the state
EDL	00:44:39,807	00:44:40,575	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Get up
EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:41,855	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And have to defend
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:42,367	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The.
EDL	00:44:43,647	00:44:44,671	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And their argument
EDL	00:44:44,671	00:44:45,695	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Basically goes like
EDL	00:44:45,695	00:44:46,975	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	There's nothing wrong with Tess
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:49,279	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	That they are just as valid
EDL	00:44:49,279	00:44:55,679	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	You know to use for all the american-born English-speaking kids
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:45:00,799	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Psychology professor at the University of Missouri and it's in a bunch of research on the Larry P case and bias in test
EDL	00:45:02,079	00:45:06,687	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	He says it's not enough for test question just to feel like it's biased
EDL	00:45:06,687	00:45:08,991	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	You always have to go back to the data
EDL	00:45:08,991	00:45:15,135	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And say what does the data say and does the data bear this out you have to prove statistically that it
EDL	00:45:15,647	00:45:21,791	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And a lot of these arguments the data just doesn't bear it out so it's like take that question who discovered America
EDL	00:45:22,303	00:45:27,679	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	According to Craig to prove that that question is biased against the save black children
EDL	00:45:27,679	00:45:30,751	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	You have to give that question to a group of white children
EDL	00:45:30,751	00:45:35,103	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And get the same question to a group of black children and show the black children
EDL	00:45:35,103	00:45:37,407	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Are more likely to get it wrong then the white child
EDL	00:45:38,175	00:45:39,199	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And Craig says
EDL	00:45:39,199	00:45:40,223	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The families in Worcester
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:47,647	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Didn't do that you know you're kind of going to shooting in the dark a little bit well this could be this could be so when
EDL	00:45:47,647	00:45:48,671	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Whenever you try that kind of
EDL	00:45:49,183	00:45:50,975	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Given ad hoc
EDL	00:45:50,975	00:45:53,023	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Explanation for
EDL	00:45:53,023	00:45:54,047	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	What you see
EDL	00:45:54,559	00:45:56,095	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	It's not a scientific
EDL	00:45:56,863	00:45:57,887	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Enterprise
EDL	00:45:57,887	00:46:04,287	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	But the reason ironically that didn't exist is because like we said before the IQ test that was given to the kid
EDL	00:46:04,287	00:46:04,799	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	It's like Daryl
EDL	00:46:05,311	00:46:07,615	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Was only normed with only standardized
EDL	00:46:08,127	00:46:08,895	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Unlike it
EDL	00:46:08,895	00:46:12,991	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And everyone admitted that no one had attempted in the testing companies
EDL	00:46:13,759	00:46:16,063	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Had attempted to validate the test
EDL	00:46:16,063	00:46:17,087	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	4 black and white
EDL	00:46:17,599	00:46:21,439	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Still Craig says the state argued the families didn't have the data they need to
EDL	00:46:21,439	00:46:22,463	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Prove their case
EDL	00:46:22,463	00:46:22,975	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Statistically
EDL	00:46:23,487	00:46:25,023	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	But the date of the state did have
EDL	00:46:25,535	00:46:26,303	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Craigslist
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:28,607	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Show that when you give IQ test black kids
EDL	00:46:28,607	00:46:31,935	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	You find the entire range of scores that you see in white kids
EDL	00:46:31,935	00:46:34,495	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	So a test we're truly biased
EDL	00:46:35,263	00:46:40,639	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Against kids because of their skin color their race and you would never have examples of
EDL	00:46:41,151	00:46:44,735	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Of African Americans who get high scores on IQ test
EDL	00:46:44,735	00:46:48,319	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And you would never have examples of white kids to get low scores
EDL	00:46:49,087	00:46:54,463	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	On IQ test said like if black children can scored very high on IQ test
EDL	00:46:54,975	00:46:55,743	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	How could they be bias
EDL	00:46:56,255	00:46:58,047	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	You have the full range
EDL	00:46:58,047	00:46:58,815	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	But
EDL	00:46:58,815	00:47:00,351	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Even though you see that entire range
EDL	00:47:01,119	00:47:02,399	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	You see something else too
EDL	00:47:02,399	00:47:03,423	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The means
EDL	00:47:03,935	00:47:05,215	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The averages
EDL	00:47:05,215	00:47:06,239	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Differ
EDL	00:47:06,239	00:47:08,543	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I'm group the group the average shift down
EDL	00:47:09,311	00:47:13,663	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The average score for black kids with lower than the average score of white
EDL	00:47:14,687	00:47:18,015	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	What the results seem to say about Americans
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:20,063	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Blacks as a group
EDL	00:47:20,063	00:47:22,111	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Scored 15 points lower than whites
EDL	00:47:22,111	00:47:24,671	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	So if the state were saying there's no bias
EDL	00:47:24,671	00:47:25,951	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	What explains that
EDL	00:47:26,975	00:47:27,743	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Discrepancies
EDL	00:47:29,279	00:47:34,143	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	One of the first things that people will say that the poor gasoline
EDL	00:47:34,143	00:47:35,679	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	On the issue is vasayo
EDL	00:47:36,191	00:47:38,239	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	If you're saying the test
EDL	00:47:38,239	00:47:40,543	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Are not biased and that means that
EDL	00:47:40,543	00:47:46,943	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	This group is genetically inferior to this other huge controversy happening in America at this time over
EDL	00:47:46,943	00:47:47,967	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	For that very idea
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:49,247	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	An old Theory
EDL	00:47:49,247	00:47:53,343	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Originally revived by psychologist Arthur Jensen of the University of California
EDL	00:47:53,855	00:47:56,159	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Is it better stay that your position has been
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:47:59,231	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Black Americans a survey
EDL	00:47:59,743	00:48:01,023	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Or not as intelligent
EDL	00:48:01,535	00:48:02,303	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Egg white
EDL	00:48:04,095	00:48:07,935	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	By my definition of intelligence yes I would say that's a fair of State
EDL	00:48:08,447	00:48:14,847	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And defend the state actually tried bringing this argument into the lawsuit they had introduced it in
EDL	00:48:14,847	00:48:16,895	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	In some of the pre-trial
EDL	00:48:17,407	00:48:19,711	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Paperwork as a possible
EDL	00:48:19,711	00:48:20,479	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Defense
EDL	00:48:20,479	00:48:23,551	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	But when they're getting ready to go to trial Wilson Riles
EDL	00:48:23,551	00:48:29,183	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The state superintendent of Education who was the name defendant in the case and happened to be a black man himself
EDL	00:48:30,207	00:48:31,231	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Stuff is
EDL	00:48:32,255	00:48:38,399	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Rapist and disgusting and vile and I can't be a part of that and I especially can't have the state be a part of the
EDL	00:48:38,399	00:48:42,751	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	That depends never directly brought that argument up in trial
EDL	00:48:42,751	00:48:44,287	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And that was kind of the ghost
EDL	00:48:44,287	00:48:46,335	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	In the room and even leave the state
EDL	00:48:46,335	00:48:51,199	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Funny tried to shuffle that argument back under the rug the family's lawyers wanted to
EDL	00:48:51,199	00:48:51,967	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Prove it
EDL	00:48:51,967	00:48:52,735	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Out in the open
EDL	00:48:52,735	00:48:55,039	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	What we were attempting to prove is that
EDL	00:48:55,039	00:48:56,319	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	That test
EDL	00:48:56,319	00:49:00,159	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Mislabeled blacks as being intellectually inferior
EDL	00:49:00,159	00:49:02,463	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	That Armando menocal again and he says
EDL	00:49:02,463	00:49:03,999	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Take out a bunch of different Witnesses
EDL	00:49:03,999	00:49:05,791	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	A whole parade of experts
EDL	00:49:05,791	00:49:07,327	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Medical background
EDL	00:49:07,327	00:49:13,215	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Historians many psychologists many education experts to show in court
EDL	00:49:13,215	00:49:15,263	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	There's no evidence to support that theory
EDL	00:49:16,031	00:49:16,799	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	It's just
EDL	00:49:16,799	00:49:17,567	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Not true
EDL	00:49:17,567	00:49:18,847	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And then eventually say
EDL	00:49:18,847	00:49:21,663	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And there's three times more blacks in classes for the retarded
EDL	00:49:22,431	00:49:25,503	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	It either means a black sword genetically inferior to whites
EDL	00:49:25,503	00:49:31,135	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Which they just spent weeks disproving or the test of discriminatory eventually get down to the IR either or
EDL	00:49:31,135	00:49:32,927	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	That was our goal in cross-examination
EDL	00:49:33,951	00:49:34,463	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And
EDL	00:49:34,975	00:49:37,279	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	We called every one of the states
EDL	00:49:37,279	00:49:38,303	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Employee
EDL	00:49:38,303	00:49:41,119	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	As adverse Witnesses and cross-examine them
EDL	00:49:41,119	00:49:45,471	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And it was one encounter with the Department of Education employee the main guy
EDL	00:49:45,471	00:49:51,871	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Within the department in charge of the classes for the mentally retarded and IQ test at Armando says pretty much
EDL	00:49:51,871	00:49:56,991	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Stop everyone in their track I pretty much got him into a corner where he basically admitted
EDL	00:49:57,503	00:49:58,271	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Yes
EDL	00:49:59,295	00:50:01,343	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	He believed that there
EDL	00:50:02,111	00:50:05,951	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Were more mentally retarded black people than white people
EDL	00:50:06,975	00:50:13,119	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And packing goes wait wait wait wait are you saying you really believe that there are more blacks who are mentally
EDL	00:50:14,399	00:50:15,423	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And the guy said
EDL	00:50:15,423	00:50:15,935	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Yes
EDL	00:50:24,383	00:50:26,687	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	October 16th 1979
EDL	00:50:27,199	00:50:28,735	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Did Beckham issues his ruling
EDL	00:50:29,247	00:50:32,831	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	He just comes right out and says this court finds in favor of plaintiff
EDL	00:50:33,343	00:50:34,111	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Daryl
EDL	00:50:34,111	00:50:34,879	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Is Mom

EDL	00:50:42,559	00:50:45,375	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Have a discriminatory impact against black children
EDL	00:50:45,375	00:50:50,495	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And have not been validated for the purpose of essentially permanent placements of black children
EDL	00:50:50,495	00:50:52,287	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Into educationally dead end

EDL	00:50:58,943	00:51:01,503	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	He says we must recognize at the outset
EDL	00:51:01,503	00:51:03,295	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The history of the IQ test
EDL	00:51:03,295	00:51:06,623	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And if special education classes built on IQ testing
EDL	00:51:06,623	00:51:10,207	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	It's not the history of neutral scientific discoveries
EDL	00:51:10,207	00:51:12,511	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Translated into educational reform
EDL	00:51:12,511	00:51:13,535	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	It is
EDL	00:51:13,535	00:51:15,583	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	History of racial prejudice
EDL	00:51:15,583	00:51:17,119	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Social Darwinism
EDL	00:51:17,119	00:51:20,447	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And of the use of the scientific quote Mystique
EDL	00:51:20,447	00:51:22,239	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Illegitimate such prejudices
EDL	00:51:23,263	00:51:24,543	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Defendant's conduct

EDL	00:51:29,151	00:51:31,967	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Reveals an unlawful segregative intent
EDL	00:51:34,015	00:51:38,879	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	To dumb it down he's basically saying they they proved everything that they set out to prove
EDL	00:51:39,647	00:51:42,207	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	That this was just a disguised
EDL	00:51:42,207	00:51:42,719	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Form of
EDL	00:51:43,231	00:51:45,535	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Segregation in under the guise of science
EDL	00:51:46,303	00:51:48,863	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	A group of Black Folk
EDL	00:51:48,863	00:51:50,399	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Sue the state in one
EDL	00:51:50,911	00:51:52,959	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	How often does that happen
EDL	00:52:02,175	00:52:02,687	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Question
EDL	00:52:03,199	00:52:05,247	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Mrs. Lester how old is Daryl
EDL	00:52:06,271	00:52:06,783	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Answer
EDL	00:52:07,295	00:52:08,575	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Daryl is 18
EDL	00:52:09,343	00:52:09,855	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Question
EDL	00:52:10,879	00:52:11,647	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Mrs. Lester
EDL	00:52:12,415	00:52:13,695	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I know that you have a plane to catch
EDL	00:52:14,207	00:52:16,511	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Is there anything else you might want to say
EDL	00:52:16,511	00:52:18,559	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	If the sum of your feelings about this case
EDL	00:52:21,119	00:52:21,631	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Lucille
EDL	00:52:22,143	00:52:24,703	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Sum it up
EDL	00:52:25,215	00:52:27,007	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I feel like it was a rotten deal
EDL	00:52:27,775	00:52:28,287	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I really do
EDL	00:52:29,055	00:52:35,455	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Because if I had an understanding in the beginning that Daryl was put in a class for the mentally ill
EDL	00:52:35,455	00:52:36,479	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Retarded children
EDL	00:52:37,247	00:52:39,807	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	He wouldn't have been there in the first place
EDL	00:52:39,807	00:52:42,111	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I would have went further
EDL	00:52:42,111	00:52:43,903	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I'm taking him to the doctor
EDL	00:52:43,903	00:52:47,231	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Find out what I thought anything was wrong with him
EDL	00:52:48,511	00:52:49,279	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I feel like
EDL	00:52:50,815	00:52:53,119	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	To a certain extent
EDL	00:52:53,119	00:52:55,935	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And even in his attitude toward people
EDL	00:52:55,935	00:53:01,823	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Certain people have changed because he feels like he has been pushed aside
EDL	00:53:01,823	00:53:06,431	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Feels like he has been discriminated and things like that
EDL	00:53:06,431	00:53:07,455	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Come and told me
EDL	00:53:09,247	00:53:13,087	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And I have to try and straighten it out and tell him what I feel is right about
EDL	00:53:15,135	00:53:19,231	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	At the end of the Atkins decision Brenda Campbell says
EDL	00:53:19,743	00:53:25,887	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	He put a ban in place no IQ tests are given to black children to make decisions about special education
EDL	00:53:26,399	00:53:29,215	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	In the state of California
EDL	00:53:33,567	00:53:37,663	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	By the time this case ended and judge Peckham issued that band years have gone by
EDL	00:53:38,175	00:53:42,783	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Daryl the kid who set this whole thing in motion when he was in elementary school was 20 years old
EDL	00:53:43,295	00:53:44,575	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Wasn't even living in the State anymore
EDL	00:53:45,343	00:53:49,695	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	His mom was still had moved the family way after things have gone so badly for him
EDL	00:53:49,695	00:53:50,207	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Score
EDL	00:53:50,719	00:53:52,767	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And that's really the last anybody heard from Derek
EDL	00:53:53,791	00:53:54,303	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Decade
EDL	00:53:55,583	00:53:56,351	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Until
EDL	00:53:56,351	00:53:57,631	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Remind me came along
EDL	00:53:57,631	00:54:00,703	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Say it maybe they've been reported we spoke with from kalw
EDL	00:54:00,703	00:54:02,751	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Because I should start reporting on this
EDL	00:54:02,751	00:54:04,287	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	She kept wondering
EDL	00:54:04,287	00:54:07,615	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	What happened and everyone was saying now I have no idea and
EDL	00:54:07,615	00:54:09,151	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	To be honest nobody seemed
EDL	00:54:09,151	00:54:09,919	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Terribly
EDL	00:54:09,919	00:54:13,759	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Interested you know and I cuz everyone talks about it

EDL	00:54:24,255	00:54:25,535	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Hanging out with Daryl last
EDL	00:54:26,047	00:54:28,351	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Everyone who works in special ed in California
EDL	00:54:28,351	00:54:29,887	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	They all talk about the Larry Peak
EDL	00:54:30,655	00:54:31,679	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Which is me

EDL	00:54:39,359	00:54:43,199	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Not only not I asked him about this nobody had ever really told him
EDL	00:54:43,711	00:54:44,479	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Like about it
EDL	00:54:44,479	00:54:44,991	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	This
EDL	00:54:45,759	00:54:49,343	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And when I came up there and I had the ruling in my hand this was the
EDL	00:54:49,343	00:54:53,183	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Just the judge's ruling it's like a hundred and thirty pages long

EDL	00:57:22,175	00:57:24,479	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Then there'll told me a story that
EDL	00:57:24,479	00:57:27,295	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Just kind of showed how this thing that happened to him when he was a kid
EDL	00:57:28,319	00:57:29,599	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Never really let him go
EDL	00:57:30,111	00:57:31,135	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I got hurt on the job
EDL	00:57:32,927	00:57:34,975	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I got slammed into a wall
EDL	00:57:36,255	00:57:38,815	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And threw them back all out of whack
EDL	00:57:38,815	00:57:45,215	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Currently he had received they sent me a letter I can workers comp decision letter saying that he
EDL	00:57:45,215	00:57:46,751	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Would be awarded benefits
EDL	00:57:46,751	00:57:47,519	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	But
EDL	00:57:47,519	00:57:50,335	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	He said he took that letter I threw it in the trash
EDL	00:57:51,103	00:57:53,151	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I didn't know cuz he couldn't

EDL	00:57:57,503	00:57:59,295	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Hard to put in words
EDL	00:57:59,295	00:58:01,087	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I've lived this long
EDL	00:58:01,855	00:58:03,391	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	These many years
EDL	00:58:05,695	00:58:07,231	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Lack of reading
EDL	00:58:08,767	00:58:09,535	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	You know
EDL	00:58:10,559	00:58:11,071	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	There was
EDL	00:58:11,583	00:58:13,375	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Things I needed to learn
EDL	00:58:13,375	00:58:14,399	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	That I didn't learn
EDL	00:58:15,679	00:58:16,703	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And he still
EDL	00:58:16,703	00:58:18,751	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I struggle with this sometimes
EDL	00:58:19,263	00:58:23,103	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	I'll be down here by myself so I come downstairs and he's
EDL	00:58:23,103	00:58:24,383	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Cream for crying
EDL	00:58:24,895	00:58:27,711	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And they say grown men don't cry that's a lie
EDL	00:58:30,015	00:58:31,295	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And I should say
EDL	00:58:31,295	00:58:34,111	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Daryl life is tough but it's not all bleach
EDL	00:58:34,623	00:58:35,903	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Has a daughter
EDL	00:58:35,903	00:58:37,183	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	He's happily married
EDL	00:58:37,183	00:58:39,743	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	CU MIT we grew up together
EDL	00:58:40,767	00:58:42,047	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Yeah we grew up in church.
EDL	00:58:42,815	00:58:44,351	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Yeah that's how we know each

EDL	00:59:00,479	00:59:01,759	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And so
EDL	00:59:02,527	00:59:04,319	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	People talk about the case and
EDL	00:59:04,319	00:59:07,903	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	And here like there's this fully dimensional
EDL	00:59:07,903	00:59:08,927	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Human being
EDL	00:59:09,439	00:59:10,207	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	That
EDL	00:59:10,207	00:59:10,975	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	Seems like the
EDL	00:59:11,487	00:59:12,767	| radiolab_podcast19larryp1__intelligence-series |	The case of merely
