EDL	00:00:07,168	00:00:10,496	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Northern listening to Radiolab
EDL	00:00:11,520	00:00:15,616	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Radio WNYC
EDL	00:00:19,712	00:00:21,248	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Gonads episode 3
EDL	00:00:22,528	00:00:23,552	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Emily Webster
EDL	00:00:24,064	00:00:29,440	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Hello hello are you still there I'm still here and this is my mother Mary Webster
EDL	00:00:29,440	00:00:35,840	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	But but it's another bedbugs are such a freaking pain vacuum
EDL	00:00:35,840	00:00:42,240	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	All the baseboards at the vacuum the floor is yet to vacuum the door jambs cuz they crawl up the walls and they're trying to get away
EDL	00:00:42,240	00:00:47,360	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	That sounds awful so I recently called my mom for
EDL	00:00:47,872	00:00:54,016	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I guess the ketchup but also I had to work question
EDL	00:00:56,832	00:01:03,232	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	That's been bugging me
EDL	00:01:03,232	00:01:06,048	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	What's on my mind
EDL	00:01:06,560	00:01:11,936	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	So I asked her mom working on the story and it made me wonder what you would have named me if I was
EDL	00:01:11,936	00:01:12,704	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Boy
EDL	00:01:12,704	00:01:14,240	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	You would have been named Daniel
EDL	00:01:14,752	00:01:16,288	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Dad always like
EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:17,056	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Name
EDL	00:01:17,056	00:01:21,408	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And if we ever had a boy
EDL	00:01:21,408	00:01:23,456	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	That's what you want
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:26,272	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Yeah cuz he didn't want to Junior
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:29,088	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	He wanted to Daniel he wanted a little Danny
EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:32,160	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Instead he got a Judy Chrissy Peggy and Molly
EDL	00:01:32,672	00:01:36,000	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Father Mike lucky father
EDL	00:01:36,000	00:01:38,304	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	If you had come out boy you would have been
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:42,400	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	All of us
EDL	00:01:42,400	00:01:47,520	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Now we wait Daniel for a boy that's for everybody ready
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:50,080	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Yeah well we didn't know when a boy came out as we could have
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:51,104	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Gaming
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:02,880	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	So this is just going to sound ridiculous but I called my mom because
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:04,928	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	All the stories that we've been doing in the series
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:08,000	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	They do make you think about fate
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:13,888	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	But even if you think about the first one where they're the primordial germ cells
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:17,472	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And they're holding on to all sorts of
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:20,032	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Possibilities in futures
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:21,056	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And then
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:25,152	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Chromosome step in
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:28,224	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	No more Infinity
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:30,528	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	You're just like shunted onto
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:31,552	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Appass
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:38,976	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I guess I I guess it I guess asking my mom about Daniel was just like a clumsy way
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:43,840	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Of getting back to what feels like a really pristine Moment Like a moment where
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:45,632	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	No decision
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:47,168	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Heaven
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:51,008	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Where you exist totally unblemish by life and choice in fate
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:53,824	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Unless
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:57,408	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Maybe life isn't so faithful
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:00,736	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Case in point
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:02,272	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	David zarkower
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:07,648	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Hello hi. I'm just going to make sure I don't like cracking people but I'll just correct you my name is is pronounce Hazard cover
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:14,048	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Is there coover W right on my head
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:16,352	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I pronounce it with that I like a V it's it's
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:17,632	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Ascension polish
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:19,168	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	That's good
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:22,240	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And you work at the University of Minnesota
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:24,288	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	What do you do there
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:26,080	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Genetics cell biology and development
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:28,128	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	That's that seem scary
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:29,152	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	This Broad
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:32,224	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Anyways the reason I called is Arc
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:37,088	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Culver was because I came across the series of experiments that he did that
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:38,880	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Just straight-up kicked me in the gonads
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:42,208	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Okay so to begin this was
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:43,488	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Back in the
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:49,376	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Early 1990s is that cover was working a lab doing genetic stuff in worms and flies and
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:50,144	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And my something
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:53,472	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And Presto we got lucky
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:59,616	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	He and his team discovered a brand-new Gene
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:05,248	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Dmrt1 dmrt1
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:09,088	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I keep trying to say DRM.
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:10,368	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Very sorry for that
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:12,160	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Interesting
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:14,976	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Was at the gym with in mice but also
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:15,488	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Humans
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:18,303	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:19,071	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	In the mailman
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:21,631	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It was expressing itself in the
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:24,191	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Testis
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:30,335	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Can I say it
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:31,615	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Testicle Festival
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:32,895	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Is that a single
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:36,479	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Okay so yes we found this Gene and humans had it
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:36,991	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	In the testis
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:40,063	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And the question we had was
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:45,183	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Weather was doing something or not like you got jeans in your eyes that are making chemicals that are making your eyes
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:45,951	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	The color they are
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:49,023	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	This Gene dmrt1 is it doing
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:51,839	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	We want to know if it's involved in maybe making
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:55,935	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Sperm or maybe just hangs around it doesn't matter doesn't do anything
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:56,959	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	You know we don't know
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:58,239	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	So do you like Alexa
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:04:59,263	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Mess around with it
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:04:59,775	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And see what happens
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:01,567	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	But
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:05,663	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	You can't do that experimenting humans so instead
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:11,551	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Some adult male mice perfectly normal fertile males
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:15,135	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Can we use
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:18,975	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And so basically genetics
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:20,511	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	They cut the gene out
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:24,607	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And then they take a slice of the testis and they look at it under the mat
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:26,143	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:26,911	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I didn't look like
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:28,959	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	What we would have expected
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:35,103	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	In what they expect to see is that these are the cells that help make sperm in the testis
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:37,407	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And normally they're kind of talk
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:38,943	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Hall and lean
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:40,479	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Long and skinny
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:41,503	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	But suddenly
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,527	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	They're different
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:45,855	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	With dmrt1 gone they have gotten smaller
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:46,623	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Rounder
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:50,207	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Inzer cover was like Snot something was supposed to happen
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:51,231	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	What is going on here
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:53,023	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	What are these things
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:54,815	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Then he realized it's a
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:57,375	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	The cells are making estrogen and he was like
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:00,959	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Oh
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:05,311	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I think what is happening is that the cells in the testis
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:06,847	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Turn into ovary cells
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:09,407	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Wait what
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:11,455	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Where's the male Mouse
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:12,735	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Yes
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:15,551	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	So you're saying this mail Mouse now has
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:18,111	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Ovary cells and it's testicles
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:21,439	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Yes that's these are cells that are changing their their sex
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:25,791	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Nothing saying can I come we just have like a
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:32,191	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Exclamatory moment like where you where you think that's possible that happen what is you know
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:32,959	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	What do you say
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:35,519	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Press anyway the greatest of all scientific
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:36,543	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Exclamations is
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:37,055	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	That's weird
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:38,847	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I'm so we had it that's weird Moana
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:41,151	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And just to take
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:43,199	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	This weirdness like one step further
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:46,783	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	A group of scientists did similar
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:48,319	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Experiment in adults
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:49,343	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Female mice
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:52,671	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Were they did like the same
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:56,511	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Only this time they knocked out a female
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:58,047	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Jean in the ovary
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:07:00,863	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And when I went to look at it over is trying to
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:03,679	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Kyrie organize itself into
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:04,191	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Potestas
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:05,983	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Wait
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:08,799	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	You sing in both cases
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:11,615	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	There's one gene it's flipping the sex
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:12,639	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	From male to female and back
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:13,919	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Yes
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:14,431	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	1 G
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:15,711	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	One gene
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:17,247	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	How many teeth do we have in our body
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:18,527	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I don't know like
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:19,551	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Tens of thousands
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:21,599	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I just wanted to
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:22,367	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Witches
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:27,743	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Weird concept to think of because we typically connect
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:30,047	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	XXR gonads
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:32,095	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Two chromosomes least I do like an a
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:32,607	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	X in a y
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:35,935	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Right girl and a boy so how could Gene step in
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:39,263	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And reverse that cuz I thought
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:40,287	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Genes are these
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:41,311	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Like massive thing
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:43,103	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	When she is so tiny
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:46,687	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Ginger tiny chromosomes are much bigger and I think the answer to that is that
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:48,479	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	When you
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:49,503	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Get down to sex
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:52,063	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Like what makes us one sex or the other
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:53,087	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It's not
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:58,207	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It doesn't work exactly like we thought I take for example the X&Y idea
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:58,719	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Dislike
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:02,815	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Chromosomal narrative we have a biological sex
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:06,911	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It's a specific way of thinking about things from a certain moment
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:08,703	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	In history that we are
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:11,775	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Actually starting to rethink
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:14,079	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I think it's helpful to
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:14,847	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Ceaser Tyvek
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:17,663	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	The history of how we understand
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:20,223	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Sex in in a in a longer
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:25,087	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	So let me bring in this guy I'm David page
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:27,647	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Biology professor at MIT
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:28,415	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Where do we start
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:33,023	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Oh my gosh well we're going to go so let's see we could go off the rails and any number of direct
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:35,071	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It's your old father to be quite
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:36,607	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Play productive but footsie
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:39,167	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	So let's go back
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,703	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	2
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:41,727	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	The 1890s
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:46,079	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Yeah that definitely is 1890s
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:46,847	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	So
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:50,687	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	So genetics was in its infancy Mendel peas
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:51,455	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	All that was happening
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:52,735	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And people have been
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:53,503	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Conjuring
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:54,783	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	For millennia
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:56,063	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Where do boys and girls
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:59,391	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Now it came to how you look people. Mom and dad
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:00,927	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Clearly info
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:02,719	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Because people have realized
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:07,583	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	You know the children ended up growing up looking something like their mother and their father
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:13,983	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Like maybe you have a chin like your dad and nose like your mom and a hair that's a little bit of both
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:14,751	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Blending
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:16,799	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Of mom and dad to make you
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:17,567	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It right
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:18,591	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	But
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:22,687	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	When it came to why you where the sex you were
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:24,991	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	That
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:26,015	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Was a mystery
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:27,807	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Because there was no funding
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:29,343	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	You ended up being like
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:30,111	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Either
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:31,647	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Your mother or your father
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:33,951	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	One or the other
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:35,999	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It must not have anything to do with
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:37,279	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Reddit it had to be
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:38,047	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Post
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:38,815	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	From the outside in
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:44,959	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	So people came up with all kinds of ideas for what made you
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:46,239	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	A boy or girl
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:47,775	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	The phase of the moon
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:48,543	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	At this moment
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:51,615	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Conception cold Dark Moon definitely a girl
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,383	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	The state of the

EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:57,247	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Everything that was bad
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:10:02,623	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Was given two women are there was what the mother ate mom's body heat
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:05,951	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Stress all sorts of crazy things and then
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:09,279	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	1923
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:10,559	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	We started looking
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:12,095	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Elsewhere
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:14,399	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	But how do we inherit our character
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:16,191	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Friend answer
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:16,703	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Chromosome
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:17,983	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Chromosome
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:19,007	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Chromosome
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:20,543	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Determine our physical appearance
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:21,567	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And our sex
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:26,431	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	In 1923 a scientist looking down the barrel of a microscope discovered
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:28,223	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Two new chromosome
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:30,527	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Send X and A Y
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:31,551	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Call the sex promo
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:34,623	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	But I just want to hit pause here okay
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:38,975	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I came to find out for Ashley from David page that the X and Y chromosomes
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:41,023	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Do not look like an X and Y
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:42,559	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Like a letter so no no
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:45,631	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	No know when they first discovered them
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:48,191	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Under the microscope they just look like these
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:50,239	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Shaping
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:51,263	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Clumps
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:52,031	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Yard sale
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:52,543	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Kidney bean
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:54,591	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	DX look bigger the white
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:59,967	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Smaller but that's it that's so interesting because there's something about the shape of the Exon the shape of the White Witch
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:01,247	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Read agendered
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:05,599	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Letters that feel so yeah
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:06,367	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Penis lights
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:10,975	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	There's like a duality or something in the acts which feels like you know ovaries in breast
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:12,767	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	After something like there is like
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:16,863	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	There is something about those letters so I was totally shocked when he was like
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:19,423	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	There's no real reason they got those letters it was totally arbiter
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:21,215	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Anyways
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:26,335	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	When they found these chromosomes XX
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:27,103	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Two X chromosomes
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:28,639	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	You would develop is
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:29,919	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Gmail
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:32,479	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Anatomic female and if you had a y chromosome
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:36,063	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	So you're XY
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:36,831	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	That's right
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:37,599	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	A boy
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:38,879	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	That was the thinking
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:42,207	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Rodger and Susan
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:46,047	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	But then
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,839	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	That idea
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:48,607	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I got more
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:51,935	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	When did you intersect with this story

EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:11,903	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	He was involved in what he describes as like
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:16,255	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Precursor to the Human Genome Project what would be

EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:29,567	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Which made people
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:35,199	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And we began to look back at some exceptional human individuals
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:38,015	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Who had not been understood previously
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:39,551	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Bat saliva test

EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:44,927	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Who had an X and A Y
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:46,975	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Like most men
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:48,511	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Women usually have a pair of x
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:52,607	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And they're also looking at men
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:55,167	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Penis testis chromosomes
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:56,703	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Appear to be those
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:57,983	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Typical of a female
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:12:59,007	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	XX
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:04,383	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And 4 Page another scientist they're like oh there must be something more Happening Here than just like the
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:06,431	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Chromosome there must be something
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:07,967	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Deeper going on here
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:09,247	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	So we might actually be on the
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:09,759	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Trail
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:10,783	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Of

EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:15,647	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	So scientists across the world start looking at these peoples chromis
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:18,463	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And what we found was that
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:21,279	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	View XY females
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:23,327	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	We're actually missing
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:24,863	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	A little bit of the Y chromosome
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:26,911	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	But these XY women
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:28,447	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	A little bit of the Y
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:29,727	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Wasn't there
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:33,823	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Of the Y that the XY females
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:34,591	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	We're missing
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:37,919	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Was the same bit that was present
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:38,943	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	In the XX
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:41,759	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Meaning somehow
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:45,855	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	A little bit of the Y chromosome had gotten onto one of the exes
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:47,391	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Abby's XX males
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:48,415	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And so
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:49,439	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Who is becoming
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:50,463	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Very clear
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:51,743	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	That
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:52,255	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	This must
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:53,535	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Fitbit that matter
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:57,119	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And around 1990
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:14:01,215	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Avenues this day scientists say they've made a major Discovery scientist
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:04,031	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	In Britain announced they'd found this one gene
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:05,311	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	On the Y chromosome
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:06,079	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	The genetic
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:10,175	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Trigger on the Y chromosome that determines whether a baby will be a boy
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:10,943	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Or girl
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:17,599	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	What they found is that of the 200 genes on the Y chromosome there was this one
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:19,903	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Single Gene that acted as
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:20,415	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	The switch
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:24,255	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	The master switch the grand master switch
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:26,303	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Which determines the child's sex
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:29,375	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	So it's not X and Y as a whole
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:31,679	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It's one tiny piece
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:40,127	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	So
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:41,663	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Back in the first episode
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:43,455	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	There were those primordial germ cell
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:48,063	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Add to go on that super long journey to get to the gonads
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:48,575	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Cathedral
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:49,599	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:53,951	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	On the journey when they got to the cathedral they were full of potential
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:55,999	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I think it'd be anything
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:59,583	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Female like being female that could be whatever your version of anything is
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:02,143	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And then when they get there
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:04,447	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	There's a moment where
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:07,519	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Fate stepped in and just
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:08,543	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Schleich
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:11,871	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Swept all their possibility away and said you are one thing
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:14,687	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	This is the thing you will be
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:16,479	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	This Gene is
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:17,759	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Baked
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:20,575	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Christian the scientist
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:22,111	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Discovered if it shows up
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:25,695	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Then you shoot off down the path that is
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:27,999	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Testis
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:28,511	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Mail
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:30,559	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And if it doesn't show up
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:32,863	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	You shoot down the path of egg
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:34,143	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Ovary female
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:35,935	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And the scientist
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:38,239	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Davis Jean a name
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:39,263	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Sry
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,311	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It is like
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:43,103	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Sorry
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:47,455	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Like your man sorry
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:51,551	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	So it sounds like we've gone from like crazy ideas about what makes
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:52,831	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	A boy or a girl to
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:54,111	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Chromosomes to now like
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:56,415	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	This little Jean
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:16:01,535	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Yeah but the the sry gene that you just mentioned is different than the gene that
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:02,815	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I just heard about from
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:05,119	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Is there a cover
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:06,143	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Is there coover
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:12,543	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Recovery up stack over Noah's Ark
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:15,615	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Is a different Gene than sry but this
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:17,919	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	This is what's so crazy about dmrt1
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:18,943	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Okay
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:20,223	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Primordial germ
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:22,015	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	There any embryo
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,551	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	The waiting to become something
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:25,599	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And then sorry
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:28,927	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	But just comes on for about a day
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:30,207	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And then
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:31,487	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It goes away
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:35,327	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	But once it turns on it then starts the Psych cast
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:36,351	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Skade of
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:39,423	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Gene Gene after Gene that all sort of
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:47,615	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And what all of these genes do is create chemicals that send out signals that start
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:49,663	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Forming and shaping
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:50,431	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	The test
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:51,199	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:53,503	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	As soon as the test is begins to develop
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:57,343	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Unturned support G
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:58,623	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Dmrt1
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:17:05,023	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	DeckOver stain is important for finishing the job of making a testis
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:06,303	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Make the tattoo turn off
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:09,375	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	But dmrt1 doesn't go away at that point
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:11,167	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It stays active
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:13,471	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Forever
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:19,615	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	In the womb when the testis is just growing and then when you're born and through
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:23,711	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	You know childhood or teenage years adulthood like until you die
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:25,759	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Dmrt1 is on
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:30,111	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And if you take it away like sark overdid
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:31,135	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	The cell will actually
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:31,903	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Change sex
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:34,719	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Which would lead you to believe that
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:38,303	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Dmrt1 is actually preventing a
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,583	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Sal from switching sex
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:43,423	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I called
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:45,471	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Who is a geneticist from our first episode
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,775	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Explain the
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:49,311	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	What all this means
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:55,455	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Is that that other past the past that you did not take in the gonad Cathedral
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:56,735	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It never went away
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:59,551	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It's actually still there
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:01,087	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	You carry it with you always
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:04,671	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It's just that that Gene has been shushing it
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:05,439	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Yeah
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:07,999	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Wait I'm repressing the other pathway my whole life
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:09,791	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Like I think we think so
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:10,559	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Yeah really
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:15,935	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Yeah there's like a parallel universe male Molly yes
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:18,495	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I think there is there's a parallel universe male male
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:26,175	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Wait when you say this Gene has been shutting the other Molly what's that even mean
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:28,991	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Okay so you can think of it like this
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:31,039	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	The code for that other Molly
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,063	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Uncle Daniel
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:33,599	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	That code is still
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:34,623	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	In myself
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:40,255	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And zharkova says it what does Gene does is it sort of one of the things this Gene does a sort of
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:43,327	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Trolls and make sure that Daniel jeans don't turn on
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:49,471	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Basically what does genes been doing it turns out as playing whack-a-mole basically just going around and being like Daniel
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:50,495	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Daniel Nowak
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:52,799	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And it doesn't maybe every day
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:54,591	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It's like an election that's always being kind of
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:56,127	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Challenged
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:57,663	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	That's where why cast
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:58,175	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	The deciding vote
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:18:59,455	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And male happened
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:00,735	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	But
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:01,503	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Does recount
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:02,271	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Every now and then
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:04,063	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:05,087	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	15 Martie 1
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:07,391	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Not there to say nope still mail then
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:08,415	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	You can go the other way
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:10,463	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	So now I understand why you're so
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:17,375	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Obsessed with Daniel because it's not just an idea he's like trying to get out and it does go
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:19,423	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Both ways like like
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:20,959	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	If you know there's sry and there's
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:22,239	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Dmrt1
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:23,007	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	But they
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:25,823	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I found these key jeans in ovaries that you can
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:26,847	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	On and off
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:28,639	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Some more results
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:31,711	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Why would our bodies be set up this way
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:34,783	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Make you think once a decision gets made
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:36,575	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	That you just
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:38,623	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Make that decision and be done with it
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:41,183	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	There always be the possibility of unmaking
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:43,487	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	That is a good question
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:45,535	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I will answer that after break
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:48,607	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	But first
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:50,911	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I'm going to call my sisters
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:43,647	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	This is Kayla Caldwell calling from Sunny Austin Texas

EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:21,536	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:22,816	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Brilliance
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:25,376	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Basically I want to hear about those times when I
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:27,168	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I kid you know did something
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:30,240	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It just means you read back and say whoa
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:35,872	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:36,640	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Back to you
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:39,456	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:43,552	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of the musical score
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:48,160	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:50,720	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	We're interested in the
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:52,000	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Specific moments where
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:56,352	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	A kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with the test

EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:11,104	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	The third episode is basically about how we all carry in US
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:12,128	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Like the APA
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:12,896	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Opposite self
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:14,176	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	That we never became
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:15,968	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	So
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:17,760	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	So I called Mom
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:20,064	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Cuz I was like what would mail

EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:28,256	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And they were like oh we would have called you Daniel
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:34,656	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	That was what they were supposed to call me they were so desperate to use Daniel it turns out that we were all
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:36,448	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	All supposed to be called Daniel
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:38,496	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Reveal
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:42,336	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It's not dinner Daniel Webster
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:45,152	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Has Molly
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:52,576	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Oh man are you surprised that your name would have been Daniel Webster that you would have been a Daniel
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:55,648	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	No I'll do that right
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:58,720	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Peggy. I just know that I don't feel like
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:24:05,120	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	My inner Daniel Webster would have that much of a different life than I have so
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:10,240	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I think you guys honestly not to Railroad this conversation but I think you guys want you out because
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:16,640	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I was the one that was raised with a hoop that there was like some Daniel lingering in me isn't Daniel Webster like a famous
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:18,432	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Sudan history yes
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:21,248	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I took a picture of a statue of him once
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:23,808	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Send it to dad because I was supposed to be the annual
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:25,600	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Who is Daniel Webster
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:27,136	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	She's a boring white dude
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:28,160	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Of course he is
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:33,536	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	We knew that part he served as senator for Massachusetts and was the under Secretary of State
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:36,608	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Under three presidents.
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:40,960	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I think it's just a regular irregular like old white lawyer dude
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:43,008	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Now they're all racist
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:46,080	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Thor ages tour
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:48,128	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Douchebag
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:57,600	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Sorry well
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:01,696	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	All right that's all that's all I got
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:08,096	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I love you guys love you
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:09,376	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Bed bug
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:15,008	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Okay
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:16,544	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Circuit everybody app
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:19,872	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	We have learned that we are all carrying around with us
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:21,664	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Another path
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:24,736	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	We all have our own inner Daniel Webster's
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:27,552	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Constantly
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:29,088	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Whatever
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:29,600	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	So
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:34,976	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	My question for zharkova was like why would I carry this path with me if I'm always trying to like a
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:36,768	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	If I'm just turning it off
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:40,352	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Do you have any answer
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:43,168	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I wish I had the answer so we don't really have an answer
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:46,240	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It could be as boring as
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:52,384	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	What doesn't really matter because normally no molecular Genesis comes in hacks out to Mirchi one or turns on foxtel to or what
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:53,920	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I'm so
EDL	00:25:54,432	00:25:56,736	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Why solve a problem you haven't created that that's
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:25:59,040	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Quite possible but boring
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:00,320	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	The more
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:01,344	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Interesting
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:04,416	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Answer is that this is an evolutionary holdover from
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:06,720	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	From a common ancestor with fish
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:13,888	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	So this ancestor would be our great
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:16,704	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Grandparents 16
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:20,288	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Which means 400 million years ago a fish
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:27,200	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Swam out of the depths of the ocean crawled onto land and took like
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:33,600	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Squelching steps forward and boredom boredom boredom for through millions of years lock and key
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:36,672	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Chance and fate until finally getting to
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:39,744	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	You and me
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:45,632	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Hello hello can you hear me yes can you hear me
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:52,032	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Bob my name is Bob Horner I'm a research Professor studies Evolution and marine biology
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:54,336	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Santa Barbara what's your trash into the ocean
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:56,640	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Wealthy
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:57,920	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Hole
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:27:01,248	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Idea that there is a different world under there
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:07,648	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I'm just going to Adam Brothers. Of this
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:12,256	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	So down in the waters around the Florida Keys their swims
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:18,656	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	A remarkable fish to head wraps it is a very common coral reefs
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:25,056	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Fish this is Marshall Phillips graduate student at North Carolina State University like Bob studies blue heads
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:31,456	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Anyways down in the keys are some Primo spots and ice patches of reef
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:37,856	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Group of say a dozen blue head in that group there will be
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:44,256	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Single large brightly colored male with a blue head
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:50,656	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And it's shiny blue green body and it has white and black stripes right behind its head
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:57,056	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	The go black white black that we very technically called the Oreo and if he's got a big Oreo well
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:28:00,384	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Gmail
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:06,784	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And then the rest of the group is essentially a harem of ladyfish
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:13,184	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	The lady in the group are little and yellow or pretty kind of swim a little slower watching out for
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:19,584	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Birthing email starting all around
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:24,192	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And this Harem of females will basically spend their entire lives on this one
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:30,592	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Where they make every day with that one male the male and the female
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:36,992	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Will Dartmouth in the water column together and then at the same time he'll release his sperm and she'll release her egg
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:43,392	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Xfinity dark right back down and then a different female same nail go up eggs firm
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:49,792	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And then again different female every day
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:55,168	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Over and over
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:57,472	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Say something happens
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:28:58,240	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	To this mail
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:29:02,336	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Jose a predator comes along and he jumps that mail
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:05,408	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	So the alpha male
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:06,432	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Gone
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:13,600	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Now the question is what happens to the ladies you think it would be chaos because their whole system's been thrown out of whack but
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:16,928	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Within
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:18,464	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Minutes to hours
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:20,000	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Life
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:20,768	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Find a way
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:24,096	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Somehow
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:26,656	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	The ladies pic
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:33,056	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Who will be the next male have it pretty well worked out who's the largest
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:37,920	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Each other like you don't line up or anything more than you know
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:39,712	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	But somehow they
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:40,480	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Figure it out
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:43,040	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Until Wednesday establish who the largest female is
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:46,368	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	She starts to change her behavior
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:53,280	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	She gets a little more friendly towards the other females just swim up to them do this little weekly dance started waving her
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:55,584	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Pectoral fin at the ladies
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:29:58,912	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Isn't really something they do as a female ever
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:05,568	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And then as time goes on her body starts to change she will get a little bit bigger
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:14,784	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	How do you just suddenly get bigger testosterone for brain starts sending signals to produce tongue
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:19,648	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	The testosterone testosterone is is taking over and a she starts to grow
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:26,048	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	A little bit of blue starts to appear right adornos her scale start to change color then sort of spread backwards
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:32,448	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Right at her chin and spread outwards until her head is entirely blue and then these darkstripe
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:33,472	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Right start to form
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:37,568	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Those will eventually become that black white black Oreo
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:43,968	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And the other thing that starts to happen is her ovaries start to disintegrate
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:50,368	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	These are the most valuable cells in the body and now suddenly they're being
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:54,464	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Destroyed and then they start to rebuild themselves into testes
EDL	00:30:55,488	00:30:58,560	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Let's start producing sperm really rapidly
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:00,352	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Wow
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:01,376	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It is not
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:02,400	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It's absolutely incredible
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:05,216	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And then
EDL	00:31:06,240	00:31:10,592	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Sex causes back new dominant male at the top of the Heap
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:16,992	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	But at first you not very good at being a male like he doesn't quite know when to Dart up and windows
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:22,112	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Spawn stress like a teenager who doesn't know how to talk to girls but eventually
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:25,184	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	You get the hang of it and can produce baby blue heads
EDL	00:31:27,232	00:31:28,768	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	The cycle of
EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:29,280	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Life
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:30,560	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Continue
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:35,424	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Is it good Attenborough thank you
EDL	00:31:35,424	00:31:36,704	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	That's crazy that they just
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:41,568	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Disintegrate their insides and then rebuild but the funny thing is if you ask Bob about this stuff
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:42,848	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	In fact
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:46,432	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	About how these little lady fish completely transform he's like
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:52,064	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Yeah I hate to admit that but yeah it's not that shocking the shocking thing is
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:52,832	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	How many
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:55,392	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Fishes
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:56,160	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Change sex
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:31:58,208	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It turns out
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:32:00,256	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It's a lot of fishes
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:04,864	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Nearly all the wrasses you blew had your fairies or flashers kush's
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:09,472	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	They actually look like parrots but most of the big groupers
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:11,520	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	The tiny gobies dance of fishes
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:13,568	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Everyone asked about clownfish
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:15,616	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Finding Nemo just that change sex
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:22,016	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	But they do it a little differently from male to female clownfish matriarchy
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:22,784	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It's like
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:24,576	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	100 whole lot of sex changing fish
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:26,624	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Heasley wow hundred
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:27,392	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Skip
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:30,464	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Here's a really crazy thing
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:34,304	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It's not suspicious shrimp
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:40,704	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Worms alligators if you include all of the animals in which their sex goes a different way than you would think
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:41,984	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Mayflies lobsters
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:43,520	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Bananas
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:46,848	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Lizard Birds muscle snails slugs chickens
EDL	00:32:46,848	00:32:48,896	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Chickens eat frogs
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:51,200	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It's just amazing and Waylon we get to Turtles
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:56,064	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It's a whole zoo in this conversation
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:58,112	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	So why would fish like why would
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:33:00,160	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Why would any animal change sex
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:01,696	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Well I think
EDL	00:33:02,208	00:33:03,232	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Sex change
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:07,840	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Increases your Fitness you have more young either eggs you produce or eggs that you fertilized
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:09,632	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Then you would
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:11,680	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	As a
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:12,960	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	As a single sex
EDL	00:33:12,960	00:33:13,984	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	In other words
EDL	00:33:13,984	00:33:17,056	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It just ensures that you can pass on your genetic material
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:20,384	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Like a beer the fishes on the reef and the mail disappears
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:21,664	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	We are stuck
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:24,224	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And there's no there's in your DNA goes nowhere
EDL	00:33:24,736	00:33:27,040	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	But if you can become a male
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:33,440	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	You can make sure that your DNA go somewhere and then like all the other fishes in your little
EDL	00:33:33,952	00:33:34,976	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Kingdom go somewhere
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:37,024	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Okay so now let me ask you the next obvious question
EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:39,072	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	You told me that we come from the sea
EDL	00:33:40,352	00:33:46,752	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	They've got this Lexie sexy thing and the we have it to some degree Daniel lurks within you and is being active
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:47,776	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	We suppress every single day
EDL	00:33:48,800	00:33:50,592	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	So can we be like the fish
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:56,480	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Yeah it does make you think of that the darkover says that ever since he did those Mouse experiments he gets
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:57,248	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	This question a lot
EDL	00:33:57,248	00:34:01,856	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Yeah yeah there's some interest from a transgender community in whether this could be
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:02,880	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Something to be helpful
EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:04,416	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	But
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:05,696	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Can't
EDL	00:34:05,696	00:34:06,464	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Do it
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:07,744	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	We technically can't
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:14,144	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Sakura says it's unethical and at this point probably even technically impossible to take that Chino
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:20,032	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And even if we could removing a gene just won't physically reorganize us
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:22,080	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	In the way the fish do
EDL	00:34:22,080	00:34:23,616	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	He says that most
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:28,992	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	You might be able to produce your own natural sex hormones of the type that's more aligned with your gender identity
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:31,808	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Oh pretty crazy to even get the body to do that
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:36,160	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	But the reason we can't actually do the full on switch
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:37,696	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Is because
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:38,720	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Humans
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:41,280	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Male and female humans
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:42,304	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Have developed
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:43,840	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Internal reproductive
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:44,352	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	The plumbing that is
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:46,400	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	So different from each other
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:48,960	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It would be impossible to drop of a hat
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:49,728	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	To switch
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:52,032	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Then this this makes me confused
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:53,824	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Miguel
EDL	00:34:53,824	00:34:54,592	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Is this
EDL	00:34:55,872	00:34:59,456	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Do use blanche's work from a few episodes ago as it's by potentiality that
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:00,480	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Still is there
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:01,504	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Latent
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:02,784	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Being suppressed
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:06,112	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Is that a legacy thing that is she
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:08,928	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Just fading away or is there is it there
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:09,696	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	For a reason
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:10,720	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	It's there for reason in the fish
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:12,768	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Is it there for a reason.
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:15,072	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Does it serve a purpose
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:16,352	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And therefore will be that
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:17,888	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Always
EDL	00:35:17,888	00:35:18,656	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Or
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:20,192	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Maybe even get stronger
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:23,264	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Yeah it's a no I ask Blanche that I don't know
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:25,568	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I don't know I don't have a good answer for that
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:27,616	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	But it's
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:29,664	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Do you think anyone does
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:32,224	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Or is this like a
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:35,552	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	No I don't think anyone does
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:38,368	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I think we're all trying to figure out why would be the case
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:42,720	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And most people ask the same question you asked her why would this be true
EDL	00:35:43,488	00:35:45,792	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And I don't know why it would be true
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:48,608	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Even if we don't know why
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:54,240	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Just knowing that that other path is there just below the surface
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:57,312	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Wanting to express itself
EDL	00:35:59,360	00:36:03,968	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Make you think a different way about how rigidly we Define
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:04,736	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Ourselves
EDL	00:36:06,272	00:36:07,296	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	I think we like
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:10,880	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	The bin people as male or female and we both always
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:13,184	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Put people into piles
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:16,256	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	But I think there's a tremendous amount of Middle Ground
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:19,584	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Even when you're just talking about
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:25,728	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	You know things like the level of testosterone you're making or the level of estrogen you're making or
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:28,544	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	The shape of your genitalia or
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:31,872	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Many other features that we we we
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:35,200	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	We've been as male or female I think there is a lot of
EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:38,272	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	There's a lot of variation between the two piles
EDL	00:36:40,064	00:36:41,344	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	And maybe we just haven't
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:43,648	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Appreciated the variation that exist
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:45,696	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	Naturally in our population
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:48,416	| radiolab_podcast18x_y_ |	How are you
