EDL	00:00:02,048	00:00:02,816	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Are you awake
EDL	00:00:10,752	00:00:15,616	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Radio WNYC
EDL	00:00:19,456	00:00:22,784	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Hey I'm Jared Radiolab
EDL	00:00:22,784	00:00:23,552	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So
EDL	00:00:24,320	00:00:25,856	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	We got an email from you
EDL	00:00:25,856	00:00:28,160	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You can head
EDL	00:00:28,672	00:00:35,072	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Not long ago our editor and we learned i weekly got into a conversation with this woman
EDL	00:00:35,072	00:00:39,680	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Her name is Janelle Jenny I like the Packers
EDL	00:00:39,680	00:00:44,544	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I guess photographers would technically be my job but I do a whole lot of different things
EDL	00:00:45,056	00:00:49,152	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	None of which really pertain to the story at hand
EDL	00:00:49,664	00:00:55,808	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And our story really starts when Janelle sent an email to the Radiolab inbox basically saying I need your help
EDL	00:00:56,320	00:00:56,832	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Yeah
EDL	00:00:57,344	00:00:58,880	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Something that happened to her
EDL	00:00:58,880	00:01:00,672	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That was a wondrous
EDL	00:01:01,184	00:01:02,976	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	An unexplainable
EDL	00:01:02,976	00:01:04,512	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And very
EDL	00:01:04,512	00:01:05,024	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Weird
EDL	00:01:05,792	00:01:08,864	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And as a result Janelle had found herself stuck
EDL	00:01:08,864	00:01:09,888	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	In
EDL	00:01:09,888	00:01:10,400	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Story
EDL	00:01:10,912	00:01:17,312	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	A story told a hundreds of thousands of people all across the country a story that's its rights
EDL	00:01:17,312	00:01:22,944	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Smack dab in the middle of one of the biggest cultural divides in our country right now
EDL	00:01:22,944	00:01:24,992	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	It was a story that wasn't hers
EDL	00:01:25,504	00:01:29,856	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	She wanted us to help her find a way to finally tell her story
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:32,672	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Do you want me to kind of just
EDL	00:01:34,208	00:01:35,744	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Sure well
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:38,048	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	When I was 18
EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:39,584	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I went to a concert
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:45,216	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	A rock concert he has actually is at Warped Tour
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:49,056	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Looks like a festival of rock concert
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:51,872	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Tons of bands on different stages all over the place
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:57,248	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And Janelle is walking around between all the different stages in merchandising tables when she sees
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:01:58,528	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	This
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:02:02,112	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	10 by 10 white tent with just a little cable insurance
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:08,512	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Table with a sign on it that says sign up to be on the registry sav-a-life something like that
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:11,840	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So this was rock music and good deeds
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:15,680	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Ride together especially right was just a pretty good mix in hindsight
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:18,752	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Soap Janelle read the sign and she thought to herself out sign up
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:20,032	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Why don't ya
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:22,336	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Did you knew what did you know what bone marrow was
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:29,504	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Yeah yeah I mean that would mean that they take a really long needle and stick it in you
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:35,904	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Second bun stuff I suppose at that point that was probably not the for thoughts and I think the altruist
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:38,208	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Thick like do something
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:40,512	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Yeah that was probably the main motivation
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:46,144	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	10th was sign some papers in the swapper cheat because
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:52,032	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	With a bone marrow donation they actually have to figure out if your a genetic match with someone who would receive the donation
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:58,944	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Which is part of what Janelle's that was cool about some I always thought that you would just be an amazing opportunity to
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:01,760	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Be the one person who could do something
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:05,344	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	For somebody that like literally no one else in the world could
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:11,488	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	What's a deep connection with someone that I don't know if either of you are only children by
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:13,792	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Yeah it you know how they're just like
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:18,656	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You have cousins are not friends but at some point there's not that
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:23,264	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	It sounds so stupid that biological connection like besides my parents are
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:25,568	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	When I look at you you missed
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:26,336	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:28,384	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Idea of someone who was
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:34,784	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Muchly like you and muchly in your world and muchly
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:41,184	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Even the kind of the need like somebody out there dependent on me on kind of that almost other
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:42,208	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The worldly level
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:49,120	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Seokjin L swab your cheek sign the paper and then went about her normal life and then about 6 months
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,912	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Later she got a call
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:53,728	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Yeah it was a phone call to my landline
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:56,288	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That's a long-ass
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:57,824	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So what are you doing here
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:04:00,384	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Alex knost 2009
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:01,408	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Okay
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:06,016	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	It was a phone call and I remember very specifically it was a voicemail
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:11,392	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Because I hadn't had the chance to answer it and they said something to the extent of
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:15,232	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Your high from the national bone marrow donor registry
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:17,536	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	We've done some tests and we
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:24,703	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Nailed you down to be a preliminary match for a patient so we need you to come in and do some further tests that in
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:27,519	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The blood and stuff
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:33,919	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Oh no I forgot that I did that or are you thinking oh boy or what were you I was so overcome
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:35,967	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	With emotion I remember just just
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:36,735	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	To think
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:41,087	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	There's somebody there's somebody out there that might be my
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:42,111	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Person
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:44,415	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Awesome absolutely no hesitation am I in
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:46,463	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:49,023	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Janelle heads in the clinic because well
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:55,423	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Bone marrow the stuff in the core of your bones actually produces all your blood cells and in
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:05:00,031	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Importantly including your white blood cells which are a key part of your immune system
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:01,055	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So you doing
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:07,455	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	With a bone marrow transplant is taking a healthy immune system out of one person and putting into another person who is
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:08,991	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	System is
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:15,391	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Cancer or messed up in some kind of way he is owed because the immune system is that part of you that
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:18,975	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Like recognizes you from not you and attacks anything that's not you
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:24,607	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You have to like fool a new body into thinking that this immune system is down
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:30,751	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	To the parts of your DNA that have to do with your immune system couple key parts of that have to match with the door
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:37,407	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So that's what they're doing but you know they're taking her into like test your DNA to see if the stuff that marks out her and
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:40,223	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Matches closely enough
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:46,111	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	But this you know recipient so that the bone marrow transplant will work
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:47,647	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Maybe a months later
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:50,975	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I get another call and this one I was able to answer and they say
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:52,255	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Well
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:59,167	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	We've done tests and you are the ideal person in this 8 million person registry
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:01,215	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	To donate for this patient
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:05,567	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You are a perfect match
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:06,335	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:08,383	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Will you do it
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,175	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Sounds like
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:12,223	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Absolutely
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:18,367	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So you like the call of Destiny like a Maybe Maybe This was meant to be
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:19,903	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Yeah
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:22,463	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	There's something I feel that's like bigger than myself
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:24,255	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	It's happening and I don't
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:28,607	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Really I mean I can't really explain it yet at that point
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:29,631	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	But I know there's like
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:31,679	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Okay here's if there's a big thing
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:33,983	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So I go in
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:39,615	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Unfortunately to disappoint you Robert the way that I donated bone marrow wasn't the actually
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:40,127	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The real
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:46,015	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Bad way with the big needles
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:52,415	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Let me come up with a small meat lovers
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:55,743	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You and this is actually the four more common way of doing it now is
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:57,791	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Inject you with all these drugs
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:07:00,863	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And it is like eight injections that
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:04,447	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Boost your white blood cell count up to astronomical Heights
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:10,847	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And you know like when you get sick when your immune system kicks in overdrive and you feel sick imagine that like 8 time
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:16,223	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Friends over every bone hurt
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:22,623	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And while Janelle is feeling achy and sick inside of her her bone marrow is pumping out a bunch of new baby
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:23,135	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Blood cells
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:25,951	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Unmatured stem cells
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:27,231	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That can really become
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:28,511	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Almost anything
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:31,327	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Let me just go in and grab those cell
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:32,863	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Harvest you I guess
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:37,727	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Do you have a needle in both arms and you pretty much sat still for 6 hours
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:39,775	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Phillies suck all your blood out of your body
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:42,591	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Put in a machine and give you back what they don't need
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:44,895	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So I think they've got about
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:47,455	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You're one of those little IV bags
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:49,759	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Just a quart size plastic bag
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:52,063	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	My
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:59,231	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And once you're done to put some Band-Aids on your like all right
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:01,279	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Let us know if you need anything
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:08,703	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And do you know anything about like what happens to your blood cells like who gets it or what
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:11,263	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Registry is very very strict about
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:13,311	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Patient confidentiality but
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:15,359	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	They did tell me that it was
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:18,687	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	A 29 year old man with
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:20,991	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:27,391	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And that's literally that's all I knew for a whole year
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:29,183	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Endless Google searches of
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:30,719	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	29 year old man
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:36,863	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:39,679	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Animated find anything's course
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:42,751	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	But once that year is up if both parties agree
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:44,031	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Then we can talk
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:47,359	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And that's that's kind of really interesting because
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:51,711	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I definitely was looking forward to that your mark but once that hit
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:52,735	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I kind of got
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,015	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Cold feet
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:55,039	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	A really
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:55,551	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Just
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:57,343	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Wasn't ready
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:09:03,743	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	To know exactly who he was and then I was also worried that maybe this guy is like a real
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:06,047	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Piece of crap like maybe he's a
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:11,679	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Clan member criminal or something so there's a part of that too
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:17,311	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Open up the Sentinel formerly ill person robs three banks in hits old lady

EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:23,711	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I thought that
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:27,551	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So I did end up eventually sending
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:29,855	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	This email and whatnot in
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:31,135	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I think about October

EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:27,679	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Call cards across he made a cigarette. She pulled out of your head or out of somebody
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:32,799	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Casually holding his hand and was holding a zigzag in the tips of his fingers and he goes delighted
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:36,895	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The puff of smoke and there's a there's a real cigarette
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:39,455	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I thought you had at that moment was

EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:43,807	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	It was how did he do that and that is cool and
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:47,647	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You know I'm going to go learn how that's done so I just begin to
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:53,023	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Look at card tricks and read books on all hell all the stuff was done to figure out how it's done
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:57,119	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So when you met Tennyson you know they started practicing together in and doing shows
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:58,911	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	In front of friends and family
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:01,727	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And pretty soon enough we start doing gigs
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:08,639	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	They started doing these shows at like schools and festivals and stuff and they would do these tricks
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:09,663	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Like a lot of
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:10,687	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Card tricks
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:11,967	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Number tricks to say
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:16,319	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Pick a random number and it went end up it was written on a piece of paper in the shoe of Nadia's number
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:17,343	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Something like that
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:18,879	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	But then
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:20,671	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The show would turn into something else
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:21,951	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Because
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:22,719	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The thing is
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:23,487	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Tennyson
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:24,767	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Believer
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:26,047	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Overwhelmingly so
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:28,607	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Believer like in God
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:29,631	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Yeah Christian
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:32,191	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Tennyson was
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:32,703	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Very
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:33,983	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Commenced
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:37,311	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Until after an hour or so of magic tricks
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:39,871	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Just pure entertainment Tennyson would say to the crowd
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:42,175	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	This is been great we're going to take a quick break
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:43,967	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I'm going to give you guys a chance to take off
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:49,855	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Cuz during the second part of the show we're going to talk about what the Christian perspective is and why we believe
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:50,623	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Christian thing
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:52,927	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	If you want to stick around great if you don't take off
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:59,327	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	No gym says during this part of the show missing and particularly was way more of the Evangelistic piece of this
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:00,863	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:03,167	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I consider myself more of a producer
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:04,959	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Now Jim actually grown up going to church
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:09,311	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Yes I was my parents went to Lutheran Church I was
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:10,335	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That was my doing that
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:12,127	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Pittsburgh Steelers
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:13,151	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Yeah you know
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:16,223	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	At the end of the day it's just there was nothing in it
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:16,991	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That's up
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:18,527	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Seem to be
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:19,551	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Satisfying
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:21,599	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So at this point in the show Jim Wood
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:22,367	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Stand back
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:24,159	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	As Tennyson talked about how
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:26,207	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Magic is actually all about the eye
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:28,511	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Seeing behind the veil of reality there's
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:29,279	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	God
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:30,047	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Watching over us
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:31,839	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And Jim said he would
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:33,119	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Standing there on stage
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:35,167	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Watching these people in the audience
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:38,239	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	We're feeling this real connection with God
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:40,799	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	However I wasn't having that experience
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:48,223	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Like I don't feel what they're feeling and he started singing to himself I didn't want to be the guy that's a while I'm a Christian because my
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:49,247	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	My friends were or
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:51,039	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I'm a Christian cuz I was raised that way
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:52,575	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I want it to be true
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:54,111	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	He just wasn't sure that it was
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:54,879	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Right
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:58,719	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And after he in Tennyson and been doing this show for
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:16:00,255	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Year-and-a-half or so
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:01,535	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Jim got a call
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:04,607	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Anderson had been out hiking in the mountains
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:07,935	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Just outside of Boulder and he was found
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:09,215	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	In a river
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:10,239	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	His body was
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:11,263	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Partially submerged
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:13,311	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Just at the edge of the water
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:15,103	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	At the base of a 40-foot cliff
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:17,151	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Peaceful Valley
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:17,919	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Is always calling
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:19,967	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	No one really knows how he passed
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:23,551	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Looks like you might have actually fallen from the cliff
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:24,831	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The police.
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:27,135	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Maybe suicide but it could be
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:28,927	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You know exposure to the elements
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:30,207	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I kind of thing
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:33,535	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Yeah Jim says he was just
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:39,423	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Devastated now he's probably the closest male friend I've ever had just felt like he was
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:41,215	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	In the bottom of a hole
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:41,727	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Yeah
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:44,031	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Bottom of a hole
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:45,311	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Figuring it out
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:49,151	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Best friend passes away my wife and I as a result
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:53,247	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I kind of got into this really strange season where are you know I'm depressed she's depressed
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:55,551	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Pretty much on the verge of
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:58,623	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Calling it Quits and then my leg starts hurting
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:00,927	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Really badly
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:01,695	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Where in the leg
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:03,487	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Underneath my right knee
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:07,583	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Jim says he started popping Advil everyday
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:09,375	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And more and more
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:10,911	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And I'm trying to get it out
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:16,287	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Then he came home one day and he says it's the pain was so bad he couldn't even get out of his car and so his wife was like look
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:17,823	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	We're going to the hospital now
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:22,175	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I'm sitting there and in an emergency room in this man walks into my room he looks me says
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:22,943	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You have cancer
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:30,367	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Jim had leukemia which is on cancer of the blood cells to the white blood cells inside of your bone marrow have literally
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:35,487	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Exploded out of control and the reason why your leg hurts so bad is cuz your your bone is breaking on its own
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:37,279	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	From the inside
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:40,863	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Wow and he said that if you don't do anything you're going to die in 2 months
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:43,423	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Just before Christmas of 2008
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:44,959	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Jim checks into the hospital
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:46,495	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Right away they do two things
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:51,103	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	When they put gym on the bone marrow registry in the hopes that he can find a donor
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:54,175	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	To just to keep him alive while he waits
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:57,247	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	They start putting him through round after round
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:18:02,111	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Chemo and get this wicked concoction of stuff and then be let out loses his hair
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:03,135	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	His body starts
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:03,903	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Fall Apart
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:06,207	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And all you can do at that point is just
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:08,511	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Hope
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:11,327	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Like tick
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:12,095	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Coptic
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:14,655	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Tik Tok Tik Tok yum
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:21,055	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That's when you think you know what you believed to be true
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:24,895	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	How is in Kai's University
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:28,223	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That's when you find out so for me it was not
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:29,759	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	It was not
EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:31,039	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	A Christian worldview
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:33,343	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	There is an all-loving omnipotent
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:35,391	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Powerful being that
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:38,719	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Makes the universe go round then why would things like
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:41,023	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You know suicide or
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:45,119	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Murder or rape exist in it and
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:46,911	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Goodness constructed world of his
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:52,543	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Jim just couldn't get himself to believe in the existence of God like that or
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:53,823	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Really any guy
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:58,175	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Now it wasn't any Rhyme or Reason or purpose is just this is this is my lot
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:00,223	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	This really sucks
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,551	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And then when he was
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:04,319	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That is
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,599	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Lowest point
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:10,719	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Remember driving back to Houston Texas from or chemo and my phone rang and I didn't recognize the number and
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:12,511	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I said hello in this woman on the other line
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:14,047	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	She said
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:15,583	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	There's a one-person
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:18,655	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That we've been able to identify on the planet
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:21,727	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Out of all the databases everything there's one you are
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:25,823	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The ideal person in this 8 million person registry
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:28,127	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	To donate for this patient
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:28,639	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Think about that
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:32,735	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Is in the world you are
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:33,759	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	A perfect match
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:35,551	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Will you do it
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:37,599	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Feels like
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:39,391	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Absolutely
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:42,463	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	My wife and I were in the car together and it was just tears
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:43,743	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You know
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:45,791	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Wow
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:47,583	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Amazing
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:50,143	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So April
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:51,423	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	20th
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:52,447	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And this is
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:53,983	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Important to remember
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:55,775	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	April 20th was when
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:56,543	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I donated
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:19:58,079	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And if they're pulling
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:02,943	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The cells are Janelle's body up in Wisconsin
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:03,455	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Full
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:05,759	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	My
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:07,807	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Himself
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:10,111	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Denton Texas gyms doctors were telling him
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:17,023	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Your bone marrow transplant is scheduled for April 23rd on April 23rd the nurses they come inside of your room to celebrate your set
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:18,303	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Second birth
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:24,703	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And then I remember Dr draw tell me are you ready to put your boxing gloves on when he was preparing me for was
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:26,239	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	A death
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:31,359	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Come to find out later on they pulled my wife
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:36,223	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Out of my room and it said we're going to give this to end with all this medication
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:40,831	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	He could potentially receive this and reject this violently and passed away
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:46,207	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Just remember they're essentially replacing Jim's immune system with somebody else's in this case Janelle's
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:50,815	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And in a very real way the replacing that part of Jim that determines who he is
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:53,119	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Would someone who he clearly isn't
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:54,143	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And Southern
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:56,191	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	A real chance that the body will just
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:57,983	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Short Circuit
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:58,751	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:01,055	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Forgiveness drug the nurses nickname shake and bake
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:03,871	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Designed to basically wipe out whatever is left
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:06,175	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Jem's immune system his white blood cells
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:08,223	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	What inside of your RV
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:11,807	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Your body just starts convulsing and then they put Janelle sells
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:20,000	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And they monitored me and over the next couple weeks to know cells enter Jim's Body to get into his bone marrow and they start Ford
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:24,096	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Reducing new white blood cells producing a whole new immune system
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:26,400	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And eventually
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:28,192	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Jim is cancer free
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:28,960	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I mean it
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:30,496	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	It's literally like
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:31,008	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	New Life
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:32,288	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You know
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:35,360	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Now I will say this
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:39,200	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Some Bells kind of began to go off of my a little bit
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:46,112	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Jim says before he even got the transplant his Doctorate come into his room and told him you're going to be like a baby in
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:48,416	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Inside your mother's womb literally being born again
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:53,024	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Because on April 23rd and once again this is their terminology
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:55,840	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Or someone else that's going to be living on the inside of you
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:58,656	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And this new system of blood is going to
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:21:59,424	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Be your life
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:01,472	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Why is that interesting

EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:04,448	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Not long after they got each other's information and saw each other on Facebook they hopped on a
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:05,216	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	My phone call
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:07,008	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So she gets on and I get on

EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:21,088	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Of a jigsaw puzzle piece
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:26,464	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	On the very spot where they stuck that IV in my arm to pull out the new blood knowing
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:30,816	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I was the missing piece in someone else's life and without me that person wouldn't be alive
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:34,656	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And I said you I was like what I was attempting to have a ton of tattoos

EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:49,504	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So that they would believe

EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:02,048	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	For me it was like I was being introduced to a person
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:07,424	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	There is an experiential understanding
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:08,704	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Of

EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:27,584	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	He's in the hospital
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:30,144	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	My maths
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:32,960	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Throwing up into a bucket
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:33,472	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And he's
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:35,776	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	10
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:38,080	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Huge circles under his eyes
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:42,688	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And then
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:44,736	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	He's playing
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:46,528	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Right when he was on
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:49,856	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The edge of death at his lowest point this
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:51,392	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	This thing happened
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:52,928	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	A miracle happen
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:30:54,976	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	1
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:56,512	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	One person
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:30:58,304	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Just
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:01,120	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	When his
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:03,424	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Blood was literally poisoning his own body
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:07,008	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Somebody substituted there blood on his behalf
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:08,544	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So he could be
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:10,080	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Reborn again
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:15,200	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Three days after his birthday
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:19,040	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The only Global Atlantic Infinity Lite
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:23,648	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So there's a whole three days thing there which is the story of Easter in the rebirth it says
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:26,720	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	In cases such as
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:29,024	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Like definitive proof that there's a God
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:30,304	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Either either
EDL	00:31:30,304	00:31:36,448	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Vista tistical number that continues to propagate this false ideology of Supernatural
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:45,152	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I like being bitten by shark and struck by lightning at the same time
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:48,224	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Or you might have to believe what I believe is true
EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:50,528	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	But that is the result of the girl in the final scene
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:59,488	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So yes this is all
EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:01,280	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Being thrown at me
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:02,048	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And is he
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:03,840	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Is he saying all this
EDL	00:32:03,840	00:32:05,120	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	To you by the pool
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:08,448	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Is it all it all comes tumbling out
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:10,752	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	How are you
EDL	00:32:10,752	00:32:11,264	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	How are you
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:13,312	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Feeling
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:13,824	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Inside
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:15,616	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Stranger and stranger
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:18,432	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Going down the Wormhole because
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:19,456	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I am
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:20,224	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	An atheist
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:23,040	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	In the sense that
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:23,808	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I don't
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:25,088	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I don't believe
EDL	00:32:25,088	00:32:29,184	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	In the tenets of Christianity I don't believe really in the tenants of any
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:30,976	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Established religion I've ever seen
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:34,048	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Honestly I just think that once things
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:39,424	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Are labeled in your pigeon-holed and the exclusivity of really any religion is
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:42,496	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Is the cause for a lot of problems
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:44,288	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	It's world history
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:46,592	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	But
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:50,944	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Face can be beautiful and there's definitely parts of me and there's moments in my life that
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:56,064	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Boy praying and really feeling like that was going out to somebody would feel great
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:57,344	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	But I just
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:32:57,856	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Can't
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:00,160	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	They just can't do it
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:04,256	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So
EDL	00:33:04,768	00:33:06,560	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	At that moment and he's telling me this
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:08,096	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:09,376	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Yeah and he's like well
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:12,448	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You know you're here in Texas for this weekend
EDL	00:33:12,960	00:33:14,752	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And would you be willing
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:17,056	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	To come on stage for one of my shows
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:19,360	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So I can introduce you
EDL	00:33:20,640	00:33:21,152	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And
EDL	00:33:22,432	00:33:23,200	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Of course I said yes
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:25,248	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Really
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:26,784	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Of course he said yes
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:27,552	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Chris
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:29,600	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I've always kind of looked at our story as
EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:31,648	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Something bigger
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:35,488	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Then what he believes and what I don't believe it's
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:38,560	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Diggers capital B underline bold
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:39,072	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	It's big
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:44,960	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Partly because Jim and every show he has the bone marrow registry people right there
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:45,984	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Ready to sign for
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:48,032	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Because
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:49,568	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Of the show they just
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:50,336	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Saw
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:51,872	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You can get a hundred
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:56,224	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I know that dozens of people have gone on to be matches
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:33:56,736	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:33:59,552	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	This was truly the combination of
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:00,832	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	From
EDL	00:34:01,344	00:34:04,160	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The moment I signed up to be on that registry this
EDL	00:34:04,672	00:34:06,976	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Felt like the Zenith of this entire thing
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:12,608	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So last night at Texas Christian University
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:13,888	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Packed house
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:20,288	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Chanel's in the audience I was in like the front row during the second part of the show when Jim goes through the rebirth
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:22,336	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	He stops and he says
EDL	00:34:22,336	00:34:23,616	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That's what everyone
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:24,896	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	A person who saved my life
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:25,920	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	She's here
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:29,248	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	He has me walk up on stage
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:36,416	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Crowd went wild the first time in my life I got a standing ovation
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:36,928	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Haitian
EDL	00:34:38,720	00:34:42,560	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Because you're Jesus that's why the Catholic crazy is because
EDL	00:34:44,352	00:34:44,864	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Yeah
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:49,984	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	All of these kids in the audience who are all pretty much my age as well
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:53,056	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Arsene
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:54,592	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	My being on stage as
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:58,176	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Quite possibly the
EDL	00:34:58,176	00:35:00,224	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Biggest proof they've ever had
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:01,248	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	There is
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:03,296	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Oh God
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:04,832	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Will you will you now
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:08,928	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Wheat was there any part of you that still I shouldn't be here or you all there
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:10,208	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	There was
EDL	00:35:10,976	00:35:12,512	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	A part of me that felt
EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:16,608	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	A little bit of an imposter
EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:20,448	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	But for now she says that feeling was outweighed
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:23,264	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Just by the number of people that were lining up
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:24,288	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The bone marrow
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:25,568	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Donation table
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:28,896	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So the next time she had a chance
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:30,432	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	She did it again
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:35,808	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And again
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:42,976	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	She's now appeared at the end of the show around a dozen times
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:44,000	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	All around the country
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:46,048	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Playing the role of gems
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:47,072	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Personal
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:48,096	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Savior
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:51,680	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And she says the more time she did it the more that feeling that
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:53,472	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Fraud feeling kept
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:53,984	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Popping up
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:56,288	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Each time a little bit louder
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:57,056	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Yeah
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:36:00,384	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	There's parts of me there's Little Fibers in my being that are like
EDL	00:36:01,152	00:36:01,664	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	While if
EDL	00:36:02,176	00:36:04,736	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	If this is a sign if there is a God
EDL	00:36:04,736	00:36:06,016	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I'm a real jerk
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:07,808	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	This is such
EDL	00:36:08,320	00:36:11,392	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	A beautiful and really literal
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:15,232	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Story being told me about like hay
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:16,512	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You know maybe there is a God
EDL	00:36:17,024	00:36:19,072	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Said she started to feel that like if she's both
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:20,096	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Apache wedding vows
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:21,888	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Story and misusing it
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:24,192	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	There's a special place in hell for me
EDL	00:36:25,472	00:36:26,240	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And this is
EDL	00:36:26,240	00:36:28,032	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Why Janelle got in touch with us
EDL	00:36:28,032	00:36:31,872	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Because she wanted us to help her figure out a way to tell a story
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:32,384	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Gitlab
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:35,200	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Her way of seeing the world
EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:36,480	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Into the room
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:39,296	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Okay are you guys
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:40,320	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Is everyone there

EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:45,952	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	How are you
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:52,352	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So I'm pretty sure let's have Nassar actually started talking to Janelle about what exactly she wanted to do and they decided that we
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:56,192	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You just all get in the studio gym and her and all of us and see if we could

EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:14,624	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	What would be the best way for me to kind of tell
EDL	00:37:15,136	00:37:17,184	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	My side of the story
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:20,256	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Yeah my side of our story so to speak without
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:23,328	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So much of the religious stuff
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:26,144	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Yes so when are you guys going to do that
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:32,288	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Maybe I missed the point I'm sorry
EDL	00:37:32,288	00:37:35,616	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So do you say we as in like we are going to do a version of that
EDL	00:37:36,384	00:37:37,408	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Flashlight
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:38,176	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Help me
EDL	00:37:38,176	00:37:39,456	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Oh cool well

EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:47,648	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Yeah cuz you are so not only a magician with magic things but also with words
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:48,160	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Haha
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:49,440	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:50,208	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Maybe if we could
EDL	00:37:50,720	00:37:52,000	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	If you could help me
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:56,608	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Yeah totally that's that's so interesting my mind begins to spin
EDL	00:37:56,608	00:38:03,008	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And I have it so at first we suggested maybe Janelle come out at the end of one of Jim shows and just read a statement or something and Jim said
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:07,104	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That's probably not going to work as you guys know in this world
EDL	00:38:07,104	00:38:10,688	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Mean audiences come based upon how things are marketed and booked and
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:13,504	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Jim said you know he has to worry about
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:15,552	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Turn up as a business the expectations of a
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:18,368	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Sponsors and an even the audience were
EDL	00:38:18,368	00:38:20,160	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	We're looking for a certain thing
EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:20,672	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Producer cuz I'm
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:24,512	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So we're like okay fair enough maybe we could be like a
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:25,536	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Q&A
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:26,560	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	After the show
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:30,144	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I have to really process it but I'm totally open to it
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:31,680	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I would always love to help
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:35,264	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Janelle figured I mean help her
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:37,056	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Put it all together in like I think
EDL	00:38:37,824	00:38:44,224	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So eventually we landed on a plan gym was going to be doing his show up in St Cloud Minnesota
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:46,528	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I and we decided Well we could just
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:49,088	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Do a show with him and Janelle the next night
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:56,512	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So long with preachers LiftMaster in enemy we headed up to steam Cloud met up with Jenelle and that night we went
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:38:58,048	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Did you all go see gems show
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:39:00,608	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Olympic venue there's probably like
EDL	00:39:00,608	00:39:02,400	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Thousand people there all college students
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:08,032	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Intercourse because Janelle was there right after you did the sort of personal Journey back to God
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:09,312	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Check this out
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:19,808	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	She's here tonight a little bit hard to hear but there was literally like
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:25,952	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Shutter of energy that went through the crowd at that moment
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:44,128	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So yeah like I said
EDL	00:39:47,456	00:39:52,832	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Better speaker than you encourage all of you to
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:53,600	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Consider
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:40:00,000	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So Janelle just pointed out that the national bone marrow registry would be there that night and she encouraged everybody to know
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:01,536	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Sign up and have a chance to
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:03,584	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	To Save a Life and do something good

EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:29,184	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Before we close I wanted to know if I can pray for you

EDL	00:41:31,392	00:41:35,488	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Play the podcast Radiolab
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:41,632	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Has about three people that shout it out
EDL	00:41:41,632	00:41:42,656	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Nobody cares
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:44,960	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Radiolab is going to be holding
EDL	00:41:44,960	00:41:49,312	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	This side of the story
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:51,872	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	What happened to her
EDL	00:41:52,640	00:41:53,151	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	All right
EDL	00:41:53,919	00:41:59,295	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So after the show we actually got a chance to talk to some of the people from the audience
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:01,343	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The whole three days
EDL	00:42:04,159	00:42:07,999	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Oh my God I can't believe that she was actually here
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:11,583	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Here in there I would have been so shocked to sit right next to her
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:16,191	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Pretty much everybody was totally floored by actually getting to see Janelle in person and they all seem to
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:21,055	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Take her story The Way Jim does
EDL	00:42:21,055	00:42:21,823	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Today's weather
EDL	00:42:21,823	00:42:24,127	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So many things fell in mine were
EDL	00:42:24,639	00:42:25,919	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You just have to believe in my
EDL	00:42:27,455	00:42:33,855	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So the next night
EDL	00:42:33,855	00:42:40,255	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	My name is Mark Springs much less Fanfare in a much smaller room like maybe a hundred people there is so with the help of the
EDL	00:42:40,255	00:42:44,351	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The religious studies program at st. Cloud University
EDL	00:42:45,631	00:42:47,167	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	We did Janelle sting
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:52,543	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I saw I'm Robert College I am one of the co-hosts of the public radio program called Radiolab
EDL	00:42:52,543	00:42:55,871	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I want you to salser and Wheeler who's our managing editor
EDL	00:42:55,871	00:42:56,383	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Who's going to
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:43:03,551	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That's him he's going to be adding his two cents from time somewhere very Democratic show in like nobody controls everything and everybody pitches in so that's our hero
EDL	00:43:03,551	00:43:04,319	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Go to
EDL	00:43:04,319	00:43:05,855	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And I want to begin by
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:06,367	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Just telling you a store
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:08,671	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So we brought Janelle up on stage
EDL	00:43:08,671	00:43:14,303	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	But you're not going to just come up here and sit I guess might as well sit here we told her whole story of
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:20,703	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Donating and then waiting a year to find out you know who Jim really was
EDL	00:43:20,703	00:43:21,471	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	No idea
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:27,871	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Talk about you know his whole processor
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:28,639	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Recovery
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:33,759	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Trying to get your bearings you talk about how grateful and thankful he was and then return back to Janelle
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:37,855	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	A little more complicated could you just run
EDL	00:43:38,623	00:43:40,927	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I asked you like how you felt
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:42,719	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Inn at 4
EDL	00:43:42,719	00:43:44,511	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Brown and usually told me in the interview
EDL	00:43:47,071	00:43:47,583	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	There was
EDL	00:43:48,095	00:43:49,887	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	A part of me that felt
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:52,703	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	A little bit of an imposter
EDL	00:43:53,471	00:43:55,775	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	When would you use the word imposter
EDL	00:43:59,359	00:44:00,127	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Can we should start getting in
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:03,199	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I think so
EDL	00:44:06,271	00:44:07,039	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Part of me
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:08,575	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I'm in at that time
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:10,111	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Especially
EDL	00:44:10,623	00:44:11,135	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Thought that
EDL	00:44:11,903	00:44:12,927	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I'm up here
EDL	00:44:14,463	00:44:15,231	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Again
EDL	00:44:15,231	00:44:15,743	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Asda
EDL	00:44:17,279	00:44:20,351	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Pretty hard and fast proof or very compelling
EDL	00:44:20,863	00:44:21,887	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Narrative for a lot of
EDL	00:44:21,887	00:44:22,911	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	People and their faith
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:24,959	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That I don't
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:26,239	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Particularly Cher
EDL	00:44:26,751	00:44:27,263	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	At all
EDL	00:44:29,311	00:44:30,079	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The question
EDL	00:44:33,919	00:44:34,943	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Knowing that
EDL	00:44:35,455	00:44:36,479	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You know what I thought
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:42,367	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Why was I was very concerned knowing that you
EDL	00:44:42,879	00:44:43,647	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You know
EDL	00:44:43,647	00:44:47,231	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Didn't agree with what I believe to be true that that you would feel like
EDL	00:44:47,231	00:44:48,255	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Secure in that spot
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:51,327	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That's why I asked you
EDL	00:44:53,119	00:44:53,887	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Yeah
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:56,703	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I'm a good person, doesn't make anything different in the fact that
EDL	00:44:56,703	00:44:57,727	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	It's still what it is
EDL	00:44:58,239	00:44:59,263	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Exactly
EDL	00:45:00,031	00:45:01,311	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I would have done it
EDL	00:45:01,311	00:45:02,591	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Regardless
EDL	00:45:02,591	00:45:03,615	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Whatever it was
EDL	00:45:03,615	00:45:06,943	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	If your whole theme of your show with Halle Berry
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:11,039	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The Dallas Cowboys were and it got everybody to join the bone marrow registry
EDL	00:45:11,807	00:45:17,951	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I would have got a boys have a show
EDL	00:45:17,951	00:45:19,999	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Even though I don't have
EDL	00:45:19,999	00:45:22,303	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You know what I hear to the
EDL	00:45:22,303	00:45:24,095	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The religious tenets of it
EDL	00:45:24,095	00:45:27,167	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I still get that feeling and everybody
EDL	00:45:27,679	00:45:33,567	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	All my family all my friends whatever their religious even my Muslim friends that I've told the story get
EDL	00:45:34,591	00:45:36,127	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Do you know that feeling
EDL	00:45:36,895	00:45:39,455	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And you know what that feeling
EDL	00:45:39,967	00:45:40,479	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Is
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:43,039	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Is a little intangible
EDL	00:45:43,039	00:45:45,087	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	But I think it's something even a little
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:47,391	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Bigger than
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:51,487	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I'm so crappy to see
EDL	00:45:51,487	00:45:53,279	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Bigger than Jesus
EDL	00:45:53,279	00:45:58,911	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That's really Blasphemous but I can't think of a better way to say it
EDL	00:46:01,727	00:46:02,751	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Well you know
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:04,543	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That
EDL	00:46:05,567	00:46:08,127	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	There is good in this universe and there is
EDL	00:46:08,127	00:46:10,431	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Good and everybody and it is
EDL	00:46:10,431	00:46:11,455	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Regardless of
EDL	00:46:13,247	00:46:15,039	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The goodness is at the top of
EDL	00:46:15,039	00:46:18,367	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The list of you and everything else is follow us here
EDL	00:46:18,367	00:46:22,719	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Religion and your race and where you're born and it's your favorite pizza topping
EDL	00:46:22,719	00:46:23,487	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Thanks and all that
EDL	00:46:23,487	00:46:24,767	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	But at the very top
EDL	00:46:25,279	00:46:25,791	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Is
EDL	00:46:26,815	00:46:27,327	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Good
EDL	00:46:27,839	00:46:29,631	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	With a capital G in underline
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:30,911	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	All right
EDL	00:46:31,679	00:46:32,447	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Jim
EDL	00:46:33,215	00:46:38,591	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	In your show you have a rather gorgeous take on on moral relative
EDL	00:46:38,591	00:46:40,383	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You have a string of thoughts
EDL	00:46:42,175	00:46:46,783	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	But this idea of being good and doing no harm and living as ethically as you know how
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:48,063	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Is
EDL	00:46:48,831	00:46:50,367	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Satisfying to some people
EDL	00:46:50,367	00:46:51,903	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	But in your ovulating
EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:52,415	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Really enough
EDL	00:46:54,207	00:46:55,743	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I am this is where we I mean
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:46:58,047	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Obviously there's some disagreement here
EDL	00:46:58,815	00:46:59,583	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I think
EDL	00:46:59,583	00:47:00,607	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That
EDL	00:47:00,607	00:47:03,167	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	There is good and I think that there is evil
EDL	00:47:04,703	00:47:05,471	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	In this world
EDL	00:47:06,239	00:47:07,007	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And
EDL	00:47:07,775	00:47:10,079	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I think the people in and of Their Own
EDL	00:47:10,079	00:47:13,919	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Left their own vices left to own devices I think that the struggle of being good
EDL	00:47:13,919	00:47:15,967	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I think that even on our best day
EDL	00:47:16,735	00:47:17,503	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I think that we
EDL	00:47:19,551	00:47:25,439	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And so in hearing her account you just say you just saying thinking what that is that she's not
EDL	00:47:27,743	00:47:30,303	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	What if what if we're does she falls to where does this idea
EDL	00:47:31,071	00:47:31,839	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Lose you
EDL	00:47:31,839	00:47:33,887	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I don't mean it doesn't lose me I think it's
EDL	00:47:33,887	00:47:35,423	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Phenomenally good it's
EDL	00:47:35,423	00:47:38,495	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Not not acknowledging his good I just think that
EDL	00:47:38,495	00:47:40,031	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	For it for the Christian
EDL	00:47:40,031	00:47:41,567	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	It's not about being good or bad
EDL	00:47:43,103	00:47:43,871	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	What is it about
EDL	00:47:44,383	00:47:45,407	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I think it's about
EDL	00:47:46,943	00:47:48,735	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I think it's about having a relationship with God
EDL	00:47:49,759	00:47:54,367	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You know he made it clear that
EDL	00:47:54,367	00:47:55,135	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Definitely
EDL	00:47:55,135	00:47:56,671	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Wasn't condemning Janelle
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:47:57,951	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Didn't have a relay
EDL	00:47:58,463	00:47:58,975	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	God
EDL	00:47:59,487	00:48:00,511	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	But then we
EDL	00:48:00,511	00:48:04,351	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Start a different approach she started talking about the unlikeliness
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:05,119	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	This whole
EDL	00:48:05,119	00:48:07,935	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Story which is why the things that Jim talks about in the show
EDL	00:48:07,935	00:48:10,239	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Until that point I decided I should jump in
EDL	00:48:11,007	00:48:12,287	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I say this
EDL	00:48:12,287	00:48:13,311	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Really say this only
EDL	00:48:13,823	00:48:17,919	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I'm because it is our job as a show on that when we hear a story like this
EDL	00:48:17,919	00:48:20,991	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	We dig and we investigate and we do that from a frame
EDL	00:48:21,503	00:48:23,551	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Been really focused on math
EDL	00:48:23,551	00:48:27,391	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Facts science and couple things happen to you if you happen to be in my position
EDL	00:48:28,159	00:48:30,463	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You run across stuff like this and I'll just read from the
EDL	00:48:31,231	00:48:31,999	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Be a match
EDL	00:48:31,999	00:48:32,511	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Website
EDL	00:48:33,279	00:48:36,607	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	A patient's likelihood of finding a match and donor on be the match Reddit
EDL	00:48:37,375	00:48:39,935	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Is estimated to be between 66 and 97
EDL	00:48:39,935	00:48:42,239	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Percent chance that you'll find a 10 to 10 match
EDL	00:48:42,751	00:48:43,775	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	In the way that
EDL	00:48:43,775	00:48:45,055	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Jim and Janelle work anime
EDL	00:48:45,055	00:48:45,823	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	10 matches
EDL	00:48:45,823	00:48:47,103	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Is around 50%
EDL	00:48:49,407	00:48:51,199	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Good Witch
EDL	00:48:54,271	00:49:00,671	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	She was the one that let me say that this does not actually contradict with Jim and Janelle's experience of it for
EDL	00:49:00,671	00:49:02,463	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	For that to happen to Jim
EDL	00:49:02,463	00:49:04,767	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Is truly staggering it is truly
EDL	00:49:04,767	00:49:07,071	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	It could be one in a trillion you know like
EDL	00:49:07,071	00:49:09,119	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The way winning a lottery is one in a trillion
EDL	00:49:10,143	00:49:14,751	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	One in the can because what happens is if you backup away from the individual and ask not
EDL	00:49:14,751	00:49:18,847	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	What are the chances this would happen the gym but what are the chances that this would happen to someone
EDL	00:49:18,847	00:49:19,359	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Somewhere
EDL	00:49:19,871	00:49:22,687	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	It's like there's a there's a story about if you're golfing and you hit a golf ball
EDL	00:49:23,455	00:49:26,527	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Nicholas however many hundreds of yards
EDL	00:49:27,039	00:49:28,575	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That lands on a blade of grass
EDL	00:49:28,575	00:49:29,855	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And a blade of grass is
EDL	00:49:30,879	00:49:31,391	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Why me
EDL	00:49:33,183	00:49:35,743	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Why would this golf ball crush me like this
EDL	00:49:36,511	00:49:38,047	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Which is a valid point
EDL	00:49:38,047	00:49:41,631	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I would feel that too but that ball was going to land on some
EDL	00:49:41,631	00:49:42,143	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Way to browse
EDL	00:49:42,911	00:49:43,679	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So are you
EDL	00:49:44,447	00:49:47,263	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	It doesn't like there is the Waimea still a true thing
EDL	00:49:48,031	00:49:49,311	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	It is a true experience
EDL	00:49:49,311	00:49:50,847	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	In which
EDL	00:49:50,847	00:49:53,663	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	There's still this difference I think
EDL	00:49:53,663	00:49:56,479	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The bull can't point to anything greater
EDL	00:49:56,479	00:49:59,039	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	No there's the argument lurks behind this is
EDL	00:50:00,063	00:50:01,855	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That these things happen and it is
EDL	00:50:02,367	00:50:08,511	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Places to random View
EDL	00:50:12,095	00:50:14,143	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The ball of Mercy landed on you
EDL	00:50:14,655	00:50:19,775	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I also not coming at it from just that angle and I wonder if it was just
EDL	00:50:19,775	00:50:21,311	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The bone marrow transplant if it would be
EDL	00:50:21,823	00:50:23,615	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	People get that all the time I think
EDL	00:50:24,639	00:50:29,759	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Press the other bits and pieces of the puzzle maybe help Shadow it in you know a little bit for me
EDL	00:50:31,295	00:50:34,623	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And so I don't know what's meets its multi-layered cake
EDL	00:50:34,623	00:50:36,415	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I thought you really don't like
EDL	00:50:36,415	00:50:37,695	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	This idea
EDL	00:50:39,231	00:50:41,023	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Like in this science version
EDL	00:50:41,023	00:50:47,167	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	There is no design and there is no first cause except the first random event that sets the thing in motion
EDL	00:50:47,679	00:50:48,191	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Right
EDL	00:50:48,959	00:50:49,983	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You both
EDL	00:50:50,495	00:50:52,799	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Could you either of you live with that version of what
EDL	00:50:54,591	00:50:58,687	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Yeah well that's perfect cuz it's exactly what you're talk about in your show
EDL	00:50:58,687	00:50:59,199	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	With
EDL	00:51:01,759	00:51:07,903	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Nails referring to a thing in gem show where he talks about how unlikely any particular order of cards in a deck is
EDL	00:51:08,415	00:51:10,719	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And idea of a particular set of cards being
EDL	00:51:10,719	00:51:15,327	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Dealt in a particular way is 52 factorial
EDL	00:51:15,327	00:51:18,911	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	It is impossible to possible number you couldn't
EDL	00:51:18,911	00:51:20,191	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Statistically right right
EDL	00:51:20,959	00:51:23,519	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	But yet you deal the cards and they happen
EDL	00:51:23,519	00:51:24,031	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Right there so
EDL	00:51:25,055	00:51:28,383	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	This really gets into just the different viewpoints on
EDL	00:51:29,919	00:51:31,455	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The proverbial deck of cards
EDL	00:51:32,991	00:51:34,015	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Who is stealing them
EDL	00:51:34,527	00:51:36,831	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Is it in a particular fashion and I think that's
EDL	00:51:37,343	00:51:39,903	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And what Jim believes that there is a
EDL	00:51:39,903	00:51:40,927	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Proverbial dealer
EDL	00:51:41,951	00:51:42,463	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And I don't
EDL	00:51:47,071	00:51:48,095	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And you would be.
EDL	00:51:49,119	00:51:49,887	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Yah mean
EDL	00:51:50,399	00:51:51,935	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Haven't you given thought to that
EDL	00:51:52,959	00:51:53,727	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I believe
EDL	00:51:54,239	00:51:56,799	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Did that there was some sort of
EDL	00:51:57,567	00:51:59,615	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You know mind personality
EDL	00:52:00,383	00:52:06,015	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So I believe part is where you is where you stand but it is absolutely absolutely it is
EDL	00:52:07,039	00:52:08,063	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And you know
EDL	00:52:08,575	00:52:09,343	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Your
EDL	00:52:09,343	00:52:09,855	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Is
EDL	00:52:10,367	00:52:12,415	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Savior I guess who saved his life
EDL	00:52:13,695	00:52:14,719	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	But in some way
EDL	00:52:14,719	00:52:15,231	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You don't
EDL	00:52:15,999	00:52:17,023	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You haven't
EDL	00:52:18,047	00:52:19,839	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You worried about this at all
EDL	00:52:20,351	00:52:21,631	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Yeah absolutely
EDL	00:52:21,631	00:52:22,399	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Uneven
EDL	00:52:22,399	00:52:24,703	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Right now on this stage there's a part of me that
EDL	00:52:25,215	00:52:27,007	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	In front of all of you
EDL	00:52:27,007	00:52:29,567	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That I'm sure lot of here at the show last night
EDL	00:52:29,567	00:52:31,103	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	There's a part of me that is
EDL	00:52:32,895	00:52:34,943	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Afraid of disappointing
EDL	00:52:34,943	00:52:36,735	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That I don't share
EDL	00:52:37,247	00:52:38,783	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	What you believe to be true I mean
EDL	00:52:38,783	00:52:39,807	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Your entire
EDL	00:52:40,575	00:52:43,391	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Experience pretty much points the arrow
EDL	00:52:43,903	00:52:44,415	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That like
EDL	00:52:44,927	00:52:46,975	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I'm like an alliteration of Jesus
EDL	00:52:47,487	00:52:48,767	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And that's really difficult
EDL	00:52:48,767	00:52:50,047	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Reconcile
EDL	00:52:50,047	00:52:50,815	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Doesn't have faith
EDL	00:52:52,095	00:52:52,607	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	A sad song
EDL	00:52:53,375	00:52:54,143	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Cuz I think it's
EDL	00:52:54,143	00:52:56,703	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	It would be alot easier if I just believe
EDL	00:52:56,703	00:52:57,215	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Exactly what
EDL	00:52:57,983	00:52:58,751	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And I think
EDL	00:52:58,751	00:52:59,775	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That I
EDL	00:53:00,543	00:53:01,311	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Always
EDL	00:53:01,311	00:53:03,359	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I'm very afraid of letting that
EDL	00:53:03,871	00:53:04,895	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Be known like
EDL	00:53:04,895	00:53:05,407	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Super
EDL	00:53:05,919	00:53:09,247	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Like clammy right now just saying it in front of this many people
EDL	00:53:11,039	00:53:12,831	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I just feel like people would
EDL	00:53:12,831	00:53:13,343	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	See
EDL	00:53:13,855	00:53:15,903	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Your story and it's so
EDL	00:53:15,903	00:53:16,927	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Immensely
EDL	00:53:16,927	00:53:18,719	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Compelling it's unbelievable
EDL	00:53:19,487	00:53:20,511	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And then see that that
EDL	00:53:21,023	00:53:21,791	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Last piece
EDL	00:53:22,303	00:53:23,583	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Photo puzzle
EDL	00:53:24,607	00:53:25,887	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Literally doesn't fit
EDL	00:53:26,655	00:53:27,167	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	At all
EDL	00:53:27,679	00:53:29,215	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I mean it's not like I haven't
EDL	00:53:29,215	00:53:33,567	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I haven't thought about that either and how you might feel and
EDL	00:53:33,567	00:53:36,127	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I empathize and I don't know how to add
EDL	00:53:38,175	00:53:39,967	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I just I just want to give you a hug
EDL	00:53:40,991	00:53:44,575	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	There's a unconditionality to how I feel about you that
EDL	00:53:45,087	00:53:45,599	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I just
EDL	00:53:47,391	00:53:52,767	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	If you can do no wrong in my eyes for you the hardest thing I was just trying to
EDL	00:53:53,791	00:53:56,607	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You have been saved your life has been saved by her
EDL	00:53:57,887	00:53:59,679	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	She is in affect your savior
EDL	00:54:00,447	00:54:01,983	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And yet you are believe
EDL	00:54:01,983	00:54:03,519	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Is the unless she except
EDL	00:54:03,519	00:54:05,055	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Jesus the consumption
EDL	00:54:05,055	00:54:06,847	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	She's outside of Grace
EDL	00:54:07,359	00:54:10,175	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And you know I don't know I don't know what happened but
EDL	00:54:10,175	00:54:15,807	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	But she might be punished what do you do about this weird and she's insisting nope not for me
EDL	00:54:15,807	00:54:17,855	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	This is the way it is
EDL	00:54:18,879	00:54:19,903	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Oh my gosh
EDL	00:54:19,903	00:54:23,743	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	What is it hard for you no not at all
EDL	00:54:23,743	00:54:24,511	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Because
EDL	00:54:24,511	00:54:25,791	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	It's not my place to do that
EDL	00:54:27,327	00:54:29,887	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I'm very sorry to everyone who isn't
EDL	00:54:29,887	00:54:32,447	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Whoever feels like they got judged by Christian
EDL	00:54:32,959	00:54:35,263	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Cuz it's never their place to do that
EDL	00:54:35,263	00:54:36,543	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And this is where
EDL	00:54:36,543	00:54:39,103	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I think most of the time never listen this podcast is
EDL	00:54:39,103	00:54:39,871	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Place
EDL	00:54:39,871	00:54:41,663	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Positioned or pigeonholed Christian
EDL	00:54:42,687	00:54:43,199	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And
EDL	00:54:43,711	00:54:45,503	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	What they don't understand is that
EDL	00:54:46,271	00:54:47,551	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I'm not commanded
EDL	00:54:48,063	00:54:49,343	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	To do anything
EDL	00:54:49,343	00:54:50,111	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	But to love
EDL	00:54:50,879	00:54:52,159	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And to start conversations
EDL	00:54:53,695	00:54:57,023	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I'm not the one I'm not I'm not that I'm not the one who sent it
EDL	00:54:57,023	00:54:57,791	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Into the world
EDL	00:54:57,791	00:54:58,559	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The judge
EDL	00:54:58,559	00:54:59,327	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Right
EDL	00:54:59,327	00:55:00,351	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	But what I sow
EDL	00:55:01,119	00:55:01,887	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So
EDL	00:55:01,887	00:55:04,447	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Putting it like that I know where you are know where you want to go with
EDL	00:55:04,959	00:55:11,103	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Judge that may not love the woman who saved your life
EDL	00:55:12,639	00:55:13,407	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Yes but
EDL	00:55:13,919	00:55:15,455	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	But at the same time
EDL	00:55:18,527	00:55:19,295	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That's not what I'm
EDL	00:55:19,807	00:55:20,831	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The temperature in my place
EDL	00:55:21,343	00:55:22,367	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	How to say I think we were
EDL	00:55:22,879	00:55:25,695	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Sort of expecting that maybe there will be
EDL	00:55:26,463	00:55:28,767	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Sharper Edge the differences
EDL	00:55:28,767	00:55:30,559	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Between Jim and Janelle
EDL	00:55:30,559	00:55:31,583	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	But to be honest
EDL	00:55:31,583	00:55:33,631	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Their conversation that night and
EDL	00:55:33,631	00:55:35,679	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Story started to feel like
EDL	00:55:36,191	00:55:37,471	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Almost an allegory
EDL	00:55:38,751	00:55:40,543	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	How to move through the world and
EDL	00:55:40,543	00:55:42,847	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Hold your differences but still be one
EDL	00:55:43,359	00:55:47,455	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Let me just finish this way do you have a sense between the two of you
EDL	00:55:47,455	00:55:51,295	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I'm because obviously you if you stay very very good for
EDL	00:55:51,295	00:55:52,063	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Laptop
EDL	00:55:52,831	00:55:56,159	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Is there some something to eat either of you can say
EDL	00:55:57,183	00:55:59,231	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That explains why you can
EDL	00:56:00,255	00:56:05,375	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Dignifiedly but emphatically disagree and still stay in such extraordinary
EDL	00:56:06,399	00:56:06,911	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Close
EDL	00:56:07,679	00:56:08,191	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Touch
EDL	00:56:09,215	00:56:09,727	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I think
EDL	00:56:10,239	00:56:11,007	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The idea of
EDL	00:56:11,519	00:56:14,847	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Humility and as Gimli even say grace
EDL	00:56:15,615	00:56:16,127	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Is
EDL	00:56:17,663	00:56:20,735	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Absolutely essential no matter your tenants of belief
EDL	00:56:21,503	00:56:23,551	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And that's really what's going to get you
EDL	00:56:24,575	00:56:25,855	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Brutal conflict
EDL	00:56:26,367	00:56:26,879	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So
EDL	00:56:27,391	00:56:28,159	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Yeah
EDL	00:56:28,159	00:56:29,439	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Is it because you're in
EDL	00:56:29,439	00:56:32,255	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	They speak ocean of the world and the two of you were just little
EDL	00:56:32,767	00:56:34,815	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Little dots in it and so
EDL	00:56:34,815	00:56:39,423	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Whatever you think it's till you're in the big ocean and they watch you got there
EDL	00:56:39,423	00:56:40,703	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I think maybe yeah
EDL	00:56:42,239	00:56:43,007	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And
EDL	00:56:43,007	00:56:45,055	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Do you feel
EDL	00:56:47,103	00:56:48,383	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Do I feel small
EDL	00:56:49,919	00:56:50,687	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I feel tiny
EDL	00:56:51,455	00:56:52,735	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Humility
EDL	00:56:52,735	00:56:53,247	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Root word
EDL	00:56:54,015	00:56:55,039	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	It comes from
EDL	00:56:55,039	00:56:55,551	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The rudest
EDL	00:56:56,063	00:56:56,575	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Hummus
EDL	00:56:57,343	00:56:58,111	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Is dirt
EDL	00:57:00,159	00:57:01,951	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	So when you become humble you become
EDL	00:57:08,863	00:57:10,143	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Creates things but I won't go there
EDL	00:57:11,679	00:57:13,215	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	But you become dirt and
EDL	00:57:13,727	00:57:16,543	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I think I think where we get hung up
EDL	00:57:16,543	00:57:17,055	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Is
EDL	00:57:17,567	00:57:18,079	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That
EDL	00:57:19,359	00:57:20,127	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	We want to be right
EDL	00:57:21,919	00:57:23,199	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	It has been brought into the
EDL	00:57:23,199	00:57:24,223	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	This yet
EDL	00:57:24,223	00:57:24,735	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You want to be right
EDL	00:57:25,759	00:57:27,039	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	And right and wrong
EDL	00:57:27,807	00:57:28,831	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	AR
EDL	00:57:28,831	00:57:30,111	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	The words right and wrong
EDL	00:57:30,111	00:57:34,975	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Are are are dead I think in relationship or deadly words I think that saying I'm right you're wrong
EDL	00:57:35,743	00:57:38,815	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Is this is this is not good for relationships
EDL	00:57:39,327	00:57:42,143	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I think it's like that's fine that's fine
EDL	00:57:42,143	00:57:43,935	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	You're right or you're wrong to her
EDL	00:57:49,823	00:57:50,847	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I think so
EDL	00:57:52,383	00:57:56,735	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	I think we're done now. This we were done done that means that I'm going to let these
EDL	00:57:56,735	00:57:57,759	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Two people
EDL	00:57:57,759	00:57:58,527	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Who's the person
EDL	00:58:00,319	00:58:01,087	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Brought them together
EDL	00:58:05,951	00:58:07,743	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	At the end of the show we had the
EDL	00:58:07,743	00:58:13,119	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Bone marrow registry people there and encourage people sign up in quite a few did I think maybe
EDL	00:58:13,119	00:58:13,887	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	20 or so
EDL	00:58:14,911	00:58:15,423	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	But
EDL	00:58:16,191	00:58:22,591	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	That was pretty much nothing compared to what gym got at the end of his show
EDL	00:58:22,591	00:58:26,431	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	150 people signing up right now that account them
EDL	00:58:26,431	00:58:28,991	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Better producer Annie McEwen
EDL	00:58:29,503	00:58:32,063	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Is this bigger than no more
EDL	00:58:32,063	00:58:33,087	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Always like this
EDL	00:58:33,855	00:58:37,695	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	This is a little bigger than normal I think anytime but I'm actually in the shows
EDL	00:58:37,695	00:58:39,231	| radiolab_podcast17matchmadeinmarrow |	Love it better so I've Been Told
