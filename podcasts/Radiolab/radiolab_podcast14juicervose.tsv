EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:08,768	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	So they make the move and as soon as they arrive in washing
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:11,328	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	We start sort of noticing something
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:12,096	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	I miss
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:14,144	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Their youngest son Owen who
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:18,240	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	That point in a totally normal chatty almost three year-old hitting always
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:20,032	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Markers suddenly goes sideways
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:21,312	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Maybe the
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:24,896	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Very first thing that happened was he stopped sleeping
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:27,712	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	He stopped sleeping stopped eating
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:32,064	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	It was very fussy and it's got to be the move
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:34,624	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And then we start losing eye contact
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:37,184	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Then he starts losing motor skills
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:39,232	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	He can't hold his cup
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:44,096	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Slipping out of his hand his gate became very odd
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:45,632	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And he was sort of
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:48,704	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Look like a drunken sailor walking around the house
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:52,032	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And then he stopped speaking bit
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:52,544	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Pipette
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:59,456	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	I bet this is all compressed into a few months
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:00,736	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Could have banged his head
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:02,528	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Ingested something toxic
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:05,600	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	UniFirst you hit the regular pediatrician and he's gone
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:06,624	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Descendants 2 Center
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:08,416	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	It was a woman there
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:11,232	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Who sits them down and she says the word autism
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:14,560	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	The word of the word mean to you at that moment
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:18,400	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	It meant rain man just I mean I'm a very good driver
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:19,936	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	We saw
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:21,728	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Thyroid that cannot be art
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:22,496	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	That cannot
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:24,288	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Our son
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:29,408	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Yeah it was just terrifying
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:35,040	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Now in reporting the story we ended up going off in a variety of different directions but we did visit one place
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:36,320	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	We got a glimpse
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:39,648	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Just a hint
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:42,208	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	What parents like rotten Cornelia must have felt
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:48,608	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	We visited the school here in Manhattan called the Rebecca school it's a
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:49,632	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Really unique
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:51,680	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	School for children with autism other
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:57,824	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Developmental delay there's little kids in their age for all the way up to 21 every kid
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:59,616	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Did you meet in the school is differ
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:01,408	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Autism is a mini mini flavored
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:05,248	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	But the overwhelming sense you get Walking The Halls there is
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:06,784	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	But each of these
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:07,808	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Kids is
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:08,320	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	China
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:12,416	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Locked away live
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:15,488	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Just that they don't know how to be with
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:19,839	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Like Kelsey pageant I we got there during lunch
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:25,215	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Hey one of the rooms I don't know who you should describe that we went to this one classroom
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:32,127	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	This one boy who really stood out he's about six years old and he had this big mop of black hair
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:36,735	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Care and he was just standing there at the table holding
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:38,527	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Snapple
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:39,807	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Apple
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:41,087	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Do you want to eat
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:41,599	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And just
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:48,767	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Hobby
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:59,519	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And the director of the school team court she was there and she just stayed with the boy and really like try to be there
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:00,287	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Are with him but
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:02,079	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	There was nothing she could do
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:11,807	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	San Jose Apple
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:14,879	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	It was
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:16,927	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Hard to watch
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:19,231	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Because
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:21,535	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	You don't know how to
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:25,887	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Help him
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:28,191	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	So that's the challenge
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:34,591	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	There's a kid who'd actually can't tell you what's upsetting to write that's Gil Tippy the school
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,359	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Is clinical
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:41,759	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Could be that he physically he actually doesn't know where he is in space maybe it's as if we were being
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:48,159	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Thrown out of an airplane but you just tumbling you don't know where your body is it's a thunderstorm
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:54,303	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	So you only see things in flashes right so now the world is totally frightening totally out
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:06:00,191	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	I mean I do remember the drive home
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:03,519	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	From that on that terrible day
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:06,335	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	We'll just I mean I just remember
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:09,407	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	You know you and I driving home in Silence with Owen in the back
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:10,943	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:12,223	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	I just felt like
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:13,503	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Do you know
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:14,783	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	There was no
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:15,807	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	There's no hope
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:20,159	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Like they had no idea if the Owen they knew was in there
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:22,207	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Or if he was just
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:23,487	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Kind of lost it
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:24,767	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Gone
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:32,703	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	But keep in mind this is 1994 we knew even less about autism than we know now we still have no idea what causes.
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:33,727	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	But then
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:38,335	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	The prevailing wisdom seemed to be the kids with autism they couldn't feel emotion
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:42,943	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And no capacity to empathize with other people this is way before the neurodiversity movie
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:47,039	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Actually right around the moment when autism was becoming a spectre
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:47,807	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	For the first time
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:48,831	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	That's happening and they
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:50,111	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Forward to starting
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:53,439	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Barely started the point Owen was
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,207	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Before
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:57,279	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Was he active or was he is very he was hyperactive
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:07:03,679	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	A lot of self stimulatory Behavior you know hand-flapping running around and Cornelia
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:04,703	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	When they would call him
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:06,495	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	It was as if he didn't even hear the
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:07,775	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	We're hoping he's hearing
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:14,175	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	You know it but he's not really responding to you needed them to come to the table or basically have to go
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:17,247	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Oh and leading by the hand or pick him up and bring him over
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:19,039	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:21,855	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	He was down to one word which was juice
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:27,999	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	So the only thing he was doing was drinking juice for about a year and also you know there was the Disney movies
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:35,423	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	But he would sit for he would sit for in for television entertainment
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:38,495	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	He wouldn't sit for the whole movie for sure but he would
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:40,799	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	That would be the one thing that he would sit
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:42,079	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	For quietly
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:43,359	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Her.
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:43,871	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	You don't know
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:47,199	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Because he didn't sleep so at night
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:48,991	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	I was usually up with him
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:51,039	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	All night thrashing around

EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:19,231	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And I see Owen on the bed
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:21,535	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Looking at a Disney book
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:23,327	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And I see on the carpet

EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:25,631	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:28,191	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	In one of them is Yago
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:29,471	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	From
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:30,751	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	From Aladdin

EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:41,759	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And I crawl along in the rug
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:44,831	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And I throw the bedspread kind of over my head
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:50,975	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Edge up to the edge of the bed and I push the puppet up through the crease in the bedspread
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:53,023	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And so now they're face-to-face
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:55,071	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Bowen and yoga
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:57,375	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And I'm looking up to the crease

EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:00,447	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And I
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:01,983	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Talk to him as Yahoo

EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:15,039	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And he turns
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:15,807	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	To the puppet
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:18,623	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Like he's a bumping into an old friend
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:22,719	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And he says Nah Nah.

EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:41,055	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	You know we start we called the basement sessions where we
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:46,943	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Say let's see how far this can go couple times a week we go down in the basement and start playing at scenes

EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:38,655	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	You're saying that when when everybody was acting out the Disney movies
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:39,423	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Only you could

EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:28,479	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	So did something
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:34,879	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	It just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:38,207	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:45,119	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:51,519	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework we're interested in the

EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:30,175	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Hey I'm Jared album run Robert krulwich Radiolab in today's story about a kid named Owen and a condition that no
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:31,199	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	No one can quite pin down
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:32,479	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Now we just heard
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:34,015	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	That Owen
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:35,807	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	When he watches
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:38,623	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Disney movies he feels comforted and that somehow
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:40,671	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	The movie seems to dial down his Auto
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:43,487	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Really why would that be
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:46,815	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	How can a Disney movie
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:50,143	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Make that much difference
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:56,543	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	I'm can you hear me okay I can read pretty well we ended up taking the question to this guy
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:58,591	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	He's a leading researcher in autism
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:02,175	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And yes he is the cousin of this guy is my wife
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:09,087	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And I'm the director of the autism research Centre at Cambridge University
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:11,647	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	A couple of different thing first of all
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:17,791	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	He says that in the last few decades are whole notion of what is happening in the mind of a child with autism has totally
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:25,215	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	We sort of tossed out the Rainman idea the idea that people with Autism lack
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:26,751	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Some in our life
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:28,799	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	I think that's completely false
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:34,687	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	It's not necessarily the can't feel emotion or empathy and says not at all it's often a decoding prop
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:40,063	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Like they have trouble decoding all of the information is coming in I mean some Studies have found it
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:41,343	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	A lot of kids with autism
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:43,647	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Literally have too many synapses
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:45,183	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And their brain so it might be
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:47,487	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	The world is just coming into loud
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:53,631	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	I think often people with Autism you feel I have very lost and confused
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:58,751	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Desaster little predictability in the social world
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:05,151	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And if people come and go they got no two days are the same people say things unexpected
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:11,551	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Levi do things unexpectedly I'm people with oil system seem to need
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:12,575	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Weather predictability
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:16,416	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	We spoke to Temple Grandin the well-known author and
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:17,440	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Autism advocate
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:18,464	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Here's how she play
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:24,864	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Got a little kid I want to feel the nice feeling being held but there was just too much overwhelming stimulation
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:27,424	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	No loud sounds hurt my ears
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:31,008	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Like the volume control on touch and hearing
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:32,544	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Was Wei Wei Wei
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:37,664	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Return. And one of the reasons why I withdrew into things like dribbling sand to my hands
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:39,968	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Is a cushion shot out
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:41,760	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	The hurtful sound
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:47,648	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	As a Temple Grandin explain it to us a kid with autism gravitating to something like bus schedules or
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:52,256	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Knowing every single a fact about every dinosaur that ever lived that is just a way
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:53,792	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Slow things down
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:55,072	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And make the world predictable
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:57,888	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Happens the same way every time it is
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:22:00,704	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Simon baron-cohen puts it in Owens case
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:07,104	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	He had these Disney movie that you can play over and over and over and over the fact that it
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:12,480	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Are insides not just repetition but it's repetition about human action
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:14,272	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Where are you out in the Menagerie
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:21,696	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And that creates a kind of structure to be able to look at human behavior and in the real way
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:25,024	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	World has no opportunity to rewind the movie
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:32,704	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Where is in the world of movies you can watch the same Disney cartoon a hundred times Arthur
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:39,104	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Thousand times when you could pull my sky frame by frame like a literary critic
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:45,504	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Horror film critic you can really analyze the action to understand okay that's what happened.
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:47,296	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	What caused him to do what he did
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:49,344	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Add to that
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:55,744	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	The element of Music we spoke with a
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:23:02,144	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Geraldine Dawson Neuroscience Professor Duke guess that maybe it's not just the repetition that made the difference but the repetition
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:08,544	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	With music one of the things that we've learned from Neuroscience is that music
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:09,568	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Nick activate
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:12,640	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Emotional centers in our brain and in fact
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:17,248	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	It's pretty reliable that certain kinds of music make us feel
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:21,088	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Frightens make us feel
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:28,512	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Happy make us feel worried and so forth
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:31,072	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	It's a done brain scans of kids with autism
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:32,096	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	They found
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:38,496	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	That during kind of normal interactions people with Autism don't necessarily activate those emotional
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:44,640	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Centers of the brain areas like the amygdala but during the experience of music
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:50,784	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	The those areas of the brain did become activated in a way that was
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:53,856	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Very much like a typical person
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:58,976	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	So it might be that while Owen was sorta forensically examining these moments of Disney movies
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:00,768	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Who's the Disney music
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:03,072	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	That was binding those moments
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:04,352	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Feelings
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:09,216	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	So you know like when a person looks like that that's when they're happy when a person looks like that
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:11,008	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	That's when they're sad

EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:05,120	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Really hard
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:08,448	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	You're not trying hard enough it's depressing
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:12,032	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	You're a new bumper sticker other than showing up
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:18,944	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	The autism is awesome and awesome spell like a you some like can't like
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:19,456	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Saint Laurent
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:22,016	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	I know you want to
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:23,296	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	It destroys lives
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:26,112	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Is is what it does in our definition of it
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:28,416	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And that's one of the things that makes it
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:31,744	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Very very confusing for people outside the community to do
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:32,768	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Describe what's going on
EDL	00:32:33,792	00:32:34,816	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	You know how this
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:36,864	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Situation were obviously autism suspect
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:39,936	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Do you have all of these different kids
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:41,472	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Describe
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:42,496	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	By the same word
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:47,616	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Making things even more confusing to take a child when they're too or
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:51,968	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Free butts Temple Grandin again to kids that look real severe
EDL	00:32:51,968	00:32:53,760	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And I look real severe when I was
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:54,528	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	When I was three
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:56,064	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Real real severe
EDL	00:32:56,832	00:33:00,416	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And then you work on these kids lots of one-on-one therapy
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:02,720	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And one kid two kind of pull him out of it
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:05,280	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And the other one you're not able to pull them out of it
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:07,072	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And they both look the same at Age 3
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:09,376	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	So if a lot of these kids
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:12,960	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Start out with the same set of symptoms they end up in vastly different place
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:14,240	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	No one knows why

EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:27,552	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Notions of
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:33,952	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	What could be up the road or what should be now if they pop into my head which is rare eye
EDL	00:33:33,952	00:33:34,720	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	I dismiss them
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:37,280	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	I have absolutely no idea
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:40,608	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Because we have been down so many roads
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:44,192	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	That were disappointing

EDL	00:34:52,800	00:34:57,664	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	We didn't know what was happening you know we just saw over the months at Owen was
EDL	00:34:58,176	00:34:59,712	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Really out of sorts
EDL	00:34:59,712	00:35:03,296	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	You got quiet and withdrawn basically stop doing Disney
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:09,696	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Over this. He's losing a lot of weight is not sleeping the three of us were scratching our head saying what is going on with
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:13,536	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Oh and he is really moving into a bad place I mean I was
EDL	00:35:14,048	00:35:20,448	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Actually worried that it was becoming schizophrenic
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:23,008	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Do something is wrong with them and we couldn't get it out of him
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:26,592	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	This is Owens older brother Walt again and he says when he pick up Owen
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:30,176	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	School you're shoving self you talk to him so I pick him up
EDL	00:35:30,688	00:35:32,736	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	You talked himself in the car and it be no floater
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:39,648	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	You know it's not true or something under his breath and then at one point I overhear him
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:41,952	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	In a kind of conversation
EDL	00:35:42,464	00:35:48,864	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	With still the sidekick of Hercules in that movie Hercules Danny DeVito does The Voice
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:51,680	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And Phyllis can always listen kid
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:54,752	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	You can take them you're not you're not to stand up for yourself that kind of
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:57,056	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Thing that Ellen was saying and I didn't
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:36:02,432	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	I didn't know where to fit it in wrong. It seems like only was trying to psych himself up for something
EDL	00:36:03,200	00:36:06,272	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Switch on the couch and a grilled them for an hour
EDL	00:36:06,272	00:36:09,600	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Until eventually I won told him about his music class
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:15,232	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	It's cool there two kids in this class who red kids emotionally disturbed kids so they're not
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:19,584	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	They're not on the autistic spectrum and socially there very
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:21,376	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	On Target
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:22,400	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And they
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:24,704	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Basically
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:28,288	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Torment and terrorize him for
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:29,056	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	6 months
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:31,360	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Of that school year unbeknownst to us
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:33,664	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And unbeknownst to the school
EDL	00:36:34,176	00:36:35,968	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	What did they do
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:40,320	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	They sat on either side of him and basically said you know
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:42,880	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	We're going to kill you we're going to kill your parents
EDL	00:36:42,880	00:36:44,672	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Two bullies
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:46,208	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Leiden
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:48,512	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Bullying me badly
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:54,656	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	I mean right then you were in a very bad spot and couldn't tell me your mom or anyone
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:56,960	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	All right because what happened the police said what
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:36:59,776	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Burn your house down if what
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:01,312	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	If you tell
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:06,432	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And Owen was so literal as are so many autistic kids
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:12,832	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	She believed that they literally meant they were going to come and burn his house down but there's an extraordinary MoMA
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:15,904	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Pain in the middle of this where Walter picks him up
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:22,304	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And Owen starts to think go through a calculus the bully said if you tell your parents
EDL	00:37:22,304	00:37:26,144	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	About what we said will bring your house down but they said nothing about your brother
EDL	00:37:29,216	00:37:32,032	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And so is he seems like an opening
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:33,056	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	So did you tell him
EDL	00:37:33,568	00:37:34,848	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	No I didn't
EDL	00:37:34,848	00:37:36,384	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	No I didn't I
EDL	00:37:36,384	00:37:37,152	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Why not
EDL	00:37:37,152	00:37:39,712	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Does I'm afraid he would beat the mop
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:42,016	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	I didn't want that
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:45,088	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Walt at this point you know is a football player and
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:49,184	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	You know what he looks like Hercules to Owen and
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:52,256	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Oh and later describes to us this thinking
EDL	00:37:52,768	00:37:55,072	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	That if he tells Walter
EDL	00:37:55,072	00:37:57,888	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	That Walter will
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:37:58,656	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Hurt the kid
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:01,216	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And maybe kill the kid
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:08,128	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And in Disney none of the heroes actually kill any of the villains
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:08,896	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	No
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:12,992	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Walter was the hero you were afraid he was going to do what
EDL	00:38:12,992	00:38:15,552	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Kill but it's wrong
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:20,160	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Did you ever talk to Walt about it a little bit later after it happened
EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:21,440	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	I just never finding out
EDL	00:38:22,976	00:38:24,256	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Like a combination of like
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:26,304	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Rage and helplessness
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:28,352	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	That
EDL	00:38:32,192	00:38:33,984	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	I literally just thought
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:35,776	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Of what
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:38,336	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	I would have gone to that kid
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:42,688	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	If I wanted told me
EDL	00:38:42,688	00:38:44,480	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	I really wanted to kill that kid
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:45,760	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	I mean
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:48,576	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Ditto
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:51,392	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	I'm his protector
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:39:00,096	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	In a way you're you are kind of Walter was worried about protecting you in that time
EDL	00:39:00,096	00:39:01,888	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	In a way it was
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:03,168	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Me
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:04,704	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	That was doing what
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:06,496	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	Protecting myself
EDL	00:39:06,496	00:39:10,592	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	And who else and my brother Ryan and Walt and Walt
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:13,408	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	You're protecting Walter
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:19,552	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	So here you have this moment we're at look like Owen was sliding backwards but according to Ron
EDL	00:39:19,552	00:39:21,856	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	It might have actually been his greatest Leap Forward
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:29,024	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	His most profound moment of empathy these days when is 23 just turned 23
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:34,144	| radiolab_podcast14juicervose |	A few months ago and are you in love right now yes I am with the girl made dreams Emily
