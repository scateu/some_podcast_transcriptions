EDL	00:00:44,544	00:00:47,360	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I don't know this is like no last November something
EDL	00:00:47,360	00:00:48,128	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Comes over
EDL	00:00:48,640	00:00:53,248	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Sitting on the giant I've big floor pillow like a Turkish floor pillow

EDL	00:00:54,784	00:00:56,064	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Sitting on the floor pillow
EDL	00:00:56,576	00:00:57,600	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And then she is like
EDL	00:00:58,112	00:00:59,648	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Already hear the story
EDL	00:00:59,648	00:01:02,976	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And I said yeah and she's like okay need you take the battery out of your phone
EDL	00:01:03,744	00:01:08,096	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Really yeah and I actually said that
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:10,144	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I can't take the battery out of it and she goes
EDL	00:01:11,168	00:01:15,776	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Okay I need you to power down and put it in another room under a pillow
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:16,544	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	What
EDL	00:01:16,544	00:01:22,944	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I was like what is going on in shoe and then if I disappoint she's taking the battery out of her phone so I
EDL	00:01:22,944	00:01:28,064	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I do it I put it in the in my bedroom and I put it under pillows I
EDL	00:01:28,064	00:01:30,368	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Turned it off I came back and sat down
EDL	00:01:30,880	00:01:34,464	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And then she starts telling me essentially about the ceremony
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:39,328	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	About going to the launch of this new
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:41,632	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Currency
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:48,032	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Which involved her flying across the country to live in a hotel room for a number of days
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:54,432	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	A bunch of strangers and then something happened because she came back seemingly paranoid
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:02:00,832	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	At least she was hiding phones under pillows
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:06,464	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	It takes a few steps to start with step one which is
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:09,024	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Which is Morgan
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:09,792	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I Morgen pek
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:11,840	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	How would you identify yourself
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:12,864	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Professionally
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:15,424	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Professionally I'm a freelance journalist
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:17,984	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And my eyes Morgan has become like
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:23,872	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	The historian of the world of digital money I started reading about neuroscience
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:27,200	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I quickly found out about Bitcoin about a year into my writing
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:31,040	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	2011 and has pretty much been running ever since
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:37,952	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Now yes a lot of people when they hear about digital money they think
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:43,072	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	650 Euros paid in Bitcoin currency
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:46,144	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Obviously it has become associated with cybercrime
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:48,960	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Stephen Morgan
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:53,312	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	What attracted her to this whole world of meter go my God this thing is amazing
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:59,712	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	She's like pulled in by the idealism of it there was an extremely active community of people who were talking
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:00,480	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	About
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:01,504	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	You know
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:05,856	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Completely subverting the financial system at a time
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:08,160	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	When the financial system was
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:11,744	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Not trusted and was clapping
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:14,816	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Because Morgan says the birth of Bitcoin goes back to
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,096	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Well
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:22,496	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Never 2008 boom was the big
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:28,896	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Implosion in September the stock market crashed the banks bailed
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:35,040	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Bears are standing there watching in amazement I don't blame him I'm believable
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:38,112	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	This shakes your trust in American institutions
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:45,792	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And then just a few months later 2009 January the Hot Topic
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:48,096	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Digital money
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:54,496	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Call Nick Quinn showed up after the big collapse
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:57,312	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	It was after and it was very much response to that definitely
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:04:00,640	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Cuz he was as currency that was decentralized
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:07,552	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Which means it's Ron and monitored by all the people who use it which means you don't need a federal
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:11,904	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Is there a Uso at the beginning a lot of people sell Bitcoin is a way to sort of
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:18,303	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Take the power back from The Big Bang so I had just everybody over Libertarians were really into it they thought that
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:19,327	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	It was going to
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:24,447	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Rash that it was going to crumble The Columns of
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:26,751	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Every Power structure in you know
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:31,103	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	The world obviously that didn't happen it did not take down the worlds
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:35,455	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	But Bitcoin is not going away it's been a decade it still around
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:38,271	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	But if you talk to people on the inside
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:42,367	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Will tell you one of the things that has dog Bitcoin from the beginning
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:43,903	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Is this issue of privacy
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:45,695	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	The weight of the
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:47,743	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Technology works
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:48,511	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Is that
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:51,839	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	It tracks every single transaction
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:52,863	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Does ever
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:53,887	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Maid on the network
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:56,703	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Anytime anyone with a Bitcoin buys
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:57,727	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Coffee
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:59,263	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Start pound of heroin
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:01,055	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	That transaction is capital
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:07,711	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	In something called the public Ledger Bitcoin is a ledger public Ledger
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:10,015	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	It's out there for anyone to see
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:16,927	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Really every single transaction has ever been done
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:17,695	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Private at all
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:24,863	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	But people thought it was Private beginning because over using these pseudonyms another words in The Ledger you never see anyone's actual
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:27,423	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	There no names on in the car
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:31,007	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Like I wouldn't be my only had bt9 572 problem is it
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:32,287	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Well
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:34,591	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	There are no names attached
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:37,151	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	The behavior is out there
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:38,431	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	For anyone to see
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:39,199	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Turns out
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:41,759	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	It's really not that hard to match
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:43,551	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Dislike string of characters
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:46,879	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	With the person that it represents out in the real world
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:52,511	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	You could just kind of Google it on the internet see if it pops up anywhere else what is associated with
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:55,071	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And then you got to figure out who the person is
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:06:01,471	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And then you can go back into the Bitcoin Ledger and search their entire history can figure out all their big
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:06,847	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Business dealings all their personal dealings who they know who they don't know possibly who their bank is
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:09,407	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And you know people have tried to solve this problem with big
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:11,711	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	But companies now
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:17,855	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And actually specialize in doing a network analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain and they do it for companies who want to
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:24,255	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Make sure that they're not transacting with you know criminals people who have had
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:25,791	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Delete trying to D Anonymous people
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:27,839	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Wow
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:32,959	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And so one of the puzzles that
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:34,751	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	All the internet people think about
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:36,287	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Is
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:42,175	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Is there a way to get the best of both worlds can you have the decentralization that comes with
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:43,711	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Digital money
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:45,503	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	But can you also get privacy
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:52,415	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Almost like cash a dollar bill out of my pocket I walk down the street I give it to someone they give to some
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:54,463	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Can trace that money
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:07:00,863	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Can you get the decentralization that comes with digital money and can you wrap that up with
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:07,263	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	The Privacy that you get with paper money not question
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:07,775	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Testing testing
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:13,663	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Brings up to this guy zooko Wilcox
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:15,455	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Zuko and I'm in a different room
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:19,039	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	He is our master of
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:21,599	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	The ceremony I have to say you do
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:26,207	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Everyone's like pretty excited on talking to a guy named Zuko like
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:27,999	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	It's just a good name Zuko
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:32,607	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Zuko
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:39,007	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Zuko is digital currencies for extremely dry
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:45,407	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Is a charismatic leader type of thing
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:51,807	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Yes but I was concerned about the Privacy applications because he's a pretty hardcore
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:58,207	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	It's like worlds upon worlds are opening for a cypherpunks
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:08:00,511	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	People that care deeply about
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:06,143	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	How to make the internet more private human right and that it's
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:08,959	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Necessary condition
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:11,775	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	For the exercise of a free choice
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:15,871	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Morality and of political participation
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:20,223	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And of everything that's of intimacy everything that's most important as humans
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:24,831	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So this whole thing with Bitcoin in the Privacy problem
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:27,647	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Right up his alley
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:30,719	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So I went out of my way to study the Bitcoin source code and
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:32,511	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Contributed some
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:33,791	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Suggestions and
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:35,583	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Yes I immediately started
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:37,887	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Fantasizing about what could be better
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:38,911	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So then he
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:41,727	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Being like the Privacy security cypherpunk
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:46,847	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Gorilla becomes the leader of something called zika
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:48,383	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	NZ cash
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:50,943	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Really it's mean
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:53,247	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Contribution to this ecosystem is privacy
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:55,295	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So there's this thing called zero knowledge proof
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:58,111	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Okay and it's a mathematical invention that
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:09:04,511	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Mathematicians who come up with it requires something called the Z snark parameters to be baked in
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,279	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Into the protocol
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:06,559	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I asked
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:08,607	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Hours of questions
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:11,423	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And it got me into conversation about circles and graphs
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:17,567	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Send the shape of numbers is the shape of what's a possibility of
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:19,359	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Was that
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:23,455	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	It allows you to prove that something is true
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:28,063	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Without revealing anything about the thing you're trying to prove is true
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:29,599	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Well you just
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:36,511	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Take van to run Computer Science and Mathematics start
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:38,303	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Overlapping to Wizardry here
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:43,423	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	All you need to know is it's zcash promises to give you decentralisation with the psych
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:45,215	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Buffet at 5
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:45,727	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Messi
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:56,479	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Zcash has its own flocked unfortunate vulnerability in the math
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:10:02,111	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	In order to create the currency of zcash you have to first create a number certain
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:06,207	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Enormous number and then you use that number to do a
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:10,815	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Bunch of math and then like boom
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:12,863	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	You have the currency
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:15,935	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	But it all starts
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:18,751	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	With this number this key
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:19,775	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Problem with that
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:24,383	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	In this system
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:26,175	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	In this system
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:32,575	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	If somebody got a hold of the private key they could counterfeit C CashPoints
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:36,671	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	They could counterfeit money just making it
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:43,071	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Millions and millions and millions of newpointe that's a really big problem
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:47,679	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	You have a Anonymous currency cuz no one would ever know
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:54,079	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Bitcoin and it's a public Ledger you can actually see if there's any funny business going on that
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:59,967	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Actually why they keep it open right the lack of privacy and Bitcoin is a security measure but you're no one would ever know
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:04,831	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So the challenges how do you get people to buy into a system that has this like
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:06,623	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Major vulnerability
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:11,999	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I'll be at just right at the very beginning there's this one moment where
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:13,791	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	You know you have to trust people
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:14,559	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	In a way that's
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:16,095	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Completely
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:18,655	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Existentially defining of the currency
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:20,959	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So this is what zukas up again
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:23,263	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	How do I
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:26,079	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	If I want super privacy what she does
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:27,615	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	How do I
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:30,687	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Generate this number in such a way
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:31,967	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	That
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:35,551	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	No one steals it not me not anyone else and how do I
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:41,183	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	To all of the people that might want to use zcash later than in the
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:42,719	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Tiny little window of
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:46,303	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Of creation nothing untoward has happened.
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:48,863	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	That the number is never been tampered with it
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:55,263	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Human eyes have never been laid upon if you know that the entire creation of the system remains
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:56,031	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Pure
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:58,591	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Is it this is very much like an Immaculate Conception
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:11:59,103	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	You're like
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:06,015	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	No humans can have sex to make this baby but I need to be a baby
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:10,623	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Examine the act of sex to make sure that there is no physical contact
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:14,463	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Is it like that that's so good okay so here we are
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:19,071	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Zuko designs
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:20,351	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Will have
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:21,375	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Ceremony
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:28,031	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Most secure most sophisticated cryptographic ceremony that's ever been performed
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:30,335	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Okay
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:36,735	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Here's the thing while it's trivial to make your own currency
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:41,343	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	It is not trivial to inspire
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:47,487	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	That's what money is is the agreement between people to use it
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:48,511	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And honor that
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:54,655	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Yourself a contract and the creation of value to me that's like Alchemy
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:13:02,079	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And at the moment of creation walking down the street
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:04,639	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Near you Mali Greenpoint
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:08,223	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And I get a text message on Signal
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:10,783	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	A private messenger app from Zuko that's like
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:13,599	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Pay we want you to be want you to
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:14,879	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Be there
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:18,463	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Since you're so excited
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:24,863	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Is chosen did you even know what you were being invited to now I had no I
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:28,191	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	No idea but I was like I have to do this I mean
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:29,215	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I cannot miss this
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:34,079	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Even if zcash doesn't make it even if you know it collapses
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:37,151	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	It seems like a historical
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:38,175	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Moments
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:40,735	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Suzuka basically said just
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:43,807	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Wait for our back call
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:45,343	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So about two weeks later
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:49,695	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	The back call come to the coffee store in Boulder
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:54,559	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Soap Morgan gets on a flight to Denver Rent-A-Car to Boulder and go to the coffee shop goes there
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:57,631	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Standing next to the Barista counter and actually
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:59,167	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	He has a huge
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:13:59,935	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Paper map
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:00,703	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	With him
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:04,799	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Spread all over like the Baristas area he's like up in their Grill
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:11,455	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And this other guy not showed up who was going to film it up
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:14,271	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Was that was that for you you wanted everything recorded
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:15,295	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And it was
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:18,623	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	To serve as a security mechanism
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:20,927	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And documentation for the public
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:21,695	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	More on that in a sec
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:22,975	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And then
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:24,255	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Okay
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:30,655	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Okay they leave the coffee shop go over to Matt's van he makes us both up I told him they can make me up
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:32,959	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Then we're going to turn off all of our cell phones
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:35,263	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So that if there were any hackers
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:37,055	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	They would be able to track
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:38,335	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Where we work physically
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:40,383	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I'm trying to think if I have to say goodbye to anyone
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:45,759	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	We're like okay now we got the van we got our cell phones turned off
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:49,855	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	The next thing we need to do where we're going to the
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:52,415	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Computer store acquire a computer
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:55,487	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Because like if there was some hacker who is planning to steal the
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:15:02,911	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	They could have already planted some malware or tracking device on zukas personal laptop
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:03,935	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Before we even started
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:11,359	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So we all piled into the van to get a clean computer
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:17,759	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	He's decided to go to Denver for this but he doesn't want to use this phone
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:24,159	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Because what if somebody is like cracking what he's looking at that is due
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:30,559	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	During much of his recording while he's driving do you have like a black hoodie over you like his
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:35,167	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Bella style so they're driving for a little bit
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:41,567	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	All of a sudden they make this Pit Stop we were like
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:47,967	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Hey there's a costume store in imperfect.
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:49,759	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Wizard hat wizard hat
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:51,295	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Can I see your wizard hat section
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:55,903	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So they walk through this big costume store pass
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:16:01,279	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Witches hats Tiaras what is the wizard that you settled on
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:03,327	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	It was a Gandalf hat Gandalf hat
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:09,471	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Play I love the Gandalf hat that is appropriate the greatest wizard of all
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:16,383	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And then back to the mission at hand stands Denver computer
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:20,223	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	We drove down using our paper map with our cell phones off to the computer store
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:26,623	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	They get their walk in a little computer shopping
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:30,975	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Different ones
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:35,839	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	The computer is sacred i7 6700
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:39,679	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Which henceforth is given a new name called the compute node
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:40,959	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And why is it sacred
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:42,495	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Well because this
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:48,895	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Is the computer that will hold the secret number the number that will give birth to an entirely new
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:55,295	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Currency so
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:17:01,695	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And drove to an area that has hotels that we knew of
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:08,095	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Hotels near going around to like the hotels in Boulder
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:14,495	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Or they don't have an ethernet connection
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:20,639	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	He wasn't clear on the notion of ethernet
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:25,759	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	If you don't know what you're going to do
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:28,319	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	They don't know what they're going to do
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:34,463	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I see this is actually your security measure I guess you're totally in the dark about what you're doing
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:38,303	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Then some hackers they can't they can't mount an attack
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:41,375	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	It's foolproof but
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:47,775	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Eventually has rooms and hotel
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:52,383	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Zuko actually Hazmat book the hotel room for two nights
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:54,175	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Do you have a key
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:56,735	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	We all check into one room from floor
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:58,783	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	It's not particularly
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:01,855	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Fancy you got your two beds
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:03,391	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Then they set up
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:10,303	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	We're well organized machine
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:13,631	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Bad to chill out on concentrate on
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:19,263	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Uncareful observing what we did was we stripped the room of all of the
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:23,871	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Lamps and the telephone everything on all counters gets
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:27,199	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Shop somewhere over that stuff bearded way into the closet
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:33,599	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Or the bathtub in addition we didn't want like the television
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:37,695	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	For example which could be remotely controlled by an adversary
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:44,095	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Television
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:50,495	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Grab that table where they're going to set up the compute node explain again while you're keeping it away from the wall
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:56,895	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	There's a teeny tiny chance that a team of spies rented the room next door and set up a giant antenna
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:19:01,503	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	The other side of this wall this is like the dopest attacks atsuko is planning against
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:07,903	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Called side-channel attacks by which you could use an antenna
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:14,303	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Phone to figure out what a computer is doing for example with some crazy microphone you can listen into the computer
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:15,583	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Desert if you heard something like
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:20,447	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Oh that's a Diffie Hellman key exchange
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:20,959	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Or
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:27,871	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Oh yeah this is obviously figured out the full 4096 bit RSA decryption key
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:29,407	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Or
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:32,479	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Hey that's a new babies video
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:36,063	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Or whatever so please don't
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:39,135	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Put anything on this desk from here on out
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:41,183	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Just pulled away from the wall about
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:42,719	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	5 ft
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:44,511	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Just in case there's somebody set up
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:48,351	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Next door and then started loading and all the
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:50,911	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Cameras and Equipment battery pack
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:57,311	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Junk food but then there was also a whole security camera setup
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:19:58,591	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	They don't have a radio
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:04,735	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	For security cameras which word from the 80s before security cameras came with Wi-Fi
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:05,503	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Which means
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:07,039	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	We had to buy antique
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:10,879	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Security cameras in their night vision security cameras
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:12,159	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And they said those up
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:15,999	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So that we could see the other cameras from the first camera so you could sell that new
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:20,351	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Did just snuck in there in like tampered with one of the cameras during the process either
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:24,703	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And this security camera setup with one of the key points in trying to
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:25,215	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Create
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:27,519	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	When Morgan was talking about earlier
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:29,055	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	The Alchemy
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:30,079	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Faith Trust
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:30,847	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Whatever
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:34,175	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So the security mechanism this was this was going to
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:35,711	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Catch any
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:36,735	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Shenanigans
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:41,343	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Inuzuka was going to post the security footage to the Internet so
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:42,623	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Security Experts
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:45,183	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Scan it and make up their minds could the ceremony be
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:45,695	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Trusted
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:47,999	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Hold on where are you going to sleep tonight
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:52,095	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	We could all cannabis sleep anywhere
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:54,143	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So we said all that stuff up
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:56,959	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	It's like 9 now at 10 it was late
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:58,751	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:03,103	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I took the computer that we used so-called compute node
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:06,687	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And it from that moment forward I kept that thing
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:09,503	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Like within Arm's Reach
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:11,807	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	48 hours or so oh my God it was
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:16,928	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	A little bit exhausting trying to be paranoid and it was exhausting trying to be paranoid
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:18,720	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Yeah like I slept with it at night
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:20,000	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	My bed
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:21,536	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	UTEP my
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:22,560	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Cut my arm around it
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:26,144	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Goodnight sweet prince

EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:32,448	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I hate everybody Pat Walters here I'm a producer at Radiolab
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:37,056	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:43,968	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:47,040	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:52,672	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when I did something
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:59,072	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I kids
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:02,144	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	You've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:09,056	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:13,920	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:20,832	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart but doesn't have
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:22,112	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Have anything to do with a test

EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:51,296	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Back to Boulder
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:56,928	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Sorry I can open the door that would be helping you
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:23:59,744	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So it's the next morning
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:03,072	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Zuko sits down at his personal computer and he starts making all these
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:05,632	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Hello
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:07,168	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Video chat calls
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:12,032	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	He calls up a guy in DC a guy in Texas
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:15,360	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Tell you you sound like Tom Hardy also
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:17,408	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Florida
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:18,432	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Really appreciate your help
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:20,224	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Slovenia
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:23,808	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Drop it by another guy in California
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:30,208	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And then there was this mysterious one has ready that was only referred to as February
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:32,512	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Didn't know where he was
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:34,560	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I didn't find out until afterwards
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:38,656	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	He was actually driving from Vancouver across
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:40,960	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	British Columbia
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:47,872	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Who are all these guys sofra Zuko it's it's very unacceptable he wants to take as much of the
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:50,432	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Trust me you got to trust me out of it as possible
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:52,224	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And that's what I tried to do
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:53,760	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	It's so
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:25:00,160	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Even though zukas can record all this footage put it up online later someone is going to be watching that could be like
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:00,928	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	This was a trick
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:07,328	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	It's all smoke and mirrors Magic Mike sure you say you recorded everything but maybe you manipulated the footage
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:10,144	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	You didn't even set the cameras up the way you said you did
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:10,912	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And so
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:17,056	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So I decided to do was get in touch with all these guys all over the world and try and decentralized distrust
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:22,688	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So there were six stations security camera setup
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:24,992	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Ready to help Zuko make
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:28,064	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	This big random number the private key so
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:32,160	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Each of the six stations was actually creating one
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:33,696	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Piece of the ski
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:40,096	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	That way they'll be no one person that makes the entire key it'll just be these little pieces that actually won't
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:45,216	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Ever come in contact with one another the idea was nobody will actually have
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:46,240	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	The kids up
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:47,776	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Hope this works
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:50,592	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So everyone's got their compute node power down
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:54,944	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And then
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:58,016	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	The ceremony begins
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:25:59,808	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	It's top secret Park
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:01,600	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	There's a special box
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:04,416	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Here to make sure that nobody can
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:07,744	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Gasser read this Secret
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:10,560	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Zuko closes the blinds
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:12,608	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And so
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:14,656	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I'm going to cover my keyboard
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:15,680	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	With the special box
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:19,264	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Do I take a cardboard box that one of the computer to come in
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:22,592	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Sawed in half so that it was
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:23,872	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Half of a cardboard box
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:27,200	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	He put it over the keyboard of the compute node
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:30,272	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Freddy
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:34,112	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And then I slid my hands under the cardboard box
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:35,136	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And then
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:44,352	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	He starts punching in all these random letters and numbers into the computer node
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:46,144	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Cat walking across the computer
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:46,912	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Okay
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:53,312	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And once he's done an auction on eBay
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:59,712	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	You know does it takes all those random characters and it combines it with more random characters that are generated like inside
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:00,736	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	By the computer
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:02,528	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Until finally it creates
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:07,136	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Part of the key to the other five participants had to do the same thing
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:10,464	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	DC made their piece of the Key Florida
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:11,232	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Texas
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:12,512	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Slovenia
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:14,048	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Canada
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:17,632	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Okay so you got one key broken into six pieces and the next
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:20,448	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Step is to get all of those pieces to work together to
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:22,752	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Create one thing which is zcash
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:26,592	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And you want to do this in such a way that those pieces never touch
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:28,640	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Each other that they remain hidden
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:29,920	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So that
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:33,504	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	No person could ever get their hand on the power of the whole key
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:42,464	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So thank God there's convoluted math to save the day I think it's a good time to just say what was happening
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:44,512	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	3-2-1 so
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:50,912	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	First things first the guy in California gets on the horn
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:53,472	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Play like the batting order and then
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:59,616	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	He sent a message, but go message to station one
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:06,016	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Station one guy and his computer know do some math on his piece of the key
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:11,136	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	If you know spits out a number and then Burns it onto DVD
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:12,672	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Why DVD
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:19,072	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Because all the guys at the station to ripped out the Wi-Fi in their compute node we don't want her to be able to package because
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:22,144	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	This by the way has a pretty cool name
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:26,752	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	You have a protective field basically around the computer that holds the secret
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:27,776	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I feel
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:37,760	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Anyway once the computer is done burning to the DVD the guy station one takes in wanted to another computer
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:39,040	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Cuter
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:45,440	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Uploaded to the internet and then the gas station to Peter van valkenburgh
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:51,840	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So what happens is the software I run on my connected computer
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:58,240	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I take the DVD out of the connected computer walk across the air gap if you will
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:29:02,848	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Mini compute node takes that little answer combined it with Peters piece of the key and then
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:05,408	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Math
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:11,808	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Sonos it Computing again you answer a bigger ass
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:15,136	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Answer and then I write on a different DVD answered
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:21,536	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Takes it out of the computer network computer uploads
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:27,936	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Station 3 grab that can find him a little bit more of an answer than Station 4
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:34,336	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	It's the same thing
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:40,736	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Get a little bit more the answer and just rinse wash repeat station 5-6 back to the

EDL	00:38:11,712	00:38:15,808	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And then Google said to me
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:25,536	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	It's like I think I'd rather donate my body
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:26,816	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	No
EDL	00:38:27,328	00:38:27,840	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Well
EDL	00:38:29,120	00:38:31,424	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	What would it take for you to donate your phone to science
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:35,520	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Like in the current state of it right now
EDL	00:38:35,520	00:38:37,056	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Without without like
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:40,128	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Yeah that's a problem no way
EDL	00:38:41,408	00:38:42,688	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Like that has so much
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:44,992	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Is my work on it
EDL	00:38:45,504	00:38:46,272	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And my
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:48,064	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Okay life
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:51,136	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I just think that
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:52,672	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Oh I don't think I have to justify
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:54,208	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Why
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:56,768	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	That's right you don't have to justify it
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:38:58,560	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	But
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:04,192	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Do you have a Leah pictures
EDL	00:39:04,960	00:39:07,520	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And some pictures but not much
EDL	00:39:07,520	00:39:10,336	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I-chaya put myself in your position I would have been like
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:14,944	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I feel okay I don't know I start
EDL	00:39:14,944	00:39:17,248	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	But you were very immediately like the opposite
EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:21,344	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	That's a no to me why
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:22,112	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Tumi
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:24,672	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	My responsibility is not to
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:27,232	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Just to myself you know privacy is a shared
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:30,560	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Resource associated with a share it's something we share with each other
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:36,192	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I will say this is one of the first stories where I
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:37,472	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Get
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:42,080	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	What privacy and data protection like means
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:48,992	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Like I remember when Morgan was telling me the story thinking if someone had hacked into Morgan
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:49,504	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Phone
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:52,576	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	How long have you been hacked in for
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:55,392	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I charge Morgan all the time
EDL	00:39:56,160	00:39:57,696	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I was kind of hat
EDL	00:39:58,208	00:39:59,488	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	You know and then it's like
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:06,400	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	We who else did you talk to her tell your dad was kind of crappy exchange those text messages that weren't on
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:07,680	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Signal that person was kind of hat
EDL	00:40:08,192	00:40:11,008	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Randomly just dawned on me duh like
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:13,312	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Her privacy isn't just hers
EDL	00:40:14,080	00:40:20,224	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	The things that are on my phone that are private or not only private from either private for for anyone I was talking to an
EDL	00:40:21,504	00:40:25,600	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Almost feel like I don't even have a right to give over that phone
EDL	00:40:25,600	00:40:26,624	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	If I haven't
EDL	00:40:26,624	00:40:28,672	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Talk to the people that
EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:34,048	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Then that would be exposing like that's not fair like sometimes people insist on privacy can feel
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:34,816	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Selfish
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:37,376	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Yeah then you realize like no like
EDL	00:40:38,656	00:40:40,960	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	One person doesn't insist on privacy
EDL	00:40:41,728	00:40:43,264	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Kind of like a chink in the armor
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:45,312	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And like something they were all vulnerable
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:53,760	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	For about an hour Morgan and Zuko go back and forth about what to do with her phone
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:40:57,856	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	But they don't really reach a conclusion
EDL	00:40:59,648	00:41:01,184	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Need to walk around
EDL	00:41:02,208	00:41:04,000	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Is anything going to happen if I go take a little walk
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:06,560	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Yeah you're not going to miss much
EDL	00:41:08,096	00:41:09,120	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Planner schedule
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:16,544	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I'm so sorry for no good reason I can't think of any reason for you not to take a walk
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:17,824	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Risk of freaked out
EDL	00:41:17,824	00:41:18,592	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Okay
EDL	00:41:18,592	00:41:19,104	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Yeah
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:20,384	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Okay
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:22,944	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	What
EDL	00:41:22,944	00:41:23,968	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I said be safe out there
EDL	00:41:26,016	00:41:26,528	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Enjoy
EDL	00:41:27,040	00:41:28,064	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Do you think I meant
EDL	00:41:28,064	00:41:28,832	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Do you think I'm a
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:30,112	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Secret agent
EDL	00:41:31,392	00:41:32,416	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I wasn't thinking that
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:33,696	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I was thinking
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:35,232	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Was afraid for you
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:36,768	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I'm not afraid
EDL	00:41:38,560	00:41:40,352	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Yeah I'm not either I was just feeling that way
EDL	00:41:43,168	00:41:44,704	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I'm going to take a walk so I feel really close
EDL	00:41:55,455	00:41:55,967	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So then
EDL	00:41:56,479	00:41:57,503	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I had to decide
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:41:58,783	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	What should we do
EDL	00:42:00,063	00:42:01,087	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Shall we
EDL	00:42:01,087	00:42:03,135	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Abort ceremony
EDL	00:42:03,135	00:42:04,671	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Shall we
EDL	00:42:06,975	00:42:12,351	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Focus our attention on some sort of Investigation of Morgan's phone
EDL	00:42:12,863	00:42:14,399	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	What should we do
EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:22,591	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Here's a decision here's what we're going to do
EDL	00:42:24,127	00:42:26,175	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	You get more out of here and otherwise
EDL	00:42:27,455	00:42:27,967	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	No change
EDL	00:42:28,479	00:42:32,319	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	He figured this these people have hacked into Morgan's phone we have
EDL	00:42:32,319	00:42:34,623	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So many security measures in place that
EDL	00:42:35,135	00:42:35,903	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	We can keep going
EDL	00:42:36,671	00:42:37,695	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Don't breathe us out later
EDL	00:42:38,719	00:42:40,255	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So basically what happens is like
EDL	00:42:42,047	00:42:43,839	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Morgan comes back from our walk
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:45,375	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Brewery
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:51,519	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I still have another full day of the ceremony last
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:54,335	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Okay
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:56,127	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And then
EDL	00:42:56,127	00:42:57,919	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	It gets to a point where
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:43:01,503	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	They finally have the final key
EDL	00:43:02,015	00:43:02,783	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Everybody
EDL	00:43:03,295	00:43:03,807	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	The big step
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:06,623	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Is there a high five
EDL	00:43:08,159	00:43:08,671	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Unplugged
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:10,719	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	No we're done
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:17,631	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And then
EDL	00:43:18,655	00:43:24,031	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	To sort of top it off I mean if you want to use the angle grinder
EDL	00:43:24,543	00:43:27,359	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Everybody takes their compute node
EDL	00:43:27,359	00:43:29,407	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And destroy that
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:31,199	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Because
EDL	00:43:31,711	00:43:34,015	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	In the case of the computer holds like
EDL	00:43:34,015	00:43:38,111	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Ghostie fingerprint of that like original piece of the key
EDL	00:43:38,111	00:43:39,135	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I just wanted
EDL	00:43:39,135	00:43:41,695	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Dawn saw the computer into pieces
EDL	00:43:42,719	00:43:45,791	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I missed smash the pieces with a hammer
EDL	00:43:45,791	00:43:46,815	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And dropped
EDL	00:43:46,815	00:43:49,631	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	The crushed pieces into a giant bonfire
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:56,031	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And that was that
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:04,991	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And now they were sort of
EDL	00:44:04,991	00:44:05,759	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	The moment
EDL	00:44:06,271	00:44:09,087	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Weather like okay well we actually did the technological
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:12,671	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Thing which was we created the system
EDL	00:44:13,439	00:44:15,999	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And now the bigger question was did they
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:18,047	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Create the Alchemy
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:25,727	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Did they needed to inspire trust like we're all the protocols in the video footage and all that stuff
EDL	00:44:25,727	00:44:27,263	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Was it all enough
EDL	00:44:27,775	00:44:31,615	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Especially now that they have this phone thing happened the phone thing
EDL	00:44:32,639	00:44:37,503	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Why did we do what we needed to do to show the world that they want to buy into this thing
EDL	00:44:41,343	00:44:44,671	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So five days after the ceremony ended the currency begin
EDL	00:44:46,719	00:44:48,255	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	To an insane
EDL	00:44:48,255	00:44:49,279	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Fanfare
EDL	00:44:49,279	00:44:50,815	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Really it was
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:55,423	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Crazy because she's a cryptocurrency built on bitcoin
EDL	00:44:55,423	00:45:01,823	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	It is dedicated to protecting your privacy but I think it went up like $4,000
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:06,687	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	21 zcash coin and that is
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:08,991	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	The Bitcoin High
EDL	00:45:08,991	00:45:10,527	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	At the time is like
EDL	00:45:10,527	00:45:16,927	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Around 1400 so that's insane
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:18,207	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Inspire
EDL	00:45:18,207	00:45:19,231	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	A community
EDL	00:45:19,231	00:45:23,071	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	To then use it it seems like it has it has done that
EDL	00:45:23,839	00:45:28,447	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	People continue to point back at this phone moment and wonderin speculate
EDL	00:45:29,471	00:45:29,983	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Some
EDL	00:45:30,495	00:45:33,311	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Yeah people of people want me to they want to know like
EDL	00:45:33,311	00:45:34,079	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Power results
EDL	00:45:34,847	00:45:37,919	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And how does it resolve them and did you give him your phone
EDL	00:45:38,431	00:45:43,039	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So what actually happened was we went to this bonfire
EDL	00:45:44,063	00:45:45,599	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	And then by the end of it
EDL	00:45:45,599	00:45:49,951	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Did everybody was sort of rushing off I was rushing to the to the airport and
EDL	00:45:49,951	00:45:51,743	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Just like game iPhone does he go
EDL	00:45:53,279	00:45:54,047	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I was like
EDL	00:45:54,047	00:45:54,815	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	We'll talk about it
EDL	00:45:56,095	00:45:56,863	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	I trust you
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:45:59,423	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Don't do anything
EDL	00:45:59,935	00:46:01,215	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	But I haven't agreed to
EDL	00:46:01,215	00:46:05,823	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	So you ended in the in the in the in the spirit of the whole Endeavor in some way

EDL	00:46:28,351	00:46:31,167	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	But you have to go through all of this again so
EDL	00:46:31,167	00:46:32,447	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	We have to do it again
EDL	00:46:32,447	00:46:33,215	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Because
EDL	00:46:33,215	00:46:34,495	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	We're upgrading
EDL	00:46:34,495	00:46:36,287	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Liquor tography and zcash
EDL	00:46:36,287	00:46:39,103	| radiolab_podcast17crypto |	Good God man what have you started
