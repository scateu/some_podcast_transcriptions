EDL	00:01:20,640	00:01:24,224	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Antonio and it's kind of country we live right outside of Kerrville actually
EDL	00:01:24,224	00:01:25,504	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	So it was even more
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:28,064	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	In a country that Kerrville is
EDL	00:01:28,064	00:01:30,880	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	These parents were very conservative very religious
EDL	00:01:31,392	00:01:34,464	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And they had created a place for their family that was
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:36,768	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Separate from
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:37,536	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	The rest of the world
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:39,072	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Well hi there

EDL	00:01:43,680	00:01:44,704	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	How to say a quick hello
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:51,616	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	His mom Lisa actually kept a video blog of life in the Pennington family
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:52,640	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Birds are singing
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:56,992	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	So peaceful out here in the country so we had like like 5 acres of land
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:02:00,064	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	This is our front porch we bought this old farmhouse
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:01,088	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	About 10 years ago
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:02,880	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	We had a little home Farm
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:04,672	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	We had
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:06,208	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Goats chickens
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:08,768	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	We had rabbits at one point
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:11,072	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	A cow that we would like raise
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:14,144	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	You know we butcher it and then freeze it all to me and then heated over the year
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:21,312	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I just sort of approaching self-sufficiency or was it was it
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:23,360	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Reach that self-sufficient point
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:25,920	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	But they also we wanted to give you something their kids
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:31,296	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Duties and responsibilities

EDL	00:02:58,688	00:02:59,200	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Farm
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:04,320	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Very strict lot of rules for how you're supposed to dress and how you're supposed to look high school
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:06,624	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Educate yourself what were some of those rules
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:10,464	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	For the girls you had to wear dresses
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:13,024	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Was super high collars we always wear sleeves no sleeveless
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:16,096	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Kind of Amish but not like that conservatives
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:17,376	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:23,520	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	We all had a really really really long hair we didn't cut her hair and we just didn't have a lot of access to things that they didn't want us to have access to
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:28,640	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I'm going to turn into like you were like 18 and could get on the allowed on internet for like limited

EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:42,208	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Not have as much of a passion for Learning and working
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:44,768	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And their Bible reading
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:51,168	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I didn't get to watch a lot of movies growing up they only listen to Christian music
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:52,192	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Cool or what how did that
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:53,216	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	All home-schooled
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:54,496	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Every single one
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:56,800	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Does that mean that you were like
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,848	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Always on the
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:00,128	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	On the property or
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:03,456	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Go to church off and on
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:05,248	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Various times so
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:06,784	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	We go out for that custofab
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:08,320	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Super rarely like we did
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:12,160	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I love the time you were with your family
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:15,744	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I was just kind of a moral thing like
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:17,024	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	We are trying to
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:19,327	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Keep you
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:20,863	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Holy
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:21,887	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I think
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:23,167	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	They
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:23,935	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Just
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:24,703	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Wanted to
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:26,239	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Keep playing
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:27,263	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	The things that they thought were like
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:29,055	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Sinful in the world
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:30,335	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Away from their kids
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:35,711	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And try to keep them safe and everything so if you said I want this they would say no and they win
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:40,575	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Yeah arguing was not allowed but face actually
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:41,599	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Should I just kind of
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:47,999	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Pushing that line just a little bit I am definitely a lot more stubborn and a lot more free-spirited and
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:50,303	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Right around her 18th birthday ideas
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:53,119	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I don't know I reached a point like a Breaking Point
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,959	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	With brushing like a little family meeting and I was
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:58,495	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	4 oldest
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:01,311	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Siblings of my parents were kind of supposed to discuss things and then
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:06,943	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	My oldest sister asked my mom she was considering getting a job and kind of asking advice or permission
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:08,223	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	If she couldn't
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:12,831	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	The Rings are too much outside influence but she was 23
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:13,599	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Yeah
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:17,695	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And then my brother said he wanted more internet because he was doing work for a church
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:23,327	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And they're like I'm sorry we can't do that you know you could be looking at things online you know we just need to shut it off
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:24,095	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Github
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:27,679	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	The one that's right next to me to 21 mm for a phone my parents are like
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:30,239	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	No telephone
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:32,287	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And so I was just like wow
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:35,359	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And I'm looking at my other siblings and they have nothing ahead of them
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:36,895	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	When I allowed to get jobs
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:38,175	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I like to go to school
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:40,735	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	They have no life except living here on this little farm
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:42,015	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	They have no future
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:45,087	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	After that night I decided I couldn't live like that
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:46,111	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I couldn't
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:48,159	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I was not going out like that
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:49,183	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	So
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:50,463	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I had an iPod
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:51,231	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:53,279	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I went on my parents room and I snuck
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:58,911	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	My mom wasn't there and I snuck my grandpa's phone number in Cincy an iPhone I could text him over Wi-Fi from
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:05:59,423	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	My iPods
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:02,239	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I did and I said hey when y'all come visit next weekend
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:03,519	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I want to go back with you
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:08,383	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I need help I need to get away from here can you take me back
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:10,431	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Home with you and
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:11,711	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	He said he would
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:15,807	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	So Grandma is not a bone of the same mind as your folks
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:20,415	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	They weren't really on board with how my parents did things
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:22,719	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	But they always kept coming to see us
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:24,255	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	That's why I knew that they cared about me
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:25,791	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And so I felt safe
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:27,583	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	To reach out to them
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:29,631	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	So the next week
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:32,191	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Her Grandpa and her grandma show up
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:34,239	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Farm and
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:37,567	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	What week

EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:42,943	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I don't want to go
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,223	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	But my grandpa was like
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:46,527	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	You need to ask them first need to ask permission
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:48,319	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	So I did and then
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:49,087	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	They
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,879	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Said no you can't go with them
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:53,183	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And then so I was like okay

EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:55,487	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And then
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:57,023	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I said
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:07:01,631	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Are they approached my grandparents broken necks and you still want to go or
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:03,935	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And if I decide that I did
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:07,775	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	As far as you know you're the only one so far in this family has
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:09,311	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	It might

EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:16,735	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Our family before
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:18,015	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	So
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:20,575	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Text morning
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:23,135	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	September 24th 2014
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:28,511	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	My mom was on her morning run and my dad was in his office he said was always there working in the morning
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:29,791	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	In the house
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:34,911	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	To my grandparents have to buy the rest of the kids and I just walked out the door with them
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:36,191	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Luggage rack
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:38,751	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	What's your weakness one suitcase
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:44,383	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	My my grandpa texted my mom and was like we're taking Faith with us just wanted you to know
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:47,455	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And then my mom texted and said don't go anywhere yet I'm coming back
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:52,831	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	She texted my dad and then they they both came and
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:55,647	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Tried to get me to get out of the car
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:08:01,023	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	They're like you have to have the car as I don't have to like what yeah you have to cuz we're telling you to Mike Will
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:03,327	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	So they got in
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,095	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:05,887	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Thanks yes my grandparents to get out
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:09,471	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	They're like can you get out of the car and we'll get in so we can talk to her
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:14,079	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	So you were alone in the car with your parents then that's then all the all the safety goes away right here
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:17,919	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	The only thing I had on my thighs that I was buckled in the
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:19,711	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Car and refuse to get out
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:22,271	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I think they were just kind of
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:22,783	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Shocked
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:25,087	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I was so torn
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:26,879	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I I mean I felt like I was just
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:28,415	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Melting
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:30,207	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	What was it that kept you in
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:37,375	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I think I was just telling myself over and over that I knew it was the right thing to do
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,911	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Even though I didn't feel like it
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:39,423	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:41,983	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Had to take
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:42,751	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Control my life
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:45,311	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And Amber wildee
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:50,175	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Migraine pressure like we have to go like we need to leave out and sew
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:50,687	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	They left
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:52,991	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Just drove away
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:55,551	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	So this world like this is
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:59,135	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	This is what 8 people that you ate + 2
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:01,183	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	10 people that you are
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:04,767	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Reminder world
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:05,535	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Like
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:07,071	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Yeah
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:10,143	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I was astonished that she had the boldness to
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:11,423	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Carry out that plan
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:17,823	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	This is Jenny L&S face and her mother's sister who like her grandparents didn't really subscribe to the Pennington
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:18,847	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	10 worlds you
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:21,663	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	But she would visit them from time to time at the Farm Heroes
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,431	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	For face
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:23,711	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	It's even more than just
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:25,247	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	The boldness of leaving her family
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:29,343	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	She believed she was walking into this world that was bad.
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:30,879	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Potentially going to
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:31,391	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Harm her
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:39,839	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	So that first night she gets to my parents house my grandparents said you can sleep in this room and there's a TV
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:45,983	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	The guest room Tulsa remote and leave her alone and said whatever you want
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:47,007	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	She never been allowed to
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:49,567	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Kicker on TV shows and Sochi
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:52,383	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	She turns it on
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:52,895	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	You looking for
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:55,967	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Full sun and she said it was like a
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:10:04,159	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Gardening show or a Home Improvement show or something and she's sitting there thinking I don't know if this is bad
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:05,183	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Exactly
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:06,719	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Portland Water
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:15,167	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Chevy watching this cuz that's kind of my parents did their what they would come dictate was right I was wrong and I went somewhere distant okay that's wrong
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:15,679	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	That's right
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:17,983	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And now that moral compass
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:18,495	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Was gone
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:22,591	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	She suddenly wasn't sure what was going to want
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:23,103	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	What about anymore
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,639	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I am so tired
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:25,407	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Tired of the way we
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:30,783	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And 19 is a tough place to step into the world being that naive
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:36,415	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Yeah she's asking me about sex
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:38,719	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	How do you learn what are you I don't know anything
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,743	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I thought I knew
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:40,767	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	What kind of man
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:42,303	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I didn't know anything
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:46,143	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Even the most basic social norms supposed to act
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:52,543	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	When she's hanging out with her cousin or other people her own age I don't know what I'm supposed to talk about I didn't catch most like the reference
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,823	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Do they make all these other
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:57,151	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Teenagers would be talking about shows music
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:59,199	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Movies school face
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:00,223	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I had no idea
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:07,647	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	She wanted to join this world we all live in an even in the most simple ways she wanted to get a job
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:10,719	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	When to drive have an apartment
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:11,999	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	But
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:12,767	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	She couldn't
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:15,583	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	She didn't have course have a driver's license
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:17,119	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	No plus she didn't have it
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:18,655	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Social security number
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:25,055	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Have the birth certificate will you were born when you were born didn't they say okay was just the hospital will
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:26,335	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	The hospital Saul home birth
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:28,895	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	They specifically sought out midwives
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:29,663	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	That would
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:30,687	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Agree to file no Wrecker
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:32,735	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Why would you want to do that
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,015	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	There's two
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:35,039	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Hole
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:37,087	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Kind of way of thinking is called
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:37,599	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	What's it called
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:41,951	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Sovereignty to take some of these documents as they exist
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:42,975	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I've got hooks in them
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:49,375	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	So as I dug into the story I actually talked to a bunch of people who the birth certificate seemed like
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:50,911	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Like a paper of ownership
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:57,311	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Political or religious or just privacy reasons don't want this kind of documentation from the gov
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:12:01,407	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Definitely been used for the measure of control
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:07,807	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Face parents who actually wouldn't talk to me for the story they're not supposed to be a part of that movement but my dad
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:09,343	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Some of those ideas
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:10,367	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	That
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:17,279	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	The government should not have a number assigned about they purposefully raised faith and her eight siblings to be
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:20,095	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Outside of the system and that's
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:22,655	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Probably something they thought of as a gift
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:25,471	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I guess the thinking is that face would be
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:26,751	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Free from the rules of
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:28,287	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Society really my parents
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:29,823	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Stay but they did it out of like
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:31,103	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	The best they thought they
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:33,407	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	To do so I mean I'm not going to
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:34,687	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Emagine buddy for doing what
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:35,711	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	They think they should do
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:41,087	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	But to face it didn't feel like Freedom it actually felt like prison
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:43,903	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And this is where face Journey really began
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:50,303	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Bass and her aunt or Grandma they went online started poking around and you realize
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:56,703	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Was it the first thing you need is a birth certificate yes
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:13:03,103	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	She's applied to the Bureau of Vital Statistics government office where they keep track of like births deaths
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:09,503	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Marriages adoption in the Bureau of Vital Statistics does a search not only a vet name but if any light
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:15,903	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Django babies born in that area and make sure that you weren't stolen at Birth from some of their parents or something like
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:22,303	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	But they couldn't find anything so they said the next step is to go to court so my mom can't
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:28,703	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Text the court and they wanted three pieces of information proving her birth facts
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:35,103	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Well there was a sworn affidavit by my mother a swearing that she was at her birth we got that one
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:39,199	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	So they needed two more documents she could get a doctor's records
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:39,967	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	But
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:42,527	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	She doesn't have any government Hospital
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:48,927	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	They said she's never been that sick never even had an accident and they're better than us

EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:30,496	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And it didn't even solve her problem because when people did offer advice
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:37,408	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Didn't really help start working on not paying taxes I'll come to you I got people who just had them ideas of what to do
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:43,808	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	So you can gain citizenship many of them more marriage proposals
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:47,392	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Actually that will help
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:48,928	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Some of them not so
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:51,488	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Set alarm
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:54,560	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Also inside of those emails in comments
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:22:00,960	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	There was a conversation about whether what her parents did was right on his from like the opposite perspective
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:06,848	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	David says her parents didn't quote neglect anything they stood on an exercise their rights and wisely so
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:13,248	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	What they did was in her best interest she just doesn't understand it because she is young and she's led a protective life a lot of these folks
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:15,552	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Spelt like Faith was blowing this
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:17,088	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Gifts that her parents
EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:17,600	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Giving her
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:24,000	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	From my perspective if you take some of these documents as they exist
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:25,024	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I've got hooks in them
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:27,072	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	This is Alfred Addis
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:29,888	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Who blogs about sovereignty and sovereign state
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:31,424	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Kristoff

EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:35,776	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Evidence that maybe I'm not crazy
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:39,360	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	There's a case called Chisholm vs. Georgia
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:43,968	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	41793 they're talking about European jurisprudence
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:46,784	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Distinction between the prince
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:47,808	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And the subject
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:53,184	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And the distinction is that the prince gets his rights from Ghana that's when they say the king is Anointed
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:59,584	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Happy message ideas obtained he
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:03,936	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Hear meaning within the United States of America after revolution
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:07,264	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	The sovereignty devolved on the people
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:08,544	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And they
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:10,336	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Are the truth sovereign
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:12,640	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And the word sovereigns is
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:19,040	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Alexandra how do you deal with the opening phrase
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:20,576	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Raisin in the Constitution which is
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:24,416	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	We and people not I the person one by one
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:24,928	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	But we
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:27,488	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	When it says we the people it means we the sovereign
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:34,400	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Are not a collective
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:38,496	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	You are an idiot we ended up getting into the the little tussle over the world
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:40,544	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Government disability
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:42,592	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And the car
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:45,152	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Tuition but eventually we got back to face
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:48,480	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Once you have been recognized as a sovereign
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:52,320	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	How do you avoid it's like in Redondo long just I want
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:55,392	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Judge I don't want blue eyes anymore
EDL	00:23:55,392	00:24:01,536	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	If you must part of you must go out and feel a little sorry for her right like she she's got it she has
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:02,304	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	A
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:09,216	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	She has a a will to become something other than cousin will to become a subject subject
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:09,984	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Yes
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:13,824	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	So you going to but I don't hear you condemning her
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:16,384	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Oh you are condemning her that little bit
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:18,944	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Is making a choice
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:25,088	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	There's Proviso in the Bible where people in the Old Testament if you wanted to remain you could be you could volunteer to be a slave for some guy
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:28,416	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Some people don't want to be sovereign
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:34,304	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	It's not an email I just want a job if you want to work for a living
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:38,656	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	There are consequences for her abandoning her status as a free woman
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:40,192	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Here's the weird irony
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:43,264	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Because she has no birth certificate because she has no passport
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:49,920	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	The state of Texas in the government United States Sabo we can't figure out how to make you visible again
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:51,712	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	They may not be able to
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:52,992	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	But then
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:59,392	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Face grandmother lives in my district in Sun City and she the government stepped in my grandma was able to
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:02,976	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Get in touch with Marsha Farney Marsha Farney state representative
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:04,000	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I have house district
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:10,400	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	She's a republican member of the Texas House of Representatives we would get together I do with my staff and say what are the cause of headache
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:10,912	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I come in this week
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:13,216	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And this one will really
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:14,240	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Caught our attention
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:16,544	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	So she heard about it she said when you do something about this
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:17,824	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And she did
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:19,616	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	This pill
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:20,384	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Is anesthesia
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:21,664	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	To get
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:22,688	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	A birth certificate
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:29,600	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Around a month after face video went viral Marsha Farney put together a bill and brought it before the House of Representatives in
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:31,136	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Standard committee
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:32,160	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Already read
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:34,208	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	About this bill and Bear
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:34,976	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Keenly aware
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:40,096	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	So the bill does a couple things it makes the process logistically easier
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:40,864	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Expanded
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:45,728	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Where a someone could apply for a delayed birth certificate it was
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:49,824	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Punishments for the parents so in the case of Faith right if she asked her parents
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:55,712	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	For documentation and they refuse then it's punishable by up to a year in jail and up
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:56,480	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	2
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:26:00,832	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	$4,000 of a fine or a combination of both
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:07,744	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Germano bail for Witnesses here who want to testify on this bill during the kind of way
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:09,536	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	That the various sides High
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:12,608	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I'm Lucy Southworth live in Georgetown Texas
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:16,704	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And so faith and her aunt and her grandma all went to test
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:19,520	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	If I face is my granddaughter in my namesake
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:22,080	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I was in the room the day she was born
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:23,360	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Unfortunate
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:30,784	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Her grandma filled in the state reps on what they've been doing the last six months we went to the DPS to get her a driver's license and
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:32,832	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	They said no they said go to the social
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:36,672	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Security people security people said no go to the voter registration p
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:41,280	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Meetings and dead-ends and rejection go to the DPS
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:43,328	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	We were stuck in a do Loop
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:47,424	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Well I wasn't going to quit their for goodness sake she's a text
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:51,264	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	So Marsha Farney has offered us
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:53,568	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Our only hope we have had since this started
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:56,640	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I just hired you to pass this
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:57,408	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Spell
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:26:58,688	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Take face out of limbo
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:26:59,968	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Give her the life she
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:03,296	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	My view was just like we would not allow a parent
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:04,832	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	The physically handicapped a child
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:08,160	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	We should not allow a parent to handicap a child
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:11,488	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Where they can't operate and function in society
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:13,536	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Although You Seen Her Standing
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:15,072	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Anon person
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:16,864	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Chicken Walk
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:17,888	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Off the face of the Earth
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:19,680	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And legally nobody would know
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:20,704	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	She was gone
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:30,944	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I think the bills a little misguided that's James Pennington face dad he came out to the hearing and ended up on the
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:32,224	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	The Fox 7 news cast
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:38,624	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And unfortunately this is the only bit of tape we have of him
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:40,416	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Fees for prostitute already there
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:41,440	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	There are six other
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:42,720	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Children seem a little
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:47,584	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I think I don't disagree with that does the State of Texas want to put start putting
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:48,352	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Aaron's in
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:52,960	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Well the bill gives the judge some leeway based on what the circumstances are for the parents
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:58,080	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	But we we felt there was a need for some teeth to this bill
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:27:59,872	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Duke and it turns out that the Texas
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:05,248	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	State house and state senate agreed so we were able to get it through the house and the Senate
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:11,136	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	The bill ended up passing Republicans voted for it Democrats voted for it there's actually only one no vote
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:16,000	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	But the next time Marshall funny was up for re-election she actually lost in the primaries
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:22,144	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And according to the Texas Observer who actually did a really nice podcast if a story
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:28,288	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	There's this lobbying group called the Texas homeschool Coalition who donated a bunch of money to find his primary opponent
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:31,104	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Parental Revenge
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:34,176	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Okay well then what's the weirdest videos that leafy
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:40,320	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Well because of the bill Faith was able to take her case to a different Court a higher Court
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:47,232	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And it seems like the bill allowed the judge to consider different kinds of evidence so in the end Faith with Abel
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:50,304	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Will use an old orthodontist record and a piece of paper
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:52,096	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	From her uncle a doctor
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:54,400	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Who had treated her toe back when she was a kid
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:57,472	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And in just a couple weeks
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:28:58,240	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	This is
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:28:59,776	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Certificate
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:01,568	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Sometimes I just take it out and look at it
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:02,848	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Sometimes randomly
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:04,640	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I know it sucks it's so dumb it's like
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:08,480	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I have one too

EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:22,816	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Counting to the singer
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:34,080	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I'm hoping that the physical papers
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:36,128	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Can like mirror
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:40,224	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	The emotional thing that she's going through cuz I feel like
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:42,528	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	It's like a she's getting the papers she's appearing
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:48,416	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	So that by the time she gets that last one she will know who she is and then she will be that person whoever that is
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:50,720	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	She's working so hard for it
EDL	00:29:51,232	00:29:52,000	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I'm hoping that
EDL	00:29:52,768	00:29:53,792	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Adjust
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:57,120	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	That will have developed in her something that she feels like it's more than a piece
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:29:58,400	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	You know
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:00,704	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I'm hoping
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:03,264	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	So now Faith
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:05,568	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	She was actually able to get a driver's license
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:08,896	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	But she still doesn't have her social security number
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:15,296	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Which means you can't get a real job she can't open up a bank account still really
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:19,648	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	But she can't get health insurance she might not be able to go to college
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:20,928	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	So
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:22,976	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I don't know what's going to happen to her
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:27,584	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	I remember asking her this question like when this is all over
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:29,376	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Do you know who you're going to be
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:30,144	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	You know
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:32,448	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Cuz now this is who you are you're the girl with no identity
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:33,728	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	And
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:34,496	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	She was
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:36,544	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	A little concerned that she wouldn't know who she was going to be
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:41,152	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	If your if your aunt ask you that same question again like
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:43,968	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	Who do who do you think you are now who Do You Think You Are

EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:55,136	| radiolab_podcast16doesntexist |	But when I was there she wanted to do something with me that she's never done before
