EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:16,703	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	About 3 EMS personnel
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:19,519	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I don't know if that's the truth truth

EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:21,055	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Picked up in-store
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:23,615	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Insulin
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:26,175	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I thought there was something unusual about that
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:28,223	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And I was curious
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:29,503	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Tahir the real story
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:32,831	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Give me just a few minutes

EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:42,815	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	So eventually was just the three of us in this living room
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:45,887	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I mean maybe I should preface this by saying
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:50,239	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	That you can't really understand the story unless you understand a little bit
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:51,263	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	About what
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:52,287	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	EMS Personnel do
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:54,847	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I talked to some other EMTs the
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:56,383	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Told me that everybody has their why

EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:02,527	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	This is a business
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:09,439	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I would say like a very small percentage like don't have second or third jobs like they don't make a lot of money
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:10,719	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	So everybody has his wife
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:13,535	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And so I asked
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:14,559	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Scotty what his why was
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:16,095	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And

EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:22,239	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Why he does what he does
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:23,519	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	But
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:27,359	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	It also explained like why he holds on to certain things
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:28,639	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	So

EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:27,807	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And that was all they viewed me us
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:32,927	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Scotty said The more I thought about it the more he felt like he had this the sort of debt to pay back
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:36,255	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	For the lives that were lost that day or the ones that he

EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:24,672	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Is pretty bad
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:27,488	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And I would I would assume that
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:28,256	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	DMs
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:29,024	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Scotty and Jay
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:30,816	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Would have seen this
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:31,584	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	This shift
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:34,912	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Yes, he told us around 2017
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:39,776	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Overdose calls went from one or two a week to 5/6
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:41,824	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	One day there was 11
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:45,408	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And that was just unheard of in this County it just
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:47,456	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	To have that many overdoses
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:49,760	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Because they would treat the same person
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:51,552	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Like five times over a few months
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:52,832	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Like this is just
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:53,600	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	The job

EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:00,768	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	It's sort of like moral calculus
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:05,888	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	That an EMS person makes when they show up to help a person who who is OD
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:07,168	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	It started
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:11,008	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	When report started emerging about this new
EDL	00:24:11,008	00:24:11,520	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Drug
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:14,080	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Distracted made it so
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:15,360	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Simply coming into contact with
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:16,128	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Person like this
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:17,664	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Simply touching them
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:19,712	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Could quit an EMS worker
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:21,248	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Endanger
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:22,528	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Wasn't a lot known about it

EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:42,496	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	World War Z
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:44,800	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Walking Dead
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:46,848	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	The drug is called Fentanyl
EDL	00:24:47,360	00:24:49,664	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	What is fentanyl like I know that it's an opioid
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:50,688	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	What is it like
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:55,552	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Talk to a guy about this
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:58,112	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Can you tell me again like who you are and yeah
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:24:59,648	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I'm in Emergency Physician

EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:07,584	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	He's also the director of the Minnesota poison control
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:09,376	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Sell fentanyl has been around for decades
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:12,192	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	We use it almost everyday
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:12,960	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	My Hospital
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:16,288	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	So fentanyl is an opioid
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:17,312	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	It's fully synthetic
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:18,592	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Manufactured in Laboratories
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:22,176	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Roxanne comes in powder form but
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:26,784	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Drug companies reformulated into all sorts of things like fentanyl lollipops
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:28,832	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	These lollipops are given to
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:35,232	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	The soldiers on the battlefield there's also Fentanyl patches that people wear to get fentanyl into their body
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:36,000	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Through their skin
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:39,072	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Oh so you can you can do Fentanyl through the skin
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:40,096	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	It's a easy way to
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:40,864	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Put something on for
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:41,632	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	People with really bad
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:42,912	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Pain
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:43,424	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	People cancer free
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:44,704	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Confuse them
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:46,752	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	It just is really really effective painkiller
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:48,288	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Because fentanyl is really really
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:51,360	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I mean a lot of people refer to fentanyl as
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:54,432	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Start of the third wave of the opioid crisis
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:56,224	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Just for context mean
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:26:01,600	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	What are the first two waves if you go back to the beginning of the crisis
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:03,392	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	The first wave was pills
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:04,672	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	When I
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:09,792	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Early 2000s manufacturers begin flooding communities with pharmaceutical grade opiates
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:15,424	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Then the second wave was around 2011 when there was a Crackdown on pills and so
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:19,776	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	A lot of people that were were using Pharmaceuticals began to migrate to heroin
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:22,848	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	In the Mexican cartels got very good at delivering that heroin
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:24,128	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And then
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:26,944	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Round 2013
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:29,760	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	3rd wave hits
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:31,040	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Worst drug crisis
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:32,576	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Ever drug dealers
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:33,856	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	People that are selling heroin
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:38,208	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Start looking to fentanyl because fentanyl is so much cheaper
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:40,000	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	To either make or obtain the
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:41,280	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Normal heroin
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:43,072	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And most importantly Fentanyl
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:45,120	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Is way more potent
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:52,544	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Is it basically to to maximize their profit drug dealer start cutting fentanyl into heroin
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:58,944	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Problem is that the people who are using they really have no idea what they're getting they think they're just getting heroin
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:27:05,344	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	2014 we started to see patients in our emergency department who were over.
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:11,744	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Ghost with what they thought was heroin that probably turned out to be Fentanyl and more and more people were overdosing
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:18,144	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Fentanyl powerful synthetic opiate about
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:24,544	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Powerful Ultra potent synthetic opioid
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:30,944	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And there are versions of the molecules changed a little bit and it makes it more potent and by 2016
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:37,344	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Even more
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:42,464	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Used to tranquilize elephants
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:45,024	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And are fed most extremely potent
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:48,096	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	The same size as just seven grains of salt
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:48,864	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Could kill you
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:53,984	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	John says it was right around this time
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:56,800	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	2016 started to be reports
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:28:00,384	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I fall backwards law enforcement and I'm tryna

EDL	00:39:54,368	00:40:00,512	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Take it and take two or three and then it just you know got to experiment and more and more started using
EDL	00:40:01,024	00:40:02,560	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Perc 30s for sure
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:04,352	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Definitely flooding into
EDL	00:40:04,352	00:40:06,144	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Places like Kentucky in the
EDL	00:40:06,144	00:40:07,680	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Early 2000s
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:10,240	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	So this is like the sort of first wave of the
EDL	00:40:10,240	00:40:11,264	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	The opioid crisis
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:12,800	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Biscotti said it first
EDL	00:40:12,800	00:40:18,944	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	You would get pills from Friends people at work and then it just you know got too well you know I started buying pills
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:21,248	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Crossover
EDL	00:40:21,760	00:40:28,160	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Probably my mid-20s he started taking
EDL	00:40:28,160	00:40:34,560	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I'm talking bread right he was talking Freddy was also working in the factory quadrat works at Steel
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:40,960	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Call somebody and I've always been that way I don't really want to stay off people feel like I can work to make enough money to
EDL	00:40:40,960	00:40:42,496	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	It was really hard
EDL	00:40:42,496	00:40:44,800	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I mean I made 5 $600 weekend
EDL	00:40:45,312	00:40:48,128	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Yeah I wouldn't have any left because you expense
EDL	00:40:48,128	00:40:54,528	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	All of it on on pills and he was doing that for years and probably about like 2011 or 12
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:57,344	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Do heroin come around that's when I start doing it
EDL	00:40:57,344	00:40:58,880	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Because it was cheaper
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:01,184	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Cuz it was cheaper and because I was spending
EDL	00:41:01,184	00:41:04,256	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	$8,200 into pills
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:06,048	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Just two pills is two pills
EDL	00:41:06,048	00:41:09,632	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	You know you might get a little behind it might not last very long at all
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:14,496	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	No Friday or $100 heroin you can get a lot more and it's a lot more powerful
EDL	00:41:14,496	00:41:16,544	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	So that it just makes sense
EDL	00:41:17,056	00:41:18,080	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Calculus Heat
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:22,944	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	He did heroin for like five or six years he didn't inject it but he would do it snort it
EDL	00:41:23,456	00:41:24,480	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And he says he
EDL	00:41:24,480	00:41:26,528	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Tried to quit a couple of times but

EDL	00:44:04,735	00:44:05,759	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Decision
EDL	00:44:05,759	00:44:06,527	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	To call the
EDL	00:44:07,039	00:44:08,319	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	The ambulance service
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:09,855	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	What happens next

EDL	00:44:23,935	00:44:25,215	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I do think they started like
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:27,519	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	In that moment they must have been a little like
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:30,591	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	What do we do next
EDL	00:44:30,591	00:44:31,615	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Tuesday

EDL	00:44:40,063	00:44:46,463	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	First person to call Buzz actually Ricky's brother
EDL	00:44:46,463	00:44:52,095	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Which means someone must have called Ricky's brother
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:56,191	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Homo is going on they didn't know what to do because when he calls

EDL	00:45:02,335	00:45:04,383	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Something about an outstanding warrant

EDL	00:45:42,527	00:45:48,927	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Sounds like their one-year-old son was in the apartment at the timeout wow really
EDL	00:45:48,927	00:45:53,279	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	They were worried about the police coming in and losing custody of their kid
EDL	00:45:53,279	00:45:55,071	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And I feel like for them
EDL	00:45:55,071	00:45:56,095	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	In that moment
EDL	00:45:56,607	00:45:58,655	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	What when Ricky was with lying on the floor
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:46:00,703	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I think there were some questions in their mind like
EDL	00:46:01,983	00:46:03,263	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	What's the right thing to do
EDL	00:46:03,775	00:46:04,543	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	How do we
EDL	00:46:05,055	00:46:06,591	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	How do we do the right thing
EDL	00:46:06,591	00:46:08,639	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Without getting ourselves in trouble
EDL	00:46:11,711	00:46:16,319	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	They did make the call
EDL	00:46:16,319	00:46:19,135	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Apartment 301 Jessica called 911
EDL	00:46:19,135	00:46:22,975	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	It was two minutes after Ricky's brother made that first call
EDL	00:46:25,791	00:46:27,839	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Goblin show
EDL	00:46:27,839	00:46:30,655	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And I believe one of the reasons that they made the call that day
EDL	00:46:31,423	00:46:32,447	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Was because
EDL	00:46:32,959	00:46:37,055	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	They knew about this law I didn't know exactly what it said I did know that it
EDL	00:46:37,567	00:46:41,663	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And came in my mind you will be okay it was designed
EDL	00:46:41,663	00:46:43,967	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Protect people in exactly this situation
EDL	00:46:44,479	00:46:44,991	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	The Good Samaritan
EDL	00:46:45,759	00:46:47,551	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Call
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:52,159	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	The Good Samaritan law

EDL	00:46:59,071	00:47:05,215	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	A lot of states started adopting these 911 Good Samaritan laws
EDL	00:47:05,215	00:47:06,495	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	46 States
EDL	00:47:06,495	00:47:08,543	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Including Kentucky now have these laws
EDL	00:47:08,543	00:47:10,591	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Which eventually say if using drugs

EDL	00:47:30,047	00:47:34,399	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Make people who are in the presence of a drug overdose do you want these people to call for
EDL	00:47:34,911	00:47:36,447	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	For help because otherwise
EDL	00:47:36,447	00:47:37,215	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	You know
EDL	00:47:37,215	00:47:40,031	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	There's a good rest of these people are just going to die

EDL	00:47:49,503	00:47:51,807	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	The parables in the Gospel of Luke
EDL	00:47:52,319	00:47:54,367	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	It's Jesus is telling the story
EDL	00:47:54,879	00:47:55,391	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And
EDL	00:47:56,159	00:47:57,439	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	So there's a
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:47:58,975	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	That you he's
EDL	00:47:58,975	00:48:00,255	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	On the road to Jericho
EDL	00:48:00,767	00:48:01,535	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And
EDL	00:48:01,535	00:48:03,071	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	As he's walking along
EDL	00:48:03,071	00:48:05,119	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Some robbers come and they
EDL	00:48:05,119	00:48:07,167	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	They steal his money and they beat him up
EDL	00:48:07,167	00:48:08,191	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And I leave them in a ditch
EDL	00:48:08,703	00:48:10,239	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And there's actually left
EDL	00:48:10,239	00:48:10,751	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Don't forget
EDL	00:48:11,263	00:48:12,031	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And then
EDL	00:48:12,031	00:48:13,823	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Another person comes along the road
EDL	00:48:14,591	00:48:15,359	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And
EDL	00:48:15,359	00:48:17,407	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	But is that helping him this person like
EDL	00:48:17,919	00:48:19,711	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	No crosses the road in the
EDL	00:48:20,223	00:48:20,991	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Keeps on walking
EDL	00:48:21,759	00:48:23,039	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Second person comes by
EDL	00:48:23,039	00:48:23,807	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Same thing
EDL	00:48:23,807	00:48:25,855	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And then a third person comes
EDL	00:48:25,855	00:48:26,367	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	End
EDL	00:48:26,879	00:48:27,903	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	It's a Samaritan
EDL	00:48:27,903	00:48:30,975	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And like the Jews and the Samaritans were like mortal enemies
EDL	00:48:30,975	00:48:31,487	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Like
EDL	00:48:32,255	00:48:34,815	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	They they absolutely detest each other
EDL	00:48:34,815	00:48:37,631	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	But when the Samaritan seizes jue Lan in a ditch
EDL	00:48:38,143	00:48:39,167	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Indeed
EDL	00:48:39,167	00:48:41,727	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	The Good Samaritan stops and he helps
EDL	00:48:41,727	00:48:43,775	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Help this guy and
EDL	00:48:43,775	00:48:45,311	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Give them money and shelter in
EDL	00:48:45,823	00:48:47,103	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And treats his wounds
EDL	00:48:47,103	00:48:49,151	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And you know like essentially saves his life
EDL	00:48:49,663	00:48:51,455	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	So that the story about
EDL	00:48:51,455	00:48:57,343	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Like showing kindness to your enemy
EDL	00:48:57,855	00:49:00,159	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Interesting about this is that
EDL	00:49:00,927	00:49:03,743	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Jesus is talking to a legal scholar
EDL	00:49:03,743	00:49:04,511	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And
EDL	00:49:05,279	00:49:07,327	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	So it's true about setting up
EDL	00:49:07,327	00:49:09,631	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I like morality verses
EDL	00:49:09,631	00:49:10,143	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	The law
EDL	00:49:10,655	00:49:11,423	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And
EDL	00:49:11,935	00:49:18,335	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And so like what I guess what he's saying is that if if you see somebody that's in need you don't think about what the law says you should have
EDL	00:49:18,335	00:49:19,359	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Do you
EDL	00:49:19,359	00:49:20,127	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	You just
EDL	00:49:20,127	00:49:21,919	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	You just help the person in need
EDL	00:49:21,919	00:49:22,431	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	It's like
EDL	00:49:22,943	00:49:24,223	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	You know
EDL	00:49:24,735	00:49:26,015	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Unconditional love
EDL	00:49:26,527	00:49:27,807	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Like takes precedence
EDL	00:49:27,807	00:49:28,575	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Over
EDL	00:49:28,575	00:49:29,855	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Over the letter of the law
EDL	00:49:29,855	00:49:30,879	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Lake but then of course
EDL	00:49:31,903	00:49:32,415	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	There is
EDL	00:49:32,927	00:49:33,695	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	The law
EDL	00:49:33,695	00:49:34,207	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Ronnie
EDL	00:49:34,975	00:49:37,791	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Does New York reporters are here to stick a microphone of your face
EDL	00:49:38,303	00:49:41,119	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And what seems to be happening across country is prosecutors
EDL	00:49:41,631	00:49:43,167	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Are beginning to push back
EDL	00:49:44,191	00:49:46,239	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Against the Good Samaritan
EDL	00:49:46,239	00:49:47,007	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Thank you

EDL	00:50:04,159	00:50:05,951	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Got bigger problems in New York to deal with them
EDL	00:50:06,463	00:50:07,999	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Then what we were dealing with it
EDL	00:50:07,999	00:50:09,279	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	That's fine I mean
EDL	00:50:09,279	00:50:10,303	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Glad that you guys
EDL	00:50:11,071	00:50:12,095	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Got down this way
EDL	00:50:12,863	00:50:14,143	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	So what did he say
EDL	00:50:14,143	00:50:15,167	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Say to you about
EDL	00:50:15,167	00:50:17,727	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Asrani starter explained it
EDL	00:50:17,727	00:50:22,335	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	To us to go back with our legislature in and the way they they have drafted the
EDL	00:50:22,335	00:50:26,431	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Good Samaritan law the way the law is written in Kentucky is that
EDL	00:50:26,943	00:50:30,015	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	If you call 911 for a drug overdose
EDL	00:50:30,015	00:50:32,575	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	You're only granted immunity for
EDL	00:50:33,343	00:50:34,111	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	2
EDL	00:50:34,111	00:50:40,511	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Specific types of charges you cannot charge them with possession of controlled substance drug possession or possession of drug paraphernalia drug
EDL	00:50:40,511	00:50:42,047	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Paraphernalia just those two charges
EDL	00:50:42,815	00:50:45,375	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	But we didn't charge him with possession we charge them with wanton endangerment
EDL	00:50:45,887	00:50:47,935	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	In this way you see this sort of pushed back
EDL	00:50:47,935	00:50:54,335	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Wanted me to take the legal term for when you do something that quit somebody at risk for physical injury or or
EDL	00:50:54,335	00:50:56,639	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Conscious disregard for
EDL	00:50:56,639	00:50:57,407	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	What cat
EDL	00:50:57,407	00:50:58,175	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Credit card
EDL	00:50:58,175	00:50:59,455	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	It's like driving drunk
EDL	00:50:59,455	00:51:03,295	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	So in this situation with fentanyl
EDL	00:51:03,807	00:51:05,855	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	You created this number one of the child
EDL	00:51:05,855	00:51:08,927	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I'm being seriously injured or killed by someone overdose or
EDL	00:51:09,439	00:51:11,743	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	What other injuries and then also you placed
EDL	00:51:12,255	00:51:13,535	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Paramedics law enforcement
EDL	00:51:14,047	00:51:16,351	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And social workers that you would have to come in
EDL	00:51:16,351	00:51:17,631	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And that's that circumstance
EDL	00:51:18,143	00:51:21,471	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	So rather than granting Scotty Ricky and Jessica
EDL	00:51:21,471	00:51:21,983	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Protection
EDL	00:51:22,495	00:51:23,519	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Ronnie Goldy
EDL	00:51:23,519	00:51:25,055	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Commonwealth of Kentucky
EDL	00:51:25,055	00:51:26,335	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Has charge them
EDL	00:51:26,335	00:51:27,359	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	With 10 counts
EDL	00:51:27,359	00:51:28,639	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	So tell me what endangerment
EDL	00:51:28,639	00:51:31,455	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	To each one of them are getting hit with 10 felony charges
EDL	00:51:31,967	00:51:35,807	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Low white n so there was one charge for endangering
EDL	00:51:36,319	00:51:36,831	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	The child
EDL	00:51:37,599	00:51:42,207	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	So like the the the 1 year old could have gotten into the drug somehow and
EDL	00:51:42,719	00:51:43,487	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And
EDL	00:51:43,487	00:51:44,511	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Become exposed that way
EDL	00:51:45,023	00:51:46,047	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And then there was
EDL	00:51:46,047	00:51:48,351	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Wanted if there are nine additional charges
EDL	00:51:48,351	00:51:49,375	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	One for each
EDL	00:51:49,375	00:51:51,679	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Of the the people that came to the house that day
EDL	00:51:52,191	00:51:53,215	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	The police
EDL	00:51:53,215	00:51:53,983	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	The social workers
EDL	00:51:54,495	00:51:56,543	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And all the EMS that responded
EDL	00:51:56,543	00:52:00,639	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And I think we should stay here that the Jessica who's now facing these 10 felony charges
EDL	00:52:01,151	00:52:02,175	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	The day
EDL	00:52:02,175	00:52:04,991	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Of the over dashefsky tested negative
EDL	00:52:05,503	00:52:06,527	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	For opiates
EDL	00:52:06,527	00:52:12,159	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	But in there getting their kid checked out okay to
EDL	00:52:12,671	00:52:15,231	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Call she was like in the apartment and made the call
EDL	00:52:15,743	00:52:17,279	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	The other thing to mention is
EDL	00:52:18,047	00:52:20,863	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	That like the thing that she and Scotty
EDL	00:52:20,863	00:52:23,935	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Were scared of which was losing custody of
EDL	00:52:23,935	00:52:24,703	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Their son
EDL	00:52:25,215	00:52:26,495	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	That that did happen
EDL	00:52:26,495	00:52:27,519	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I'm not mad about that
EDL	00:52:28,031	00:52:30,591	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I understand that I understand that aspect you
EDL	00:52:31,871	00:52:33,407	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Drug stuff found in the home
EDL	00:52:34,431	00:52:35,967	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	They took him I understand that
EDL	00:52:36,479	00:52:38,015	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	As far as the other things
EDL	00:52:38,015	00:52:38,783	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	10 felonies
EDL	00:52:39,551	00:52:40,831	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I don't understand them
EDL	00:52:41,855	00:52:42,879	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	But Ronnie's
EDL	00:52:42,879	00:52:44,415	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Argument is that
EDL	00:52:44,415	00:52:48,511	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Because of the number of people who had been overdosing in the community
EDL	00:52:48,511	00:52:54,399	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Because of the local and national news reporting about heroin being laced with drugs like Fentanyl and carfentanil
EDL	00:52:54,399	00:52:59,007	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	But you can argue the rest that you knew was out there but yet you're using anyway
EDL	00:52:59,007	00:52:59,775	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	You should know better
EDL	00:53:00,287	00:53:06,687	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	But it's up to you it's like I don't know I don't know if loopholes the right word but it's like it's a way in which you can still as you said like your preclude
EDL	00:53:06,687	00:53:08,735	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Booted from bringing charges for possession
EDL	00:53:08,735	00:53:12,319	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Of drugs and paraphernalia but like there is a sort of side door be like well
EDL	00:53:12,831	00:53:14,111	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	We can charge you for this
EDL	00:53:14,111	00:53:15,647	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Now that's not the case at all
EDL	00:53:16,159	00:53:19,999	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	It's not like we're trying to say okay we don't like to get smeargle always go around it
EDL	00:53:19,999	00:53:22,303	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And that's not how I work that's not how we work
EDL	00:53:22,815	00:53:24,351	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	The thing I don't understand it seems like
EDL	00:53:25,375	00:53:29,215	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	The net effect of the Good Samaritan laws to sort of reduce fatalities and it seems like
EDL	00:53:32,031	00:53:34,847	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Rather successful in reducing fatality so you are
EDL	00:53:35,615	00:53:41,759	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Encouraging people to call nine-one-one you are reducing fatalities and in this case if they hadn't call 911
EDL	00:53:41,759	00:53:42,783	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Possible that the
EDL	00:53:43,295	00:53:45,087	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Ricky Mays the patient would have died so
EDL	00:53:45,855	00:53:51,231	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	In some ways I feel like I totally understand it I don't understand the reason behind it
EDL	00:53:51,743	00:53:54,303	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	But what I may think morally or personally
EDL	00:53:55,071	00:53:56,351	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I don't have that luxury
EDL	00:53:56,351	00:54:00,703	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I have a statute that I have to follow because when I took the oath of office it is it I will uphold
EDL	00:54:01,215	00:54:06,079	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	The laws of the Commonwealth and if it's a Crime After Crime I don't get to say well but they were trying to do the right thing
EDL	00:54:06,591	00:54:08,895	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Life is a crime it is a crime and I have to pursue it
EDL	00:54:10,175	00:54:13,247	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	We actually we talked to another prosecutor mauldin's case
EDL	00:54:13,759	00:54:14,783	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Kim hunt price
EDL	00:54:15,551	00:54:17,343	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Is the county attorney who indicted
EDL	00:54:17,343	00:54:20,671	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Ricky Scott and Jessica have people whose jobs
EDL	00:54:21,183	00:54:24,255	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Are to protect the public who have to be there
EDL	00:54:24,255	00:54:27,839	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	You know the message needs to go out there these people are protected
EDL	00:54:28,351	00:54:29,631	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	As well
EDL	00:54:30,399	00:54:30,911	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Pressure
EDL	00:54:31,423	00:54:37,311	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	People weren't calling you locally or there wasn't somebody from like the state
EDL	00:54:37,311	00:54:41,919	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Like no one calling from the state or anything like that I mean I just had my
EDL	00:54:41,919	00:54:44,223	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Local people you know that were
EDL	00:54:44,223	00:54:48,063	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Concerned about it and was it the people who were there we're calling you early
EDL	00:54:48,063	00:54:52,927	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I kind of think one of them did call me you know just say is there anything
EDL	00:54:52,927	00:54:58,303	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	We can do you know with regard to this is there an appropriate criminal charge
EDL	00:55:01,119	00:55:03,679	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Believe mr. Whiteman is so dead
EDL	00:55:04,191	00:55:05,215	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Okay so
EDL	00:55:05,215	00:55:06,751	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	My Tata Sky Whiteman
EDL	00:55:06,751	00:55:07,775	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	We asked him
EDL	00:55:07,775	00:55:09,311	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Essentially why was it
EDL	00:55:09,311	00:55:14,431	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Did he wanted to see these people charged our view it as a call for
EDL	00:55:14,431	00:55:15,455	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Accountability
EDL	00:55:15,455	00:55:16,735	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	They're doing heroin
EDL	00:55:16,735	00:55:19,039	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Will get out here we'll roll around in the yard for a week
EDL	00:55:19,551	00:55:20,831	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I have no issues with that
EDL	00:55:21,855	00:55:23,391	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	But when you do something
EDL	00:55:24,159	00:55:25,439	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	They could cause harm to me
EDL	00:55:26,207	00:55:27,743	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I've got a problem with that
EDL	00:55:28,511	00:55:29,791	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I think clay KY
EDL	00:55:30,303	00:55:31,839	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Understand that but
EDL	00:55:31,839	00:55:33,119	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Ultimately also feel like
EDL	00:55:35,679	00:55:37,215	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Did they truly didn't
EDL	00:55:37,215	00:55:42,335	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Know that like this is a drug that somebody could like brush up against or something like that and potentially
EDL	00:55:42,847	00:55:44,127	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Have reaction that there's
EDL	00:55:44,127	00:55:45,663	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Just not enough knowledge there for them to
EDL	00:55:46,687	00:55:47,199	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Have
EDL	00:55:47,711	00:55:52,063	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Even even even a sense of the fact that they could be endangering other people
EDL	00:55:53,599	00:55:55,647	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And then said he didn't know that you've been through this
EDL	00:55:55,647	00:55:58,975	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Experience with an accident I would kind of felt like on just surprised
EDL	00:55:59,999	00:56:00,511	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	That
EDL	00:56:01,279	00:56:02,303	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	That you
EDL	00:56:03,327	00:56:05,119	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	What it may be extended them
EDL	00:56:05,119	00:56:05,887	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I sort of Lake
EDL	00:56:06,655	00:56:08,447	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I'm no sympathy the right word but
EDL	00:56:08,447	00:56:09,471	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I think
EDL	00:56:09,471	00:56:11,519	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	That if you harm someone
EDL	00:56:12,543	00:56:13,823	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	You should be held accountable
EDL	00:56:15,359	00:56:19,199	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	If you guys know now that I'm going on vacation
EDL	00:56:21,503	00:56:22,527	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	September the

EDL	00:56:57,855	00:56:59,903	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Made to pay my respects to them
EDL	00:57:01,951	00:57:03,743	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And even though
EDL	00:57:04,255	00:57:06,559	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Here we are coming up on
EDL	00:57:07,583	00:57:09,375	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	19 years later
EDL	00:57:10,911	00:57:11,935	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Still do that
EDL	00:57:16,031	00:57:17,311	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Just my way of
EDL	00:57:17,311	00:57:18,591	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Dealing with it I guess
EDL	00:57:19,359	00:57:20,895	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	What are you doing that moment
EDL	00:57:20,895	00:57:22,175	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	When you're when you isolate
EDL	00:57:23,711	00:57:26,271	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	One of those that I reflect on that morning
EDL	00:57:26,783	00:57:31,135	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And I still try to figure out if there was anything that I could have done different
EDL	00:57:32,671	00:57:34,463	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	That may have changed the outcome
EDL	00:57:35,487	00:57:37,023	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	What I done
EDL	00:57:37,023	00:57:37,535	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	May 1st
EDL	00:57:40,095	00:57:44,703	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I still have nightmares I still wake up in cold sweats

EDL	00:57:52,127	00:57:53,407	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	So nicely I think there was a
EDL	00:57:55,199	00:57:57,247	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	There's a lawsuit filed by the family against
EDL	00:57:58,015	00:57:59,039	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Company
EDL	00:57:59,039	00:58:01,599	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	But then there was a civil suit that you had to go through
EDL	00:58:03,903	00:58:05,439	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Peter benchley bankrupted you
EDL	00:58:07,231	00:58:07,999	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And
EDL	00:58:07,999	00:58:09,023	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	What I'm wondering is Lake

EDL	00:58:25,663	00:58:28,735	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I took three members of that family away from them
EDL	00:58:30,015	00:58:31,551	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	That took potential
EDL	00:58:33,599	00:58:35,391	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Earnings wife in that family
EDL	00:58:39,999	00:58:42,047	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Birthdays and Christmases Miss

EDL	00:58:52,287	00:58:55,103	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I was held accountable for my actions of that morning
EDL	00:58:56,895	00:58:58,175	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And then
EDL	00:58:59,455	00:59:01,759	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	When you look at the
EDL	00:59:02,527	00:59:04,319	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Exposure case
EDL	00:59:06,367	00:59:07,903	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	She needs to be
EDL	00:59:08,415	00:59:12,255	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Accountable for those actions because he knew the risks that were involved
EDL	00:59:13,023	00:59:16,095	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Right just as I think like getting behind the wheel of a
EDL	00:59:16,095	00:59:16,863	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Truck
EDL	00:59:16,863	00:59:19,167	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	You know on September 16th 1989
EDL	00:59:19,679	00:59:20,447	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Thank you know that
EDL	00:59:20,959	00:59:22,495	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	There could be consequences
EDL	00:59:22,495	00:59:23,007	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	His butt
EDL	00:59:23,519	00:59:24,543	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	You never
EDL	00:59:24,543	00:59:26,335	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	If that's why it's an accident right it's like
EDL	00:59:27,359	00:59:29,663	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	The same thing if you'd taken like I don't know
EDL	00:59:29,663	00:59:30,175	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	2
EDL	00:59:30,943	00:59:33,247	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	2 mg less of the drug it's like
EDL	00:59:35,807	00:59:40,927	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I seem like really they seem like really similar situation the most and I guess I'm just wondering
EDL	00:59:41,951	00:59:42,719	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Like what
EDL	00:59:44,511	00:59:46,047	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Why is it hard to forgive him
EDL	00:59:49,887	00:59:51,167	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Don't say I didn't
EDL	00:59:51,167	00:59:51,935	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Forgiven for it
EDL	00:59:53,983	00:59:54,495	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	It's just
EDL	00:59:55,263	00:59:55,775	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I think
EDL	00:59:56,287	00:59:58,335	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	They should be held accountable for his actions
EDL	01:00:04,223	01:00:08,831	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I mean like all of that sort of like brings us to the the big question in the story
EDL	01:00:09,343	01:00:15,487	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	What happened that day because if we're going to hold Scotty hadn't accountable for what happened to Scotty Whiteman
EDL	01:00:15,487	01:00:21,887	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	You need to be able to show that that the drugs in the apartment or whatever was on Ricky skin
EDL	01:00:21,887	01:00:23,423	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Like could actually
EDL	01:00:24,447	01:00:25,983	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Caused him to overdose
EDL	01:00:25,983	01:00:26,751	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Would you have any
EDL	01:00:27,263	01:00:33,407	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Do you have any reason to doubt that the reason I found this story was it was reported as a credible
EDL	01:00:33,407	01:00:35,455	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Report in the New York Times
EDL	01:00:35,455	01:00:37,247	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Everybody sort of acknowledge that
EDL	01:00:37,759	01:00:41,599	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	No First Responders were going down all across the country
EDL	01:00:41,599	01:00:43,135	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	But when I
EDL	01:00:43,135	01:00:44,671	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Actor John Cole
EDL	01:00:45,183	01:00:46,975	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Toxicologist from earlier
EDL	01:00:46,975	01:00:48,255	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	He said well
EDL	01:00:48,255	01:00:51,071	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I don't doubt any of the symptoms that any of these
EDL	01:00:51,583	01:00:52,607	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Fire EMS
EDL	01:00:54,143	01:00:55,679	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Police officers have
EDL	01:00:55,679	01:00:56,447	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Experience
EDL	01:00:56,447	01:01:00,287	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	He was skeptical not 100% clear if that's
EDL	01:01:00,287	01:01:01,823	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Actually due to the
EDL	01:01:01,823	01:01:02,335	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Fentanyl
EDL	01:01:02,847	01:01:04,639	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Or to some other event that occurred in those
EDL	01:01:05,407	01:01:08,991	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And John Cole wasn't alone I mean I I started calling like
EDL	01:01:08,991	01:01:12,575	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Doctors in toxicologist pharmacologist
EDL	01:01:12,575	01:01:16,671	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And they said the like the risk that fence all posed to First Responders
EDL	01:01:16,671	01:01:18,207	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Was extremely low
EDL	01:01:18,207	01:01:24,607	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Why what was there which I think well for one I mean like that the powder doesn't spontaneously aerosol eyes it doesn't
EDL	01:01:24,607	01:01:28,191	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Don't like proof into the air so that makes like breathing it in
EDL	01:01:28,191	01:01:28,959	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Pretty unlikely
EDL	01:01:29,471	01:01:32,543	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	As far as the skin to skin contact thing
EDL	01:01:32,543	01:01:34,079	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	So poorly absorbed
EDL	01:01:34,079	01:01:39,455	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Feel like substance itself doesn't pass through the skin easily to get fentanyl to absorb through your skin
EDL	01:01:40,223	01:01:41,503	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	You have to use
EDL	01:01:42,015	01:01:48,415	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	A special Matrix to be able to know if you want to offend I'll pass you have to sort of use the solvent to get the absorption
EDL	01:01:48,415	01:01:49,951	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	To even be to the point where it's
EDL	01:01:50,463	01:01:51,231	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Therapeutic
EDL	01:01:51,999	01:01:53,023	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Let alone in Alberta
EDL	01:01:53,023	01:01:58,911	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Even if you put a fentanyl patch on it takes it takes a very long time for the drug to sort of like achieve a meaningful dose
EDL	01:01:58,911	01:01:59,679	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	In the body
EDL	01:01:59,679	01:02:02,751	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	But something is happening to these people I mean after
EDL	01:02:02,751	01:02:03,775	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Assume so
EDL	01:02:03,775	01:02:04,543	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	It's not the drugs
EDL	01:02:05,311	01:02:06,079	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	What is it
EDL	01:02:06,079	01:02:12,479	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	It says he has he I was John Cole and a couple of other people brought up with this idea that maybe it wasn't that
EDL	01:02:12,479	01:02:18,879	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	External situation that they're in there was more it was more something internal
EDL	01:02:18,879	01:02:19,647	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	One of these people
EDL	01:02:20,927	01:02:22,719	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Felt symptoms that are very real
EDL	01:02:23,231	01:02:24,255	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Vedanta the symptoms
EDL	01:02:24,767	01:02:28,095	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Don't don't really match the symptoms of a typical opiate overdose
EDL	01:02:28,095	01:02:28,607	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Princeton
EDL	01:02:29,119	01:02:30,143	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Hyperventilating
EDL	01:02:30,143	01:02:33,215	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I hope you answer usually beating slower not breathing faster
EDL	01:02:33,215	01:02:37,311	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Or a lot of First Responders reported feeling a sense of great
EDL	01:02:37,311	01:02:38,079	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Impending doom
EDL	01:02:38,079	01:02:40,383	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Opiates are all about Serenity and pleasure
EDL	01:02:40,383	01:02:41,663	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Not impending doom
EDL	01:02:41,663	01:02:48,063	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And so if you look at the symptoms and started the stories that are being told about these new substances in these new city
EDL	01:02:48,063	01:02:49,599	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Situation in our culture right now
EDL	01:02:50,111	01:02:50,879	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	He says
EDL	01:02:51,391	01:02:52,927	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Kind of looks like a mask
EDL	01:02:53,439	01:02:55,743	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	A mass panic so there is a condition
EDL	01:02:55,743	01:02:57,279	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Called Mass psychogenic illness
EDL	01:02:57,279	01:03:01,119	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	This is the thing that John Cole says that he's actually come across
EDL	01:03:01,119	01:03:03,679	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	In his work at the that the Minnesota poison
EDL	01:03:03,679	01:03:04,959	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	There was a
EDL	01:03:04,959	01:03:07,007	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	A school event in a bunch of
EDL	01:03:07,775	01:03:08,543	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	You said that about
EDL	01:03:09,311	01:03:11,615	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	45 years ago there was this incident
EDL	01:03:11,615	01:03:13,663	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Republic school in Minnesota
EDL	01:03:13,663	01:03:16,223	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	We're about your kids started like killing over cuz
EDL	01:03:16,991	01:03:18,015	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	They thought
EDL	01:03:18,015	01:03:19,807	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	It was like carbon monoxide poison
EDL	01:03:19,807	01:03:24,671	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Subsequent student after student begin to feel they took all these kids to the hospital and they live
EDL	01:03:25,183	01:03:27,231	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Give them blood test none of the blood levels
EDL	01:03:27,231	01:03:28,255	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Positive for carbonara
EDL	01:03:28,255	01:03:33,887	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I just didn't check out the medical conditions are are ruled out from unknown
EDL	01:03:33,887	01:03:34,911	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Poison
EDL	01:03:34,911	01:03:39,263	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	You have to start considering other causes and and that event was consistent with
EDL	01:03:39,263	01:03:41,311	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Actress condition called Mass psychogenic
EDL	01:03:41,311	01:03:46,687	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Illness when you think about you know First Responders showing up the scene of a drug overdose
EDL	01:03:47,455	01:03:50,015	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	What's running through their mind is this like
EDL	01:03:50,015	01:03:52,831	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Constant onslaught of news reports another
EDL	01:03:53,855	01:03:55,903	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Anecdotal accounts they've heard about their
EDL	01:03:56,415	01:03:58,719	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	They're their friends in their colleagues that are
EDL	01:03:58,719	01:04:03,327	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	No passing out it isn't it isn't that anybody's crazy or we gets that
EDL	01:04:03,839	01:04:05,631	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Their mind is
EDL	01:04:06,143	01:04:09,471	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Causing them to be physically ill they really are sick
EDL	01:04:09,983	01:04:12,543	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	But it isn't necessarily due to the thing
EDL	01:04:12,543	01:04:13,823	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	That they believe that it is
EDL	01:04:14,847	01:04:15,615	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Does that make sense
EDL	01:04:16,127	01:04:17,919	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	My response to that is
EDL	01:04:18,431	01:04:21,247	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	So what we knew what the scientist
EDL	01:04:21,247	01:04:24,063	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And then thing in Sky says basically like look
EDL	01:04:24,063	01:04:27,135	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	They can say whatever they want to in their lives but
EDL	01:04:27,135	01:04:28,927	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	This is what I went through I just know
EDL	01:04:30,207	01:04:31,487	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	The effects of that day
EDL	01:04:31,999	01:04:32,511	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	That
EDL	01:04:33,535	01:04:35,327	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I came in contact with something
EDL	01:04:35,839	01:04:38,399	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	That put me in an overdosing situation
EDL	01:04:51,455	01:04:54,527	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	An inmate at the Clark County Detention Center
EDL	01:04:54,527	01:04:55,551	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Kentucky

EDL	01:05:05,535	01:05:07,071	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Because the jails don't accept
EDL	01:05:07,071	01:05:09,887	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Letters cuz they're afraid of drugs getting in
EDL	01:05:09,887	01:05:13,215	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And a week later I got a call from Ricky Mays

EDL	01:05:19,359	01:05:20,895	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Biscotti white men treat it

EDL	01:07:18,911	01:07:21,471	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I'm about to have the same sort of like confidence and conviction
EDL	01:07:23,263	01:07:26,079	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I understand where you're coming from that's what my lawyer says to
EDL	01:07:28,383	01:07:31,711	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Think when a few things comes like you know
EDL	01:07:31,711	01:07:32,479	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Like
EDL	01:07:32,479	01:07:37,855	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	They may say well he did get sick while we're going to stay while he didn't test positive for anyting
EDL	01:07:38,367	01:07:39,647	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Could have been something else
EDL	01:07:40,415	01:07:42,719	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Every little bit of doubt that you created
EDL	01:07:42,719	01:07:43,487	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Reasonable Doubt
EDL	01:07:44,767	01:07:49,119	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And all you got to do is convince one person that Jerry is saying I'm not doing it
EDL	01:07:51,167	01:07:51,935	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	That's all you got to do
EDL	01:07:53,983	01:07:55,519	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Obviously the jury will be making
EDL	01:07:56,287	01:07:58,335	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	A decision about
EDL	01:07:58,335	01:07:58,847	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	The case
EDL	01:07:59,359	01:08:01,407	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	In about what happened in the apartment that day
EDL	01:08:01,919	01:08:02,431	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	But
EDL	01:08:02,943	01:08:06,783	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	I think there's sort of a bigger sort of more consequential
EDL	01:08:07,295	01:08:08,319	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Message
EDL	01:08:08,319	01:08:10,111	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	That they'll be sending about
EDL	01:08:10,111	01:08:12,671	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	What people like Scotty and Scotty
EDL	01:08:12,671	01:08:13,951	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Should believe in
EDL	01:08:13,951	01:08:14,975	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	What they should fear
EDL	01:08:15,487	01:08:16,511	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And
EDL	01:08:16,511	01:08:17,535	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	What they should do
EDL	01:08:18,047	01:08:18,559	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Going forward
EDL	01:08:19,071	01:08:21,375	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	50 charges end up getting dismissed
EDL	01:08:21,375	01:08:22,143	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	Or
EDL	01:08:23,679	01:08:25,471	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	If it goes to trial in and the
EDL	01:08:25,983	01:08:27,775	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	People are found not guilty for

EDL	01:08:44,415	01:08:50,047	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	If they're not found guilty then so bad if he goes out and use again

EDL	01:09:03,615	01:09:04,895	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And that's what I'm going to do
EDL	01:09:06,431	01:09:07,199	| radiolab_podcast19thegoodsamaritan |	And
