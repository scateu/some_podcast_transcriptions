EDL	00:01:19,872	00:01:24,224	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	I think we should start the story on June 25th 1969
EDL	00:01:24,224	00:01:25,504	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Urmc

EDL	00:01:28,832	00:01:30,368	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Why 220 when was it
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:32,416	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	June 25th 1969
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:38,048	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Supreme Court chief justice Earl Warren is retiring or a Warren of the Warren Court
EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:39,328	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Isn't that a big Court
EDL	00:01:39,840	00:01:44,960	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Yeah that's what I think of you think of legendary
EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:45,984	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Supreme Court judge
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:47,776	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Says he's probably in
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:48,544	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Top five
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:50,592	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	So he was one of the mount Olympians he's a big deal
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:55,456	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Right now he's retiring so he's retiring he's been on the court for 16 years
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:58,016	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And he's in an interview in his ass
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:02:04,160	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Would you list Master Chief Justice of the Supreme Court's most important decision you're 16 years here
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:09,024	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Is kind of astounding
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:13,376	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Not only of state legislatures by Porsche before you hear the answer
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:19,520	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	I think that you need to know that he could have said all kinds of cases he was the chief justice
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:21,056	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	During
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:23,104	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Miranda
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:29,504	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Remain silent
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:31,808	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Or Gideon versus Wainwright
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:32,576	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Beauty
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:36,160	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Harvey Specter
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:41,792	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Athens Big Bore Brown versus Board of Education
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:46,912	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Mad when I know that one
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:47,936	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	He doesn't say any of those
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:50,496	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	What is issei
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:54,080	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	He says this little case called
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:54,848	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Scarface
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:56,640	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Baker vs. Carr
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:00,480	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	The Batcave
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:03,552	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Is perhaps the most important case that who that
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:05,344	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Since I've been on the court
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:09,952	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	He thought that case whatever it is is more important than the case that desegregated the school
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:10,976	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	He did
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:13,024	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	So what the hell is it
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:13,792	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Exactly
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:15,584	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	No really what is it
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:19,936	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	It's this case that was so dramatic and so dramatic
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:21,472	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	But it apparently
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:22,752	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Broke to Justice
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:25,312	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	There was an instance in which
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:25,824	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	My
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:29,152	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Brother found my father going upstairs
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:29,664	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	To get a shotgun
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:38,880	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Supreme Court of the United States
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:52,960	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	United States
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:57,056	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	United States and this honorable Court
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:20,863	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Is this more perfect miniseries about the Supreme Court just a frame the story we're about to hear first
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:21,631	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Second
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:23,679	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	As we were putting the show together
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:26,239	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	We we hosted a panel discussion
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:31,615	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	A couple of us were on stage and a woman in the audience asked the following question
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:34,175	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Address what I see is the
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:39,295	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Increasing politicization of the Court the apotheosis of which I guess was
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:42,367	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	You know voting
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:45,695	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Electing Bush to be our
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:52,095	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	President always been this way is this just my perception that it's becoming more popular
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:56,191	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Size
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:05:00,287	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	I didn't know this until City started looking into it but there was a moment
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:02,847	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	When the Pandora's Box
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:03,615	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Just got ripped off
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:08,223	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	So I think they understand that moment and this story you have to get to know three care
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:15,391	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	These aren't necessarily the three most important justices of all time because of that time you had chief justice Earl
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:16,415	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Warren
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:19,231	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And William Brennan on the court in these are kind of giants
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:20,767	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Supreme Court judge
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:22,303	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	But for this story
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:23,327	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	These three guys are
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,119	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	One of them is on the right
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:26,143	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	One of them is on the left
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:29,215	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And one of them is just stuck right in the middle
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:31,007	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Tragically in the middle
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:35,615	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	On the conservative side
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:38,687	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Oliviana expression or action by the state
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:40,735	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	You had a guy named Felix Frankfurter
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:44,575	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Did Justice Frankfurter was one of the most sweetest name is really Frankfurter
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:45,599	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	One of the most
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:47,391	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Influential Justice
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:53,279	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Of all time I bet taragrove she teaches constitutional law at William and Mary Law School
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:55,583	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	A very influential scholar at Harvard Law
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:57,375	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	School before he became adjust
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:06:00,191	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	With a close adviser to Franklin Delano Roosevelt
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:02,239	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	He was extremely smart
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:03,263	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Towering figure
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:04,543	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	But as a person
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:06,079	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Justice
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:08,895	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Justice Frankfurter
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:11,967	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	He wasn't necessarily the nicest
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:12,735	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Person
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:13,759	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	I heard that from everyone else
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:16,319	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	I always call him a Bantam rooster
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:19,903	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	He was a difficult Krusty figure this short
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:21,695	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	A little bit of a pouch on
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:25,791	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Was one of the most
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:27,839	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	He was a tough cut
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:32,447	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	When a when a clerk would come to the u.s. Supreme Court Chambers to deliver a message
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:33,983	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	In the person of the door
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:37,055	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Tried to hand Justice Frankfurter the paper
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:39,871	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Frankfurter would inevitably Let It Drop to the ground
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:42,431	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	So the person had to bend down and
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:43,199	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Pick it up
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:44,223	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Two handed to him again

EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:41,343	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	The thing is crazy to me is it
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:44,159	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	He walked into the highest court in the land in
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:45,439	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	He didn't even go to college
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:47,999	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	I think it's important to understand
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:50,047	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	That he had no formal education real
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:53,119	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Another way she never took history

EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:01,823	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	He expected
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:03,103	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	The court to be
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:08,223	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	An arena in which there were Lively arguments on legal issues
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:11,295	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And that's what he enjoyed what
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:13,087	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	What's really good at
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:14,879	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	What what are you love

EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:19,487	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	His dad was kind of the walking embodiment of that thing that
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:22,047	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Chief Justice John Roberts said back in 2005
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:25,887	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	During his confirmation hearing for chairman I come before the committee with no agenda

EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:31,519	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And not the pitch
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:32,287	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Or bat
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:37,151	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	My father was not interested in advancing a cause or a
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:40,223	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Siri but frankly that's adjusted
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:47,135	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Should be that you are approaching it without a political agenda and that you're deciding it I think
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:48,415	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Exactly right
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:49,183	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	But
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:50,207	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	In practice
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:52,767	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	So many of their case
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:55,583	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	There is no law
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:58,911	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	To turn to to decide those cases
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:04,287	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Ken says that his dad quickly discovered that law that Supreme Court is never clean cut
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:08,383	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Cases make it there precisely because the lot isn't clear my name
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:09,151	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	These are just

EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:04,703	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Justice Whittaker was undecided all
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:07,775	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Douglas would tell him one thing
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:09,311	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	That seems right and then just

EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:43,327	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	123 Charles W Baker at Alcatel appellant versus Josie car
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:47,679	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Okay so it's April 19th 1961
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:54,079	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	The Supreme Court is hearing Baker vs. Carr

EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:10,719	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Not on the surface Baker vs. Carr was about districts and how people are counted in this country and this is why
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:17,119	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	One of the most basic ways that political power gets assigned in America
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:23,519	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	That growth should be reflected in the number of Congress people that are representing them but at that time in 10

EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:36,319	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Since 1901 which was 60 years earlier will this created big problems
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:40,671	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	For urban areas like Memphis because in those 60 years
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:47,071	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	People move to the cities in droves and rural areas were getting smaller and put the Tennessee State Legislature
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:52,191	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Had refused to update account and it was still giving more representation to those rural areas
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:55,007	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	In Tennessee
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:57,055	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	The figure was 23.

EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:03,199	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	This is very
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:05,759	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	You have one District that has
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:08,063	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	One person in it
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:09,343	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And you have another District
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:10,367	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Trick that has 23
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:14,463	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	The district that has one person gives all the power to the

EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:23,935	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	What are you think of it this way
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:27,007	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	At that time a person in the city in Tennessee
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:33,407	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Had one 23rd as much of a voice in the legislature as a person living in the countryside and
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:35,967	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Here's sort of the Insidious underbelly of that
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:40,319	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	It just so happened that the people living in the countryside or mostly White
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:43,903	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And a large percentage of the people living in the city were black
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:47,231	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Underlying all of the reapportionment litigation leasing South was
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:48,511	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	White supremacy
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:51,839	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	That's Doug Smith
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:55,935	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Historian in the author of on democracy's doorstep this is deeply tied to whites
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:59,775	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Supremacy in the maintenance of Jim Crow was a method of making sure that rural
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:03,359	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	A white legislators continue to control the power structure
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:10,783	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	So you had the situation he says we're a small minority was choking the majority
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:17,184	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Suburban areas from any sort of any sorts of funds cities couldn't get the money they needed for Rhodes education Social Services soda
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:21,536	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	The question at the Supreme Court was and they actually tackle this in two separate things
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:22,560	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	What should they do about
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:33,056	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And here's where you get to the ideological Smackdown liberals on the court like Douglas
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:39,200	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Basically agree with the plaintiff when they argue
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:58,400	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Liberals are like yeah this is clearly an injustice people in the cities are getting screwed
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:22:03,776	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Their voting rights have been diluted in the basement
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:07,104	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	But conservatives are like yes people are getting hurt
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:08,384	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	But we're not going to do anything
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:15,296	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	We can't Frankfurter
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:21,440	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Firstly said we cannot get involved that as bad as it says it was not an issue that the court should get involved in right now
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:34,496	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Unique situation
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:40,896	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	If we end up doing this in Tennessee pretty soon we'll be intervening in California South Carolina
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:47,296	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Will be rewriting entire us legislative map
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:48,064	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Tennessee
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:50,368	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	This is the United States not
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:52,416	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Yes so
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:56,256	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Basically he felt like this would force the courts to get involved in politics
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:23:00,608	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And he really believe that the court should never ever get involved in politics
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:06,496	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	This is a this is an idea that goes way back to something called
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:08,032	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Political question Doctrine
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:09,824	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	The political question Doctrine says
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:14,176	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	No federal court can decide this issue at all
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:16,480	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Quartz simply had no business
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:19,808	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Getting into what were considered to be fundamentally political
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:24,160	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Questions and what could be more fun in my life political than the makeup of the legislature it's a philosophy
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:30,560	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	To feed rooted in the notion that unelected lifetime judges should not be substitute
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:32,096	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Shooting their will
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:35,168	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	For the will of the people's elected representatives
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:42,080	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Frankfort like even if you have a terrible political situation if the justices stepped in and overruled the legislature
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:46,432	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	That would be worse than doing nothing at all because it would be fundamentally undemocratic
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:47,968	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	I'm he viewed
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:49,504	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	He view the political question Doctrine
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:53,344	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Is a crucial limitation on the Federal Judicial power
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:57,952	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And he wasn't alone the courts at follow this guideline for about a hundred and fifty years
EDL	00:23:58,464	00:24:02,560	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And even with the current case in Tennessee federal court that first heard the case
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:04,352	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Recognized
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:10,496	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	The situation actually referred to it as in evil
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:14,848	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	But this is the decision that this is a political question
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:19,712	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Malapportionment is a political question and only the political branches can handle this
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:20,992	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	They have no power
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:22,272	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Anything about
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:23,808	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Protecting and enforcing
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:25,088	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Voting rights
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:28,672	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	So
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:34,560	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	When the lawyer for Tennessee got up there
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:35,328	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Play jokes
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:41,728	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	He didn't try to defend her Tennessee was counting or not counting its people he basically said yeah what we're doing is bad
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:43,776	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	But it's nobody's job but hours to fix
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:45,824	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Is it worth
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:48,640	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	The legislature of Tennessee
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:50,176	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Not
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:50,944	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	The real Porsha
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:53,504	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Or is it
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:54,272	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Warriors
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:57,344	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Federal District Court
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:58,112	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Violate
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:07,584	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	He basically said if you step in you're going to screw up the balance of power in America the power
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:10,656	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	I want America comes from we the people not the courts
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:17,056	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	So this matter should be left up to the people of Tennessee and their elected representatives if the whole problem
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:18,592	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Is that you don't have a voice in The Ledges
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:20,640	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	So then how can you suddenly
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:21,664	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Have a voice
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:22,176	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	In legislature
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:27,296	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	I mean either way to change it would be SC legislature itself where to give up power and why would they do that
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:30,112	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Can of course once elected officials are in
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:30,880	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Power
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:32,160	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	They have a vested interest
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:35,744	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And keeping their districts exactly as they are because
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:38,816	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Those are the districts that elected them and fundamentally
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:44,448	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Electoral Representatives knew that if they redrew the lines and they would be
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:48,800	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Voting themselves out of political power

EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:59,808	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	So for the Liberals on the court they felt like this was a fundamental flaw in our democracy that needed to be fixed
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:02,112	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And nobody was going to fix it if they didn't fix
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:08,768	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Frankfurter he's like if you fix this one you're going to fix that one and that one and that one and that one and where's it going to stop
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:10,304	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	If you do this
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:17,216	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	There is no way out the Court's going to get stuck and what he called political Thicket

EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:26,592	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	When is the knot

EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:37,856	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Constitutional right there's a lot of thought that he might actually come down on the side of
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:40,672	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Of the plaintiffs medication I threw a Frankfurter really

EDL	00:27:58,080	00:28:01,408	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	From prior cases gesticulating wildly
EDL	00:28:01,408	00:28:04,736	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	To make his point and the whole time looking directly at Whitaker
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:10,880	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	There was one account that I heard where Frankfurter went on for 4 hours
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:17,792	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	4 hours really lecturing Whitaker really really belittling him
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:19,840	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Yes it was it was horribly intimidating
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:25,216	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	At one point one of the justices on the liberal side
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:25,984	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Justice Hugo Black
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:29,312	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	It took Whitaker side was trying to make
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:35,456	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Can feel better and black said to Charles Whitaker just remember we're all boys grown tall
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:40,064	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	We're not the gods who sit on high and dispense Justice
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:44,928	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	But it's very difficult not to see yourself in that role
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:50,304	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Particularly if your vote might be the vote that decides everything
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:52,608	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	This started weigh heavily on Whitaker's mind
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:29:00,800	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	He was disturbed by the by having the weight of Spring Court on his shoulders
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:07,200	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	According to his family Kate and Ken's my mother tells me that he
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:09,248	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	At that time was under a lot of
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:15,392	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Stress and spoke as though he were dictated spoke his punctuation
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:22,816	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Hello Judas, it's very nice to meet you could clearly thinking about everything that he
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:25,376	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Might say being recorded
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:26,400	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	I remember his
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:27,936	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Stating that he felt like
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:34,080	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	All the words that he ordered were being chiseled in stone as a result of Leaky Shed
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:35,360	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	You don't talk much
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:47,648	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	So after they heard the case the first time wudaokou couldn't make up his mind
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:51,488	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And actually incidentally there is another Justice Justice Stewart
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:54,048	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Who was the other Swing Vote in the case
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:55,840	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Who also couldn't make up his mind
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:59,680	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	The court decided to hear the case again in the fall
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:01,984	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Just because they needed more time
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:08,896	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And over the summer remain deeply divided that he actually
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:11,200	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Written memos on both sides of the issue
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:17,600	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Doug Smith says Whitaker wrote both and opinion for intervening and Baker vs. Carr and Addison tag in

EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:07,424	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Kept asking
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:09,216	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Like a
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:11,008	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Dog after a bone
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:12,800	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Trying to persuade him
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:14,080	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And that
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:16,384	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Harassing a guy. I have to make a point
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:19,712	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	It was a nightmare
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:21,504	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And I saw the night
EDL	00:32:25,088	00:32:25,856	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	How so
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:27,648	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Describe it to me well
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:28,672	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	He was
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:34,304	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	A nervous wreck and like
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:38,912	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Cat on a Hot Tin Roof I found out I don't know if he told me or his wife told me
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:40,448	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	He was on tranquilizers
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:42,240	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Overcome
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:44,544	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	What he thought was just work-related
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:46,336	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Stress will clearly
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:47,872	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Something was taking
EDL	00:32:47,872	00:32:48,640	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Hold of him
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:50,944	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Who had trouble concentrating
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:54,016	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Highway fraud I would characterize
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:56,064	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Here's eventual breakdown
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:58,368	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	It's something of a slow descent
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:04,000	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	By the early spring after the court had returned from
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:04,768	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Winter recess
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:08,352	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Whitaker was absent from the
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:08,864	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Court
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:14,752	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	You mean like he just didn't either getting chill for work one day
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:17,312	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Apparently so Splurge didn't know where he was
EDL	00:33:17,824	00:33:19,616	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	The other justices
EDL	00:33:19,616	00:33:20,384	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Didn't
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:21,664	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Know his whereabouts
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:22,944	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	He just
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:23,456	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Appeared
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:25,248	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Really in the middle
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:28,576	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Of what's going to become one of the
EDL	00:33:28,576	00:33:31,392	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Your Monumental decisions of the 20th century
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:32,928	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	He disappeared
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:35,232	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	She had to it
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:35,744	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Escape
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:37,536	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Where'd you go
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:38,560	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Well
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:42,400	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	He went to really what would be a cabin in the woods
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:44,448	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	In the middle of Wisconsin
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:50,592	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And he called up one of his former law says he's in Kansas City to come up and join him
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:52,384	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And according to Craig Smith
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:55,712	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	He in the sky whose name was Sam Milby
EDL	00:33:57,248	00:33:57,760	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	They would just
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:33:58,784	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Set there
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:01,088	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	On the bank of the lake
EDL	00:34:02,880	00:34:03,392	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	In silence
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:18,496	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	They would sit for hours on end not talking to each other
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:27,456	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Just waiting for the justice
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:27,968	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Speak
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:44,864	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	We have no way of knowing what he was thinking at that moment but
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:46,912	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	I imagine he was just
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:50,240	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Sitting there and he was thinking about these two realities that could unfold like
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:51,776	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	On the one hand
EDL	00:34:51,776	00:34:53,056	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	If a court stepped into politics
EDL	00:34:53,824	00:34:58,176	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	They can protect people
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:08,416	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	But on the other hand
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:11,488	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	President with the set
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:15,584	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Would it make the court too powerful
EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:18,656	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	How much case
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:20,192	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	W bush do to protect the people
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:26,080	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Imagines mine went back and forth and back and forth
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:32,480	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And when Whitaker decided he really had to get back to work than this
EDL	00:35:32,480	00:35:34,528	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Protege would say to him
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:37,856	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	No just relax
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:41,184	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Did you just take it easy and
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:44,000	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Get yourself together before you decide to go back
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:49,120	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	After 3 weeks
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:51,168	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Justice Whittaker returns to DC
EDL	00:35:51,168	00:35:51,680	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Back to worship
EDL	00:35:53,216	00:35:54,496	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	For a few days
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:56,544	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	But can't again his son
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:35:59,872	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	We found my father to be
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:01,920	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Really in extremis
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:06,784	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And debate and end I think I'm borderline suicidal
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:10,112	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	When you said that he was suicidal what do you mean
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:15,232	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	There was an instance in which my
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:18,560	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Brother found my father going upstairs to get a shotgun
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:27,776	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	A few days later
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:30,848	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Charles Whitaker checks himself into a hospital
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:31,616	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	There is
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:36,480	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Some evidence that it was really Justice Douglas Who convinced Whitaker
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:38,016	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Go to the hospital
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:45,952	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	That's Justice William Douglas again
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:50,816	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Hospital
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:26,656	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	A few weeks later March 29th 1962 the presidential press conference
EDL	00:37:26,656	00:37:28,448	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	From the new state department Auditorium
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:30,240	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Washington DC
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:32,032	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Several announcements to make
EDL	00:37:35,616	00:37:36,896	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	It is with extreme regret
EDL	00:37:37,664	00:37:40,224	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	That I announce the retirement of associate justices
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:40,992	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Supreme Court
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:42,784	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Charles Evans Whittaker
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:44,320	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Effective April 1st
EDL	00:37:45,088	00:37:46,368	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Justice Whittaker
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:48,672	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Remember the Supreme Court for nearly five years
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:51,232	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Have the federal judiciary
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:52,000	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Beignets
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:55,072	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Is retiring at the direction of his position
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:57,120	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Reasons of disability
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:37:59,680	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	I know that the bench in the bar
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:01,216	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Of the entire nation
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:04,288	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Join me in commending this to Justice Whitaker
EDL	00:38:05,056	00:38:06,592	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	First devoted service to his country
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:09,152	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	During a critical period and its history
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:14,784	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Text I want to take this opportunity to stress again the importance
EDL	00:38:14,784	00:38:16,832	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	The tax bill now before the House of Representatives
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:18,112	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Wow
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:21,184	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Whatever happened with the case with Bakery card
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:24,000	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Whitaker didn't vote on Baker vs. Carr
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:25,792	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	So you could say that this
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:26,816	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Case that
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:27,840	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Essentially broken
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:29,376	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	His vote didn't count
EDL	00:38:29,888	00:38:36,032	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Around the time that he was in the hospital they were sort of the liberal coup at the court where Frankfurter lost a couple of other
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:40,384	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	So in the end the decision actually wasn't very close at all
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:41,152	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	What was it
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:41,920	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	It was 6
EDL	00:38:41,920	00:38:43,200	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	2
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:50,368	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Brennan wrote the majority opinion and he says that this whole kind of cluster we've been fighting over of how
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:52,672	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	How States in Tennessee Count Their voters
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:55,488	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	But this is something the court can and should look at
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:38:58,048	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	So another words I decided to
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:38:59,840	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Lower their arms and go into the thicket
EDL	00:38:59,840	00:39:02,144	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Oh yeah they did
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:05,984	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And just one or two final questions of what happened to Justice Frankfurter
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:08,288	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	The thing that I find
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:09,312	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Crabs most extraordinary
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:14,176	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Is it less than two weeks after decision in Baker versus car came down
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:18,272	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Felix Frankfurter was working at his desk at the Supreme Court
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:19,040	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:20,832	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Frankfurter secretary found him
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:22,880	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Sprawled on the floor of his office
EDL	00:39:23,648	00:39:24,672	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	From a stroke
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:26,464	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	He suffered a massive stroke
EDL	00:39:26,976	00:39:28,768	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And the never return to service
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:32,864	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And while he was in the hospital solicitor-general Archibald
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:33,376	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Cox
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:34,912	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Visit a Frankfurter
EDL	00:39:35,680	00:39:36,704	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And Frankfurter
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:37,984	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	He was in a wheelchair
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:38,752	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	I could barely speak
EDL	00:39:39,520	00:39:40,032	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	But he

EDL	00:39:43,616	00:39:45,408	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	That the decision
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:47,456	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Baker vs. Carr had essentially caused
EDL	00:39:47,968	00:39:48,480	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Stroke
EDL	00:39:52,576	00:39:53,344	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	He felt
EDL	00:39:53,344	00:39:54,112	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	So passionate
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:39:55,904	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	The court should

EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:01,792	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	After the court
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:02,560	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Gone the other way
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:23,296	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	After Baker vs. Carr President Kennedy essentially had to Supreme Court vacancies to fill
EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:26,880	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Now Whitaker seat he filled with a guy who turned out to be a moderate
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:29,952	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Frankfurters vacancy that second vacancy
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:31,488	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	That vacancy
EDL	00:40:31,488	00:40:32,256	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	See
EDL	00:40:32,256	00:40:37,120	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	That will lead to the appointment of a man named Arthur Goldberg
EDL	00:40:38,144	00:40:40,192	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	That is the fifth vote
EDL	00:40:40,960	00:40:41,984	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	That
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:43,520	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	The four liberals
EDL	00:40:43,520	00:40:47,360	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	What are regarded as the four liberals that becomes the fifth vote that they need
EDL	00:40:47,872	00:40:52,736	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Really to create what has come to be regarded as the Warren Court Revolution
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:41:02,720	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	This is when the Supreme Court basically became an agent for social change
EDL	00:41:02,720	00:41:09,120	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Begins with a 1962 term that's the revolution that is going to change
EDL	00:41:09,120	00:41:15,520	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	One man one vote in a political boundaries
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:21,920	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Confession the way we think of Criminal Justice
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:28,320	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	The way we treat 1st Amendment religious and obscenity issues
EDL	00:41:28,320	00:41:30,624	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	That's the Warren court that people run
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:31,648	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Member
EDL	00:41:31,648	00:41:36,768	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And that's the court that came into existence when Felix Frankfurter left
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:45,472	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And so just thinking about that question that that woman asked all the way at the beginning of the story
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:46,240	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Could you
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:48,800	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Address what I see is the
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:51,360	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Increasing politicization
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:53,919	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Of the corriere papios is of which I guess was
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:41:56,991	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Yoona voting
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:41:59,807	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	OLX Ching Bush to be
EDL	00:42:00,319	00:42:01,855	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	President you can
EDL	00:42:01,855	00:42:05,695	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Kind of draw a line from this moment in Baker versus car
EDL	00:42:06,207	00:42:07,999	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	All the way to December 9th
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:08,511	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Mm
EDL	00:42:10,047	00:42:14,911	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	The polls in six new states have just closed and the lead story at this hour is
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:15,935	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	The state
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:17,727	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Florida is to
EDL	00:42:17,727	00:42:18,239	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Close
EDL	00:42:19,263	00:42:20,799	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	I think feel transported would have said
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:21,823	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	See
EDL	00:42:23,871	00:42:25,919	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	That's what I told you that's what would happen
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:29,759	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Is that eventually you will you will be deciding a

EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:32,063	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Which

EDL	00:42:33,855	00:42:35,903	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Essentially received the most

EDL	00:42:36,671	00:42:37,695	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	For those who
EDL	00:42:37,695	00:42:40,511	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Felt themselves on the losing side of bush V Gore
EDL	00:42:41,023	00:42:42,303	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	This was just
EDL	00:42:42,303	00:42:42,815	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Does frankfurters
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:48,447	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	This was the moment
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:49,471	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Bad Baker
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:50,495	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Car head
EDL	00:42:52,799	00:42:54,591	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	When I teach this to students
EDL	00:42:54,591	00:42:57,407	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And particularly in the decade.

EDL	00:43:03,295	00:43:03,807	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Still quite Raw
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:06,111	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	I would say to them well
EDL	00:43:06,623	00:43:07,647	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Is this
EDL	00:43:07,647	00:43:08,671	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Was Frankfurter right
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:12,255	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And I remember a student in the
EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:13,279	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Who said
EDL	00:43:13,791	00:43:15,839	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	In class I never thought I would
EDL	00:43:15,839	00:43:16,607	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	I would say this
EDL	00:43:16,607	00:43:17,375	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	But
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:19,167	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Because I hated the outcome and
EDL	00:43:19,167	00:43:19,935	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Bush V Gore I was
EDL	00:43:19,935	00:43:20,447	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	So angry
EDL	00:43:21,215	00:43:21,727	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Proceeded
EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:23,263	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	But if
EDL	00:43:23,775	00:43:24,799	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Bush V Gore
EDL	00:43:24,799	00:43:26,335	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	The price we have to pay
EDL	00:43:26,335	00:43:27,103	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	4
EDL	00:43:27,103	00:43:28,127	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	The courts make
EDL	00:43:28,127	00:43:28,639	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	In the overall
EDL	00:43:29,407	00:43:30,175	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	System
EDL	00:43:30,175	00:43:30,943	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Work
EDL	00:43:30,943	00:43:32,479	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Somewhat more tolerable
EDL	00:43:32,479	00:43:33,503	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Play properly
EDL	00:43:33,503	00:43:34,527	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	It's a price I'm willing
EDL	00:43:35,551	00:43:41,951	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	If we totally sign off what
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:48,351	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	The Douglas Weiser lost track of time so after Baker vs. Carr was decided he went on to be a Supreme Court Justice for
EDL	00:43:48,351	00:43:54,751	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	13 more years and to this day he actually holds the record for being the longest-serving justice of all time 30
EDL	00:43:54,751	00:44:01,151	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	Frankfurter so Baker vs. Carr was the last case that he ever heard
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:07,551	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	And he died a few years afterwards recover
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:13,951	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	After Whitaker retired from the court he moved back to Kansas City with his family and his son said that it took them about
EDL	00:44:13,951	00:44:20,351	| radiolab061016_moreperfect_episode2 |	About two years to get better from his nervous breakdown but he did get better and eventually he got a job as counsel
