EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:31,136	| radiolab051315 |	Give me a kind of valedictory interview
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:32,160	| radiolab051315 |	Pretty wonderful
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:34,208	| radiolab051315 |	We decided
EDL	00:01:34,208	00:01:35,488	| radiolab051315 |	How to do literally
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:37,280	| radiolab051315 |	I look at a heart
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:41,120	| radiolab051315 |	This comes to my producer Molly Webster it was scored live by
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:42,912	| radiolab051315 |	So percussion
EDL	00:01:42,912	00:01:49,312	| radiolab051315 |	Which is Eric Chou Beach Josh Quillen Jason treuting and Adam zielinski and some people in the audience in theater on inside a pretty
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:51,104	| radiolab051315 |	Be strong reaction to what you are about to hear
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:53,408	| radiolab051315 |	And we are not
EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:55,712	| radiolab051315 |	So sure that that may not also be the case if you
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:56,224	| radiolab051315 |	You just listening
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:02:02,112	| radiolab051315 |	So if you are driving or operating Machinery maybe this isn't the best piece to listen to cuz it can get a little
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:04,416	| radiolab051315 |	Intense which will talk about little bit afterwards
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:05,952	| radiolab051315 |	In the meantime here is
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:06,720	| radiolab051315 |	Producer Molly Webster
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:12,096	| radiolab051315 |	So this is a story about a friend's summer Ash we used to work together
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:13,888	| radiolab051315 |	And I think it's fair to say that
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:15,168	| radiolab051315 |	Summer has a
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:17,216	| radiolab051315 |	Complicated relationship with her heart
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:19,008	| radiolab051315 |	You know my heart was not beating
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:22,592	| radiolab051315 |	For 3 hours
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:25,920	| radiolab051315 |	This is a really crazy.
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:28,736	| radiolab051315 |	I was
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:30,272	| radiolab051315 |	Technically
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:32,320	| radiolab051315 |	Hart dead
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:33,344	| radiolab051315 |	I don't know
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:36,928	| radiolab051315 |	So couple of things to know about summer
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:37,696	| radiolab051315 |	She's like Wicked
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:39,488	| radiolab051315 |	Smart she's an astrophysicist
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:40,256	| radiolab051315 |	Cheese has a lot of Big Y
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:43,072	| radiolab051315 |	Propulsion center of gravity and moment of inertia
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:44,352	| radiolab051315 |	X and Y
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:47,168	| radiolab051315 |	Remember that original like radial keratotomy
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:48,448	| radiolab051315 |	Like no I don't even know what that
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:48,960	| radiolab051315 |	Where it is
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:52,800	| radiolab051315 |	The other thing to know is she's in
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:54,848	| radiolab051315 |	Engineer writes she loves like
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:55,616	| radiolab051315 |	Take things
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:56,128	| radiolab051315 |	Depart
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:57,664	| radiolab051315 |	You sort of like
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:02:58,688	| radiolab051315 |	Poke around
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:00,736	| radiolab051315 |	Rewire
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:02,528	| radiolab051315 |	Ratchet
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:07,904	| radiolab051315 |	And so the thing to know is when she found out she had to go
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:11,232	| radiolab051315 |	Get heart surgery she made sure there was someone in the operating room
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:12,000	| radiolab051315 |	With a camera
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:14,304	| radiolab051315 |	Of my open chest
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,608	| radiolab051315 |	And the valve
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:17,632	| radiolab051315 |	And when things were
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:21,472	| radiolab051315 |	Haircuts and when things are being sown in
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,264	| radiolab051315 |	Completely as a scientist
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:25,056	| radiolab051315 |	I want to know what's happening
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:29,408	| radiolab051315 |	I want to know why I want to know what you're doing I want to know what's going on around me
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:30,432	| radiolab051315 |	Start a backup in
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:30,944	| radiolab051315 |	Explain
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:32,736	| radiolab051315 |	Summer
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:33,504	| radiolab051315 |	Was just
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:35,808	| radiolab051315 |	The following up on like a heart diagnosis
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,088	| radiolab051315 |	Happened about
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:38,880	| radiolab051315 |	18 years earlier
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:41,696	| radiolab051315 |	And so she had been diagnosed with a murmur
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:42,208	| radiolab051315 |	Which is basically
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:43,744	| radiolab051315 |	Funny sound in ear
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:44,512	| radiolab051315 |	Your heart
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:46,816	| radiolab051315 |	And that's in between the thumb thumb
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:52,192	| radiolab051315 |	Dlanter this was just
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:52,704	| radiolab051315 |	The follow-up
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:54,240	| radiolab051315 |	Sure nothing
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:56,544	| radiolab051315 |	And so she goes to
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:57,568	| radiolab051315 |	Did the doctor
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:58,336	| radiolab051315 |	They run a few tests
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:00,640	| radiolab051315 |	They sent her on her way and
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:01,152	| radiolab051315 |	A few weeks later
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:02,176	| radiolab051315 |	It's an email
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:04,224	| radiolab051315 |	Don't panic
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:11,136	| radiolab051315 |	But I think you should see a heart surgeon
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:16,000	| radiolab051315 |	It turns out the situation with her
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:17,024	| radiolab051315 |	Carhartt hatching
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:19,327	| radiolab051315 |	Her aorta which is
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:20,095	| radiolab051315 |	Like the largest
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:21,375	| radiolab051315 |	Artery coming out of
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:22,399	| radiolab051315 |	Her heart it was
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:23,679	| radiolab051315 |	Larger than
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:24,447	| radiolab051315 |	Then it should have been
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:25,471	| radiolab051315 |	It's supposed to be about
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:27,519	| radiolab051315 |	2 cm in diameter and in summer
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:30,335	| radiolab051315 |	Yeah what does that mean for your body
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:31,615	| radiolab051315 |	So that's the thing
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:32,639	| radiolab051315 |	It's asymptomatic
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:35,455	| radiolab051315 |	It's not actively harming you but it's
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:37,759	| radiolab051315 |	Threat to your life
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:43,903	| radiolab051315 |	Because if it rupture it's your main blood vessel and if it goes
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:45,695	| radiolab051315 |	You bleed out internally so fast
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:53,119	| radiolab051315 |	No ER can help you her doctor says go find a heart surgeon and in the meantime
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:54,399	| radiolab051315 |	Are contact Sports
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,703	| radiolab051315 |	Summer is like a live in New York
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:05:03,871	| radiolab051315 |	Like living in New York is a contact sport people crashing you all the time
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:10,271	| radiolab051315 |	Six months later summer find yourself on the operating table they actually
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:14,111	| radiolab051315 |	I think I'm not sure the exact order of operations
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:20,255	| radiolab051315 |	But they open her sternum from the bottom all the way up to the top
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:20,767	| radiolab051315 |	And then they just said
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:25,631	| radiolab051315 |	You pull back a rib cage so they can get at her
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:27,423	| radiolab051315 |	They put some sort of
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:28,959	| radiolab051315 |	Fluid on it that
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:29,471	| radiolab051315 |	Stop that from
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:33,311	| radiolab051315 |	And they actually started just inject that fluid into the heart
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:34,591	| radiolab051315 |	And that short-circuits
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:36,383	| radiolab051315 |	So your heart actually
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:37,407	| radiolab051315 |	Stops
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:39,967	| radiolab051315 |	And then
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:40,991	| radiolab051315 |	A hook you up
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:41,759	| radiolab051315 |	2
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:42,527	| radiolab051315 |	A bypass
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:43,295	| radiolab051315 |	A heart-lung bypass
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:46,111	| radiolab051315 |	And one of the things that does is it
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:52,511	| radiolab051315 |	Drains the heart of all its blood so it's like flat like a pancake and you can see picture
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:58,911	| radiolab051315 |	Pictures of all of this on her blog you can even see pictures true you can even see pictures of
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:03,775	| radiolab051315 |	The surgeon cutting 4in out of her aorta and replacing it with
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:04,543	| radiolab051315 |	The synthetic to
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:08,383	| radiolab051315 |	And the entire time Summers heart is
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:08,895	| radiolab051315 |	Just Lim
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:10,687	| radiolab051315 |	In quiet
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:13,759	| radiolab051315 |	8 hours later
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:14,271	| radiolab051315 |	She wakes up
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:16,831	| radiolab051315 |	What do you remember
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:18,367	| radiolab051315 |	About your first conversation
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:19,135	| radiolab051315 |	With your doctors
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:22,207	| radiolab051315 |	Oh I don't remember my first conversation much
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:25,023	| radiolab051315 |	But I do vividly remember my first thought
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:26,303	| radiolab051315 |	Part of my friends
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:29,887	| radiolab051315 |	This
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:35,263	| radiolab051315 |	Just mind-altering
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:36,031	| radiolab051315 |	Pain
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:37,567	| radiolab051315 |	Oh my God 8 hours ago I felt
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:40,383	| radiolab051315 |	So much better than this can we just go back to that now like Joe
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:43,711	| radiolab051315 |	You know everything pulls on your torso
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:45,759	| radiolab051315 |	And so when your sternum pain
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:48,575	| radiolab051315 |	Cut open and then reconnected
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:53,951	| radiolab051315 |	Everything that pulls on that hurts you can't move anything
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:54,975	| radiolab051315 |	Or List anything
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,511	| radiolab051315 |	It hurt to talk
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:58,559	| radiolab051315 |	It even hurt to breathe
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:00,351	| radiolab051315 |	But literally from
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:01,119	| radiolab051315 |	Day one
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:02,911	| radiolab051315 |	They make you stand up
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:06,751	| radiolab051315 |	And start
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:07,519	| radiolab051315 |	Waukee
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:12,127	| radiolab051315 |	Really I was like she was like we're going to get you to send child
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:16,223	| radiolab051315 |	And that's just too
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:17,759	| radiolab051315 |	That's just too
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:19,807	| radiolab051315 |	Basically just got to get the heart going again
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:21,855	| radiolab051315 |	You know just get it healing
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:24,159	| radiolab051315 |	But here's the thing
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:25,951	| radiolab051315 |	When it came back
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:27,487	| radiolab051315 |	It came back
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:27,999	| radiolab051315 |	With a vengeance
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:34,911	| radiolab051315 |	3 Fairhill recovery went really well about 2 months in she's in car
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:37,215	| radiolab051315 |	Rehab the pain is fading
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:39,775	| radiolab051315 |	She's thinking about sending her mother home her mom at
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:41,055	| radiolab051315 |	Staying with her for a while
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:44,383	| radiolab051315 |	And then one day she's in cardiac rehab
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:45,151	| radiolab051315 |	On the elliptical
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:47,455	| radiolab051315 |	And so I remember stopping
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:49,247	| radiolab051315 |	And I had
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:51,551	| radiolab051315 |	This white T-shirt
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:52,575	| radiolab051315 |	That would
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:53,599	| radiolab051315 |	Literally
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:55,135	| radiolab051315 |	Fluttering
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:58,975	| radiolab051315 |	With my heart
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:02,559	| radiolab051315 |	Like it was blowing in high winds or something
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:05,887	| radiolab051315 |	You mean that
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:07,679	| radiolab051315 |	You could see it
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:11,007	| radiolab051315 |	Yeah even though the physical therapist there could see it
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:12,031	| radiolab051315 |	Will it rain
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:14,847	| radiolab051315 |	Give me give me like you would look down and you'll see the thing
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:16,383	| radiolab051315 |	Your heart beating
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,663	| radiolab051315 |	Through your chest wall
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:18,431	| radiolab051315 |	Pushing you
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:19,455	| radiolab051315 |	Shirt off
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:20,991	| radiolab051315 |	Well
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:21,759	| radiolab051315 |	Because I'm a lady
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:24,831	| radiolab051315 |	There is a gap here so like that
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:26,879	| radiolab051315 |	Sort of there's a space for that vibration
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:28,159	| radiolab051315 |	So to speak
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:33,279	| radiolab051315 |	But then she goes home and it was still half a
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:41,727	| radiolab051315 |	Like just sitting on a couch not even working out she's like woah my heart is strong it just fell
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:47,871	| radiolab051315 |	So strong that I heard of me was like as it seems like
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:52,735	| radiolab051315 |	So one day
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:55,807	| radiolab051315 |	A few months after surgery she goes to Upstate New York
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:59,903	| radiolab051315 |	He's visiting some family friends and she's hanging out with their daughter Julia
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:02,207	| radiolab051315 |	She walked in in
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:03,999	| radiolab051315 |	We're sending in
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:05,279	| radiolab051315 |	My room
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:06,303	| radiolab051315 |	They're just chatting
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:09,631	| radiolab051315 |	And it's suddenly Julia's eyes get really wide
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:13,727	| radiolab051315 |	Feeling there's a oh my God I just I just heard it
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:16,287	| radiolab051315 |	She could hear Summers heart
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,567	| radiolab051315 |	Out loud
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,335	| radiolab051315 |	2 feet away from
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:19,359	| radiolab051315 |	In the room
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:21,919	| radiolab051315 |	And I was like okay this is happening
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:24,735	| radiolab051315 |	So I guess in typical summer fashion
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:30,367	| radiolab051315 |	And she's kind of like let's engineer this if a friend of mine can hear it with her ear what could a studio pickup
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:32,159	| radiolab051315 |	She grabs a radio producer friend
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:34,463	| radiolab051315 |	Studio and he sticks
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:36,255	| radiolab051315 |	A mic about 6in
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:37,535	| radiolab051315 |	In front of her chest
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:39,327	| radiolab051315 |	And this is what they recorded
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:57,247	| radiolab051315 |	This is not a stethoscope this is what it's
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:10:03,647	| radiolab051315 |	Sounds like if you were standing a quiet room next to Summer God that's strong what does that feel
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:10,047	| radiolab051315 |	You like it just feels as if my entire rib cage
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:16,447	| radiolab051315 |	Age my clavicle my sternum my whole chest cavity is acting like an amp
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:22,847	| radiolab051315 |	It is sort of transmitting the vibrations of each heartbeat in fizz
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:29,247	| radiolab051315 |	Physically in my body to feel each heartbeat
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:35,647	| radiolab051315 |	It feels like somebody has a rubber mallet and it's banging on the inside of my sternum
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:39,999	| radiolab051315 |	It is very staccato
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:55,615	| radiolab051315 |	When she goes back to the doctor she's like dude my heart
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:11:00,735	| radiolab051315 |	So he sort of just did some like listening and some feeling haha you know what his reaction to was like
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:07,903	| radiolab051315 |	So we run some tests and he's like listen your blood pressure is fine
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:09,439	| radiolab051315 |	All of your stats are fine
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:10,207	| radiolab051315 |	So
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:16,607	| radiolab051315 |	I guess I did a really good job Yay good for you but okay I guess I have a strong heart
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:22,751	| radiolab051315 |	Yeah a strong heart but I don't want to feel this all the time the doctor was like what
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:27,871	| radiolab051315 |	Probably just that there is scar tissue on your sternum
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:30,431	| radiolab051315 |	And it's transmitting the vibration
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:31,967	| radiolab051315 |	And his back goes away the sea
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:34,271	| radiolab051315 |	Fade he said
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:35,807	| radiolab051315 |	Sometimes 6 to 9 months
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:37,087	| radiolab051315 |	This is when
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:38,367	| radiolab051315 |	Maybe the scar tissue
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:41,183	| radiolab051315 |	Heels more spins out
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:43,999	| radiolab051315 |	Does she's like all right so I can get to that
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:45,023	| radiolab051315 |	That's no problem
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:48,095	| radiolab051315 |	Sushi sorta just settled in and treated it like a sign
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:49,887	| radiolab051315 |	Lego party
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:52,191	| radiolab051315 |	If I went to
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:53,215	| radiolab051315 |	A restaurant
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:55,263	| radiolab051315 |	Where they had like tables for two
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:56,287	| radiolab051315 |	But they weren't like this
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:57,567	| radiolab051315 |	Sturdiest of tables
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:58,591	| radiolab051315 |	If we had water glass
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:11:59,615	| radiolab051315 |	Houses on them and I
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:00,383	| radiolab051315 |	Hive
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,407	| radiolab051315 |	Leaned on the table
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:03,455	| radiolab051315 |	Water glass
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:09,855	| radiolab051315 |	Looks like Jurassic Park like my heartbeat would be like the
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:12,159	| radiolab051315 |	Footsteps of the tired
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:14,975	| radiolab051315 |	Yeah so that was like my parties
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:18,047	| radiolab051315 |	If you had six months of elation party trick and then
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,839	| radiolab051315 |	Yeah and then it stopped being a party
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:21,631	| radiolab051315 |	Yeah
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:22,399	| radiolab051315 |	What happened
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:23,935	| radiolab051315 |	And I'm not really sure like
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:27,775	| radiolab051315 |	You know incident wise I think for me it was just time passing
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:32,895	| radiolab051315 |	Cuz that 9-month Mark
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:34,431	| radiolab051315 |	Just came and went
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:35,967	| radiolab051315 |	He was still there
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:39,807	| radiolab051315 |	And when she asks her doctor he has no idea why
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:41,087	| radiolab051315 |	12 months
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:43,391	| radiolab051315 |	Still there
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:46,463	| radiolab051315 |	15 months
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:47,999	| radiolab051315 |	Still there
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:53,631	| radiolab051315 |	And she says it just started getting really annoying distracting
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:56,703	| radiolab051315 |	The funny thing was the more active I was
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:59,007	| radiolab051315 |	Then the less aware of it I was
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:02,847	| radiolab051315 |	She says when she was at her office trying to be still be still
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:05,919	| radiolab051315 |	To either be writing something writing emails
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:07,455	| radiolab051315 |	Planning lectures
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:11,295	| radiolab051315 |	That's what it would be like
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:19,487	| radiolab051315 |	Really loud that's when it would become the most dominant thing like I couldn't go to
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:23,071	| radiolab051315 |	Work because it just kept drawing my focus
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:29,471	| radiolab051315 |	And when it did it would just feel her with anxiety it was sort of this like
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:35,871	| radiolab051315 |	Automatic response and I'll try and explain if it's basically like when you get scared it goes into your
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:42,271	| radiolab051315 |	Brain and then the signal goes down into your body do you step on a snake and your brain is like oh my God it's a state-run body
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:43,807	| radiolab051315 |	And then your heart
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:50,207	| radiolab051315 |	In summers case it was just the opposite there's no snake but her heart was pounding their brain
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:56,607	| radiolab051315 |	Would be like oh why is my heart pounding oh my God is there snakes there must be a snake run buddy run
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:57,631	| radiolab051315 |	Workout
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:14:02,239	| radiolab051315 |	My brain keeps thinking something must be wrong because we're having we're already doing this
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:08,639	| radiolab051315 |	So something must be wrong so I guess something's wrong so let's freak out she was caught in this feedback loop and then
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:15,039	| radiolab051315 |	And she was like rightly so edgy and Prime that any emotion on top of that like even if it was
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:21,183	| radiolab051315 |	Happiness is just too much oh my gosh it would keep me awake
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:27,327	| radiolab051315 |	I would get into hearing the Rhythm feeling the Rhythm
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:33,727	| radiolab051315 |	You sort of with the expectation of just next one
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:36,799	| radiolab051315 |	Fun
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:43,199	| radiolab051315 |	Fun fun
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:49,599	| radiolab051315 |	Next one next one next one next one
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:55,999	| radiolab051315 |	Next one next one next one
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:15:02,399	| radiolab051315 |	Next one next one next one
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:08,799	| radiolab051315 |	Next
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:15,199	| radiolab051315 |	With Every Beat our hearts are just literally tapping out time and
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:21,599	| radiolab051315 |	Actually thought about this and there was this idea that was proposed like a right before the dawn episode of Modern hearts
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:27,487	| radiolab051315 |	Surgery that we each get 1 billion beats In Our Lifetime and then that's it
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:33,887	| radiolab051315 |	And most of us don't notice them going by but in summers case you can't not notice it that I'm aware of it all
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:40,287	| radiolab051315 |	It's never not there it's never not noticeable
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:46,687	| radiolab051315 |	That beat and it's just like this constant awareness of the future that summer is
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:53,087	| radiolab051315 |	Endlessly meditating on my heart takes over and I can't do the things that I want to do and
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:59,487	| radiolab051315 |	Not knowing if that's going to last forever or if it's going to end suddenly or
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:04,607	| radiolab051315 |	Going to Peter out but not knowing gets me
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:07,167	| radiolab051315 |	So she stopped going out as much
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:13,055	| radiolab051315 |	She stopped returning phone calls except for like a few close group of friends the worst times we're just
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:16,383	| radiolab051315 |	Curled up in bed
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:17,919	| radiolab051315 |	And just
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:18,431	| radiolab051315 |	Is crying
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:19,967	| radiolab051315 |	I really want
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:21,503	| radiolab051315 |	Yell at my heart shut up
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:24,063	| radiolab051315 |	Stop would you really talk to her
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:25,855	| radiolab051315 |	Well I mean I've never had conversations
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:26,367	| radiolab051315 |	But I would be like
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:32,255	| radiolab051315 |	But it wouldn't
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:37,119	| radiolab051315 |	And as time went on
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:40,447	| radiolab051315 |	Like the constant pounding
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:46,847	| radiolab051315 |	Just became unbearable she describes it as like this alien creature
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:52,991	| radiolab051315 |	Is like trying to claw its way out the bottom of my neck
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:28,319	| radiolab051315 |	But there was this one moment
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:30,623	| radiolab051315 |	Right in the middle of all of this
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:33,695	| radiolab051315 |	She had her 2-year check up post-surgery
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:35,743	| radiolab051315 |	And for that they had to take up
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:36,511	| radiolab051315 |	A picture of her heart
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:38,303	| radiolab051315 |	So I schedule my
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:41,375	| radiolab051315 |	Two-year appointment and to look at heart they do and
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:44,959	| radiolab051315 |	Which is basically a you know like the ultrasound
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:46,239	| radiolab051315 |	Like that you got for the pregnant
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:50,335	| radiolab051315 |	Yeah it's like a little a little while and then you get the Jelly
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:53,151	| radiolab051315 |	We basically go all over
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:54,687	| radiolab051315 |	Your upper
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:56,735	| radiolab051315 |	You know the area around your heart
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:57,759	| radiolab051315 |	I from all different angles
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:01,087	| radiolab051315 |	So what ended up happening is I'm lying on my
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:03,647	| radiolab051315 |	Left side and I'm facing the wall in the
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:04,927	| radiolab051315 |	Technicians by me
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:08,511	| radiolab051315 |	And the technician is sort of like reaching around her waving the wand
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:09,791	| radiolab051315 |	Her heart
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:12,351	| radiolab051315 |	And the monitor for the echocardiogram is
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:14,399	| radiolab051315 |	Find summer so she can't see it but
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:14,911	| radiolab051315 |	She's wearing eyeglass
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:17,983	| radiolab051315 |	So you know how you can sometimes like see a reflection
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:20,799	| radiolab051315 |	Peripherally on glasses
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:21,823	| radiolab051315 |	Something behind you
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:25,919	| radiolab051315 |	Like if you were in a somewhat darker room there was a window like you totally Caesars
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:28,479	| radiolab051315 |	So the rooms a little bit darkened
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:30,271	| radiolab051315 |	Somers lying there on her side
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:32,831	| radiolab051315 |	And she sees the reflection of a
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:33,343	| radiolab051315 |	Screen
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:34,879	| radiolab051315 |	Oh my glasses
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:36,415	| radiolab051315 |	And it catches our eye because
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:37,183	| radiolab051315 |	If it's moving
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:38,975	| radiolab051315 |	Then I realize what it is that I'm
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:39,487	| radiolab051315 |	I'm seeing
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:42,815	| radiolab051315 |	A tiny reflection of her heartbeat
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:44,351	| radiolab051315 |	And I have this
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:45,375	| radiolab051315 |	Moment
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:48,703	| radiolab051315 |	I have this moment where I'm like
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:49,471	| radiolab051315 |	Oh my gosh
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:52,031	| radiolab051315 |	You're my talking to my heart in my head going
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:53,823	| radiolab051315 |	We had you're working hard
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:56,383	| radiolab051315 |	Like you're trying your hardest you're doing the best that you can
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:19:02,783	| radiolab051315 |	I'm doing the best that I can you're in there and you're working and you are working for me
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:04,831	| radiolab051315 |	We are on the same team
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:08,415	| radiolab051315 |	And I just totally like I just silently sir
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:08,927	| radiolab051315 |	Crying
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:16,863	| radiolab051315 |	What do you think
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:18,911	| radiolab051315 |	Bird that on like what was it about
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:19,935	| radiolab051315 |	Seeing it
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:24,543	| radiolab051315 |	There's just something about physically seeing it
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:25,055	| radiolab051315 |	Pump
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:30,687	| radiolab051315 |	And but feeling it at the same time like knowing that I'm seeing what's happening inside me
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:32,479	| radiolab051315 |	That somehow just like
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:36,575	| radiolab051315 |	Flicked this understanding into place
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:43,231	| radiolab051315 |	She said there was something about seeing it in real-time like a feeling this thing in her chest
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:48,607	| radiolab051315 |	Just pulsing in rhythm with what was happening on the screen and then suddenly just
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:55,007	| radiolab051315 |	It didn't seem separate from her anymore and all those worries about the future and what was going to happen and was
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:58,591	| radiolab051315 |	Going to go away. Stopped no
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:00,895	| radiolab051315 |	You are just beating
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:02,687	| radiolab051315 |	And that thing is me
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:04,479	| radiolab051315 |	It was sort of a sort of like this moment of
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:06,527	| radiolab051315 |	Of recognition of its
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:09,087	| radiolab051315 |	Purpose and its work and
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:10,623	| radiolab051315 |	And sort of this
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:18,559	| radiolab051315 |	It's kind of like that whole idea of when you feel like you see somebody
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:21,631	| radiolab051315 |	Not just physically like you see who they are
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:23,423	| radiolab051315 |	You see what they are but you see who they are
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:25,471	| radiolab051315 |	You had that like I felt like ice
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:26,239	| radiolab051315 |	CU heart
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:27,775	| radiolab051315 |	Like I said
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:29,055	| radiolab051315 |	See what you're doing
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:31,103	| radiolab051315 |	See what your purpose is
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:37,503	| radiolab051315 |	I see you on the one hand what she sees like with her
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:43,903	| radiolab051315 |	Engineers brain Izzo
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:50,303	| radiolab051315 |	Realization that eventually led to modern medicine right like the minute we took the soul out of the heart
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:56,703	| radiolab051315 |	Touch it to cut it open a stitch it up to start fixing things and now we have life spans if I some s
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:21:03,103	| radiolab051315 |	Estimates are 2.5 billion beats on the other hand
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:08,991	| radiolab051315 |	When you hear someone's heartbeat your parents or your child
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:15,903	| radiolab051315 |	Is an entire lifetime it's a it's a history of Beats it's a series of
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:22,304	| radiolab051315 |	Beats yet to come and thinking about
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:28,192	| radiolab051315 |	Summer asked us if we wanted to try and listen to her
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:33,312	| radiolab051315 |	Can we try that just see if you want to just move the microwave
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:34,080	| radiolab051315 |	I'll Stand Up
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:36,384	| radiolab051315 |	So she stood up from her chair
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:37,664	| radiolab051315 |	How to put a chest
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:40,736	| radiolab051315 |	Right in front of the mic and then we all do
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:41,504	| radiolab051315 |	Just got really quiet
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:45,344	| radiolab051315 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:05,568	| radiolab051315 |	Oh my god wow it just makes me really emotional everytime I hear it it makes my eyes well with
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:08,640	| radiolab051315 |	It's really amazing
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:11,456	| radiolab051315 |	Guess I still got it
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:16,832	| radiolab051315 |	Good job
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:18,880	| radiolab051315 |	Hugo
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:28,864	| radiolab051315 |	So give it up for Radiolab producer Molly Webster
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:35,264	| radiolab051315 |	And giving up your self protection
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:40,640	| radiolab051315 |	That one we said earlier that a lot of people in the audience had strong reactions
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:47,040	| radiolab051315 |	You're so I don't know if you could do the same but like when we were doing that story I should definitely seem like something's going on out there
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:53,440	| radiolab051315 |	Cuz we were on state I couldn't answer their 20 something going on in the oven is something going on stage but I didn't really know
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:54,976	| radiolab051315 |	It was we were in the middle of it
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:56,000	| radiolab051315 |	Walk off stage
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:58,560	| radiolab051315 |	And the first thing we hear is that
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:03,680	| radiolab051315 |	Numerous people had fainted even vomited during that piece we were like
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:04,192	| radiolab051315 |	What
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:09,824	| radiolab051315 |	Seriously I did not see it coming we really really scared
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:16,736	| radiolab051315 |	And I thought oh my God I might get my killing people like it was just like
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:23,136	| radiolab051315 |	Are they old
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:24,928	| radiolab051315 |	Maybe I can handle it
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:26,976	| radiolab051315 |	I just was and then I kind of
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:31,072	| radiolab051315 |	Weirdly mortified terrified but if we figured out that no one was hurt
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:32,864	| radiolab051315 |	We were like we got
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:33,376	| radiolab051315 |	We're like
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:36,960	| radiolab051315 |	Would you start putting out my start making some calls to me like what
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:43,616	| radiolab051315 |	We make it that I didn't know you thought you was a show is over and we all go home days after
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:47,968	| radiolab051315 |	Listen to podcast
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:52,320	| radiolab051315 |	The damn thing right with the Swift understand this in the I sound that is completely right
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:55,136	| radiolab051315 |	The first person we called was a psychiatrist
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:56,416	| radiolab051315 |	Rachel Yehuda
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:24:02,560	| radiolab051315 |	Mount Sinai School of Medicine Department of psychiatry
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:04,096	| radiolab051315 |	How was he born
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:07,424	| radiolab051315 |	Mitre have any 5 or 6 people out of 2200
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:09,472	| radiolab051315 |	Somewhere between 5
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:10,496	| radiolab051315 |	And
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:11,776	| radiolab051315 |	12
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:17,152	| radiolab051315 |	We don't have a clear number just yet. What might have caused this
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:18,688	| radiolab051315 |	Just like a guess
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:25,088	| radiolab051315 |	So my best guess about that would be that they have activated their parasympathetic nerves
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:25,600	| radiolab051315 |	System
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:28,416	| radiolab051315 |	In response to hearing the heartbeat
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:34,816	| radiolab051315 |	You just explain our autonomic nervous system is divided into a bunch of different parts you've got your sympathetic nervous system disorder
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:36,096	| radiolab051315 |	Fireflight right
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:37,376	| radiolab051315 |	Sweat turns on when you're
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:40,704	| radiolab051315 |	Scared then you got your parasympathetic nervous system which
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:42,496	| radiolab051315 |	Is sort of the opposite
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:44,800	| radiolab051315 |	Rather than getting you ready to fight or run
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:46,336	| radiolab051315 |	It makes you calm
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:50,176	| radiolab051315 |	Dr. Yehuda says it in certain people that parasympathetic response
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:55,040	| radiolab051315 |	Kenexa kind of go overboard and their blood pressure can drop
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:56,320	| radiolab051315 |	Quickly too quickly
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:59,136	| radiolab051315 |	And they end up painting the most common
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:02,976	| radiolab051315 |	Give me a list for this to happen in
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:05,024	| radiolab051315 |	In real life is
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:07,328	| radiolab051315 |	Fainting at the sight of blood
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:09,120	| radiolab051315 |	Some people just do that and it's
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:11,424	| radiolab051315 |	Not that comment about you
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:13,216	| radiolab051315 |	4% of the population
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:14,752	| radiolab051315 |	Have is kind of a
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:19,872	| radiolab051315 |	And we don't exactly know why it happens there is
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:23,712	| radiolab051315 |	Summit Canyon de TI Dia of fainting when you see blood
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:26,784	| radiolab051315 |	Is it an Adaptive evolutionary response
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:33,184	| radiolab051315 |	That you know maybe back in the day when we were being chased by Predators it would have been a good idea to faint or dead
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:34,464	| radiolab051315 |	Nahel skip you
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:38,816	| radiolab051315 |	He wants live meet and you're dead meat to eat that
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:39,584	| radiolab051315 |	I already.
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:40,608	| radiolab051315 |	Another
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:43,168	| radiolab051315 |	A theory is an alternate evolutionary what is it
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:48,544	| radiolab051315 |	If your blood pressure drops like it does when you faint that kind of protects you a little bit because
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:51,360	| radiolab051315 |	You'll have less blood in your arms and legs
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:57,760	| radiolab051315 |	So if your arms legs get bitten by a lion say then you're less likely to bleed out
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:25:59,552	| radiolab051315 |	There's nothing juicy to suck on
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:01,088	| radiolab051315 |	If your blood is I'm not in your
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:02,368	| radiolab051315 |	Winger your limb
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:04,928	| radiolab051315 |	Yeah who knows these are just stories but
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:08,512	| radiolab051315 |	Going back to the two or 4% thing we got to thinking
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:11,584	| radiolab051315 |	2 to 4% of our audience at night
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:12,864	| radiolab051315 |	Would be
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:17,472	| radiolab051315 |	What we decide Molly was it would be 44 to 88
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:21,568	| radiolab051315 |	44 288c 2200
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:24,896	| radiolab051315 |	So we put out some emails look at the incident reports
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:27,456	| radiolab051315 |	And I think now we have identified
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:31,808	| radiolab051315 |	I need us we've heard of maybe 10 or 11
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:33,600	| radiolab051315 |	1011 it but I think
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:38,976	| radiolab051315 |	It based on some of the stories are coming in that the number might actually be much higher
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:45,376	| radiolab051315 |	Example it just manifested itself physically in a way that I
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:46,912	| radiolab051315 |	Could not have imagined
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:48,192	| radiolab051315 |	I would be the case
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:49,728	| radiolab051315 |	This is Maria chaveco
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:52,800	| radiolab051315 |	Actually works down the street from us
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:55,616	| radiolab051315 |	For the company that makes Latino USA
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:57,408	| radiolab051315 |	I was sitting in the front
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:27:00,480	| radiolab051315 |	Against one of the walls but not right at the wall
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:04,832	| radiolab051315 |	She says she was listening to the story everything was fine at first but then
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:07,392	| radiolab051315 |	She does as the beat kept going
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:08,416	| radiolab051315 |	She began to worry
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:13,280	| radiolab051315 |	What if it never stops what if someone never gets away from it
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:15,328	| radiolab051315 |	And then the drama and got more intense and it was
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:17,120	| radiolab051315 |	Pono
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:21,984	| radiolab051315 |	Oh no and it was definitely the sense of being trapped that the thing that was giving her life
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:26,336	| radiolab051315 |	Which was absolutely necessary was also the thing that was
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:27,872	| radiolab051315 |	Tormenting
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:29,920	| radiolab051315 |	She says that she was thinking about that
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:31,456	| radiolab051315 |	She just kind of got
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:31,968	| radiolab051315 |	Short of breath
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:35,040	| radiolab051315 |	I looked at my husband
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:36,576	| radiolab051315 |	Put my hands up like
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:38,368	| radiolab051315 |	Like I got to go
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:41,184	| radiolab051315 |	And he looked me he was like are you are right and I was like
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:42,208	| radiolab051315 |	I shook my head
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:44,512	| radiolab051315 |	And
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:47,584	| radiolab051315 |	And I and then I had to talk in my brain like okay
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:49,632	| radiolab051315 |	This is an intimate radio moment
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:53,216	| radiolab051315 |	You are right in the front area if you get up
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:57,568	| radiolab051315 |	6 people have to get up with you what are you doing you're ruining this for everybody
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:58,592	| radiolab051315 |	Just Breathe
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:28:03,712	| radiolab051315 |	And it'll be fine and then the deeper I tried to breathe the more anxious I sort of got
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:07,040	| radiolab051315 |	And I have this fantasy of like
EDL	00:28:07,552	00:28:12,416	| radiolab051315 |	Standing up and doing like a ruler
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:14,208	| radiolab051315 |	But I was like that's
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:17,536	| radiolab051315 |	Suck it up
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:18,560	| radiolab051315 |	And so
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:25,472	| radiolab051315 |	I thought I'm having trouble breathing just thinking about it I don't put no no no no I'm fine I'm fine
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:27,008	| radiolab051315 |	That's what my hunches
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:29,056	| radiolab051315 |	There might be a lot more than 10 because
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:31,360	| radiolab051315 |	Maybe a lot of people just pushed
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:32,896	| radiolab051315 |	Through and didn't get up at 6
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:38,016	| radiolab051315 |	Still felt weird case one of the most interesting things we bumped into is that doctor you told us it's
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:38,528	| radiolab051315 |	It's very pause
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:43,392	| radiolab051315 |	At the fainting in the woods penis
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:44,416	| radiolab051315 |	Really
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:45,952	| radiolab051315 |	In what sense
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:46,720	| radiolab051315 |	Well
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:48,512	| radiolab051315 |	If you hear somebody's heart
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:49,280	| radiolab051315 |	Beading
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:55,424	| radiolab051315 |	And you're aware that that's what you're hearing it might arouse of tremendous connection within you
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:28:59,520	| radiolab051315 |	Of hearing the very source of their life
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:00,544	| radiolab051315 |	Yeah I became her
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:04,384	| radiolab051315 |	I did I just I was there with her and
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:10,272	| radiolab051315 |	Will it be a lot to take in and you feel a little faint or emotional I just identified
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:12,576	| radiolab051315 |	So much with somebody being
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:16,160	| radiolab051315 |	Trapped in their own body I thought she couldn't escape
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:18,208	| radiolab051315 |	It was beating in my chest
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:22,304	| radiolab051315 |	The drums I felt were beating in my chest and in my
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:29,472	| radiolab051315 |	Crazy fantasy you know maybe they were beating at the same Rhythm one of the people that you emailed after the live show said that
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:31,776	| radiolab051315 |	He felt like his
EDL	00:29:31,776	00:29:32,544	| radiolab051315 |	Heart was
EDL	00:29:32,544	00:29:34,080	| radiolab051315 |	Trying to match her beat
EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:38,944	| radiolab051315 |	And he couldn't catch his breath I don't know I haven't I don't know it's never happened to me before
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:44,832	| radiolab051315 |	Highest Indian if you ever want to hear someone's heart beat again and she said oh yeah
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:47,904	| radiolab051315 |	In fact she said she's going to listen to the story as soon as it was podcast
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:49,184	| radiolab051315 |	Which is now
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:51,744	| radiolab051315 |	Is that she's got all these questions like what
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:53,280	| radiolab051315 |	The Acoustics of the space
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:54,048	| radiolab051315 |	What's fact
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:56,096	| radiolab051315 |	Issues with so many people or

EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:35,424	| radiolab051315 |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons

EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:36,256	| radiolab051315 |	Tonight
EDL	00:33:36,256	00:33:37,280	| radiolab051315 |	Are you Galaxy
EDL	00:33:38,816	00:33:39,584	| radiolab051315 |	Cuz he's one of our family
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:44,960	| radiolab051315 |	So as I've done for decades now I went over his house in Manhattan with my Mike and I sent
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:47,776	| radiolab051315 |	I just need to know what just
EDL	00:33:48,800	00:33:51,104	| radiolab051315 |	A month-and-a-half ago you were fine
EDL	00:33:52,128	00:33:52,640	| radiolab051315 |	And then
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:33:57,504	| radiolab051315 |	I see beginning of the year I was fine
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:34:01,344	| radiolab051315 |	On the 3rd of January I feel Sandoval queer
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:04,160	| radiolab051315 |	And I tossed some dark urine
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:07,232	| radiolab051315 |	I thought I said little girl bladder attack
EDL	00:34:09,024	00:34:10,816	| radiolab051315 |	Didn't pay that much attention
EDL	00:34:11,328	00:34:13,120	| radiolab051315 |	But thought I better get things checked
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:14,656	| radiolab051315 |	And then
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:16,704	| radiolab051315 |	Vxrail
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:20,032	| radiolab051315 |	Is expected only to show a couple of gallstones
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:21,824	| radiolab051315 |	Chode
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:23,360	| radiolab051315 |	FAFSA
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:24,896	| radiolab051315 |	And my liver
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:28,736	| radiolab051315 |	Alumadock
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:31,040	| radiolab051315 |	How to say he didn't know what his will and I would
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:31,808	| radiolab051315 |	Need further tests
EDL	00:34:32,576	00:34:33,344	| radiolab051315 |	I
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:34,112	| radiolab051315 |	I knew what they were
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:35,648	| radiolab051315 |	I said it's
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:40,512	| radiolab051315 |	He's right the doctors eventually confirmed
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:44,864	| radiolab051315 |	A cancer that has been found in his eye 9 years ago had spread to his liver
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:46,144	| radiolab051315 |	Were you
EDL	00:34:47,936	00:34:48,704	| radiolab051315 |	Peyton
EDL	00:34:48,704	00:34:49,216	| radiolab051315 |	Or
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:52,288	| radiolab051315 |	Relieve orcas
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:53,312	| radiolab051315 |	Sore
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:54,848	| radiolab051315 |	But you know I am
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:58,688	| radiolab051315 |	I think my first feeling was one of
EDL	00:34:59,200	00:35:00,224	| radiolab051315 |	Overwhelming sad
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:04,064	| radiolab051315 |	They're also
EDL	00:35:04,064	00:35:04,832	| radiolab051315 |	Strings
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:05,856	| radiolab051315 |	I will see
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:08,160	| radiolab051315 |	And I will do
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:10,720	| radiolab051315 |	One or two people listen to me in
EDL	00:35:10,720	00:35:13,792	| radiolab051315 |	Consoling me
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:16,608	| radiolab051315 |	But f*** it it's not like we all die
EDL	00:35:17,120	00:35:18,400	| radiolab051315 |	It's like you have four months
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:25,824	| radiolab051315 |	Has that has your property is your prognosis at this moment cuz I know you had an
EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:31,968	| radiolab051315 |	Well if it gets revised it depends of course on how is the cancer response to treatment sand
EDL	00:35:31,968	00:35:33,248	| radiolab051315 |	Or how quickly it spreads
EDL	00:35:34,016	00:35:34,784	| radiolab051315 |	This is so far
EDL	00:35:36,064	00:35:39,648	| radiolab051315 |	The metastasis from my eye only in my liver
EDL	00:35:40,160	00:35:41,696	| radiolab051315 |	I told they love live
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:48,352	| radiolab051315 |	I love liver as well and I'm one of the magical things I did was going to have liver and onions
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:52,192	| radiolab051315 |	Sudoku
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:55,520	| radiolab051315 |	I'm thinking bad liver looks better than mine far away
EDL	00:35:55,520	00:36:01,920	| radiolab051315 |	This is what he's like instead of being frightened by the thing is trying to kill him he's thinking about loving liver and liver lovers
EDL	00:36:01,920	00:36:04,992	| radiolab051315 |	Looking for connections and one really doesn't stop
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:07,040	| radiolab051315 |	He just notices it case in point
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:10,624	| radiolab051315 |	A few months ago his doctor said to him We're going to run out a line
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:17,024	| radiolab051315 |	Up your liver and ineffective going to straight shave off or start some of the cancer cells first on one side than the other
EDL	00:36:17,024	00:36:18,304	| radiolab051315 |	Go to see if I can give you a little more time
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:19,840	| radiolab051315 |	But they warned him
EDL	00:36:19,840	00:36:21,632	| radiolab051315 |	How's the metastasis
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:22,144	| radiolab051315 |	Guy
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:25,216	| radiolab051315 |	They put on farias contestant Kevin
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:27,776	| radiolab051315 |	Send me exhaust you text your system badly
EDL	00:36:29,312	00:36:31,616	| radiolab051315 |	At one point shortly after the procedure
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:33,920	| radiolab051315 |	I started talking a little strangely
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:37,504	| radiolab051315 |	And I'm as I was talking I was inviting
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:41,600	| radiolab051315 |	You'll be the first person to see this
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:45,696	| radiolab051315 |	So he showed me a notebook where song it
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:46,464	| radiolab051315 |	To you
EDL	00:36:46,464	00:36:48,512	| radiolab051315 |	In just a moment you can see this sort of
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:53,632	| radiolab051315 |	Writing there on the left it's all he's writing a book actually children's book about the elementary table
EDL	00:36:54,144	00:36:57,728	| radiolab051315 |	But as he was writing if you if you look to the next page
EDL	00:36:57,728	00:36:59,520	| radiolab051315 |	If you can see that it gets a little bit
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:02,336	| radiolab051315 |	Wobbly the letters and then
EDL	00:37:03,104	00:37:04,384	| radiolab051315 |	And then there was some
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:05,920	| radiolab051315 |	Crossing out there
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:08,736	| radiolab051315 |	Yes I see them then why the dramatic lie
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:09,760	| radiolab051315 |	The Whiting
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:10,272	| radiolab051315 |	Change it
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:12,832	| radiolab051315 |	It actually scares a large
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:17,440	| radiolab051315 |	Slash across it and then you get seems a little incoherent at the palace
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:20,512	| radiolab051315 |	Okay pure
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:23,072	| radiolab051315 |	Atlanta's delirium
EDL	00:37:23,840	00:37:24,864	| radiolab051315 |	Krypton made
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:29,984	| radiolab051315 |	All this happened to the course of 10 minutes
EDL	00:37:29,984	00:37:34,592	| radiolab051315 |	I'm writing at a constant speed I know pretty much how fast I write
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:40,992	| radiolab051315 |	And so I can time this out I can figure out exactly how long it took me to slip into delirium out of
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:46,112	| radiolab051315 |	Of this delirium
EDL	00:37:46,112	00:37:47,392	| radiolab051315 |	Animal Medical West
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:49,440	| radiolab051315 |	I think this was a lovely illustration
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:52,768	| radiolab051315 |	How to put in a timeline of delirium
EDL	00:37:53,792	00:37:56,608	| radiolab051315 |	Coming like that
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:58,400	| radiolab051315 |	Unusual
EDL	00:37:58,400	00:38:04,800	| radiolab051315 |	You don't seem too worried at all when things become incoherent
EDL	00:38:04,800	00:38:08,128	| radiolab051315 |	You're not showing it to me as if interested
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:10,688	| radiolab051315 |	I was crazy here for a little bit
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:16,064	| radiolab051315 |	The truth is Oliver is fascinated by what goes on in the human mind no matter how strange he gets up there
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:22,464	| radiolab051315 |	I went time when he was a young resident in California driving his bike and by the way I I should show you what he look like
EDL	00:38:22,464	00:38:23,232	| radiolab051315 |	Take back then when he was
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:25,536	| radiolab051315 |	Driving his bike is I think it's him
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:26,304	| radiolab051315 |	In New York
EDL	00:38:27,072	00:38:27,840	| radiolab051315 |	Kind of
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:30,656	| radiolab051315 |	You know
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:35,264	| radiolab051315 |	In the sixties he was also a champion weightlifter they called him doctor Squad
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:38,080	| radiolab051315 |	And in this picture that you show you here
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:39,616	| radiolab051315 |	That's him raising six
EDL	00:38:39,616	00:38:40,640	| radiolab051315 |	100 lb
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:47,552	| radiolab051315 |	In order to win a trophy like this is that he was a champ and and you can see more pictures like these that cuz we have signed copy
EDL	00:38:47,552	00:38:50,112	| radiolab051315 |	Copies of Oliver's Newman we're out for sale in the lobby
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:51,648	| radiolab051315 |	Pretty good book too by the way
EDL	00:38:51,648	00:38:53,952	| radiolab051315 |	In any case at this time
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:57,024	| radiolab051315 |	The 1960s in addition to being
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:39:01,376	| radiolab051315 |	Muscled out however was a serious recreational drug taker
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:06,752	| radiolab051315 |	And because he's Oliver he was extremely curious about his high as no matter how weird they were
EDL	00:39:06,752	00:39:08,032	| radiolab051315 |	1 time for example you took
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:10,336	| radiolab051315 |	20 pills that he shouldn't have
EDL	00:39:10,848	00:39:13,408	| radiolab051315 |	And then to my surprise
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:16,992	| radiolab051315 |	How does a spider on the wall
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:18,784	| radiolab051315 |	Set hello
EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:21,344	| radiolab051315 |	Have a voice like that she's also
EDL	00:39:21,856	00:39:24,160	| radiolab051315 |	Famous mathematician
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:28,512	| radiolab051315 |	It cost me a wild a technical question as to whether Russell had exploded
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:30,304	| radiolab051315 |	Frege's paradox
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:32,608	| radiolab051315 |	And we had this
EDL	00:39:33,120	00:39:39,520	| radiolab051315 |	Conversation
EDL	00:39:39,520	00:39:41,312	| radiolab051315 |	Cuz you you trust your perception
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:45,920	| radiolab051315 |	Okay many years later when I mentioned this to an entomologist
EDL	00:39:45,920	00:39:46,944	| radiolab051315 |	Cornell
EDL	00:39:47,968	00:39:49,248	| radiolab051315 |	Philosophical spider
EDL	00:39:50,784	00:39:51,296	| radiolab051315 |	Inotes
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:58,464	| radiolab051315 |	Taking it all in talking spiders whatever
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:40:04,864	| radiolab051315 |	The generosity of his curiosity becomes profoundly moving and transformative when he's tree
EDL	00:40:04,864	00:40:08,960	| radiolab051315 |	Treating his patients I want to tell onestar here really quickly do to demonstrate what I mean
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:12,544	| radiolab051315 |	I never once had a patient when he called mrs. OC
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:15,104	| radiolab051315 |	She was
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:18,688	| radiolab051315 |	An old woman she was 88 years old living in a nursing home
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:22,272	| radiolab051315 |	And one night she was awake and Jarred awake by a loud
EDL	00:40:23,296	00:40:24,064	| radiolab051315 |	I wish
EDL	00:40:28,160	00:40:32,000	| radiolab051315 |	It was a song
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:35,328	| radiolab051315 |	And she thought about somebody left the radio on but when she looked
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:37,376	| radiolab051315 |	3D when the room is on your roommate
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:41,984	| radiolab051315 |	Soundasleep which was odd because the song was really loud
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:46,080	| radiolab051315 |	The doors after that
EDL	00:40:46,080	00:40:47,104	| radiolab051315 |	There's another song
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:50,944	| radiolab051315 |	And then another song
EDL	00:40:53,504	00:40:59,904	| radiolab051315 |	Which Associates may be my roommate can't hear the songs because the songs are are coming to the fillings in my teeth I've heard that spot
EDL	00:40:59,904	00:41:04,768	| radiolab051315 |	But no her doctor told her this is something in your head you need to see
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:05,536	| radiolab051315 |	A neurologist
EDL	00:41:06,048	00:41:07,328	| radiolab051315 |	Which led her to dr. Sachs
EDL	00:41:09,888	00:41:16,288	| radiolab051315 |	That when he met mrs. OC he she could barely hear him the song sung by the female boys were coming and coming she was
EDL	00:41:16,288	00:41:21,408	| radiolab051315 |	Frightened and justifiably worried that she was going crazy but Oliver said no no I'm going to do some tests
EDL	00:41:21,408	00:41:22,432	| radiolab051315 |	And when he was done
EDL	00:41:22,432	00:41:28,832	| radiolab051315 |	He said he found a slight stroke or condition that triggered musical epilepsy 87 production of music
EDL	00:41:28,832	00:41:29,344	| radiolab051315 |	Picking her brain
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:36,000	| radiolab051315 |	Normal doctor might say okay we got the diagnosis and he thought that the songs would probably faint it will pass are they worth
EDL	00:41:37,024	00:41:38,304	| radiolab051315 |	But Oliver did not stop
EDL	00:41:39,072	00:41:39,840	| radiolab051315 |	He doesn't stop
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:44,448	| radiolab051315 |	He kept talking to her
EDL	00:41:44,960	00:41:51,360	| radiolab051315 |	She told him she was born in Ireland in the 1890s her father died before she was born her mother when she was
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:55,711	| radiolab051315 |	Only five she was sent to America
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:41:58,015	| radiolab051315 |	For the Love of beading
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:41:58,783	| radiolab051315 |	Make a note
EDL	00:41:59,295	00:42:02,111	| radiolab051315 |	She had no conscious memory
EDL	00:42:02,111	00:42:03,647	| radiolab051315 |	The first five years of her life
EDL	00:42:04,159	00:42:06,463	| radiolab051315 |	New memories
EDL	00:42:10,303	00:42:10,815	| radiolab051315 |	It's black
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:16,959	| radiolab051315 |	We asked her about the songs
EDL	00:42:17,983	00:42:18,751	| radiolab051315 |	What are they like
EDL	00:42:18,751	00:42:21,823	| radiolab051315 |	MS Associated well I think they're lullabies
EDL	00:42:21,823	00:42:23,103	| radiolab051315 |	Can you sing them for me
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:23,615	| radiolab051315 |	She did
EDL	00:42:24,127	00:42:29,247	| radiolab051315 |	And then after checking them not sure who I'll ever figured out that these songs what happened to be popular
EDL	00:42:29,759	00:42:30,783	| radiolab051315 |	Irish ballads
EDL	00:42:30,783	00:42:33,855	| radiolab051315 |	From the 1890s where mrs. OC was a little baby
EDL	00:42:33,855	00:42:34,879	| radiolab051315 |	And I gave him an idea
EDL	00:42:35,391	00:42:37,183	| radiolab051315 |	What he does next isn't science
EDL	00:42:37,695	00:42:40,255	| radiolab051315 |	It isn't in any traditional way medicine
EDL	00:42:40,255	00:42:42,047	| radiolab051315 |	He just told her the story
EDL	00:42:42,047	00:42:42,559	| radiolab051315 |	And it goes like
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:47,423	| radiolab051315 |	You don't have nobody remembers anything that happens to you when you're one or two or three
EDL	00:42:47,935	00:42:52,799	| radiolab051315 |	Well there was a theory wants not honored much today but it's sad that those earliest memories
EDL	00:42:52,799	00:42:55,615	| radiolab051315 |	Get locked away deep in our brains in a special safe
EDL	00:42:56,127	00:42:57,151	| radiolab051315 |	The weekend never open
EDL	00:42:57,663	00:42:59,455	| radiolab051315 |	So let's suppose mrs. OC
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:02,015	| radiolab051315 |	But you are struck by some crazy chance
EDL	00:43:02,527	00:43:04,575	| radiolab051315 |	Open the lock that none of us can break
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:07,135	| radiolab051315 |	And release those first memories
EDL	00:43:07,135	00:43:07,903	| radiolab051315 |	In you
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:08,927	| radiolab051315 |	Just for a little while
EDL	00:43:09,951	00:43:11,999	| radiolab051315 |	Show that The Voice you're listening to
EDL	00:43:11,999	00:43:13,279	| radiolab051315 |	The homeboy
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:18,655	| radiolab051315 |	Maybe that is in the radio boy
EDL	00:43:19,679	00:43:20,447	| radiolab051315 |	Let's play
EDL	00:43:20,959	00:43:21,983	| radiolab051315 |	It's your mother's voice
EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:23,775	| radiolab051315 |	Pets your missing mother
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:28,639	| radiolab051315 |	Until with the ripe old age of 88 you finally get to be back in your mother's arms
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:30,431	| radiolab051315 |	You get to be a baby again
EDL	00:43:30,431	00:43:31,967	| radiolab051315 |	Images of the Seas thought about that
EDL	00:43:33,503	00:43:35,039	| radiolab051315 |	Okay it's
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:35,807	| radiolab051315 |	Sort of fit
EDL	00:43:36,319	00:43:37,343	| radiolab051315 |	I'm an old woman
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:40,159	| radiolab051315 |	Old people's home
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:43,231	| radiolab051315 |	But I feel I'm a child in Ireland
EDL	00:43:43,743	00:43:45,535	| radiolab051315 |	I feel my mother's arms I see
EDL	00:43:46,047	00:43:47,071	| radiolab051315 |	Ikea voicing
EDL	00:43:49,119	00:43:50,143	| radiolab051315 |	United
EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:51,935	| radiolab051315 |	Clinton's wrong
EDL	00:43:55,775	00:43:59,615	| radiolab051315 |	Shortly thereafter the songs began to fade the pauses widen
EDL	00:43:59,615	00:44:02,687	| radiolab051315 |	Mrs. OC he's been so frightened by this music in her head was now
EDL	00:44:03,199	00:44:04,735	| radiolab051315 |	Sorry to see the songs go
EDL	00:44:05,503	00:44:06,783	| radiolab051315 |	But it was Oliver
EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:08,831	| radiolab051315 |	Who noticed how those songs that touched her
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:12,927	| radiolab051315 |	Who noticed that the songs might become a comfort to her because that's what he does
EDL	00:44:13,439	00:44:14,463	| radiolab051315 |	He listens closely
EDL	00:44:14,975	00:44:16,511	| radiolab051315 |	He can hear another person's heart
EDL	00:44:17,279	00:44:18,559	| radiolab051315 |	And this is really the
EDL	00:44:18,559	00:44:19,839	| radiolab051315 |	Profound puzzles for me
EDL	00:44:20,607	00:44:21,119	| radiolab051315 |	About Oliver
EDL	00:44:21,631	00:44:27,263	| radiolab051315 |	Because reading the new what a biography you see that while he was so full of heart as a doctor in his own life
EDL	00:44:27,263	00:44:29,567	| radiolab051315 |	In relationships the really matter
EDL	00:44:29,567	00:44:31,615	| radiolab051315 |	It turns out he didn't get a whole lot of affection
EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:35,711	| radiolab051315 |	He was for a long time a lonely guy I'd say he was
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:36,479	| radiolab051315 |	Very lonely
EDL	00:44:37,247	00:44:39,295	| radiolab051315 |	And he's talking about that now for the first time
EDL	00:44:41,087	00:44:42,367	| radiolab051315 |	Let me talk about love for a minute
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:47,743	| radiolab051315 |	In this book you tell the story of your of your very first love
EDL	00:44:47,743	00:44:49,279	| radiolab051315 |	A fella by the name of Richard

EDL	00:44:58,495	00:44:59,007	| radiolab051315 |	A poet
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:00,799	| radiolab051315 |	Unhandsome
EDL	00:45:01,311	00:45:02,079	| radiolab051315 |	Beautiful
EDL	00:45:02,079	00:45:02,847	| radiolab051315 |	Beyond belief
EDL	00:45:03,359	00:45:04,127	| radiolab051315 |	Anais
EDL	00:45:04,895	00:45:05,919	| radiolab051315 |	Fell for him
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:08,735	| radiolab051315 |	Although I didn't
EDL	00:45:08,735	00:45:10,015	| radiolab051315 |	Say anything
EDL	00:45:10,015	00:45:11,295	| radiolab051315 |	Because I was some
EDL	00:45:12,831	00:45:14,623	| radiolab051315 |	Very haunted by my mother
EDL	00:45:15,391	00:45:16,671	| radiolab051315 |	Accusations
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:18,207	| radiolab051315 |	What is your mother

EDL	00:45:25,887	00:45:27,167	| radiolab051315 |	And I saw the Father song
EDL	00:45:27,679	00:45:28,447	| radiolab051315 |	Conversation
EDL	00:45:28,959	00:45:29,727	| radiolab051315 |	Any setup
EDL	00:45:30,239	00:45:31,775	| radiolab051315 |	You don't seem to have many girlfriends
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:33,567	| radiolab051315 |	And I said
EDL	00:45:34,335	00:45:34,847	| radiolab051315 |	No
EDL	00:45:35,359	00:45:37,151	| radiolab051315 |	Wishing the conversation would stop
EDL	00:45:38,175	00:45:39,455	| radiolab051315 |	He said I'm

EDL	00:45:48,159	00:45:49,439	| radiolab051315 |	I said I've never done nothing

EDL	00:45:52,255	00:45:53,791	| radiolab051315 |	I knew that then
EDL	00:45:53,791	00:45:54,559	| radiolab051315 |	I knew that
EDL	00:45:57,119	00:45:57,887	| radiolab051315 |	Probably since I was 12
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:00,703	| radiolab051315 |	And I said
EDL	00:46:00,703	00:46:01,727	| radiolab051315 |	Don't tell Mama
EDL	00:46:02,239	00:46:03,263	| radiolab051315 |	She will be able to take
EDL	00:46:04,799	00:46:06,079	| radiolab051315 |	But my
EDL	00:46:06,079	00:46:07,103	| radiolab051315 |	Father
EDL	00:46:07,103	00:46:08,639	| radiolab051315 |	Did tell my mother in the night
EDL	00:46:09,151	00:46:11,967	| radiolab051315 |	And the next morning she came down with him
EDL	00:46:12,735	00:46:14,783	| radiolab051315 |	I somehow want to say that face of Comber
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:16,831	| radiolab051315 |	Enraged me
EDL	00:46:17,343	00:46:19,135	| radiolab051315 |	And my other thing said
EDL	00:46:19,135	00:46:20,671	| radiolab051315 |	Joanne abomination
EDL	00:46:20,671	00:46:21,951	| radiolab051315 |	I wish you would never been born
EDL	00:46:22,719	00:46:24,511	| radiolab051315 |	And then she has something to shut up
EDL	00:46:25,279	00:46:27,071	| radiolab051315 |	And said nothing for 3 days
EDL	00:46:28,095	00:46:29,119	| radiolab051315 |	And
EDL	00:46:32,703	00:46:34,751	| radiolab051315 |	The match was never mentioned the game and highlights
EDL	00:46:36,543	00:46:37,823	| radiolab051315 |	Anthem
EDL	00:46:37,823	00:46:39,615	| radiolab051315 |	2 years later I found myself
EDL	00:46:39,615	00:46:40,639	| radiolab051315 |	The first time in my life
EDL	00:46:41,151	00:46:42,175	| radiolab051315 |	Falling in Love
EDL	00:46:42,175	00:46:44,223	| radiolab051315 |	This was the gun guy Richard
EDL	00:46:44,223	00:46:45,759	| radiolab051315 |	Holler at the time was in college
EDL	00:46:46,271	00:46:50,367	| radiolab051315 |	It was a very positive feeling why didn't know whether it was one which I did Express
EDL	00:46:50,879	00:46:51,647	| radiolab051315 |	But I did
EDL	00:46:52,159	00:46:53,695	| radiolab051315 |	Say so with my heart my mouth
EDL	00:46:59,839	00:47:01,375	| radiolab051315 |	And Richard
EDL	00:47:01,375	00:47:03,935	| radiolab051315 |	Clipped me by the shoulders and he said I know
EDL	00:47:04,447	00:47:06,495	| radiolab051315 |	He said but I'm not that way
EDL	00:47:07,007	00:47:08,543	| radiolab051315 |	But I love you in my own way
EDL	00:47:09,055	00:47:10,335	| radiolab051315 |	And
EDL	00:47:10,335	00:47:15,711	| radiolab051315 |	I was glad I have said that imply versus being received in such a warm February
EDL	00:47:15,711	00:47:17,759	| radiolab051315 |	I thought you might be friends for the rest of our
EDL	00:47:17,759	00:47:18,271	| radiolab051315 |	Lives
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:22,879	| radiolab051315 |	But then one day he came into me since he didn't bother by finding
EDL	00:47:22,879	00:47:23,647	| radiolab051315 |	Alarm
EDL	00:47:23,647	00:47:25,951	| radiolab051315 |	In his groin and he was worried
EDL	00:47:26,719	00:47:27,487	| radiolab051315 |	Could I have a look at it
EDL	00:47:28,511	00:47:30,815	| radiolab051315 |	And I looked at it and I felt it
EDL	00:47:31,583	00:47:33,375	| radiolab051315 |	And it was hard and tethered
EDL	00:47:34,399	00:47:35,679	| radiolab051315 |	I turned out to be a
EDL	00:47:36,191	00:47:37,215	| radiolab051315 |	Tiki malignant
EDL	00:47:37,983	00:47:39,775	| radiolab051315 |	Form of lymphedema

EDL	00:47:42,079	00:47:43,103	| radiolab051315 |	Anthem
EDL	00:47:43,615	00:47:45,919	| radiolab051315 |	He never spoke to me again often
EDL	00:47:46,431	00:47:47,455	| radiolab051315 |	I don't know whether
EDL	00:47:47,455	00:47:50,015	| radiolab051315 |	Since I gained the first to recognize the ominous
EDL	00:47:50,015	00:47:50,527	| radiolab051315 |	Import
EDL	00:47:52,319	00:47:53,599	| radiolab051315 |	Harbinger of death
EDL	00:47:53,599	00:47:54,623	| radiolab051315 |	Messenger of death
EDL	00:47:55,135	00:47:55,903	| radiolab051315 |	Whatever
EDL	00:47:55,903	00:47:57,695	| radiolab051315 |	But you you were left with the
