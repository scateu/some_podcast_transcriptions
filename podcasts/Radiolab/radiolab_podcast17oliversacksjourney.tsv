EDL	00:00:31,744	00:00:34,048	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Hearing a mind kind of formulate a thought
EDL	00:00:34,560	00:00:35,584	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	It wasn't there

EDL	00:00:45,312	00:00:51,712	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	So today a little bit of departure a couple of months ago I got connected to a guy named
EDL	00:00:51,712	00:00:58,112	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Bill Hayes mutual friends or put us in touch. A really good book actually about Anatomy music
EDL	00:00:58,112	00:00:59,648	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	If I give it to my son really
EDL	00:00:59,648	00:01:00,416	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Yeah
EDL	00:01:00,416	00:01:06,304	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	He is a writer and a photographer and I was the partner of the Late Oliver Sacks
EDL	00:01:06,304	00:01:08,096	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	And together we made
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:12,192	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Tapes or recordings of conversations in the last year of his life
EDL	00:01:12,704	00:01:18,336	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Now Oliver Sacks one of the great great writers of Science and masterful
EDL	00:01:18,336	00:01:22,176	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Masterful writer Radiolab of grown up with him
EDL	00:01:22,688	00:01:27,808	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	That ended his style of combining sort of clinical scientific observation with
EDL	00:01:28,832	00:01:30,880	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Deep Humanity in poetry
EDL	00:01:31,648	00:01:38,048	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	I feel like we're always trying to walk in his footsteps in some way
EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:42,144	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Many many times that his voice will be familiar to a lot of you but what you hear
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:43,424	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	On these tapes
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:45,984	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Is an altogether different portrait
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:50,592	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	And why why did you start these recordings
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:53,664	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Oliver got his diagnosis of terminal
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:57,248	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Cancer in mid January 2015
EDL	00:01:57,248	00:02:00,320	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	He had had cancer about nine years earlier dealt with it
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:01,856	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	But it was back
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:05,696	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	It's spreading to his body the prognosis was 6 to 18 months
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:08,768	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	And thought it was shattering
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:15,168	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Shortly after bill says they were sitting at the kitchen table talking
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:19,520	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Things on his mind that he wanted to write I said well what do you what do you thinking about writing this is about
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:24,128	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	4 days after he got his diagnosis and he paused
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:26,432	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	And then he looked at me and he said
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:27,968	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Something like
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:30,784	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	A month ago I felt that I was in good health
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:31,808	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Even robots Dallas
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:34,880	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	881 I still swim a mile a day
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:36,672	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	But my luck has run out
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:38,720	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	And
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:40,256	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	I said stop right there
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:42,560	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	And I grab the pad and a pen
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:44,608	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	And I said start over
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:46,912	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	And I began writing as fast as I could
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:48,192	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Has he dictated
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:49,472	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Virtually the entire essay
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:53,568	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Desserts spelled out like that
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:57,408	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	So we had the idea of getting a little audio recorder digital recorder
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:03:03,296	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	So they could be on hand at any time whether to record what he want to write
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:05,088	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Or reminisce or
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:09,696	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	To collect stories after his death I put the recorder in a drawer
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:13,280	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	And didn't pull it out again until
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:16,608	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Over a year-and-a-half after his death I didn't even listen to it
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:18,912	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Any event to write my own memoir
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:25,312	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	I have been kind of very nervous about listening to them cuz I thought I'd be very sad just that we're just
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,592	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Make me depressed and sad
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:32,224	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	But I took it I took the recorder out of the drawer where you had sat for 18 months and
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:38,624	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Cypress playing of course it didn't work because the batteries were dead so I had to scramble to find batteries and when
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:39,648	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	When I did and then
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,672	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Push play
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:46,304	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Okay this is a recorded conversation

EDL	00:03:58,336	00:03:59,104	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Went off
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:05,504	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	It was as if he was alive this is the first recording you made it was eating at the
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:09,088	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Time and he began telling me about his dreams
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:09,856	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Dream
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:13,184	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Springsteen

EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:42,111	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Very religious
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:44,927	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	But then finally coming to some

EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:00,543	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	The journey from where to where
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:10,527	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	This was February 6th 2015 show about 3 weeks after Oliver got his diagnosis

EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:34,335	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Oliver was quite deaf
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:38,943	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	Even louder than he realized he would whisper words to himself trees
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:43,551	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	As he wrote them down on the pad and you wrote with a fountain pen
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:55,327	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	For Oliver writing was a form of thinking and the primary activity
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,399	| radiolab_podcast17oliversacksjourney |	For human being
