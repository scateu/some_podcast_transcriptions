EDL	00:00:59,136	00:01:05,280	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	The poaching Zimbabwe where Cecil was killed open up an investigation but what really caught our eye
EDL	00:01:06,560	00:01:12,960	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Was the reaction from the public lion killer the words painted on the home of dr. Walter Palmer

EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:07,488	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Strange relationship between wanting to hunt and kill an animal
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:09,024	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And wanting to save it

EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:18,752	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Alright so this story really started for me
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:20,032	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	In Salt Lake City
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:27,200	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	The past February I went to the Western hunting & conservation Expo sometimes
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:31,040	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Referred to as the Super Bowl of hunting from walking through

EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:03,808	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	There was a banquet hall where there was an MC who is working
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:04,832	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	What's today
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:07,392	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I want to continue on a couple of thoughts
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,696	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	That we touched on last night
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:11,744	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Your greatest
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:12,512	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Conservation
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:14,304	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	President Theodore Roosevelt said
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:16,096	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	The wild life
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:17,120	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And its habitat
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:19,424	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Cannot speak for itself
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:21,472	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	So we
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:21,984	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Must
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:23,776	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Let me tell you
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:25,568	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	We have
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:27,616	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And we will continue to speak
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:29,920	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	But we've got to go further than
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:30,688	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Speaking
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:33,504	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	We're going to have to suit up in our armor to go into battle
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:35,808	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	To protect our wildlife
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:36,832	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	On our way of life
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:42,720	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Let me tell you we are at War brought on by the extreme radical environmental movement
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:44,512	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	If we're not vigilant
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:45,536	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Dangerous enemy
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:49,376	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	The most endangered species in America
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:50,400	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Could be
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:52,448	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	The American Hunter
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:54,240	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Now one of the things that surprised me
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:56,288	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Kind of right off the bat was
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:58,080	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Talking to people everybody kept
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:04:02,688	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Coming back to the side and hitting on this idea that like if it weren't for us if it weren't for the hunters
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:05,504	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	The animals would not be alive without us unto him
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:09,088	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	They would go extinct I got that line over and over
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:13,184	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	If there would be no animals other hunt basically what they mean by this is
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:14,720	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	They are the ones that are
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:18,303	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Paying to keep these animals around they are doing to our funding conservation
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:25,471	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And I saw what that look like on the final night of the Expo Saturday night when the
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:27,007	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Organizers held this auction

EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:45,823	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	He was an expo super similar to this one
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,103	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Put on by the Dallas
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:49,663	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I have my wife with me
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:51,455	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	You just walking the floor when
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:52,479	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	He bumped into a friend of it
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:55,039	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Gentleman by the name of John Jackson
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:56,831	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Okay and John Jackson
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:58,111	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Heads up
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:58,879	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	A group called
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:08:59,903	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Conservation Force
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:02,719	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	So anyway John came to me
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:04,511	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And he told Corey that he was working
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:06,047	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	That the Dallas Safari Club
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:07,839	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	They were auctioning off
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:09,119	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Opportunity to hunt
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:10,399	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	A black rhino
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:11,167	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	In
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:11,679	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Namibia
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:14,239	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Namibian Ministry of environment and tourism
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:15,775	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I'd given them one tag
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,567	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Antoine black rice
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:18,847	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And they were going to auction it
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:21,919	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Now the black rhino is a critically endangered
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:22,431	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Species
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:26,271	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	5000 of them in the world about 2000 mmba
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:30,879	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And what the namibian government does is they auction off the older males
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:33,951	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	What happened to the black rhino gets older
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:35,231	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	It sees other rhinos
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:37,279	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	He wants to attack the
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:38,047	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Boston time
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:38,815	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And kill them
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:40,607	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	So the government will offer up the
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:41,887	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Problem rhinos
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:42,399	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	For trophy
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:44,191	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And then use the money
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:45,471	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	To protect the others
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:46,751	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	From poachers
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:49,055	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Is poaching of the Black Rhinos a real issue
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:51,359	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Huge issue Rhino horn right now
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:52,895	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	It goes with
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:54,943	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	$60,000
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:58,015	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Yeah it's weird like three times
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:00,063	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Per ounce
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:03,391	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	In any case Cory says the reason that John was so worried
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:05,439	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	John said Corey there's been a
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:06,975	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	A giant
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:08,255	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Push
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,791	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	People coming out against
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:13,887	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	It's literally a license to kill people don't want to talk
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:19,775	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	A permit to hunt down and kill one of the world's most endangered animals
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:22,847	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	You're not going to have
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:24,127	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Someone
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:25,407	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	To bid this minimum bid
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:30,527	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	His friend was worried that they're going to be these namibian ministers they are and they didn't want to be embarrassed
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:36,927	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	So John asked me if it would you at least bit the minimum bid just started like get the auction rolling as a friend

EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:52,031	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	$50,000 thinking that way
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:55,615	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Told the other bidders that's right I was like you know what I'm going to do what I told you

EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:19,839	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Literally nothing
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:23,423	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	He told me he grew up in rural Missouri in a small house
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,447	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Trailer home
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:27,519	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	His mom raised a family his dad loaded trucks

EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:32,383	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	So when Corey with eight
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,663	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	We left Missouri
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:38,527	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Witham in a Monte Carlo with $2,500 in the bank in a dream to make it

EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:41,343	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	So by the time I was 15
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:43,391	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	We moved all over the United States
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:45,695	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	His dad picked up jobs in Arizona
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:48,255	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Texas I'm going from school to school to school
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:53,631	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I didn't really have a benefit of get any sports teams or whatever but the one thing I did is I had a dad that worked
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:55,167	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	His butt off
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:56,191	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Everyday
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:12:57,727	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I didn't get to spend much time with him
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:02,591	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	So then we would get want to go do things like that lets go dove hunting that's Duffy's
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:04,639	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	You know he loved that
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:06,431	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	She mentioned this one time
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:09,247	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	News 11 we go out I have shotgun in my hand
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:11,295	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Two doves fly up
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:14,879	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And I shoot nothing both of them. One shot fell right there okay
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:16,159	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I went over there
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:17,183	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Got the dubs
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:19,487	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	That went through cleaning them
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:20,767	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Okay and preparing the cookie
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:23,327	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And just being in that moment
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:24,607	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And not worrying about
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:30,751	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	You know other problems that you met that we all go through in life and just having a nice quiet on my dad
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:33,055	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I looked at is
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:33,823	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Privilege to go hanoi
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:36,895	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I didn't look at it like hey it's my right to go out
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:38,431	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And take some animals
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:39,455	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Looks like I'll look at it like
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:43,295	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	This is an awesome opportunity I get to go spend with my dad outside
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:44,831	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Now
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:51,743	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	As I became older I became more interested in hunting or learn about both I want to learn about hunting I was eight
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:54,303	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Get up with it by the time he's in his mid-20s he says
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:57,375	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And this is right around the time his dad hit it big in the oil industry
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:03,263	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	He was leading Huntsman all around the world from the North Pole to as far south as you could hunt
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:09,663	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	In New Zealand Nepal Papua New Guinea so I've seen the whole world and he says somewhere in the
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:11,199	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	The middle of all of those trips
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:11,967	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	He realize
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:13,759	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	There's a big fight out there
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:16,831	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	This large biomass of humanity
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:19,647	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Is taking over the world and
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:22,719	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Wildlife doesn't exist by accident anymore
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:25,279	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And so he started thinking about not just hunting these
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:27,071	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	But preserving them
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:30,399	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And keeping them here all the witches to say when
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:31,935	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	He won that auction
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:32,447	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Without meaning
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:34,751	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And started getting all this death threat

EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:38,335	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	What on Earth is keeping you
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:40,895	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	So steadfast in going ahead and doing this
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:42,175	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I think I would have
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:42,943	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Thought
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:43,711	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I should
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:46,271	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I was willing to do this
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:48,831	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And it may have not been what I planned on
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:52,671	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	But I was willing to do this based on a commitment I made you a friend
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:53,439	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Make meth
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,207	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Family

EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:56,255	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	The conservation of the whole
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:57,535	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Look
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:59,327	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	This was never about
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:00,863	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Me going over
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:01,631	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And taking
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:02,655	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Black rhinos live
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:07,519	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Like Viola I get to achieve the Zenith of life and killing his black rhino give me a break
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:08,543	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	It was about
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:10,847	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Method
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:12,383	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	A conservation
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:14,175	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	To keep Black Rhinos on the face
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:15,967	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	You are saying
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:19,807	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	That you're doing this for conservation your detractors will say
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:24,927	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	They will say you say you were only doing it for conservation when you are really doing it for
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:29,023	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I'm not saying that's what you said I'm saying that this is what they will throw at you
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:31,839	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	You were only you were saying you're only doing it for constipation
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:35,167	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Well are you actually getting out of it as some sort of satisfaction
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:39,007	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Can you talk for a minute about in car for more than a minute about it
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:40,031	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Okay alright
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:40,799	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Sure
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:44,127	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I enjoy the act of hunting can I tell you why
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:49,503	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Could I wrap that up in a real pretty burrito for you to be able to eat and understand it taste good
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:51,039	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	No but I can tell you that
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:52,319	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	ICare
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:53,087	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	About
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:54,111	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	The survival of these
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:56,671	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Species and do you understand why
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:15:58,975	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	People have a hard time
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:00,511	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Wrapping your mind around that
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:02,303	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	You believing that
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:03,583	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And simultaneously wanting
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:05,375	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	To kill an animal
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:09,471	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	What it does that just does not compute you at all what point were
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:12,287	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	We're getting redundant they're missing
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:15,871	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	The whole boat we don't have one without the other
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:16,895	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Okay
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:19,711	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	If we want Wildlife to be
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:20,991	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Around
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:22,527	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Future generation
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:24,831	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	We have to understand
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:25,855	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	But that Wildlife has
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:27,391	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Value
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:28,671	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	If it doesn't have a bag you
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:30,975	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Especially in the continent of Africa
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:32,511	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	It's going to be gone
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:35,071	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I'm sure he made a sort of economic
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:37,631	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	He said you got to keep in mind that
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:39,423	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Living next to a black rhino
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:43,007	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Not just talking about it but actually living next to a black rhino
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:44,799	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	It's a nightmare
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:48,895	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I mean who wants to live next door to a raging Psychopathic babysits
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:50,431	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Killing thing
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:51,199	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	No one
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:55,295	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Sew-in just very purely economic terms it has a negative value
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:17:01,183	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	But what Cory will tell you and what conservation organizations like World Wildlife Fund and various others will tell you
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:05,535	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Is by him paying $350,000 to shoot one
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:07,327	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	He is creating a positive
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:10,911	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Value for that animal he's creating jobs for game wardens
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:12,191	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Is creating jobs for trackers
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:13,727	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	She got look at the net benefit
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:16,287	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	It's there when so what
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:19,871	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	What is the common ground here because you guys want the same things
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:22,687	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And yet there's somehow this
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:23,967	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	We don't want the same
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:25,503	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Conservationist in general do
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:27,295	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Common Ground has to be
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:30,367	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Do you or do you not want to see
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:32,415	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Black Rhinos on the face of the Earth
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:33,695	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And I think
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:35,231	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Everyone agrees that they do
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:36,767	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	But I think he'd
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:41,119	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	No I think they do I are actions are speaking louder than their words
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:45,215	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	They're all at I think to a lot of people there these neo-colonial
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:46,495	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Sentiments
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:49,311	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	The you are this guy who has a lot of money
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:52,639	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And you are paying a lot of money to go to Africa
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:53,919	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	To shoot this
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:55,711	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And I think that
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:58,783	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	That causes a reaction
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:17:59,807	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Certain people
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:01,855	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Do you think the amount of money plays into it or no
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:04,159	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Okay
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:07,743	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Okay
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:10,559	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	You say you don't answer anything or that I want
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:14,911	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	To give you the best office plants be understanding I'm really trying
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:16,447	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	To an emotional level Runway
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:16,959	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	My god dammit
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:37,439	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And I know that the words
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:38,975	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Put out means
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:41,279	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:42,047	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I don't want
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,143	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	People that
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:47,935	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Bent
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:49,727	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I'm not a radical sign
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:50,495	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	If you conceived
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:54,335	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Get you something I believe in I can believe in these animal
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:55,871	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I believe that I want them
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:18:59,455	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	But I also understand
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,551	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	But the death of the species.
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:07,647	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And so
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:11,999	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Putting myself through this because I believe
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:13,791	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Embarrassed right cuz I've seen that it
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:16,607	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And I'll go down and I will sit next

EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:06,527	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	What it takes
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:07,551	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Continue
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:22,655	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	So that conversation happened over 6 months ago
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:24,191	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	At that point
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:26,751	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	The Dodge was totally in limbo
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:28,543	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	You still receiving death threats
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:34,943	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Animal Welfare organizations like Humane Society of the United States were lobbying and petitioning to try to
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:35,711	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Stop the hunt
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:39,039	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And what it all really hinge Don was
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:41,343	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	A decision to be made by us Fish and Wildlife
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:45,951	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Under The Endangered Species Act it's illegal to import the carcass
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:49,023	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Of an endangered species into the United States
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:51,071	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Unless you can prove
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:55,167	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	That by killing and importing that animal
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:59,775	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	You are helping the species as a whole so that's what US fish and wildlife had to decide
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:02,079	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Would Corey killing and importing
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:05,919	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	That one black rhino help Black Rhinos as a whole
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:08,479	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	March went by
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:09,759	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	April
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:11,807	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And then
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:14,879	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	In early May

EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:56,704	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	We converted into a game form basically they decided
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:29:03,104	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	How to get rid of all the cattle and bringing all these animals they've got your rafts they've got two different species of zebras will.
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:09,504	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	The Beast Ultra beasts in all they got 29 different species including how many black rhinos are on the property here
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:15,904	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Up until about three weeks ago. Then and now we we've got eleven one of the hunting guides staff
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:22,304	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	At the auto game mode is in the movie told me that they actually just had a rhino born on the
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:28,704	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Property and in fact I've had several throughout the years born on this property and we have to find one
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:35,104	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Look for signs and keep our eyes feeling so what should I be looking for if I'm going to be of any help here
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:41,504	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Yeah I'm at this until just look like a big gray rock that you really going to have a Keen Eye driving through the
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:47,904	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Really tall thick grass that kind of enveloped the car was almost like we're driving through a cloud
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:53,536	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	This is the calorie Sawgrass and set realistic Summers like the monster on top of it
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:59,936	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And after
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:06,336	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Searching and searching and searching I was just
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:12,736	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Like a hundred yards away oh man okay
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:19,136	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	They had the vehicle so you know it's still a very safe distance
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:25,536	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Can you can put the binoculars man looking
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:31,936	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Skip the binoculars and he's just pointed straight at as his head moving left to right left to right I think this is
EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:38,336	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Does a bull by the looks of things it looks like a dinosaur
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:44,736	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Very prehistoric looking animal
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:49,344	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Keep trotting away from us started moving away from us
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:55,232	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Tiny looking legs so when they run they have to kind of shuffle along I think of the girls was in the
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:31:01,632	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Laughlin Nevada movies
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:08,032	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	They're lucky to the front one she's at the we were tailing behind it in the crazy thing is
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:14,432	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Huge animal that weighs over a ton on it is on the Move thinking move like 30 miles per hour
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:20,832	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	We're currently driving in about 15 km an hour and he's getting away from us and left us behind
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:26,976	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	So you want nothing to do about these moving off of at one point before it took off we actually got close enough
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:33,888	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	That with the binoculars on Steph was able to get a good look at its ear
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:40,288	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And this one doesn't actually have an earmark in it so perhaps this one was born on this
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:40,800	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Property
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:43,104	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	What the hell does that work how did
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:44,896	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	How did the Rhinos get to be on this property
EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:51,808	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	The ministry of environment tourism has been in touch with the owner of Otto Graham Rogers
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:57,696	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Government said hey you got all this land will you take a couple of these rhinos and protect them for us
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:32:01,280	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And you know we started off of a couple
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:03,840	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	3 Donovan the number 3
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:06,144	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Strange foster care types
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:13,056	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Each year we have to take photos of them and we build up a portfolio and then we can send it into the Met it's interesting that lie

EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:19,200	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	So there are more of them now than there would have been
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:22,784	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	If they hadn't been moved here yeah yes he's like
EDL	00:32:23,296	00:32:24,832	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Another thing
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:27,136	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	We will knuckle assembly actually we lost it runners
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:34,048	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Steph said he want to show me something about 10 minutes then he stopped the car at the small clear

EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:46,592	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Stumble across the street and can you describe what we're looking at right
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:52,992	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I hear bones scattered all over the right side of the kalari bleach white bones again
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:59,392	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Read Brett's and see if they can see some positive spine as well as that a rhino skull
EDL	00:32:59,392	00:33:02,464	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	It's just unreal

EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:12,192	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	We got out of the car and like actually like held these bones of God
EDL	00:33:12,704	00:33:13,216	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Wow
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:15,776	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	How how did that happen
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:18,336	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	It was a dominant do I was fighting with a younger boo
EDL	00:33:18,848	00:33:22,176	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	The two squared off and the older one ended up
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:24,992	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Goring the younger one with its horn
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:25,504	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Really sweet
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:28,064	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Pushing the envelope passed away
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:29,856	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	He killed it
EDL	00:33:30,368	00:33:32,928	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Then this this older bowl that it just
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:33,952	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Killed the younger one
EDL	00:33:34,464	00:33:37,024	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Steph told me then went up to this female
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:39,072	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Wanted to bring the juice and the
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:41,888	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Young female wasn't ready she wasn't mature enough yet
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:44,448	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	She kept forcing himself on her
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:46,496	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Over and over until
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:48,288	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	So she couldn't enjoy longer
EDL	00:33:51,360	00:33:55,456	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	That I guess it would happen in nature as well it's just unfortunate that today
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:57,248	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Add to beer
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:33:59,552	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	See how they would have been even more butt
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:02,880	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Nature take its course we can get involved in
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:04,672	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	How it is
EDL	00:34:05,696	00:34:08,256	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Steve explain to me that it was these type of black rhino
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:11,072	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Older aggressive bulls that get
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:13,888	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Auctioned up for guys like Cory to come over and shoot
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:16,448	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And then all the money that's been paid for it
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:17,728	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Is going back
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:19,520	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Logang back into
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:22,592	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Anti-poaching unit is going back into

EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:28,224	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	It's nice to see such a large sum of money coming in
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:29,504	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	For a good cause
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:31,296	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	So he believes in this program
EDL	00:34:31,808	00:34:35,136	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Never be able to
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:35,648	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Deschutes
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:37,440	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Black rhino

EDL	00:34:46,656	00:34:48,448	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Explain why
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:52,288	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Not the notes
EDL	00:34:54,336	00:34:55,360	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Difficult to say
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:56,384	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Enough
EDL	00:34:57,408	00:34:57,920	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Doesn't tickle me
EDL	00:35:01,760	00:35:03,808	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Over the next couple days at the lodge
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:05,344	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	As I was hanging out with kind of these
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:06,880	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Tourists
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:10,464	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	From all over the world would come here to be wined and dined and then
EDL	00:35:10,976	00:35:13,536	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Gotten shoot stuff in the morning and afternoon
EDL	00:35:14,048	00:35:15,072	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Steps ambivalence
EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:17,888	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	30 to make a deep sort of sense
EDL	00:35:17,888	00:35:19,424	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Tiffany toma toma toma toma
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:21,984	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	For instance I spent a lot of time with this guy
EDL	00:35:21,984	00:35:28,128	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Steven Lindstrom middle-aged there with the family on vacation we decided six years ago that we will
EDL	00:35:28,640	00:35:29,408	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Google
EDL	00:35:29,408	00:35:30,176	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	To Africa
EDL	00:35:30,176	00:35:31,456	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	So I'm very happy to
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:32,224	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Be here today
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:34,272	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	This is six years in the making for you

EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:48,096	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And now today I can't we have at least
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:48,608	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	50 more
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:50,656	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I got the following a few hun

EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:55,008	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Stamina setting
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:36:02,176	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	One of the times we spent about 2 and 1/2 hours
EDL	00:36:02,176	00:36:04,224	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Searching for different animals talking different animals
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:06,016	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And then in the distance
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:10,368	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	So very nice what about bull we finally found a water bug
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:14,208	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Which is what it's kind of like a reindeer
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:15,232	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	But
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:17,792	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	It has he's too big Longhorns
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:20,096	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Shoot backwards almost like
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:20,864	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Spirit
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:21,376	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Big animal
EDL	00:36:22,912	00:36:23,680	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Like a Stone
EDL	00:36:23,680	00:36:26,752	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Norse mythology is just going to close NC
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:28,800	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	We hop down from the car and just kind of
EDL	00:36:28,800	00:36:30,848	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Slowly moving towards it through the grass
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:37,248	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Type of animal is the top for me this weekend and his laundry seven told me he had a list of animals
EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:43,648	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	He was hoping to shoot and this was at the top of this one with the game
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:49,792	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Charges $2,800 to shoot
EDL	00:36:55,936	00:36:56,704	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Walking through
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:36:58,752	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Chandelier
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:03,360	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Every like 10 minutes weave
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:09,504	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Stop to measure how far away it was 12 to 6
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:28,448	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Eventually
EDL	00:37:28,448	00:37:30,752	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	We got this a couple hundred feet away from it
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:33,056	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	The animals off in the distance is just kind of pacing
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:35,360	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Simple.
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:36,896	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Tripod sets it up
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:38,944	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And Stephen gets into position
EDL	00:37:53,536	00:37:55,840	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	The buck stumbled a few paces and you don't
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:37:57,888	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Fall down
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:37:58,912	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	But then again
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:38:00,448	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Right back up and stumbles forward
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:03,520	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	What's this one
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:10,176	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Appreciative
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:12,224	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Add appointment seems tense
EDL	00:38:13,760	00:38:17,344	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Cuz like he knows that the animal is suffering
EDL	00:38:19,392	00:38:25,280	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	The dog takes off runs after it and just keeps it at babe I kind of circling it and we start moving towards it
EDL	00:38:38,592	00:38:40,640	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Again second shot doesn't kill it
EDL	00:38:40,640	00:38:44,736	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Fall down get back up fall down again
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:47,552	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Next Injustice
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:52,672	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Benton housing
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:53,696	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Pretty upset
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:56,000	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I don't know what you said it the first time better
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:38:56,768	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Irvin High
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:05,216	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And the third shot
EDL	00:39:05,216	00:39:05,984	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Duncan killer
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:11,104	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Discipline
EDL	00:39:17,248	00:39:18,528	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Macadamia nut
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:19,040	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I will try
EDL	00:39:25,952	00:39:27,488	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Finally fourth shot
EDL	00:39:28,000	00:39:28,512	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Because
EDL	00:39:30,560	00:39:31,328	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	What's the winning shot
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:34,656	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I can still kicking a little bit but it is
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:35,168	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Done
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:37,472	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Oh it's so nice
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:40,288	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I'm so happy I'm so happy
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:43,104	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	What's the top of the list for me this weekend
EDL	00:39:43,872	00:39:44,896	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Movie synopsis perfect
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:46,688	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Is very nice feelings
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:00,512	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Seeing it up close
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:02,560	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	It can be
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:04,096	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Emotionally difficult
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:12,032	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	But when you pan out it's pretty clear the numbers show that this namibian model is working
EDL	00:40:12,032	00:40:18,432	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Wildlife numbers on private land have gone up by almost 80% since the government allowed people to
EDL	00:40:18,432	00:40:24,832	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Buy sell and shoot Wildlife on their land and since trophy hunting of the black rhino with legalized
EDL	00:40:24,832	00:40:29,440	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	That population has grown by like 30%
EDL	00:40:29,440	00:40:35,840	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Button front of my face not all African conservationists are on board I talked to a guy named
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:40,448	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Richard Leakey Super Famous Anthropologist who also directed
EDL	00:40:40,448	00:40:42,240	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Kenya's Wildlife program for a while
EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:46,848	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And I asked what is your stance on this idea of sustainable use
EDL	00:40:47,616	00:40:51,200	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Listen to me I think it's absolutely ridiculous
EDL	00:40:51,712	00:40:56,832	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	If a father cant afford to pay school fees for his children
EDL	00:40:57,856	00:41:02,464	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Does you say to somebody you can rape my daughter so I can get the money to pay for school fees
EDL	00:41:02,464	00:41:06,048	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I don't think we go to set some standards in life and I think was his mom sue for
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:09,376	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	What this argument is about killing wild animals
EDL	00:41:10,144	00:41:11,936	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	So that they can be looked after
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:14,752	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Absolutely sends the wrong message
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:16,800	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	This was the big issue he took
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:18,080	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	With Namibia strategy
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:21,920	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Yes you can you can afford to lose five Runners from a breeding perspective
EDL	00:41:22,432	00:41:24,480	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Does that send the right message
EDL	00:41:24,480	00:41:29,856	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	She then told me a story about when he took over Kenya's Wildlife service in 1989
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:30,624	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	At the time
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:37,024	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Things were dire elephants were being killed in her Lobby number and we were going to lose our elephants totally poaching with
EDL	00:41:37,024	00:41:43,168	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Is on the rise and his predecessors had actually confiscated a huge number of elephant tusk
EDL	00:41:43,168	00:41:43,680	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	From this boat
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:45,472	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Tough.
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:49,824	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	You said you thought that's another Library
EDL	00:41:49,824	00:41:52,128	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Zelda side remake about 3 million dollars
EDL	00:41:52,640	00:41:55,455	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And then use that money to help fight poaching
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:42:02,367	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	But like you said know what he did instead when she built a giant Tower of that ivory
EDL	00:42:02,367	00:42:08,767	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Taken by poachers burn

EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:23,103	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	CPR stat to draw
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:24,383	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	The world's attention to the
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:30,783	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Site of elephants and part of what he was saying in that was like we have to Value these things beyond their dollar value
EDL	00:42:30,783	00:42:32,831	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	If the respect the intrinsic value of the
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:34,111	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	These creatures the wait a second
EDL	00:42:34,623	00:42:37,951	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	If you're burning a bunch of ivory aren't you in effect
EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:44,351	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Increasing the value of the ivory cuz now there's just less of it out there so you're looking at the supply end of it right yes by
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:48,447	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Reducing Supply that would push up price leaky was attacking the demand side
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:50,495	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	What an impact it had to run the world
EDL	00:42:50,495	00:42:56,639	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Opinion changed overnight. He said it woke the public up people stop buying Ivory and the market
EDL	00:42:56,639	00:42:57,663	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	For ivory
EDL	00:42:57,663	00:42:58,687	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Is it crashed
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:43:04,319	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Up to that time would be losing about three and a half thousand elephants to four thousand elephants a year
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:07,647	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	A year later we were losing
EDL	00:43:07,647	00:43:08,671	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	At most
EDL	00:43:08,671	00:43:09,439	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	60
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:10,463	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Really

EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:13,535	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Getting a public
EDL	00:43:14,047	00:43:16,351	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Support conservation of Wildlife
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:21,215	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	That's a huge Challenge and we just can't afford icing
EDL	00:43:21,215	00:43:22,751	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Just send out the wrong messages
EDL	00:43:25,311	00:43:27,103	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	But the problem with that is
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:31,455	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Finding the right message is getting harder and harder
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:34,783	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I called various conservation organizations
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:38,111	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And one guy who I talked to told me that
EDL	00:43:38,111	00:43:41,439	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Their average age of donor is getting older
EDL	00:43:41,439	00:43:47,839	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	More and more people just living in cities less people are having positive experiences in the natural way
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:53,727	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	World at a young age and so he said that they're going to have to continue focusing on people focusing on us
EDL	00:43:54,239	00:43:55,519	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	This message of
EDL	00:43:55,519	00:43:57,823	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	What does Wildlife give us
EDL	00:43:57,823	00:43:59,103	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	What does it do for p
EDL	00:44:04,223	00:44:05,503	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Third Day up in the area
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:07,551	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Still no luck we're just going to
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:08,063	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Keep at it
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:12,415	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Back in the media after 3 days of bushwhacking through this
EDL	00:44:12,415	00:44:13,183	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Dance
EDL	00:44:13,183	00:44:14,207	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Vegetation
EDL	00:44:14,207	00:44:15,743	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Up in the north of the country
EDL	00:44:15,743	00:44:19,071	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Corey and his crew finally got on the tracks of the right Ryan
EDL	00:44:19,071	00:44:21,375	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	The local guy says wakanda rhino
EDL	00:44:21,887	00:44:24,447	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Better Built another Rhino that it killed another rhino
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:25,983	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	So we're going to follow this
EDL	00:44:26,751	00:44:28,543	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Like 100% sure that it's the right one
EDL	00:44:29,311	00:44:30,847	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And then we'll try to take if we can
EDL	00:44:30,847	00:44:34,943	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	So for the next couple hours they they track the animal looking for
EDL	00:44:34,943	00:44:35,967	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Fiscally footprints
EDL	00:44:36,479	00:44:38,783	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Anywhere that is marked its territory
EDL	00:44:43,391	00:44:44,159	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Play Store
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:46,719	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	We were at walk at this point just about 12 MI
EDL	00:44:47,231	00:44:47,999	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	It was very hot
EDL	00:44:51,071	00:44:54,655	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	The grass was so thick that they really couldn't see more than about 30 feet in front of
EDL	00:44:55,167	00:44:58,239	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And eventually they find you can see this is a rhino
EDL	00:44:58,751	00:45:00,287	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	A pile of rhino fees
EDL	00:45:00,287	00:45:03,615	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Is that still warm still very moist mean it's practices
EDL	00:45:03,615	00:45:10,015	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	We're not more than an hour behind that animal right there you can see the dung beetles and everything in it and so
EDL	00:45:10,015	00:45:15,391	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Set there for a few minutes right gathered our thoughts
EDL	00:45:15,391	00:45:17,951	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	You wanted out where and what you say
EDL	00:45:18,463	00:45:19,231	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And then
EDL	00:45:19,231	00:45:24,351	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	About two hours later from my left
EDL	00:45:24,351	00:45:30,495	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	All I see is running Beast with a giant saber on its head
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:34,591	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	It was like lightning
EDL	00:45:38,175	00:45:41,247	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	So you also didn't get it with the first shot the first
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:43,039	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Several shots did not kill the
EDL	00:45:43,039	00:45:44,831	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	It ran off and then they have to start tracking
EDL	00:45:45,855	00:45:47,135	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Bonded oil
EDL	00:45:47,135	00:45:48,159	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	We followed it
EDL	00:45:48,159	00:45:49,439	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I would say 10 minutes out of
EDL	00:45:49,951	00:45:55,839	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	La looked over there I saw it wasn't lying down at this point it was standing up but it has already fallen down twice
EDL	00:45:56,351	00:45:56,863	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	It was dying
EDL	00:45:57,631	00:45:59,167	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And then
EDL	00:46:02,495	00:46:04,031	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I shot it
EDL	00:46:06,847	00:46:08,127	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	The last thing you do
EDL	00:46:08,127	00:46:10,687	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Is what you really assured its dad you touch its eye
EDL	00:46:11,711	00:46:12,735	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	If it doesn't blink
EDL	00:46:12,735	00:46:14,527	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	So did you go take your time
EDL	00:46:16,063	00:46:16,575	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Absolutely
EDL	00:46:17,343	00:46:19,391	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Animal like that is there some sort
EDL	00:46:19,391	00:46:24,767	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Is there a conversation going on now that the animal is is dead and you're not know
EDL	00:46:24,767	00:46:27,839	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	We just kind of looked at everybody looked at each other make sure we are okay
EDL	00:46:28,351	00:46:30,143	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	There wasn't a whole lot of talk I didn't this guy
EDL	00:46:32,703	00:46:34,239	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	But it was an emotional moment for me
EDL	00:46:35,007	00:46:35,519	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	So
EDL	00:46:36,031	00:46:36,799	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Debate
EDL	00:46:37,311	00:46:39,871	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	We've been sitting here skin this animal so far this morning
EDL	00:46:39,871	00:46:46,271	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And now we're about to roll it over skin the other side and then just take the quarters off just like any other animal that you would if your
EDL	00:46:46,271	00:46:47,039	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Hunting trip
EDL	00:46:50,623	00:46:55,231	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	They loaded up all the meat to be shipped off to a local Village
EDL	00:46:55,231	00:46:55,999	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And
EDL	00:46:55,999	00:46:56,767	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	They
EDL	00:46:56,767	00:46:58,559	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Kept a little bit of it for themselves
EDL	00:46:58,559	00:47:03,423	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	So kicking my first piece of black rhino me here on the coals next to the karges
EDL	00:47:03,935	00:47:05,727	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Right here's the moment when
EDL	00:47:07,007	00:47:11,103	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Everybody here has started eating some of those black rhino so it just
EDL	00:47:11,103	00:47:11,871	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Apart of
EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:15,967	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	The part of hunting and a part of being a human
EDL	00:47:16,735	00:47:17,503	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	So it's a pretty
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:24,159	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Unique an awesome moment right here I'm not really morally outraged by I'm maybe I'm a little but
EDL	00:47:24,159	00:47:30,559	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	I think you might be vulnerable if you insist that your enthusiasm for hunting is part of the balance Renee
EDL	00:47:30,559	00:47:32,863	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	But I think Robert perfectly
EDL	00:47:32,863	00:47:37,727	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	You don't have those k93 and salad and I understand that people don't like it
EDL	00:47:37,727	00:47:40,543	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Any more than they wouldn't like going and killing the lamb
EDL	00:47:40,543	00:47:41,823	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Of the lamb chops I eat
EDL	00:47:42,335	00:47:43,615	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	What are dynamic mean it's wrong
EDL	00:47:44,383	00:47:45,151	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Hunting
EDL	00:47:45,151	00:47:48,479	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	It's part of who we are now it may be a bigger part of
EDL	00:47:48,479	00:47:50,015	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Who I am then you are
EDL	00:47:50,527	00:47:51,807	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And that's fine
EDL	00:47:51,807	00:47:53,343	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	But when
EDL	00:47:53,343	00:47:54,879	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Wildlife populations
EDL	00:47:55,647	00:48:02,047	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Abound is when they're managed by Humans Beings the alternate model might be a view of humans that's
EDL	00:48:02,047	00:48:03,071	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Different from yours I think
EDL	00:48:03,839	00:48:05,375	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	You assume
EDL	00:48:06,399	00:48:07,167	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	That
EDL	00:48:07,167	00:48:10,495	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Because we are smart and because there are so many of us
EDL	00:48:11,263	00:48:12,543	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	That inevitably
EDL	00:48:13,567	00:48:15,103	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	We will bump into them
EDL	00:48:15,871	00:48:17,407	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And when we do we will win
EDL	00:48:18,175	00:48:19,455	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And that's your calculator
EDL	00:48:19,455	00:48:21,503	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	The alternate model might be
EDL	00:48:21,503	00:48:23,039	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	That because we are smart
EDL	00:48:23,807	00:48:25,343	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	We might create a space
EDL	00:48:26,367	00:48:27,391	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Willy won't bump
EDL	00:48:28,159	00:48:30,207	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Now you're now you're not in the real world
EDL	00:48:30,207	00:48:31,743	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	We're dealing not in reality
EDL	00:48:31,743	00:48:34,815	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Okay I'm glad I'm living in a world that matters and it's real
EDL	00:48:34,815	00:48:41,215	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	So it's not it's not a dream scenario and it's not saying okay well let's just create this unfortunately these Ana
EDL	00:48:41,215	00:48:42,239	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Animals don't have that time
EDL	00:48:43,263	00:48:47,359	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	So I'm not trying to outsmart anybody it's just a traditional method that's worked
EDL	00:48:47,871	00:48:49,151	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	And until
EDL	00:48:49,151	00:48:50,175	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	Somebody comes up
EDL	00:48:50,687	00:48:54,527	| radiolab_podcast15rhinohunter |	With a methodology that we can look at and say this is
