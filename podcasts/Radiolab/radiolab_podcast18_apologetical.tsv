EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:49,791	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And there was this one moment that happened about a month after I got to America that just

EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:14,623	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Cuz in the house that day
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:15,903	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	They're going to vote on a bill
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:23,071	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	So the speaker Rings is electric bill that let everyone know it's time to vote and as is Canadian tradition
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:24,351	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Do people notice
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:27,935	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Walk up the aisle and then it is kind of bow and then the voting can begin
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:35,103	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	But for this particular approach the liberal whip guess the front and he turns it was right and he did not see that
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:36,639	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Gordon Brown
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:41,759	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	He's like where is this man and he turns left behind me see is a Gordon Brown has tried his very best

EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:44,831	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	But he is stuck
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,927	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And you stuck because
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:49,951	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	There is a clump
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:50,975	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Of MPS
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:53,791	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	They're standing in his way
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:06:00,703	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Purposefully or just accidentally I think it's debated but I would say very confidently that it was extremely
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:02,239	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Purposeful
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:08,895	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	They're pretending they don't see him and they're using their little their butts like shuffling their butt and you can see he's like dodging this way
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:15,295	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Ellen scaring that way and then it's kind of complicated
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:16,319	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Basically we have
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:19,135	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	3 minutes we have a deadline

EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:00,415	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Including
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:04,511	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	At someone behind me who I did not say apologize again
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:06,047	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Anyone feel that they were
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:10,911	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Impacted by my actions I
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:17,055	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Completely apologize I was not my intention to hurt anyone and certainly wasn't
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:28,063	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	This down his whole side of the room stands up give him a standing ovation but for the opposition the people
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:28,575	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Other side of the aisle
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:30,879	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	This is not good enough
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:33,439	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Across the floor
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:39,839	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	With anger fear in his eyes and face member after member rise from their seats to school
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:45,983	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Add my testimonies are the conservatives thinking with Glee
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:48,287	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I would use the word charge
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:54,687	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Across the floor Whittington people of clutching their pearls with the light Justin is not the perfect
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:58,527	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Perfect man that we all thought he was
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:10:03,135	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Someone accused of making it unsafe place for women to work
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:09,535	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Best made of steel
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:14,655	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Eventually
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:15,679	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I was remembering question
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:20,031	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The woman who was elbowed Ruth Ellen brosseau she returns and she speaks
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:21,567	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I was elbowed in the chest
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:22,079	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	By the primary
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:25,407	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	It was very overwhelming
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:30,015	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I just wanted to clarify and make sure it's clear to all the members in the house if that did happen
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:38,463	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	At which points Trudeau again stands up and says what I think is a pretty nice apologies
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:41,023	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Take the opportunity at now that the member
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:45,887	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	It is okay to return to the house right now to be able to express directly to her
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:47,423	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Apologies
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:50,495	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Up for my behavior unreservedly
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:53,311	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	He says what he did he says it was wrong
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,079	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And he says
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,103	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I'm very sorry
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:56,895	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Thank you mister speaker
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:59,967	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	We got the idea now he said it three times
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:01,503	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Will you think so
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:02,783	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Right
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:06,879	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Something that can be cured by a simple apology
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:09,695	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	But that wasn't the case that night at a press conference
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:15,327	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And indeed I'm going to apologize again for incident in the house
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:17,631	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	This evening he does it again
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:24,031	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And for that I truly regret that at this point the media is going crazy about it
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:28,127	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Day of atonement
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:31,455	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	#elbow elbow Gates
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:34,783	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Trudeau got on social media added apologetic tweet
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:40,927	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Just in case but even then we're still not done because the next day back in the House of Commons
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:45,023	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	He apologizes again
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:47,327	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I apologize for crossing the floor in his attempt
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:49,375	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Take a seat
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:53,471	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And again
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:56,543	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And again
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,591	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Against
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:01,151	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Apologizing and again
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:02,175	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I regret it
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:02,943	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Deeply
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:04,991	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I made a mistake and
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:07,551	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Again
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:08,575	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Canadian
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:10,367	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Understanding and
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:14,975	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I think at this point when I was learning about these I was just like okay
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:18,815	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I just I just feel like I guess I just feel like
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:20,351	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	This posturing end
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:22,655	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Volume like for Canada it's not just about
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:23,679	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Elbow thing
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:30,591	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Feel like every month Trudeau is apologizing to one group or another that has been harmed in the past by Cannon
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:36,991	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And you know I should say that actually think he's apologies are very helpful and I think it's very important but you get to a point where they just
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:41,343	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Start to pile up and I so I guess like what I'm seeing Alba gate
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:44,159	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I'm noticing elbowgate I'm thinking about all of this
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:45,951	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Attending to come here
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:52,351	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Do America where where we have this President Donald Trump tonight he's refusing
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:54,143	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	To apologize for anything
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:59,263	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Is there anybody you'd like to apologize to know
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:02,335	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Funny weird things
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:05,919	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Give me a moment in that tiny tiny moment the contrast was
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:07,967	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Refreshing
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:10,015	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	What colloquial
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:16,415	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	At least I know where you stand that's so funny because as you're telling the story about Canada on the apology is none like
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:17,439	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Oh my God I would
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:23,839	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	We haven't apologized in this country for some really wrong stuff that I'm not down
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:30,239	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Not apologizing for stuff but then again we had one too many glasses of wine and we are so
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:31,007	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Sorry
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:37,919	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Show me the days are just like nothing says sorry like free pizza story not story
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:44,063	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Sorry if you felt hurt I'm sorry if I offended you if you're not real
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:47,903	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Broken
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:49,183	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Sorry
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:49,951	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Yeah
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:50,975	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And I guess I could
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:53,791	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Found myself getting to this whole thing about like
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:55,327	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	How to figure out first of all
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:57,631	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	How did it get broken how to re break it
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:13:58,655	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	End
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:00,703	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	What can we do to get it back
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:03,263	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Yeah well maybe it
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:09,663	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	It might be worth our time to back up a little bit to get aware that notion of I'm sorry and apologies come from
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:16,063	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And what they are because take me back
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:19,135	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I'm the chair of the floss department at the University of New Hampshire
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:22,463	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	He's an expert in the history and philosophy of contrition
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:23,231	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	We got these
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:26,047	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Ancient traditions
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:31,423	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Usually grounded and some kind of religious
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:31,935	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Practice
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:37,823	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Pretty much all the world religions have some kind of repentance
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:40,127	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Tencent
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:46,527	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Turn to God never again
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:52,159	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	You do something wrong and wrong is identified by you know whatever the holy book say whatever and you say there are some
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:57,791	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	There's some things you need to do that kind of make it right
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:15:01,119	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Admit to regret to ask for forgiveness than to promise never to do it again
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:04,447	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Ain't no repentance is the term that
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:09,311	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Is around for most of the history of apologizing and when you think of it in those
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:12,383	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Explicitly religious terms you kind of get a sense for the
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:14,943	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Full thickness of it because you're talking about like
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:15,967	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Your soul
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:18,527	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And the afterlife
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:20,575	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And you're standing
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:23,903	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Before the gods and not just the person you injured right this is
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:25,439	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Soul crafting
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:33,631	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	As we enter
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:35,167	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Modern secular
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:36,959	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Industrialized living
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:41,311	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And as we try to find a way to to do something like repentance
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:44,383	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	In a secular terms we end up with this
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:45,663	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Weird modern soup
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:46,943	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Of apology
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:52,575	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	So Nick says overtime as we started letting go of he's like explicitly religious rules around apology
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:55,647	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Sori sort of started to shift
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:56,927	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And fuse
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:59,487	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	In that context is everything alright so what
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:02,047	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	In Modern Life do we mean
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:05,631	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Alright what's a good apology what do we mean by apologies
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:07,167	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	This is going to be super complicated
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:08,959	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Like when we've been hurt
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:09,983	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	To buy someone
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:11,519	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	What is it we actually want
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:16,383	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And as I was looking around for stories about the role of apologies our lives today
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:17,151	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I found
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:19,199	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	A moment that feels to me like
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:22,015	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I like almost sort of inflection points
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,807	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	In a Reckoning with the meaning of
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:24,831	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I'm sorry
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:28,927	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Inserts oddly enough
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:32,255	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	With this guy

EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,463	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Moment

EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:32,575	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Imagine what happened
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:39,231	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	This is Abigail saltonstall send your bill saltonstall as youngest daughter you know we weren't a family that talked

EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:13,791	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And stop at the beach and when it was really cold and swim with her friend and then go to school
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:15,839	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	She was adventurous and she did love

EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:20,703	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And I am not sure where they started I am
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:23,007	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Thinking maybe somewhere near Boston
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:23,775	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Did you call
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:25,311	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Bikes for a couple of hours

EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:34,527	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And I mean he got luck
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:36,575	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:42,975	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	My understanding of what happened over biking down the road on the shoulder there were two cars that were
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:43,999	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Maybe
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:47,839	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Maybe playing chicken maybe racing I'm not really sure
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:49,887	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	But the cars
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:51,423	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	One of them
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:53,727	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Look into the breakdown Lane and just
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:54,495	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Took out my sister
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:56,799	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And she died
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:58,335	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	It's always awful
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:19:59,615	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Who is awful
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:03,967	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Do you remember where you were when you heard about your sister's death
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:07,807	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Yeah I was at
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:08,575	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	A friend's house
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:11,647	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And then my father called and told me what happened
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:13,183	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	How I found out
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:13,695	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Well over the phone
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:16,255	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Dad over the phone
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:16,767	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Yes
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:22,655	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	To lose a daughter in on the prime of Life 16 years evasion
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:24,959	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Although circumstances
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:27,519	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	So tragic
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:29,311	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Can you can imagine
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:31,615	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Billava Sleepless
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:32,383	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Was devastated
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:36,479	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Eventually the song Sail found out who the driver was this 19 year old guy
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:38,783	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And the publisher of taking him to court
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:39,295	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And one
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:40,575	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Easily
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:42,367	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	My memory
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:44,671	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Is that my family did not press charges
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:47,487	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	My father says
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:50,303	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	That he didn't see a reason to ruin to life
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:53,119	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	But what he did at some level want
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:57,215	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Was was just for this guy to reach out to the family
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:58,495	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Who caused her death
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:00,287	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	To say
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:01,823	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	To say that they were sorry
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:05,151	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	But he never contacted them so I never knew
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:06,175	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Weather person thought
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:08,991	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And some point
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:12,063	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	My father told me that he that he thought that that was
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:12,575	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Because they
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:13,855	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The law
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:17,952	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	That's right the driver is afraid of the legal implications of an apology
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:19,744	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	This is Lisa Lisa
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:22,304	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	He's a lawyer and a graduate of Harvard Divinity School
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:23,328	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And he says that
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:25,376	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	At that point pretty much across the entire
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:26,400	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Tire us
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:29,728	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The general rule of law was that if I run a red light
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:36,128	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Can I get out of my car and I sent any I'm so sorry it was entirely my fault I was not paying attention I was talking on my
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:36,640	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	My cell phone
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:38,944	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	You can use
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:39,712	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Mike
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:40,736	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Apology
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:43,040	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	To establish that I caused the accident
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:49,184	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	So you're Humane empathic reflexes might steer you towards you know saying you're sorry
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:55,584	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	It was my fault I wasn't looking or I was wiping my kid's nose or something
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:21:56,608	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	But
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:21:59,168	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The takeaway is wait don't do that
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:01,728	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Because if you
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:03,008	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	In that moment
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:03,520	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Apologize
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:04,800	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	American Seating
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:07,872	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	But that you deserve the blame
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:11,712	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	In other words in the eyes of the Court apology is an admission
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:17,088	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And don't sell thought maybe the driver of a car isn't apologizing because he's afraid that would use it against them in court
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:20,416	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	So we figured was Rectify this situation
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:23,488	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Let's just change the law which brings us back.
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:25,280	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	It was in response to that
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:28,096	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Not Bill sitting on Governor Dukakis
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:29,120	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	It was
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:33,728	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Designed to make it possible for people to apologize
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:35,776	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Without implicating them
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:39,616	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	As guilty party
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:43,712	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I'm sorry that story cannot be used against you in court
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:50,624	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Which only makes sense to me and I think made sense just about everybody and I don't think they had much difficulty in getting through those
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:51,392	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Unanimous
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:52,160	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Too close to it
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:56,256	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And so December 24th 1986 Massachusetts passed the first
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:57,280	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Apology legislation
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:23:02,144	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Creating For the First Time the song window that allowed two people to just
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:04,192	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Do people enjoy I'm sorry
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:06,496	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Without any legal consequence
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:09,312	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Do you have any sense of
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:13,920	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Whether or not that measures had any effect did you do you hear of it coming up
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:15,200	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I honestly don't know
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:16,992	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I don't know
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:18,016	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I mean I don't know
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:22,624	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	You know the person even after the law was passed did not apologize
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:25,440	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	So it didn't accomplish that
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:26,464	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Specific goal
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:29,536	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I actually found and reached out to the driver
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:32,096	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And through his son he declined to comment for the
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:32,864	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Story
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:33,888	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	So didn't work
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:35,424	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I never got their apology
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:38,752	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Well at me for Abigail and her family know
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:41,568	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	But what I dug in the history of this
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:43,616	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	A bit what became clear was it this
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:44,640	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Little drop
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:45,920	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Of legislation
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:48,992	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Created some ripples that are still spreading today

EDL	00:23:58,464	00:24:02,816	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	But in the late 90s
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:07,680	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The I'm sorry Bill and then in the early 2000 you see a big
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:14,080	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	First this is Jennifer ravenel's professor of law in Psycho
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:16,128	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Ecology at the University of Illinois
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:21,504	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	According to her one after another states started passing these kinds of rules

EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:38,656	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Of the states that passed one of these laws
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:41,728	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Making it okay to say I'm sorry
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:46,848	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	But now you know that you're saying it without having to
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:48,384	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	To pay the consequences
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:51,200	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	You feel like that make it less real to say sorry yes that's
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:52,224	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	That's
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:55,040	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	That's not apologizing
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:25:00,672	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	What if you don't say you're sorry because you feel like that I'm going to sue you
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:01,952	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Until you say nothing
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:04,000	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	But isn't it better to have
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:09,120	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Sorry at least come out even if the sorry little bit less with sorry that point yeah so that's the rub
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:13,472	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Write give on the one hand what you want is a mechanism to
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:15,264	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Encourage
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:16,032	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Good apologies
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:18,592	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	On the other hand
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:20,128	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	You know what wait a minute
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:25,760	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	An apology tells us that this person is responsible if they are responsible than
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:26,528	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	You know perhaps
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:29,344	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	One of the things that comes with that is responsibility to
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:30,624	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Repair the harm
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:32,672	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Yeah this is
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:36,256	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	This is a real double-edged sword
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:37,024	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Because
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:38,816	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	If you're a sophisticated
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:40,864	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Offender
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:41,888	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	You can manipulate the
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:43,936	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Against victims to great effect
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:47,264	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Think of it like this
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:49,056	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	You've suffered a serious injury
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:51,616	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Imagine like you be like you wants to tile
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:54,176	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Nick says what happens
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:26:00,320	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Is that the people responsible for that death may be accompanied by a lawyer what they do is they show up at your house
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:02,624	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Sit down at your table and express
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:04,416	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Something that looks like
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:06,208	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Like a really deep
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:07,744	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Profound
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:09,792	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Soul moving
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:11,584	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Apology that
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:17,984	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	They're really sorry for what happened and they take responsibility for it and they admit blame
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:18,752	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And honest
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:23,104	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	But nix's often times has a combination of loitering
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:23,872	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Enacting
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:25,152	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Because
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:27,712	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Once you express enough sympathy than you
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:28,736	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	You make an offer
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:30,784	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And you know you lowball
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:35,904	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	So victims think they're getting something like a heartfelt repentance or something like that new Fender
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:42,048	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	When facts negotiation negotiation dressed up as an apology
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:46,400	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	How do you know that that's the line of thinking I've been in the other rooms
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:48,192	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	You know where the strategies are
EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:52,288	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Being discussed of the apologizes
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:53,056	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Yes
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:57,408	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And Nick says overtime lawyers have realized by going to people's homes
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:26:59,968	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Listening sympathetically
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:02,784	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And offering amount
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:04,320	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	This is way more cost
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:05,856	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	In fact
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:08,928	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	One of the major supporters behind that
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:12,000	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Groundswell of apology laws in America for lobbyist
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:13,024	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	A lobbyists
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:14,304	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Who advocate for
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:16,864	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Corporate interests who seek
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:17,888	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	To reduce
EDL	00:27:18,912	00:27:20,192	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Liability for Harms
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:21,728	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Really
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:23,264	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	So sorry got weaponized
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:25,568	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Yeah particularly by Corporation
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:27,360	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Nick says in the early 90s
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:28,128	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Also
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:29,152	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Sorts of
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:29,920	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Industries
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:32,736	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Started apologizing as a tactic
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:34,784	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Tell me about one company he said he'd
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:37,344	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	In eight years they save 75 million
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:39,136	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	S*** and
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:42,464	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	If you want to follow the money that it's pretty easy to follow the money here
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:44,768	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I'm suddenly
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:47,840	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Who suddenly starting to argue the other side of my head which is
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:51,936	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Isn't isn't a fundamental aspect in an apology like you're making yourself
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:59,360	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Smaller or vulnerable to the person you're apologizing to
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:01,920	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Not legal repercussions I hate that the laws involved but it is
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:04,992	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And they're doing it for their own Financial benefit
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:06,016	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Then
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:10,112	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	They're not actually making themselves vulnerable to the person
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:12,160	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And so the
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:14,720	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The apology is robbed of something essential Maybe
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:16,000	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Yeah
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:20,864	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I don't know that IMAX imagine if your corporation
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:21,632	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	You can stay
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:23,424	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	It's still a human woman
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:28,288	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Be even then you don't even if it seems like you're going well you never know
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:29,312	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I don't know
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:34,688	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Like that is the thing it all comes down to you when they say they're sorry
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:35,712	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Do they mean it
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:39,040	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And usually can't really judge someone's apology until like years later
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:45,696	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And actually Nick told me a story that really drive this point home so this is a really interesting example
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:46,720	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	So
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:53,888	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	So it's 1076 where in medieval Europe Henry the fourth is
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:55,936	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The Holy Roman Emperor
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:28:58,752	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And Gregory 1/7
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:28:59,520	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Is
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:02,336	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Hope you love the most powerful people on the planet
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:05,152	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And at some point the emperor goes behind the folks back
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:06,688	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And appoints a bishop
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:09,504	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The pope takes particular issue with disappointment
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:11,552	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	So what the pope does
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:14,368	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Is excommunicates the emperor
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:18,208	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Which means that
EDL	00:29:18,208	00:29:23,328	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I mean he's not really the emperor anymore because the pope has just said he's not part of the church anymore
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:25,120	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Really bad news
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:29,984	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Violence is breaking out people are demanding he step down
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:32,288	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The emperor does Henry
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:35,872	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Henry takes a walk
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:36,640	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Lacrosse
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:37,152	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The Alps
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:38,944	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	With his wife
EDL	00:29:38,944	00:29:42,784	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And small child and I know who else is in there their Entourage
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:44,576	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Edison winter
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:48,416	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	It's bitterly cold they March for days and days which are in two weeks
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:48,928	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The week
EDL	00:29:51,232	00:29:57,632	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Through snowy valleys across icy rivers and because he's been excommunicated there
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:30:01,216	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	He can't go so they have to make take like the most dangerous mode
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:02,240	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Approach
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:03,008	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Across the aisle
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:11,200	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And then finally after months of travel
EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:14,784	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	He arrives
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:17,600	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And it's some sort of Castle he arrives at where the Pope
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:19,648	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Is staying but
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:20,416	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The Pope
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:22,720	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Refuses the emperor entry
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:27,840	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	It is allegedly snowing and something like a blizzard
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:30,144	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Standing at the gates of this gas at the gates
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:31,424	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	In a blizzard
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:34,240	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	In a blizzard with his wife and small child
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:37,568	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	He stands there
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:39,104	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	3 days
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:40,384	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	3 days
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:42,176	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Fasting
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:46,784	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And the eight I decided to use there's my paintings of this and he's
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:49,600	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	He said to have taken a penitent posture
EDL	00:30:50,112	00:30:51,136	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Start again
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:55,744	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The bottling position in a sentence feeling he's wearing a hair shirt
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:31:00,608	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Which is traditionally associated with repentance and supposed to be painful and
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:04,704	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	It said that all his family take off their shoes in the snow
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:07,264	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	It's about the pope as watching this
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:10,848	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	From the castle from his nice toasty Council

EDL	00:35:31,968	00:35:32,992	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I remember it
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:39,136	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Knowing and like looking out the window of the nursery and
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:46,560	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Christmas was playing on the radio in there
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:52,960	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Just like the one and just thinking like
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:55,264	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	What has happened here
EDL	00:35:55,776	00:35:59,616	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	When Gabriel was born the doctors had learned that there was something wrong with it
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:00,384	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Brain
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:01,408	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	But they didn't know what yet
EDL	00:36:01,920	00:36:07,552	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I remember I got to go home pretty quickly I don't think I stayed there even a day
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:08,832	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And then I would go back
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:14,464	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Can see him know so he had to stay there yeah they nearly had a brain bleed and so they've got to look at
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:15,232	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	What does kids
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:16,512	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	What did you do for Christmas
EDL	00:36:16,512	00:36:17,536	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Do you celebrate Christmas
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:19,328	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Did celebrate Christmas
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:24,960	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	You know what I hardly remember at all
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:28,800	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	After couple weeks Leilani was allowed to take him home
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:32,896	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And for the first little while everything was pretty normal
EDL	00:36:33,408	00:36:34,176	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Diapers
EDL	00:36:34,176	00:36:34,688	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Long nights
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:40,576	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Yep pretty normal baby days and then he ended up where he was diagnosed
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:46,208	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	With hydrocephalus when he was 4 month old hydrocephalus what it is basically it's
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:49,536	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Fluid around the brain as someone says you can called water on them
EDL	00:36:50,048	00:36:52,096	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	When you hear your kid has hydrocephalus
EDL	00:36:52,096	00:36:54,912	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	What is that how do you envision that their future
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:56,448	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I remember the neurosurgeon
EDL	00:36:56,448	00:37:00,800	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And saying that he's never going to play football and he's never going to be drafted into the army
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:01,824	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Which
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:03,104	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Sounds great yes
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:05,152	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Winning right
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:10,784	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	It's not that serious me not necessarily but the kids is hydrocephalus like
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:11,808	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	You know they have problems
EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:13,600	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Vision problems with balance
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:20,000	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And after the single to shunt which is sort of a tube that acts like a siphon so it would drain off the excess flow
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:22,048	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Fluid in his brain and drain it down into his belly
EDL	00:37:22,560	00:37:25,120	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Wow and I could feel it like on the side of a
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:25,632	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	His neck and
EDL	00:37:26,144	00:37:29,216	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	He had a little tiny incision on his tummy where they
EDL	00:37:29,216	00:37:29,984	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Hold it down
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:32,800	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	So the shunt it seemed to do the trick
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:37,920	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Gabriel's doctors were so pleased with his progress that we went to have an ultrasound done and
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:38,944	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The doctor told us
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:39,712	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	That
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:40,480	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Our baby
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:40,992	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Had
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:44,832	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The actress starred in a commercial with the local hospital
EDL	00:37:45,344	00:37:46,880	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	That was very sweet
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:47,904	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Sweet commercial
EDL	00:37:47,904	00:37:48,928	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	We can help babies
EDL	00:37:48,928	00:37:50,464	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Before they're born
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:51,744	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Tiny little baby with a
EDL	00:37:51,744	00:37:55,328	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Scrap of blond hair up being held by a laughing doctor
EDL	00:37:55,328	00:37:55,840	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	They've made
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:37:58,656	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Feel like Celia Lonnie talking about her experience
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:04,032	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Commercial actually ends with Gabriel
EDL	00:38:04,032	00:38:05,056	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	A huge smile on his face
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:08,128	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Kind of kicking up his legs and and scooting across
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:10,432	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Hospital logo baby
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:13,760	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	This is undeniably a very
EDL	00:38:14,272	00:38:15,040	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Kit
EDL	00:38:15,040	00:38:17,088	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	She would let anyone hold him
EDL	00:38:17,088	00:38:23,488	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	His arms were always reaching out to people and so it wasn't unusual for him to get passed around
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:25,792	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Making the line at the grocery store or
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:32,704	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Seriously oh yeah because he did actually have problems with vision he would always put his hand on your face
EDL	00:38:32,704	00:38:34,240	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Some kind of like turn your face
EDL	00:38:35,008	00:38:37,056	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I don't know if he was doing that so if he

EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:49,600	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	He would do that and
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:52,160	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And people would recognize him
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:55,744	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And people would say oh he's the miracle baby and
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:38:57,024	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I can't he is
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:39:00,096	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	When did you first notice that there was a
EDL	00:39:00,096	00:39:00,608	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Problem
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:09,568	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Thursday I remember is a Thursday Gabriel was 20 months old and I had been told
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:12,640	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	That if he started throwing up to take him to the emergency
EDL	00:39:12,640	00:39:13,152	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	State Department
EDL	00:39:13,664	00:39:14,176	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And
EDL	00:39:14,944	00:39:16,480	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	He was throwing up alot
EDL	00:39:16,480	00:39:22,112	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	A lot he had no fever he didn't have diarrhea but he was throwing up alot to come to a nearby house
EDL	00:39:22,112	00:39:26,208	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Hospital rejected the first of two hospitals that will play a role in this story but
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:31,328	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Anyway when she got in there the rest of my fleet Haley took an x-ray and everything looked fine
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:33,376	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	So he ends up being hospitalized
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:38,752	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Treated for stomach flu given anti-nausea medication
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:41,312	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	He was still really sleepy
EDL	00:39:41,312	00:39:42,592	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And
EDL	00:39:43,104	00:39:44,384	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I had a previously
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:48,224	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	We scheduled an appointment with the neurosurgeon on Monday afternoon this was
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:49,248	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	4 days later
EDL	00:39:49,248	00:39:53,088	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I walked in and my mom was holding Gabriel and dr. Edwards
EDL	00:39:53,088	00:39:54,368	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Takes one look at him
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:39:57,440	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And he said why did no-one call me
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:00,000	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	What was he seeing
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:03,328	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	He just saw a really sleepy beautiful little
EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:07,936	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Sick baby immediately knew that something had gone wrong with the shunt
EDL	00:40:08,448	00:40:10,752	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The fluid was building up and Gabriel's brain
EDL	00:40:10,752	00:40:11,264	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:13,056	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Then it was
EDL	00:40:14,592	00:40:15,104	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Bad
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:23,040	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Leilani needed to get him to a specialist fast so she she put them in a car seat in the back of her car and drove all the way
EDL	00:40:23,040	00:40:24,320	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Stanford
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:25,344	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	5 hours away
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:27,904	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Yeah and he sounded like a little kitten
EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:29,952	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Kind of like
EDL	00:40:29,952	00:40:32,000	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Mm Ewing like not really crying
EDL	00:40:33,280	00:40:33,792	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	But just
EDL	00:40:36,608	00:40:37,632	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And I remember getting
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:38,912	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Stuck on the Bay Bridge
EDL	00:40:39,680	00:40:44,800	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And just wondering can the Navy Seals come rescue me I have this is a traffic jam near 2nd
EDL	00:40:45,568	00:40:46,592	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Yeah
EDL	00:40:46,592	00:40:47,360	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Cod
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:47,872	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Yeah
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:51,968	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Did you make it to the hospital to check in and get a room
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:54,784	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Finally Leilani just
EDL	00:40:54,784	00:40:55,808	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Allows yourself
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:41:01,440	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Take a breath so you were sitting in a chair that was like right next to his bed or you given enough
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:02,464	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	You were okay
EDL	00:41:02,464	00:41:05,536	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Just like a regular one that would like
EDL	00:41:05,536	00:41:09,632	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	One of those turquoise blue naugahyde recliners you know like
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:11,936	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	You're sitting straight or your lying down
EDL	00:41:14,496	00:41:16,032	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Gabriel's lying in bed
EDL	00:41:16,032	00:41:22,432	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	We were on the Telemetry unit so that means they're monitoring his heartbeat and is breathing really closely so we had
EDL	00:41:22,432	00:41:23,712	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	At the little monitors on him
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:25,760	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	He falls asleep
EDL	00:41:25,760	00:41:26,784	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And so does she
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:33,184	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	But any time there would be any change in his breathing or his heart rate or any even little kind of
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:33,952	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Twitch
EDL	00:41:35,488	00:41:38,304	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	These alarms on the monitors would just go off
EDL	00:41:38,304	00:41:42,144	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Like I would wake him up and it would make
EDL	00:41:42,144	00:41:43,936	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Be up to nurse would come in
EDL	00:41:43,936	00:41:44,448	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Check him
EDL	00:41:44,960	00:41:46,240	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Make sure everything's okay
EDL	00:41:47,008	00:41:48,288	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Leave the room and
EDL	00:41:49,568	00:41:52,640	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Just as they were settling back into sleep
EDL	00:41:52,640	00:41:58,015	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	This this kept happening over and over and over again
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:41:59,551	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And so the nurse
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:03,647	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	When I think about her now I think of like a bird
EDL	00:42:04,159	00:42:05,439	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Leica
EDL	00:42:05,439	00:42:07,999	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Like a swallow one of those really like
EDL	00:42:08,767	00:42:09,279	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Bass
EDL	00:42:09,791	00:42:10,815	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Moving
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:12,863	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Birds that's really Nimble and
EDL	00:42:13,375	00:42:14,399	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And quick and can
EDL	00:42:14,399	00:42:15,167	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Switch Direction
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:16,703	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Really fast
EDL	00:42:17,215	00:42:18,239	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Because she was
EDL	00:42:19,519	00:42:21,311	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	In and Out In and Out in and out
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:23,871	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	So much and now I know
EDL	00:42:23,871	00:42:27,455	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	But she was taking care of another really really sick little girl
EDL	00:42:27,455	00:42:29,759	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And taking care of Gabriel and I at the same time
EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:32,063	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Sochi
EDL	00:42:33,087	00:42:34,623	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	She said I'm going to turn off the
EDL	00:42:34,623	00:42:35,647	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The sound on the alarms
EDL	00:42:38,207	00:42:39,743	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Understand turn the sound off
EDL	00:42:39,743	00:42:40,767	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Thin hair which I
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:43,839	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Really appreciated and I thank
EDL	00:42:43,839	00:42:44,863	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Turf or that
EDL	00:42:45,631	00:42:47,423	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Because I really wanted to go see
EDL	00:42:47,423	00:42:47,935	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Sleep
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:52,031	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	So I fall asleep
EDL	00:42:52,031	00:42:53,311	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And
EDL	00:42:54,079	00:43:00,479	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And then the next thing I remember is she walks in and she grabs the foot of the recliner
EDL	00:43:00,479	00:43:03,295	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	With her left hand as she's walking past me and she's
EDL	00:43:03,295	00:43:04,575	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Swings it around
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:06,367	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And she said Leilani you have to get up
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:10,975	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	She could see the flat lines
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:11,999	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	On the monitor
EDL	00:43:13,023	00:43:14,303	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Because his heart had stopped
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:14,815	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Speeding
EDL	00:43:16,095	00:43:16,863	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Then
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:19,423	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Code blue is on the intercom and Q
EDL	00:43:20,191	00:43:22,239	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Hooked to machines and he's not
EDL	00:43:22,239	00:43:24,031	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Squeezing my hand and he doesn't
EDL	00:43:24,031	00:43:25,055	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Feel warm and
EDL	00:43:25,567	00:43:26,591	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And someone
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:28,895	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Takes me out and I'm in the hallway and
EDL	00:43:31,455	00:43:35,295	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	You know I don't know I don't know if I thought about this
EDL	00:43:35,807	00:43:40,159	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Later or if I thought about it in in the time you know how you go back and you
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:45,535	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	You're sure you remember something in the moment but I don't know that I remember this in
EDL	00:43:47,071	00:43:50,911	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I remember just kind of this like him saying goodbye to me
EDL	00:43:50,911	00:43:51,423	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	At that time
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:52,447	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Really
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:54,495	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Yeah
EDL	00:43:54,495	00:43:55,519	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	What what do you mean
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:43:57,823	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Kind of like
EDL	00:43:59,103	00:44:00,895	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Like this gentle sort of
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:04,479	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Like this is up to you now Mom
EDL	00:44:04,479	00:44:04,991	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	You know
EDL	00:44:08,319	00:44:11,135	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I mean you're connected right it really connected
EDL	00:44:11,903	00:44:13,951	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And when part of that connection
EDL	00:44:13,951	00:44:14,975	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Is gone you feel that
EDL	00:44:32,895	00:44:35,455	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Leilani says in the wake of Gabriel's death
EDL	00:44:35,455	00:44:38,015	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	She's all the regular things you do when someone dies
EDL	00:44:38,783	00:44:39,807	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Therapy
EDL	00:44:39,807	00:44:40,831	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And in her case
EDL	00:44:40,831	00:44:42,623	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	A lot of snowboarding
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:43,391	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Snowboarding
EDL	00:44:44,671	00:44:45,183	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Yeah
EDL	00:44:46,207	00:44:46,719	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Yeah
EDL	00:44:47,231	00:44:49,023	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	White snow and blue sky was
EDL	00:44:49,535	00:44:51,327	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	All that really could compute
EDL	00:44:51,327	00:44:53,631	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	But she said in those first few days and weeks
EDL	00:44:54,143	00:44:55,167	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Following Gabriel's death
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:58,751	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	She just kept playing over and over in your mind
EDL	00:44:59,263	00:45:02,335	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	What went wrong what what happened at those two Hospital
EDL	00:45:02,847	00:45:03,359	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Yeah
EDL	00:45:04,127	00:45:08,735	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	So the first hospital where Gabriel shunt failure was misdiagnosed as stomach
EDL	00:45:08,735	00:45:10,783	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	This is the hospital where
EDL	00:45:11,295	00:45:11,807	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The nurses
EDL	00:45:12,319	00:45:13,087	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Parents
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:17,695	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The commercial was for this Hospital commercials just stopped
EDL	00:45:20,511	00:45:21,023	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Wow
EDL	00:45:21,791	00:45:23,839	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	What is so then yeah what happened next
EDL	00:45:24,607	00:45:25,375	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Nothing happened
EDL	00:45:26,911	00:45:32,287	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	She just basically heard nothing from them how did it feel when you were shut out like that
EDL	00:45:32,287	00:45:33,567	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	What made me really angry
EDL	00:45:34,079	00:45:35,871	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	It made me feel like they
EDL	00:45:36,895	00:45:42,015	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Where did nine that Gabriel even existed or that his life had any importance at all
EDL	00:45:43,295	00:45:44,063	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The fact that
EDL	00:45:44,063	00:45:44,831	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	He died
EDL	00:45:46,367	00:45:47,135	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	That
EDL	00:45:47,135	00:45:49,439	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Wasn't enough reason for them to
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:50,463	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	To talk to me I just
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:57,631	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	It still makes me angry you know I wouldn't I would purposely drive around the house
EDL	00:45:57,631	00:46:04,031	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Hospital I would not drive past it so I reached out to this hospital for comment and they act
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:10,431	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Declines to get one so I can't be sure but part of the reason they made out of reach out to Leilani
EDL	00:46:10,431	00:46:15,551	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Is because it's hospital is located in Nevada and Nevada is one of those states that
EDL	00:46:15,551	00:46:17,599	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Does not have apology legislation
EDL	00:46:17,599	00:46:19,391	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	So you're not protected if you apologize
EDL	00:46:20,415	00:46:22,207	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	But California
EDL	00:46:22,207	00:46:22,975	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Does have a lot
EDL	00:46:23,999	00:46:26,303	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	So under the California lot you can say things like
EDL	00:46:26,815	00:46:28,095	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I'm sorry
EDL	00:46:28,095	00:46:31,935	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I feel bad a bee cannot say I'm sorry it was
EDL	00:46:31,935	00:46:33,471	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Our fault we made a mistake
EDL	00:46:33,471	00:46:35,519	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	That parking still be used against you in court
EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:38,591	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Brings us to the second house
EDL	00:46:39,103	00:46:41,151	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Stanford
EDL	00:46:41,151	00:46:45,503	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Reach out to me right away they invited her back to the hospital I had a lot of
EDL	00:46:45,503	00:46:48,063	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Questions and I brought all of them I like print
EDL	00:46:48,063	00:46:53,439	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	It's about loud I had photos of Gabriel So at 2 months after Gabriel died
EDL	00:46:53,439	00:46:55,743	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Leilani carrying these photos
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:46:57,535	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Walked into Stanford
EDL	00:46:58,047	00:47:00,607	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Do you remember what the expression on her face was
EDL	00:47:02,655	00:47:03,167	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Just
EDL	00:47:03,679	00:47:04,959	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Caprese chicken
EDL	00:47:04,959	00:47:07,007	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	This is Pam Wells you know you just
EDL	00:47:07,007	00:47:09,311	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	There's a look about people are crazy stricken
EDL	00:47:09,311	00:47:12,127	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	At the time and was head of nursing at Stanford
EDL	00:47:12,127	00:47:18,527	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Not day she two doctors in a hospital administrator set down around a table with Leilani
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:22,623	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The small table that could have said maybe eight people have you ever met her before
EDL	00:47:23,903	00:47:26,975	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I've never met her before I really know what
EDL	00:47:26,975	00:47:32,863	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	My intention was but I do remember I said after you tell me everything you need to say to me I want
EDL	00:47:32,863	00:47:36,191	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	How to say some things to you and they said why don't you say what you have
EDL	00:47:36,191	00:47:36,703	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	To say first
EDL	00:47:37,471	00:47:43,871	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I said I felt like I had been prepared to take care of a kid who had hydrocephalus she said on Gabriel and I arrived at Stanford
EDL	00:47:43,871	00:47:46,175	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	There was no one waiting for us there
EDL	00:47:46,687	00:47:52,319	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Had to get checked in the neurosurgeon news on call should have seen Gabriel. Night. Come by
EDL	00:47:52,831	00:47:53,343	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	End
EDL	00:47:53,855	00:47:54,879	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Just more generally
EDL	00:47:55,647	00:48:02,047	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I trusted you guys I just needed to get in here right like I got him here now somebody else is going to make sure
EDL	00:48:02,047	00:48:03,071	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Sure everything's okay
EDL	00:48:03,583	00:48:05,631	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And that's not what happened
EDL	00:48:08,191	00:48:10,239	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	This was a critical moment for Stanford
EDL	00:48:10,239	00:48:14,591	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	It wasn't usual that time to meet with families after something that happened
EDL	00:48:14,591	00:48:20,991	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	For obvious reasons I mean if a doctor or a nurse said anything in that meeting that even remotely resembled admitting that they screwed up
EDL	00:48:20,991	00:48:23,039	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	That could be used against them in court
EDL	00:48:23,551	00:48:26,367	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And so mostly hospital just avoided these meetings all together
EDL	00:48:27,391	00:48:27,903	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	But
EDL	00:48:28,415	00:48:31,743	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Right around the time that Gabriel died bar Quality Inn
EDL	00:48:31,743	00:48:37,375	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Bridge Department cabin talking to us about taking a different approach and approach that was actually led by Lee Taft
EDL	00:48:38,143	00:48:40,447	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And the thinking was going to be open
EDL	00:48:40,447	00:48:41,471	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Let's be transparent
EDL	00:48:42,751	00:48:43,519	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Forget the law
EDL	00:48:44,287	00:48:45,311	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And so after this
EDL	00:48:45,823	00:48:50,431	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Is like moments after Leilani cerilles off all of her grievances
EDL	00:48:50,943	00:48:51,455	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Pam
EDL	00:48:52,223	00:48:53,247	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Looks are in the eye
EDL	00:48:53,759	00:48:54,271	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And says
EDL	00:48:55,039	00:48:55,807	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	We are
EDL	00:48:56,319	00:48:57,087	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Barry
EDL	00:48:58,111	00:48:59,135	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Let me rephrase that
EDL	00:49:00,927	00:49:01,951	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	We are so sorry
EDL	00:49:02,719	00:49:04,767	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	This happened in this terrible thing happened
EDL	00:49:06,047	00:49:07,071	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	No family
EDL	00:49:07,071	00:49:08,351	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Should ever go through
EDL	00:49:08,863	00:49:10,399	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	This kind of loss
EDL	00:49:10,399	00:49:11,679	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Imperfectly not into Beast
EDL	00:49:11,679	00:49:12,191	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Cancel

EDL	00:49:28,831	00:49:30,111	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Were committed
EDL	00:49:30,623	00:49:31,391	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	2
EDL	00:49:32,415	00:49:33,183	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Not only

EDL	00:49:36,511	00:49:39,327	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Only investigating what happened and
EDL	00:49:39,327	00:49:40,863	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Want to make sure
EDL	00:49:41,375	00:49:42,143	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	That
EDL	00:49:42,143	00:49:44,703	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	We can put some things in place so that this
EDL	00:49:45,215	00:49:47,519	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Never happens to another child or family
EDL	00:49:49,055	00:49:49,823	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And they went
EDL	00:49:49,823	00:49:50,847	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	One step further
EDL	00:49:51,871	00:49:55,199	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The situation that led to
EDL	00:49:55,711	00:49:56,735	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Gabriel's death
EDL	00:49:56,735	00:49:57,503	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Was
EDL	00:49:57,503	00:49:58,271	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The
EDL	00:50:00,063	00:50:00,575	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The
EDL	00:50:01,855	00:50:04,927	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Gabriel is on a monitor the alarm skip
EDL	00:50:04,927	00:50:05,695	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Going off
EDL	00:50:05,695	00:50:07,999	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The nurse and the room turned the alarm off
EDL	00:50:08,511	00:50:09,279	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Not
EDL	00:50:09,279	00:50:10,559	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Knowing
EDL	00:50:10,559	00:50:12,607	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	That it turned off all the alarm
EDL	00:50:13,375	00:50:14,655	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The nurse in the room that night
EDL	00:50:15,935	00:50:20,543	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	When she went to turn off the alarm next to Gabriel's bed to allow Leilani and Gabriel to sleep
EDL	00:50:21,055	00:50:24,383	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	She also accidentally turned off the alarm on a pager
EDL	00:50:24,895	00:50:25,919	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And at the nurses
EDL	00:50:25,919	00:50:27,199	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Station info
EDL	00:50:27,199	00:50:31,039	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	He wasn't being monitored any really needed to be monitored and subsequently
EDL	00:50:33,087	00:50:36,159	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Something in our system contributed to this
EDL	00:50:36,159	00:50:36,927	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Poor Boys.
EDL	00:50:37,439	00:50:38,463	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	In other words
EDL	00:50:38,463	00:50:39,231	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	We made a mistake
EDL	00:50:39,743	00:50:41,791	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Stanford had just admitted that
EDL	00:50:41,791	00:50:42,303	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Finally
EDL	00:50:42,815	00:50:46,399	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I would have dancing around the issue at all and so with the head just done is
EDL	00:50:46,399	00:50:47,423	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Give Leilani evidence
EDL	00:50:47,935	00:50:49,215	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Evidence that she could
EDL	00:50:49,215	00:50:50,751	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Take the court and use against them
EDL	00:50:50,751	00:50:54,847	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	If you want to do I know she was checking me out I know she was trying to understand
EDL	00:50:55,359	00:50:56,127	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Whether she could
EDL	00:50:56,127	00:50:56,639	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Trust me
EDL	00:50:57,151	00:50:59,711	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	There's no question in my mind that that was
EDL	00:51:00,479	00:51:01,503	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Going through her head
EDL	00:51:02,015	00:51:02,783	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And
EDL	00:51:02,783	00:51:04,575	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I was doing whatever I could
EDL	00:51:05,087	00:51:05,855	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	2
EDL	00:51:05,855	00:51:07,135	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Communicate that
EDL	00:51:07,135	00:51:08,415	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Yes you can
EDL	00:51:08,415	00:51:09,439	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I'm going to help you
EDL	00:51:10,975	00:51:11,743	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I want to help you
EDL	00:51:17,631	00:51:20,447	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I don't remember a lot of the words
EDL	00:51:21,983	00:51:22,751	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	But
EDL	00:51:22,751	00:51:24,543	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I remember how I felt
EDL	00:51:26,079	00:51:27,615	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Imagine like you you like you wants to tile
EDL	00:51:28,383	00:51:29,919	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And the wrong door apologize
EDL	00:51:29,919	00:51:30,943	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Read that can be
EDL	00:51:31,455	00:51:32,735	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Almost like a religious
EDL	00:51:33,503	00:51:34,015	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Moment
EDL	00:51:35,551	00:51:38,367	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I mean really bad has happened to you in the offender is now in a way like
EDL	00:51:39,135	00:51:41,695	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Humbly and vulnerably
EDL	00:51:41,695	00:51:42,463	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Kneeling before
EDL	00:51:43,487	00:51:44,767	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I felt that they listen
EDL	00:51:44,767	00:51:45,279	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Tumi
EDL	00:51:46,047	00:51:52,447	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And I felt that they genuinely cared about me and my family and about Gabriel
EDL	00:51:52,447	00:51:54,239	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And I still feel that
EDL	00:51:54,239	00:51:56,543	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Leilani accepted their apology
EDL	00:51:56,543	00:51:58,079	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	She never filed a suit
EDL	00:51:58,079	00:52:04,479	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I should say that that Stanford did a lot more than just apologized they they reach out to other hospitals had this Monitor and
EDL	00:52:04,479	00:52:06,527	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Alerted them of the problems or whatever
EDL	00:52:06,527	00:52:07,807	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Mercante another kid
EDL	00:52:07,807	00:52:10,623	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I'm in also the relationship between Pam and Leilani like
EDL	00:52:10,623	00:52:13,695	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Remain very strong they still are in touch to this day
EDL	00:52:14,207	00:52:15,487	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And all those things are important but
EDL	00:52:15,487	00:52:16,767	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The thing is
EDL	00:52:16,767	00:52:18,303	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Since Leilani is hot
EDL	00:52:18,303	00:52:19,583	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Experience
EDL	00:52:19,583	00:52:22,655	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Stanford and a few other hospitals to do this full disclosure thing
EDL	00:52:23,167	00:52:24,191	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	What they found
EDL	00:52:24,191	00:52:30,335	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Time and time again is that people get an explanation and an apology they are far far less likely to see
EDL	00:52:30,847	00:52:32,639	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And therefore those Hospital save
EDL	00:52:33,407	00:52:34,175	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Money
EDL	00:52:34,175	00:52:34,687	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	A lot of money
EDL	00:52:35,199	00:52:39,295	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And I guess you know you could think about it and so self-serving way
EDL	00:52:39,295	00:52:41,855	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	If it saves money to apologize
EDL	00:52:42,367	00:52:47,487	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	You know what is the motivation behind these apologies and humid in the circuit board room at Stanford somewhere with
EDL	00:52:47,487	00:52:52,095	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	These people in suits making decisions about whether or not they want their doctors and nurses to apologize
EDL	00:52:52,095	00:52:54,655	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And the motivation behind that I guess
EDL	00:52:54,655	00:52:55,935	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	It makes you feel a little
EDL	00:52:55,935	00:52:56,447	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Weird
EDL	00:52:57,471	00:52:59,519	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	But but when I asked leahlani about this
EDL	00:53:00,031	00:53:02,335	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	She just said like if money is a driving force
EDL	00:53:02,335	00:53:03,615	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I don't care about it at all
EDL	00:53:04,383	00:53:05,151	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I don't care
EDL	00:53:05,919	00:53:08,223	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I don't care about the motivation I would love it
EDL	00:53:08,991	00:53:10,271	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I would love it if
EDL	00:53:10,783	00:53:13,343	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Human connection was the motivation
EDL	00:53:13,343	00:53:14,623	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	But I know that it's not
EDL	00:53:15,391	00:53:17,439	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And the fact that this is
EDL	00:53:17,439	00:53:18,975	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Makes good business sense
EDL	00:53:20,255	00:53:21,791	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	If that's what drives people
EDL	00:53:24,095	00:53:25,631	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I will get on board
EDL	00:53:34,847	00:53:35,359	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	For me
EDL	00:53:35,871	00:53:38,431	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I guess what happened between Leilani
EDL	00:53:38,431	00:53:41,503	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And the doctors and the nurses at Stanford Hospital
EDL	00:53:41,503	00:53:44,831	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I know the cops because I was I was working on this apology piece
EDL	00:53:44,831	00:53:51,231	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Kipling I had to choose between music Bad apologies I was seeing or no apology.
EDL	00:53:51,231	00:53:51,999	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Either of those are good
EDL	00:53:52,511	00:53:58,911	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Or just trying to compare these like super corporate apologies to some sort of moment that the head deep meaning for the
EDL	00:53:58,911	00:54:00,959	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Two people involved these humans faces
EDL	00:54:02,495	00:54:05,567	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And I don't know I guess I guess what does Pam and Leilani apology
EDL	00:54:07,359	00:54:09,407	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Just felt To Me lyrics
EDL	00:54:09,407	00:54:10,431	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	This new thing
EDL	00:54:11,199	00:54:12,223	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	New Way Forward
EDL	00:54:13,503	00:54:16,063	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	It certainly felt that way to Leilani and in fact
EDL	00:54:16,575	00:54:20,927	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Several years after that meeting she became a Patient Liaison
EDL	00:54:20,927	00:54:21,439	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Stanford
EDL	00:54:21,951	00:54:24,255	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Her job is now to sit in that conference room
EDL	00:54:24,767	00:54:26,815	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And do for others what Pam did
EDL	00:54:28,095	00:54:32,191	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And the 20th and 21st century you got
EDL	00:54:32,959	00:54:36,287	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Inhumanity from staring into the abyss
EDL	00:54:37,055	00:54:38,079	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Of
EDL	00:54:38,079	00:54:41,663	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Maybe there is no God and maybe this is all meaningless
EDL	00:54:42,687	00:54:45,759	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	You know there is a kind of searching for what are values
EDL	00:54:46,527	00:54:47,807	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Do we have shared values
EDL	00:54:48,575	00:54:50,111	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Are there values other than
EDL	00:54:50,623	00:54:53,439	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The competition for money and resources
EDL	00:54:53,951	00:54:54,719	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I'm what
EDL	00:54:54,719	00:54:56,255	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	What do we stand for
EDL	00:54:56,767	00:54:59,327	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	When it comes time to die like what
EDL	00:54:59,839	00:55:02,911	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	What did my life mean what values does it have
EDL	00:55:03,935	00:55:07,519	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And this is an important like a process that like humanity is going through
EDL	00:55:08,287	00:55:09,055	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And
EDL	00:55:10,591	00:55:12,383	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	It's like we're reaching back to these
EDL	00:55:14,431	00:55:15,711	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Traditions of repentance
EDL	00:55:16,735	00:55:19,039	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	To try to find some shared ground
EDL	00:55:19,039	00:55:25,439	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Like some shared even secular ground and the call to apologize is like no we have to
EDL	00:55:25,439	00:55:26,207	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	To share these values
EDL	00:55:26,719	00:55:27,999	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	These are the thing
EDL	00:55:27,999	00:55:29,791	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	That's going to hold us together
EDL	00:55:44,895	00:55:45,407	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Nice work
EDL	00:55:47,455	00:55:52,831	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I don't know I I don't know it's a good question but
EDL	00:55:52,831	00:55:54,367	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Actually I think I
EDL	00:55:54,367	00:55:56,671	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Feel like I am beginning to
EDL	00:55:56,671	00:55:58,207	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	You peel back the layers of this
EDL	00:55:58,975	00:56:00,767	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Incredibly complicated country
EDL	00:56:01,279	00:56:02,559	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Speaking of which
EDL	00:56:02,559	00:56:04,607	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	During my reporting actually stumbled
EDL	00:56:04,607	00:56:05,119	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Upon this
EDL	00:56:05,631	00:56:06,911	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Very very mad
EDL	00:56:06,911	00:56:07,679	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Kerrigan
EDL	00:56:07,679	00:56:12,799	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Little moment in history it's so so apparently during Michael Dukakis run for president
EDL	00:56:12,799	00:56:18,943	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	There's this looks very very negative ad campaign guy who got out of prison and this is one of these
EDL	00:56:19,711	00:56:20,991	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Worst negative ads
EDL	00:56:21,503	00:56:23,039	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Of all-time exit one of the first
EDL	00:56:23,551	00:56:25,599	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And it and it I think it ended his campaign
EDL	00:56:26,111	00:56:29,183	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Right there was a man running for president named George Bush
EDL	00:56:29,183	00:56:33,535	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Lee Atwater was his campaign manager they put an ad on television
EDL	00:56:33,535	00:56:37,887	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	The television ad said look what's happening in America people are criminals are being released
EDL	00:56:38,399	00:56:44,799	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	On furlough and then they're doing terrible things in this case
EDL	00:56:44,799	00:56:46,847	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Play Don to the Democrat Democrat
EDL	00:56:48,639	00:56:51,967	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Sorry it was so unfair like they blamed Governor Dukakis
EDL	00:56:52,735	00:56:54,015	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	For essentially
EDL	00:56:54,015	00:56:55,551	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Play causing the rape of the
EDL	00:56:55,551	00:56:56,063	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	This woman
EDL	00:56:56,575	00:56:59,391	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	When he didn't even create the program that allowed the guy to get out of
EDL	00:57:00,671	00:57:01,951	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	But that was created before him
EDL	00:57:02,463	00:57:03,487	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	But it was also
EDL	00:57:03,487	00:57:05,279	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Obviously racist Romanian
EDL	00:57:05,279	00:57:08,351	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Black guy attacking a white woman and so on so forth
EDL	00:57:08,863	00:57:10,143	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I mean speaks for itself
EDL	00:57:10,143	00:57:12,703	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	So when I was talking to Governor Dukakis the sex
EDL	00:57:12,703	00:57:14,239	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	She came up that water was a tough guy
EDL	00:57:15,007	00:57:16,543	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And he was an attacker
EDL	00:57:16,543	00:57:22,175	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And he told me that Lee Atwater years later on his deathbed he decided he wanted to
EDL	00:57:22,943	00:57:23,711	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Repent
EDL	00:57:23,711	00:57:24,223	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Freddy's
EDL	00:57:24,735	00:57:27,807	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Sins that he felt he had done in his life and one of those was making
EDL	00:57:27,807	00:57:28,831	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Willie Horton ad
EDL	00:57:28,831	00:57:31,903	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Really so we actually apologized what did he say
EDL	00:57:32,671	00:57:33,695	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Publicly and
EDL	00:57:34,463	00:57:35,487	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	2 mi
EDL	00:57:35,487	00:57:36,255	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Campaign manager
EDL	00:57:36,767	00:57:37,279	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Ready
EDL	00:57:37,791	00:57:38,559	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Regretted it
EDL	00:57:38,559	00:57:39,839	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And what did that mean to you
EDL	00:57:41,119	00:57:44,191	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Well I can't tell you that made me feel great cuz
EDL	00:57:44,191	00:57:45,727	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	You know I lost that race
EDL	00:57:46,239	00:57:48,543	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And a lot of it had to do with at a camp
EDL	00:57:49,311	00:57:49,823	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I never
EDL	00:57:50,335	00:57:50,847	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Having
EDL	00:57:51,615	00:57:54,431	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	I didn't feel any better but looked at least he was wanting to do that
EDL	00:57:55,455	00:57:58,015	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	What does that mean when you say at least he was going to do that
EDL	00:57:58,015	00:57:59,039	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Well I think you
EDL	00:57:59,039	00:58:00,063	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	At least it was one of those
EDL	00:58:00,063	00:58:00,575	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Knowledge
EDL	00:58:01,087	00:58:03,391	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Did was racist and he said sewing
EDL	00:58:03,903	00:58:04,671	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	And apologize for
EDL	00:58:06,463	00:58:07,743	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	That at least deserve some
EDL	00:58:09,023	00:58:09,791	| radiolab_podcast18_apologetical |	Some fries but
