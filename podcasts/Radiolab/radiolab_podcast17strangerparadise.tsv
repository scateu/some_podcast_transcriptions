EDL	00:05:57,375	00:06:01,215	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	So next thing I decide to try is okay let's put some traps out in
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:02,751	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	We tried to trap some
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:04,799	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	But there are smart
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:06,847	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	The big metal sword a tripwire
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:09,151	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	But the one day there was no trap
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:12,991	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	We found the trapper in the woods and it was all bent up
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:16,063	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	We did they run away with the truth
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:22,463	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	The raccoons were actually destroying that sometimes we just
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:23,487	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	I decided okay
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:27,327	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Had to try the dogs guard dog put their dogs in the field
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:33,215	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	By the next day when we came it was it was it was it was
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:37,055	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	The raccoons killed one of your dog exactly
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:40,895	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	All of his intestines were outside so it was a jewel to the death
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:47,551	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	So you know what kind of animal dealing with
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:50,367	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	This confirmed every feeling I have about raccoons
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:52,159	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	They're not just clever they're fierce
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:58,559	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Good and bad in everyone of these are obviously not very nice raccoons and if I were

EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:11,359	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Campaign I
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:16,479	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	But when I floated this idea by them
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:19,039	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	If I was you I would want to kill those raccoon
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:21,599	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	They just kind of looked at me funny
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:25,695	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Killing them
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:26,719	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	It's a little love
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:28,767	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	A little harsh

EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:56,223	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	One day Miller was just hanging out in his office when a box turtle
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:57,503	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Guadalupe
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:02,879	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	And he opened it up and found very much dead raccoon
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:04,927	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Misshapen
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:11,327	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Skin I like in a company's called This is a kristofer Helgen curator of mammals at the national museum of natural
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:13,119	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Drunk History part of the Smithsonian
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:16,447	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Douching actually has the same job that Miller had back in 1911
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:17,215	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Anyway
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:22,079	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	This raccoon that Miller had in front of him looks a lot like the North American raccoon
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,103	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	But it was small
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,383	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	And
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:25,407	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Different in
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,175	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Quite subtle ways
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:27,455	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	And so
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:32,831	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	We left large Miller baptized Olympian raccoon existing species
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:34,879	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Scientific name

EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:39,487	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Guadalupe and Recker
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:44,351	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Putting a name on it and recognizing it is a new species implied a deep history
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:45,119	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Of
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:49,727	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	The presence of raccoons in Guadeloupe hundreds of thousands if not millions of years
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:53,823	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Have it over these Millennia these raccoons have evolved into their own distinct species
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:55,103	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Found nowhere else
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:56,895	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	So is that
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:11:01,247	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	When do the Guadalupe is begin to love raccoons when they realize they had their own
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:06,623	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	No one and only yeah but it took awhile to catch on I mean
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:09,951	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	This discovery was with initially only being talked about in these
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:12,255	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Arcane academic scientific journals
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:16,863	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	It's not like this discovery was on the width on the front page of the guadalupian x or anyting
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:20,191	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	But then in the 1980s
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:23,007	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Conservation really came into its own
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:25,311	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Scientist started worrying about us
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:27,615	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	How about species disappearing from the planet
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:28,895	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Any particular
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:30,431	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	I started worrying about
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:34,015	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	This raccoon these raccoons and I were being recognized as
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:35,039	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Potentially endanger
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:37,343	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	F****** their only on these islands there
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:38,879	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Probably aren't that many of them
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:40,159	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Like we got a
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:40,671	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Hectic
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:42,207	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Sza
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:47,839	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Sol de Guadeloupe is an overseas French Department France
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:49,631	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Decided to do just that
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:54,239	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	February 17th 1989 legislation was created to
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,263	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Detective raccoon
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:12:01,407	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Shortly after the passage of this law Guadalupe open
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:03,199	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Pittsburgh National Park
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:07,039	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	And the raccoon became the mascot
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:09,087	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	The symbol of the National Party
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:12,159	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Animal sympathy
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:17,791	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	And as the mascot of this new National Park became that symbol of
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:19,327	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Protected species
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,607	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	It was a celebrated
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:24,191	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	More like okay nice wheel of the raccoon
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:29,055	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	In more than just a symbol of the importance of
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:31,615	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Protecting the natural environment of Guadalupe
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:35,455	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Overtime the raccoon became in a way
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,991	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	A symbol of Guadalupe
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:37,759	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Itself
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:41,343	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Who is it that it's really that simple for people like
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:44,671	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	You can definitely see it as the Bold evil in the US
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:48,255	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Aside from raccoons
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:49,535	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	You didn't really have
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:53,119	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Hardly any other mammals that are native to these islands apart from bats
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:13:00,031	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	And so if the raccoon is the one furry Critter running around that everyone can point to and say this is something
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:00,799	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Special
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:03,615	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	No this is not the same as a raccoon you'll find anywhere else
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:07,711	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	That is an exciting thing is a powerful thing and
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:08,735	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	A point of pride
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,039	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	I mean we're not
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:14,879	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Suck it

EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:41,056	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	That there was a raccoon in the air
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:45,152	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	And I suddenly realized it when I
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:47,712	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	All of the officers were very on it
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:51,040	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Going to live
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:53,344	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Why can't we just just take the raccoon
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:54,880	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	For safety reasons

EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:06,144	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Tell me what was going on in that second situation cuz I have a lot of it was over my head
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:08,960	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	I mean he's really understanding the context of the setting
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:09,728	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	I mean
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:12,288	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	This is not just a police I mean it's

EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:47,872	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	I would have taken my my husband's gone and I would have

EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:21,568	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	The behind-the-scenes area
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:23,360	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Where are the real Treasures are store
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:25,152	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Can we take a quick detour
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:26,688	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	So I can explain what he means by that
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:29,504	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Okay so scientist
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:35,392	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Taxonomists their job is to name and differentiate species writing so how did they do that well
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:37,184	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Let's let's talk about sharks
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:39,232	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Because sharks are kind of cool animals Brighton
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:44,096	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Imagine there's a shark species it's swimming around its having a great time and
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:45,120	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	At some point
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:47,936	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Half of the sharks in this shark population decide to leave
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:49,472	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	To go somewhere else
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:52,288	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	I don't know they go to deeper waters or to a different ocean
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:58,688	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Get cut off from the their previous shark family they don't see him for a long time and over thousands
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:27:05,088	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Or maybe a million years they actually start evolving on their own as third of a new a new type of shark
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:08,160	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Become different enough that they've become a new species
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:10,464	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	That's what the scientists come in and try to figure out
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:16,352	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	How do they make a determination basically it's a comparison game
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:18,656	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	They compare him to the old trucks do they look
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:19,680	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	The same are there
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:21,728	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Dorsal fins taller or shorter
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:25,824	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	They look at how they how they behave in the water how they move through the world is that different
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:27,360	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Now it is all even just do genetic
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:31,456	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	If they decide it is a new species of shark
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:40,416	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	At that point they do this sort of wacky thing that I had no idea about what they've decided that this
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:43,232	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	The shark is a new species scientist will go and kill one of the
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:45,024	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	They will stuff it
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:45,792	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Put it in a box
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:50,144	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	And then they will store it in a locked cabinet in a natural history museum
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:52,704	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Because
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:53,472	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Ever After
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:55,008	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	For hundreds of years
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:57,568	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	That specimen becomes
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:58,848	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Kind of a gold standard
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:27:59,616	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	The definition
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:01,408	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Of that species
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:05,248	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	There's a difference
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:06,528	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Key
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:07,296	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Four types another
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:09,344	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Every kind of
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:10,624	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Moth or might
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:13,184	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Smallest mammal in Ivory Oak
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:14,208	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Free
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:17,024	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Every kind of zebra somewhere in the world
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:18,048	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	There is a museum cabinet
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:20,864	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	We're locked down there is a
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:22,912	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Physical specimen of that organism
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:30,080	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	That's so it's like it literally is like the Natural Museum history of the world are like the library the card
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:32,128	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Life life
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:34,688	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	In the room that are that Helgen took me into
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:36,992	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	I'm in the sixth floor of the
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:37,504	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Smithsonian
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:40,576	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Cabinet upper cabinet after cabinet upper cabinet
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:42,880	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Filled with these type specimen
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:45,952	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Including the Guadeloupe raccoon
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:46,976	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Type specimen
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:50,304	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Be very specimen Miller inspected back in 1911
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:51,840	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	So here we go
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:56,448	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Pelican bend down and open this one particular cap
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:28:57,472	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	I'm pulling out of
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:28:59,264	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Big metal drawer
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:00,032	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	And inside
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:03,104	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	This is it right here
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:05,152	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Here it is right in front of you
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:07,968	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	This sort of Ratty looking taxidermied raccoon
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:09,504	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Is maybe not the most pretty
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:12,320	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	The ears are a little bit broken and bitten off
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:15,392	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Some of the stuffing was coming out of the belly butt
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:20,512	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	That's probably how it arrived Helgen foresaw this raccoon back in 2000
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:22,816	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	One of the first things he did was
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:29,216	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Start it over looked at it in this small maybe like a 18in long like that that just like Miller had reported
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:32,544	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	But then he popped open this little white box that had the skull
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:33,824	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	And
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:35,616	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Take a look what do you see here
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:37,664	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Keep Collective fine white lines
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:38,688	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Crisscrossing the dough
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:40,224	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	These are open sutures
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:42,272	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Which show that this girl still growing
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:43,296	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	In other words
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:44,576	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	It's not an adult
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:48,160	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Who's the Helgen with a big D
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:48,928	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Deal
EDL	00:29:48,928	00:29:52,512	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Because ever since being a kid he was suspicious of the guadalupian
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:53,792	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	It didn't it didn't add up to
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:59,424	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	I just had a suspicion of Anneliese Tribune raccoon didn't make sense
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:05,824	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	He said if you look at islands that usually don't have just one native mammal species walking around Guadalupe
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:10,688	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	I'm going to put it on this tray the fact that this thing was a kid
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:14,016	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	It meant that there was nothing special at least
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:15,296	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	About its size
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:16,064	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	End
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:19,392	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	No by the time I I laid my hands on this one and looked at the
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:21,184	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	The skin and skull I'd seen
EDL	00:30:21,184	00:30:25,792	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	So many raccoons in museum collections at 9 to their skulls and teeth really well
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:26,816	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	So when I saw this
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:29,120	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	And one of the first things I noticed this
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:35,520	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	There's just nothing that looked any different to me from the common raccoon in the North American raccoon and soap Haugen decided to do
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:36,288	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Some genetic work
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:39,872	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	She compared the DNA of these guadalupian raccoons against North America
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:42,432	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Did the math we made the comparisons and
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:43,968	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Are clear answer came
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:46,016	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Not only are these
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:49,344	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Not very different they are just simply North American right now
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:58,560	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	You mean Guadalupe in raccoons are the same ones that come in and and torment my garbage cans
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:00,352	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Common
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:06,496	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Literally garden-variety raccoon that we have in our own backyard scientists and conservationists

EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:26,464	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Worksite because raccoons

EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:46,944	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Proof now that they are certain that this raccoon doesn't belong here
EDL	00:31:46,944	00:31:51,296	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Then they feel finally we're going to be able to go out and start doing something about this
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:53,344	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Protect the actually special one
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:56,160	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Get rid of this one sort of faker
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:31:56,672	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	But
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:32:00,000	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Putting conservation aside
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:01,792	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	What you've got is is this

EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:15,104	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Probably
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:15,872	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Just on a boat
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:19,200	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Will giving everything that you've told us about the colonial history

EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:27,136	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Well well we went down in 2004 Pelican and his mentor
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:28,160	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	To Guadalupe
EDL	00:32:28,672	00:32:29,440	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	And
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:34,048	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	We talked to some people associated with the zoo and with the government management of the park
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:36,608	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	And it was just a very brief conversation
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:39,680	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	She made sure that they had heard the news
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:40,704	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Why is this
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:43,776	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Raccoon that's found only in your country
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:45,312	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	It's not
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:47,360	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	What you thought it was and it doesn't belong here
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:49,152	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	And
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:50,688	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	I remember that
EDL	00:32:50,688	00:32:52,992	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	The message that came back to us was
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:55,552	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Essentially thank you very much
EDL	00:32:55,552	00:32:56,320	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	But
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:59,136	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	We're going to we're going to hold on to a raccoon
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:07,328	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Yep meaning according to Blanding chemo communication campaign
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:13,728	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Held on to make sure the population knew that there was a change inside of the government never really told
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:20,128	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	And when someone did say something like Gerard Berry
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:25,504	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Long-time conservation

EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:35,744	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	I was interviewed by a reporter and I told him what I knew for
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:42,144	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	And everyone was just saying you know Off With His Head
EDL	00:33:42,144	00:33:48,544	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Head some of my friends were like how can you possibly say this you should not

EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:50,592	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	This is this bad
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:55,200	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	And soap for over a decade now
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:56,480	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Nothing is changed
EDL	00:33:57,248	00:33:58,784	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	The laws haven't been amended
EDL	00:33:58,784	00:33:59,552	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	And
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:00,576	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Because the government
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:01,856	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Cut this so hush-hush
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:04,160	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Many people on these islands
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:05,952	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Still don't know the truth
EDL	00:34:06,720	00:34:09,024	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	My understanding of the story is
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:11,584	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	For many many years
EDL	00:34:12,096	00:34:12,608	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	There is this
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:14,400	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	In fact I
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:15,680	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Guadalupe accidentally broke
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:16,192	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	The news

EDL	00:34:17,984	00:34:20,800	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Recently it was discovered that no in fact
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:24,640	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	It's it's the same species that lives in the United States
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:25,920	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Is that

EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:51,776	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Is it possible that maybe it was
EDL	00:34:51,776	00:34:53,312	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Brought to the United States
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:55,872	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	The scientists say that it was brought here

EDL	00:35:06,624	00:35:12,512	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	It is kind of sad for me to know that it's not in that me to Guadalupe I mean
EDL	00:35:12,512	00:35:13,536	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	I wish
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:15,072	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	It would have been so
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:15,840	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	To be honest
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:19,936	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	And then
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:22,752	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	I had to even less enviable task
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:25,056	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	I'm informing not
EDL	00:35:25,056	00:35:26,336	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	That just this past

EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:39,136	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	We recognize that we cannot act on all the time basically

EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:50,912	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	The thing is of particularly in Germany the raccoon is terribly invasive

EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:56,800	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Spread from Germany throughout the contest
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:58,336	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	And so
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:35:59,616	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	The raccoon made the list
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:02,688	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	And that means that
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:04,736	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	That member states like France and us
EDL	00:36:04,736	00:36:07,552	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Very likely overseas agencies like Guadalupe
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:10,368	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Will have to start managing

EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:18,816	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	There's a good possibility that in the next year
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:22,656	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	The raccoon is going to change from being a protected species
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:25,984	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	To being a species that can be hunted

EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:19,488	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	That's responsible of the person saying it was another specie

EDL	00:38:53,440	00:38:54,720	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Peace and War
EDL	00:38:54,720	00:38:55,744	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	It has been
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:38:58,048	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	We have dressed it in America
EDL	00:38:58,560	00:39:00,608	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Every time a nation chooses
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:04,960	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	To identify with some wild thing it mostly really about
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:06,496	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	People identify
EDL	00:39:06,496	00:39:07,264	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Now.
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:08,288	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	The animal
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:13,152	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	I totally agree but I see like this like there's that you have this fact right there is a fact.
EDL	00:39:13,152	00:39:16,480	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	That the raccoons didn't show up a million years ago or whatever
EDL	00:39:16,480	00:39:17,760	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	It was probably more like to hunt
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:19,040	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Your stats
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:19,808	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Most
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:20,832	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Probably a fact
EDL	00:39:20,832	00:39:23,136	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	But then there's the stuff on top of that which is like
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:25,184	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Are they not
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:26,720	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Troll are they invasive
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:31,328	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Do they belong here though still feel like fax those who like judgment so can like who gets to make those
EDL	00:39:32,352	00:39:32,864	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	The scientist
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:39,520	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	I don't know I certainly didn't realize the extent that this was a deep-seated cultural battle in which I was entering
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:47,712	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Again Christopher Helga it's just the same information you know different responses and
EDL	00:39:48,480	00:39:51,552	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	I think the one of the deep questions of that
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:53,344	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Of this story lives in that
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:55,136	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Which is like
EDL	00:39:55,904	00:39:58,464	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	You you came to a scientific truth
EDL	00:39:59,488	00:40:00,256	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	In
EDL	00:40:00,256	00:40:02,304	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	The question becomes should that scientific
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:02,816	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Truth
EDL	00:40:04,096	00:40:04,864	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Win the day
EDL	00:40:06,144	00:40:07,168	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	I mean
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:10,752	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	As a scientist you know I would say yes
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:15,616	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	There is a conservation biologist I would say yes it's important to shows us that
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:18,688	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Taxonomy really matters this animal didn't belong and
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:21,248	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Really perhaps it should be
EDL	00:40:21,760	00:40:22,784	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Remote from the aisle
EDL	00:40:22,784	00:40:23,552	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	But
EDL	00:40:23,552	00:40:24,576	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	At the same time
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:27,648	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	It's really a question for Guadalupe
EDL	00:40:28,160	00:40:29,440	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	This is our Island
EDL	00:40:29,952	00:40:32,512	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	These are there animals running around on it and
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:35,840	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	I can be very challenging for
EDL	00:40:36,352	00:40:37,632	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Scientists like myself
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:38,400	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	2
EDL	00:40:38,400	00:40:38,912	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Come to terms
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:39,936	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	But
EDL	00:40:41,216	00:40:42,496	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	That's how the world works
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:05,024	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	One more thought before we before we go alright
EDL	00:41:06,304	00:41:08,096	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Before Helgen officially sang
EDL	00:41:08,608	00:41:10,144	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Or dethroned
EDL	00:41:10,144	00:41:11,936	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Guadalupian raccoon
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:14,752	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	There's actually another guy with a similar
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:15,520	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Hunch
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:18,848	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	This Parisian mammalogist named ijm
EDL	00:41:18,848	00:41:19,360	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Pons
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:21,920	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	I did one of those papers he wrote that
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:24,224	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Even if it can be proven
EDL	00:41:24,224	00:41:27,552	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	That the guadalupian raccoon is no different from the Northam
EDL	00:41:28,064	00:41:28,832	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Raccoon
EDL	00:41:28,832	00:41:32,416	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Did the best answer might not be its reclassification
EDL	00:41:32,416	00:41:33,184	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Or eradication
EDL	00:41:33,952	00:41:34,976	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	But it's dead
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:36,768	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Is isolate
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:39,584	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	He wrote that it's quote
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:45,984	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Insular distribution prevents Gene exchange with the mainland and is likely to Warrant different select
EDL	00:41:45,984	00:41:52,384	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	The pressures that should favor short-term genetic differentiation that may lead to a long-term speciation
EDL	00:41:52,384	00:41:58,783	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Process we was that mean meaning if they were able to keep these North American raccoons on Guadalupe
EDL	00:41:58,783	00:41:59,807	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Isolated long enough
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:01,855	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Maybe someday
EDL	00:42:02,623	00:42:04,927	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	They could be reclassified yet again
EDL	00:42:05,439	00:42:06,463	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	This time
EDL	00:42:06,975	00:42:07,743	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Ezreal

EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:20,031	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	What's your response to that pawns said that but
EDL	00:42:20,543	00:42:22,079	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	And I like it
EDL	00:42:22,079	00:42:23,103	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	But
EDL	00:42:23,871	00:42:25,663	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	I'd say going to be waiting a long time
EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:29,247	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	That's going to take over
EDL	00:42:46,143	00:42:52,287	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Do you want to give super super things to Sally stand ye who was our translator and got Simon everywhere he needed to go

EDL	00:43:29,919	00:43:32,479	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	It's been a Blog called the truth about raccoons
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:35,295	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Andesitic contains a paragraph
EDL	00:43:36,319	00:43:37,855	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	I wish I'm pretty sure is not true
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:44,767	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Pecos and I quote raccoons are one of the only land mammals who can also walk on the bottom of river
EDL	00:43:44,767	00:43:46,815	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Dad's holding their breath for up to an hour
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:50,911	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	They eat both live prey and carrion be consumed after
EDL	00:43:50,911	00:43:55,007	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	20 lb of raw meat at a time then go without food for a week
EDL	00:43:55,007	00:43:57,823	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Their skeletal structure is found in no other animal
EDL	00:43:57,823	00:44:02,431	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	And that combined with their ferocity and complete lack of moral fiber
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:03,455	| radiolab_podcast17strangerparadise |	Make them perhaps
