EDL	00:01:08,352	00:01:12,704	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	She wakes up early drops or nine-year-old off at school runs a few errands
EDL	00:01:13,472	00:01:16,032	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Then she drives downtown to this
EDL	00:01:16,032	00:01:21,152	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	This big fancy hotel what was the name of the hotel
EDL	00:01:21,152	00:01:26,272	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I'm 87 years old don't expect
EDL	00:01:27,296	00:01:30,880	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	But at any rate you know I parked in a parking garage across
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:34,464	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Right across from the hotel is a park but there's a
EDL	00:01:34,464	00:01:35,488	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Parking garage underneath
EDL	00:01:36,000	00:01:40,864	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Walk every walk across the street that there were sidewalks on both sides of the street
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:42,912	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	There were people on both sidewalks
EDL	00:01:42,912	00:01:49,312	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	She joins the crowd across the street from the hotel was very crowded couple thousand people it's like a big scene and there was
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:51,360	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Barrier a rope barrier right
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:53,408	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Keeping us back on the sidewalk
EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:56,736	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And my plan has always been to be back in the crown
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:02:04,928	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	You know what I was dressed like every other middle-aged woman that was there so I don't remember what you were wearing
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:05,696	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Temperature there
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:10,048	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Older pictures of it yes I was wearing I was wearing slacks that was
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:11,840	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	That was at the beginning of winter
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:13,632	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Natural for women to wear slacks
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:14,912	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I had a coat on
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:18,240	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And I was carrying a purse and I went back into the middle of the crowd
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:20,288	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I had planned to do anyway
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:22,080	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I thought a man come up against man
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:27,200	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Socializes I wasn't that day and time I spun around to Slappy's face
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:33,088	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	She see this guy there big strong guy blond hair look at him and realize that it was
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:35,904	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	He had not done anything out of the ordinary that
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:37,696	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I turn back around
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:40,512	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And I went on about my business
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:42,304	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I was in pushed up
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:45,376	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Crowd pressure was such I tried to stay back in the ground
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:49,472	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	But I got pushed up almost on to the ropes in the front
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:52,032	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Write up on the curb of the sidewalk
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:53,568	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Why do I not plan to be
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:57,408	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And he apparently was still right behind me
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:59,712	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	So maybe he was pushed out by the crowd also
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:02,272	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And so Sarah Jane is just crammed into the
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:08,160	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Crowd and she's just standing there
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:11,488	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Going about doing what I set out to do
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:12,768	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	So
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:14,304	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	She waits
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:15,328	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And she waits
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:21,984	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And an hour goes by and two and three and then finally
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:29,152	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Out of the hotel comes none other than the president of the United
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:30,944	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	United States Gerald Ford that he has
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:37,856	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Police and Secret Service they're all coming to walking out of the hotel to get in his car which was parked there on the street
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:41,952	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	But he sees the crowd Sarah Jane actually says he looks directly at her
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:42,720	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:44,000	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Waves
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:45,792	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	He waves to the crowd and everyone starts
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:47,840	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Applauding and cheering
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:48,608	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Now
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:49,632	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Right at that moment
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:51,936	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Sarah Jane
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:54,240	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Regis her right hand
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:56,032	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Into her purse and
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:58,592	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Pulled a gun out of my purse
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:01,152	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	A 38 caliber revolver
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:08,064	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Cox it and then she takes aim right at Gerald Ford's head
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:11,136	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And then
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:25,471	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Mr. Ford did not fall
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:28,543	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	For chips the wall behind him Ford
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:34,943	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Freezes in place Sara Jean never plan to take a second shot
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:41,343	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And still in the air holding the gun looking over the smoking barrel of the gun and she's got enough time if you wanted
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:47,743	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	But before she can take that second shot the blond man behind her lunges
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:54,143	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Grabs her gun arm pulls it down and deflect it for just that crucial second
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:05:00,543	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	50 police officers nearby need to get to her the tackle her they take our guns and the pentagram
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:06,943	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	So I couldn't move and buy that points the secret service has whisked off the president into the limousine and I was in
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:08,991	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Immediately picked up and carried across the street
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:10,015	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Into the hotel
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:10,783	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Arrested
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:13,087	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And eventually
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:18,975	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Cheap went to prison and she served 32 years in prison and then
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:21,023	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And then after that was released on parole
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:23,071	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And then we talked to her
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:24,607	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Weihai
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:26,399	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	God prepared
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:32,799	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	To be told the first-person narrative from the perspective of someone who's about to be president that was not what I was expecting
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:38,943	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I was hoping that weight can you explain know why it is she decided to shoot the night
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:45,343	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Never fully explained that and when I asked her what this is not
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:47,903	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	She was like I'm not going there this is not an interview about
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:53,023	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	What was driving me or about what I did or why did it this is an interview about mr. simple
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:06:00,447	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Sipple Oliver Sipple the random blonde guy who just happened to be
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:06,847	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Standing next to Sara Jane Moore that date the guy who grabbed her arm and save the president's life and T-Pain
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:13,247	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Dearly for that I actually called up Sarah Jane and had her tell that whole story because I was actually interested in what
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:16,575	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	What happened to Oliver Sipple after that because had he not
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:21,439	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Reached out and put his hand on my arm
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:23,231	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	None of this would have happened to him
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:27,839	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Wait what happened to him
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:33,727	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	So Oliver Sipple actually died in 1989 but
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:36,543	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Before we go to destroy I just want to give you a picture of the guy
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:37,567	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	So
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:42,687	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Just Google search Oliver Sipple Ford or something
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:45,247	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Wait okay wait I see the picture

EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:54,207	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	He's a handsome guy yeah he's a he's a little bit James Dean
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:07:00,351	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And Marlon Brando had a baby, or something all American
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:07,519	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	We're bringing in another All-American for the story Daniel Lutzer editor at
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:09,055	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Oxford University press
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:10,847	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And a few years ago
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:13,407	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Probably more than 5 years ago I wrote
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:14,687	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	An article
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:16,223	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	About Oliver Sipple
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:20,319	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Anyway to get back on track September 22nd 1975
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:24,671	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Sara Jane Moore fire snapshot Oliver Sipple grabbed her arm the police
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:31,071	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Russell Moore to the ground in a police actually grab Oliver to pull them inside the hotel the question is
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:37,215	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Initially some confusion about what he was doing there and some thought that you know he might have been a suspect
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:41,055	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	So he's in this hotel trying to light a cigarette but
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:44,383	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	He just couldn't do it because he was shaking so hard
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:49,759	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Oliver had served very rough tours in Vietnam
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:56,159	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Loud noises Woods would make him very unhappy I think this is the sort of thing we might call poster
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:57,951	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Traumatic stress disorder now
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:08:01,791	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	But when eventually Oliver started to calm down the Secret Service were like
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:08,191	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	What are you even doing here it's kind of hard to answer because it's like didn't even really knows like
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:09,983	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And I just bumped into this
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:16,383	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Huge crowd of people asked what was going on people like oh like Gerald Ford is going to be here any other the president is going to
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:18,687	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	So he said he thought I might as well see him
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:25,087	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And then he was standing there for a couple hours until he saw a flash of metal realized it was a gun reacted quickly
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:27,391	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Instinctively and then
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:28,927	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	You guys all put me in here
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:30,463	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Can you be here

EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:38,399	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And there's a reporter that waiting for him
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,167	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	My butt
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:41,471	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	He just wants to
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:46,591	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Serta be left alone and he told this reporter quote
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:51,967	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I'm a coward I don't know why I did it it was the thing to do at the time
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:56,319	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And isn't even after that he just keeps getting phone calls from reporters and then some of them
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:09:00,927	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Learned that he was a marine until they would ask him questions like oh was it your

EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:11,679	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I'm no hero or nothing
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:15,263	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	But

EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:49,215	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Tolerated that's why San Francisco sometimes labeled with a slide caption Queen City of the West
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:56,127	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	San Francisco was one of the first cities in America have a gay pride
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:11:02,527	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	My Parade in the 70s boys go to bed with boys and girls are better than girls and

EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:18,911	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Because
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:19,679	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	What the West
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:25,311	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Offered was the Ethereal promise if you will of reinvention
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:29,151	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	You could cross the line in which your past
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:31,199	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Stay behind you
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:36,063	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	It was a place where you could be out but to the people you left behind you can still be in
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:42,975	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	So a super Oliver you know he came from Michigan from a working-class family I had a lot of brothers and sister
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:49,119	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Can use one of the eight children
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:55,519	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And he was perfectly open about his sexual orientation and would tell anybody who asked that he was a gay man
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:57,311	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	But you know you never told his family
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:12:01,151	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Until Oliver lived like a lot of gay people is a time this
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:07,295	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Double life and do we know that this is the reason why I said mechanic San Francisco or was there a difference
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:09,087	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Harvey Milk is there
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:11,903	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	The Harvey Milk you know famous gay activist
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:14,463	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	San Francisco politician he was friends with Harvey Milk
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:15,231	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	A New York
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:21,631	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	An immigrant from New York turns out Oliver had actually met Harvey a decade earlier New York
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:28,031	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I just want to mention this because it's so cool the time they actually dated the same guy who was the
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:32,639	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	The inspiration for Sugar Plum Fairy sugar
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:36,991	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	In Lou Reed Walk on the Wild Side
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:38,783	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Just a fun fact just a fun fact
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:39,807	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	That's it but
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:42,367	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Oliver Harvey they were pretty good friends
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:48,767	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	They correspond it's in touch when they lived in different places in the country IP Harvey even loans Oliver money sometimes cuz
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:49,791	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Oliver didn't have a job
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:52,863	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	You know Collective disability from his time in the Marines but
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:54,143	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Anyway
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:56,703	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	By the beginning of the 70s
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:13:03,103	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	When Oliver got to San Francisco reconnected with an old friend Harvey was shall we say evolving into the hue
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:09,503	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Huge figure their butt gay public figure
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:15,391	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I'm just thinking like one of the things we were talking about on the phone was about sort of the
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:17,439	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	The kind of two different
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:23,839	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Schools are no different the Segway to that
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:26,655	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Other I would say older but other generation
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:28,191	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Okay
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:29,215	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Mostly men
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:31,519	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Was that
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:37,919	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	They were content to go to tea with the mayor or public official of some kind
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:43,295	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Wearing jackets and ties really weren't
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:44,319	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Shall we say
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:45,087	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Activist
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:48,415	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Because according to Ken the activism came
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:56,607	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	When in the late sixties early seventies that young gay men and women who came out of the
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:58,143	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Vietnam War protests
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:13:59,935	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Into the world
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:00,703	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Take a look around
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:07,871	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Discomfort or fear
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:14,271	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	The police are still rating bars
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:20,671	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	One of them and said we're faget we're going to beat the s*** out of you sending that affect how we going to kill you
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:22,463	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Violently in
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:24,255	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And non-violent
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:26,303	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	They knock me down and
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:29,375	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Started beating me with their hands in their feet their elbows
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:32,447	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Try to muffle my screams
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:32,959	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:37,567	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	After a while a body of people get to a point where they just
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:38,591	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Will not take
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:39,615	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Depression anymore
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:47,551	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	So in came the activist like harbin ponytail mustache
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:53,951	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Banker turned hippy you know you lying you know you're changing the statements around he was very outspoken
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:15:00,351	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Behind it very militant to Harvey
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:06,751	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	A person should have the right to say gay people with living in a half life opportunity
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:13,151	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I am gay that is a part of society. Not being able to be who they were
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:19,551	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Must
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:23,135	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Does it is you must tell your immediate family
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:25,183	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	You must tell your relatives
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:31,583	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	You must tell your friends if indeed they are your friends you must tell your neighbors you must tell them
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:37,727	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	People your work with you must tell the people in the stories you shopping
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:47,967	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Once you do you will feel so much better
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:49,503	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And so
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:53,599	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Cut back to September 22nd 1975
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:56,671	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	In a blink of an eye Oliver civil becomes this
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:15:58,207	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Hero
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:16:00,767	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And that same night Oliver spread Harvey
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:02,303	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Sears about all this news
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:03,839	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:04,607	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Consensus
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:06,655	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Wait maybe there's an opportunity
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:12,543	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	So he picks up the phone and calls
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:14,591	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Columnist herb Kane
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:17,663	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	A very very well-known well-loved
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:24,063	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Gossip columnist isn't there so milk leaves a message on his answering machine
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:26,623	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And he basically says what

EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:40,959	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Harvey outage
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:42,495	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Milk out of them

EDL	00:16:46,079	00:16:48,895	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Well for Harvey
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:55,807	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Stereotypes the lies the innuendos of gay people as limp-wristed and drag queens and stuff
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:57,087	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Distortions

EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:16,031	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	It's too good an opportunity
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:19,103	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	For once we can show that days do heroic things
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:23,967	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Not just all that caca about molesting children and hanging out in bathroom

EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:55,871	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Proud maybe this will help break the stereotype
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:19:00,479	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And then that day this guy named Darryl Lemke
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:01,247	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Left

EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:29,407	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	In the Allie X collection at the Huntington Library in Los Angeles and M
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:32,479	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	It's the reason they hung onto it was cuz it was

EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:37,728	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Now
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:44,128	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	The reason is Tampa so controversial is because according to Oliver before the interview began before the you know
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:45,664	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Recorder started rolling
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:50,272	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	He had said to the reporters from The Sentinel
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:53,856	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Okay I'm going to talk to you guys about my sexuality
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:56,160	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	But then she had said to Daryl
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:58,720	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I don't want you to write anything about that
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:24:00,768	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I don't I don't want that International Paper
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:03,840	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Daryl says he doesn't remember that
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:04,608	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	But then
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:06,656	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Right here in this interview
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:09,984	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	This thing happens where Darryl says
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:14,336	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I'll make one more try on the gate
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:16,384	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	You don't want to change
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:19,456	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	You don't want to change your mind on that
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:20,224	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	No
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:22,528	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I just don't want to change them
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:27,648	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Very popular saying homosexuality has nothing to do with it
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:30,720	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I'm calling and saying that
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:34,560	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	If I were a homosexual I was not even cook me or not
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:36,352	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	It doesn't make me any less of a man than what I
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:42,752	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	But I think they have nothing to do
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:45,056	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	React
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:45,568	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Rancho
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:49,152	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	So I don't think you took anything
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:55,040	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Eventually
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:56,832	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Okay
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:59,136	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Interview ends and
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:00,160	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Daryl says
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:05,536	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Is that when he left that interview he felt like when I came to all of her sexuality don't want to be quoted
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:07,072	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	That was it like just don't
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:08,096	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Quote me on it
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:11,680	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	But still I was trying to report from all sides about us
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:13,472	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	The big side for me was
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:15,264	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	That he was a hero on this
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:17,824	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	The president of States was very slow on the take
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:20,640	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I'm psyching him for saving his life
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:21,920	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Darryl thought that
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:26,272	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Oliver sexuality the fact that he was gay might have something to do with that because
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:27,552	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Just seven months earlier
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:34,208	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	On March 6th Sergeant Leonard matlovich disclosed to a supervising officer at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:36,000	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	That he was a homosexual
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:37,536	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I wanted to stay in the Air Force
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:40,352	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Is Air Force Sergeant named Leonard matlovich
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:45,472	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Who had the Purple Heart had the Bronze Star he comes out that he's gay
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:47,008	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Annie's kicked out of the Air Force
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:48,800	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	In conversation
EDL	00:25:55,456	00:25:59,040	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	My account
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:01,088	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Minority group
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:07,488	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	No more America
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:14,400	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And now you've got this former Marine saved the president's life and it's
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:16,960	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	2 days later he still hasn't heard from the president
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:24,896	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Tilt for Darrell even though Oliver had said don't make this about my sexuality I still thought it was it was a no
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:25,920	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	National story and it was
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:30,272	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Pretty hard to ignore it after a hurricane and started the ball rolling
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:34,368	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	So that night after the interview Darrell calls in his
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:36,416	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Story to the LA Times office
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:38,208	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And he uses this
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:38,720	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Raise
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:42,560	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	He said to Oliver's of former Marine who was quote
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:45,376	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Prominent figure in the gay community
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:51,776	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Put it down always the story with the rewrite guy put it in the lead really made it the big thing
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:52,800	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And so
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:54,848	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	3 days after the assassination attempt
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:57,920	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Ble X run the story with the headline
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:59,968	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	No call from president
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:04,064	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	0 in Ford shooting active among SFGate
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:06,624	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And the only times
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:07,648	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	New service
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:10,208	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And so Daryl story it goes
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:11,488	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I mean it goes everywhere
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:15,840	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Another strange twist to the story headlines are like
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:16,608	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Score
EDL	00:27:16,608	00:27:22,752	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Homosexual hero been reported that the ex-marine who deflected misses more shot on Monday
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:26,336	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Is well known in San Francisco is gay activist circles
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:32,736	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And so it was not just running in Los Angeles it's also running in Chicago it's raining in Dallas
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:35,040	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	It's running in Indianapolis and it's running
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:36,832	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	You know of all places
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:37,344	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	In
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:39,136	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Oliver Sipple hometown
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:40,672	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	In Detroit
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:44,000	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I guess what I'm wondering is if you have a guy who says
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:47,584	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Please don't talk about this it has nothing to do with what I did yesterday
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:52,704	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Shouldn't that play some role in what you decided to write or not to be
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:53,728	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Well
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:57,312	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	You don't know your news sources
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:58,848	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Are always
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:28:00,128	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Reluctant to talk
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:03,712	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	So I guess I
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:06,272	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Took it as much
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:07,552	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Duty
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:12,416	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Pick up that angled specially such as Bob the president of the United States
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:13,184	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Right
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:17,536	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	But if you were to do it all over again would you do anything differently
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:21,888	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I don't know
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:27,008	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Taken into
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:27,776	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Call baby
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:31,872	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	The potential harm
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:32,896	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Second
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:35,712	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I don't know if I do it over again or not
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:41,088	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	But
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:45,952	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Not able to turn back the clock for something like that
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:29:02,848	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Clock marches
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:09,248	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Forward after the break

EDL	00:30:02,752	00:30:07,616	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:14,528	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:15,616	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Just as the color of my eyes

EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:54,272	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Person
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:55,040	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Worth is
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:32:57,088	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Determined by how
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:58,880	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	He or she
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:01,952	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Response to the world
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:03,488	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	In which they live
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:05,024	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Not on how or what
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:07,840	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Or with whom a private life
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:08,352	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Is Cher
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:11,424	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	He basically says like stop stop
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:16,288	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Macy's canvas simple as that
EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:19,616	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Makes the whole thing I mean so much more
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:21,152	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Personal
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:25,248	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Finally actually was the very reason that Oliver
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:26,784	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Call the press conference in the first place
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:28,832	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I want you to know that my mother
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:30,368	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Told me today
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:32,928	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	But she could not walk
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:36,000	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Out of her front door or even go to church
EDL	00:33:36,512	00:33:38,048	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Because of the pressures
EDL	00:33:38,816	00:33:41,120	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	He fails because of the press
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:41,888	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Stories
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:45,984	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Concerning my sexual orientation
EDL	00:33:46,496	00:33:47,776	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Actually I never
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:49,568	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Anticipated
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:53,152	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Interference with my family's
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:54,688	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Relationship when she died
EDL	00:33:55,456	00:34:01,600	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	When I supposedly say the president's life Oliver would later say that when he was talking on the phone with his mother
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:03,648	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	She said to him
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:04,416	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I don't
EDL	00:34:04,416	00:34:05,952	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Want to speak to you ever again
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:07,232	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And she hung up on him
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:08,768	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And also hung up
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:15,936	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Did you call him uncle uncle Oliver
EDL	00:34:15,936	00:34:17,472	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Yes I called the macabre

EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:52,543	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	So the issue
EDL	00:42:52,543	00:42:58,943	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	You know it's it's a very fundamental issue for those of us in journalism and to help us make sense of the arguments
EDL	00:42:58,943	00:43:00,479	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	In a lurking in those pages
EDL	00:43:00,479	00:43:06,879	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	What is privacy in what is invasion of privacy we talked to Dan morain editorial page editor of the
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:13,279	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	The Sacramento Bee actually first heard about the case in journalism school and also wrote about Oliver Sipple way back in
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:14,559	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	1980s
EDL	00:43:14,559	00:43:17,119	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Anyway okay so here's the first page of the file
EDL	00:43:17,119	00:43:21,471	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	The lawsuit was against a Chronicle Oliver W Sipple
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:22,495	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Plaintiff vs
EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:24,287	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Is the chronicle Publishing Company
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:30,687	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	LA times Des Moines Register the Chicago Sun-Times a denverpost Indianapolis Star and a San Antonio
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:36,319	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Express 180 said this is the deposition of Oliver w
EDL	00:43:36,319	00:43:36,831	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Simple
EDL	00:43:37,343	00:43:43,743	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	See the one of the arguments the lawyers for the newspapers were making is that all of her sexuality was not actually
EDL	00:43:43,743	00:43:44,511	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Chile private
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:49,631	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Lawyer were there any people that you knew in San Francisco's and say September 1975
EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:51,679	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Who knew that you were homosexual
EDL	00:43:52,447	00:43:53,471	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Simple yes
EDL	00:43:53,983	00:43:56,287	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Lawyer approximately how many people
EDL	00:43:56,287	00:43:57,823	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Simple I have no idea
EDL	00:43:57,823	00:43:59,359	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	More than 10 yes
EDL	00:43:59,359	00:44:00,639	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	When it's 50 yes
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:02,175	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	More than a hundred
EDL	00:44:02,175	00:44:08,575	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Yes there were people in New York who knew he was gay there were people in Dallas who knew he was gay
EDL	00:44:08,575	00:44:10,623	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	The settle in the like in the hundred
EDL	00:44:10,623	00:44:14,975	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Did you tell anybody before and September of 1975 that you were homosexual
EDL	00:44:15,487	00:44:16,255	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	If I were asked
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:17,535	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I am asking you
EDL	00:44:18,047	00:44:19,327	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I don't know what you were asked
EDL	00:44:19,327	00:44:23,167	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And they make the argument the newspapers lawyers that hey this was already
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:26,495	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Somewhat public a fact but his
EDL	00:44:26,495	00:44:32,895	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Personal business was his personal business I've never attempted to obtain publicity for the
EDL	00:44:32,895	00:44:39,295	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Fact that I'm gay or predominantly homosexual in my sexual orientation private citizen and made my home app rocks
EDL	00:44:39,295	00:44:42,367	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Ultimately 1800 miles away from home
EDL	00:44:42,367	00:44:48,767	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	But my parents and my family so that I could move so much freely in the gay community without the fact of my sexual orientation getting fat
EDL	00:44:48,767	00:44:50,047	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	To my parents and family
EDL	00:44:50,559	00:44:51,071	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And it goes on
EDL	00:44:51,583	00:44:54,143	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	But the newspapers need another argument it was like okay
EDL	00:44:54,911	00:44:59,263	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Whether or not you're living a double life whether or not you wanted to or whether or not you had to
EDL	00:44:59,263	00:45:05,663	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	There's something here that's bigger than that that's bigger than you which was he was a private citizen who thrust himself
EDL	00:45:05,663	00:45:11,295	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Self as anybody would hope they would do he ran toward the he went toward Danger
EDL	00:45:11,295	00:45:13,343	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And when he did
EDL	00:45:13,343	00:45:19,743	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	He also thrust himself into the public eye and a journalist when you're in the public eye
EDL	00:45:19,743	00:45:22,815	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	You become something else entirely you become a public
EDL	00:45:22,815	00:45:25,119	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Ticketmaster
EDL	00:45:25,631	00:45:28,191	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	When that happened to Oliver
EDL	00:45:28,191	00:45:32,543	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Lost his right to privacy I'll make one more try on the game
EDL	00:45:32,543	00:45:38,943	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	The music was argued when it came to all of her sexuality
EDL	00:45:38,943	00:45:44,831	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	It is was and it all printed times has been my judgment that Mr sipple's activities in the gay community
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:47,647	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Are highly significant and newsworthy for two important reason
EDL	00:45:48,159	00:45:50,975	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	First smartphone
EDL	00:45:50,975	00:45:57,375	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	He was a homosexual
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:46:03,775	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	You had this big story about the u.s. Air Force trying to kick this guy Leonard matlovich out because he was gay
EDL	00:46:03,775	00:46:06,591	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Oliver has heard nothing from the president
EDL	00:46:07,359	00:46:10,687	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Present leader said that he thought had nothing to do with all of her being gay
EDL	00:46:10,687	00:46:17,087	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	But the people at the time the suggestion that the president's expression of gratitude to Sybil might have been affected by rumors
EDL	00:46:17,087	00:46:23,487	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Activities in the gay community
EDL	00:46:23,487	00:46:25,279	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Has not yet personally thank them
EDL	00:46:25,279	00:46:31,679	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Second lies the innuendos the public display of heroism in saving the life of the president
EDL	00:46:31,679	00:46:33,727	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	United States
EDL	00:46:33,727	00:46:35,519	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Okay people travel esters
EDL	00:46:35,519	00:46:36,799	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Presented an image
EDL	00:46:36,799	00:46:39,871	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	The gay people are like everybody else that
EDL	00:46:39,871	00:46:46,271	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	They're Heroes image certainly contrary to The Stereotype of persons associated with the gay community as we can done
EDL	00:46:46,271	00:46:47,295	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Heroic figures
EDL	00:46:48,063	00:46:53,695	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Which is to say this is newsworthy this is worth knowing and it is something that the whole country wants to know
EDL	00:46:53,695	00:46:57,535	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And and the value of that is more than the value of
EDL	00:46:58,047	00:47:03,423	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	You know this individual person's privacy do they make sure to put it in terms of the public
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:05,727	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Benefit outweighs the private privacy
EDL	00:47:06,239	00:47:08,799	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	So Oliver ski
EDL	00:47:08,799	00:47:11,359	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	It dragged on for 9 years
EDL	00:47:11,359	00:47:14,175	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	So from 1975 to 1984
EDL	00:47:14,687	00:47:15,967	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	But this is
EDL	00:47:15,967	00:47:17,247	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I'm quoting the judgment
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:24,927	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	The record shows that the Publications were not motivated by morbid and Sensational prying into
EDL	00:47:24,927	00:47:25,951	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	To apologize private life
EDL	00:47:26,463	00:47:30,815	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	But rather were prompted by a legitimate political concerns
EDL	00:47:30,815	00:47:31,583	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Ie
EDL	00:47:31,583	00:47:36,703	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	To dispel the boss public opinion that gays were timid we can done heroic figures
EDL	00:47:36,703	00:47:40,031	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And to raise the equally important political question
EDL	00:47:40,031	00:47:46,431	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Whether the president of the United States entertained a discriminatory attitude or bias against a minority group such as home
EDL	00:47:46,431	00:47:46,943	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Bisexuals
EDL	00:47:47,455	00:47:47,967	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	So
EDL	00:47:48,735	00:47:49,503	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	The court
EDL	00:47:49,503	00:47:50,783	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Cost Oliver's case out
EDL	00:47:51,295	00:47:52,063	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	He lost
EDL	00:47:52,063	00:47:52,831	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Didn't get it.
EDL	00:47:54,879	00:47:56,671	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Everything about it is weird that
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:48:01,023	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	A journalist can just take a person's most private details
EDL	00:48:01,535	00:48:03,583	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And then if it feels relevant
EDL	00:48:03,583	00:48:05,375	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	If they can make that argument they just
EDL	00:48:05,887	00:48:12,031	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Put it out there if we did we were to go silent because somebody said don't say that about
EDL	00:48:13,055	00:48:17,919	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Then and the government backs him up it is if it's meaningful than the person
EDL	00:48:18,943	00:48:22,015	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Out of which the meaning is being pulled painfully
EDL	00:48:22,015	00:48:28,415	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Had nothing to say about it that's just because it's really hard and I was thinking about this like even on the train coming
EDL	00:48:28,415	00:48:30,207	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Over here Daniel Lutz
EDL	00:48:30,207	00:48:30,719	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And it's like
EDL	00:48:31,231	00:48:32,255	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	The thing that like mixed
EDL	00:48:33,023	00:48:35,839	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Journalism law so complicated in the things that make
EDL	00:48:35,839	00:48:39,423	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	An invasion of privacy discussions so difficult is that like
EDL	00:48:40,959	00:48:45,567	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	What makes something not an invasion of privacy is not that it's okay it's that it's
EDL	00:48:46,079	00:48:47,359	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Politically you know releve
EDL	00:48:48,127	00:48:51,455	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	So like this with the fact that the story that affected the
EDL	00:48:51,455	00:48:52,991	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Private details of his life
EDL	00:48:53,503	00:48:54,271	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	AR
EDL	00:48:54,271	00:48:55,551	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Politically relevant
EDL	00:48:55,551	00:48:56,575	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Memes
EDL	00:48:56,575	00:48:58,623	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	That it's not an invasion of privacy
EDL	00:48:58,623	00:49:01,951	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	You know it doesn't mean that it isn't rude or that it doesn't hurt
EDL	00:49:01,951	00:49:02,463	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	It means
EDL	00:49:02,975	00:49:03,487	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	That it's
EDL	00:49:03,999	00:49:05,023	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Inappropriate
EDL	00:49:05,023	00:49:06,559	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Story 2 video
EDL	00:49:06,559	00:49:07,071	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Publix
EDL	00:49:07,839	00:49:14,239	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	But I do think like why should the journalist be the only ones to decide what is newsworthy it's not like
EDL	00:49:14,239	00:49:15,775	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Why is it that then
EDL	00:49:15,775	00:49:17,567	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Journalist you
EDL	00:49:17,567	00:49:23,967	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	You just pick up a notepad and pencil and all the sudden you have so much more power to say what say of
EDL	00:49:23,967	00:49:25,503	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Then than anybody else
EDL	00:49:27,039	00:49:32,415	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Well I mean we have a long tradition of that in the United States I mean like that's
EDL	00:49:32,415	00:49:33,951	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Like what the first amendment is
EDL	00:49:34,463	00:49:35,487	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I mean
EDL	00:49:35,487	00:49:39,583	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I don't know means like yeah sure like it's like why do journalist get to decide that will like
EDL	00:49:39,583	00:49:41,375	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Who would you rather have decided
EDL	00:49:41,375	00:49:43,679	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	It's not a perfect system but it's
EDL	00:49:43,679	00:49:44,447	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	You know
EDL	00:49:44,447	00:49:45,215	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	It kind of works
EDL	00:49:45,727	00:49:52,127	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	So so is Oliver just like this this is Tracy hunt it was in on the interview somebody who
EDL	00:49:52,127	00:49:55,711	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Life is basically kind of sacrifice to the altar of the First Amendment and it's like
EDL	00:49:56,479	00:49:57,503	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Sad way
EDL	00:49:57,503	00:49:58,015	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Yes
EDL	00:49:59,295	00:49:59,807	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Yeah
EDL	00:50:07,231	00:50:09,023	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	I feel like he was sacrificed from all sides
EDL	00:50:10,559	00:50:11,327	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Yeah
EDL	00:50:11,327	00:50:16,191	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	It it feels like there's just one kind of man in the middle and then they're all these
EDL	00:50:16,191	00:50:18,495	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Forces around him these like
EDL	00:50:19,007	00:50:21,823	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	These larger-than-life forces like
EDL	00:50:21,823	00:50:24,383	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	The White House there's the gay movement
EDL	00:50:24,383	00:50:25,663	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Freedom of the press
EDL	00:50:26,175	00:50:32,575	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	NN all these people are our sort of batting around all these all these enormous and important abstractions and then
EDL	00:50:32,575	00:50:33,343	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	In the middle of it
EDL	00:50:33,343	00:50:34,367	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	This guy that just
EDL	00:50:34,879	00:50:37,951	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Is trampled by all of them and so what ends up happening to him in the end
EDL	00:50:38,719	00:50:42,047	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Apparently some people in the gay community
EDL	00:50:42,047	00:50:44,607	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	During and after the lawsuit
EDL	00:50:45,375	00:50:48,959	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Tell that he was trying to go back in the closet so they sort of
EDL	00:50:49,471	00:50:51,007	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Turn their backs on him
EDL	00:50:52,799	00:50:57,407	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Surprisingly he was friends with Harvey Milk till till the ends like
EDL	00:50:57,407	00:50:59,455	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	When Harvey Milk was assassinated
EDL	00:50:59,967	00:51:01,503	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Oliver Sipple went to his funeral
EDL	00:51:03,551	00:51:09,439	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	He did have one brother George senior who stuck by him throughout but but his parents
EDL	00:51:09,951	00:51:10,719	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Did not
EDL	00:51:10,719	00:51:14,303	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And they never fully accepted the fact that he was gay and end
EDL	00:51:15,327	00:51:16,863	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	To when his mom died
EDL	00:51:16,863	00:51:19,423	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	It was so bad that
EDL	00:51:19,423	00:51:23,263	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Oliver suppose father didn't let him go to the funeral
EDL	00:51:23,263	00:51:25,311	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	And because he he sort of
EDL	00:51:26,079	00:51:27,103	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	He had so far
EDL	00:51:27,615	00:51:30,687	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	So few people I guess at the end and because there weren't
EDL	00:51:31,455	00:51:34,527	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	You know a lot of news articles about him and
EDL	00:51:34,527	00:51:40,159	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Cuz a lot of people in the gay community from that time have died because of the AIDS
EDL	00:51:40,159	00:51:40,927	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Craigslist
EDL	00:51:40,927	00:51:43,743	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	It was really hard to find out what
EDL	00:51:43,743	00:51:45,535	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	Happened to Oliver Sipple nose last

EDL	00:51:50,143	00:51:52,191	| radiolab_podcast17oliversipple |	The only way we could was because
