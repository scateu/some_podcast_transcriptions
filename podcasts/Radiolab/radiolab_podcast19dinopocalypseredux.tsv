EDL	00:00:49,152	00:00:55,552	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	At the Paramount Theater in downtown Seattle with several years ago he called that show apocalyptical cuz it was about
EDL	00:00:55,552	00:00:59,392	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Ending different kinds of endings of different things
EDL	00:00:59,904	00:01:02,464	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	All of these incredible musicians and video artists
EDL	00:01:02,464	00:01:04,512	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Then we had a huge yes
EDL	00:01:04,512	00:01:10,912	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Paw Patrol all of which you can see on the video on my website at radiolab.org but we're going to do for you now

EDL	00:01:14,240	00:01:15,520	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Actually the first
EDL	00:01:15,520	00:01:17,312	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Story in that show which is about the end
EDL	00:01:18,080	00:01:19,104	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Of the dinosaur
EDL	00:01:19,616	00:01:26,016	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Because we have news to tell you about that story and it's a verisimilitude
EDL	00:01:26,016	00:01:29,600	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	So we're going to go first play you part one of our show about dinosaurs
EDL	00:01:29,600	00:01:30,368	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Let's go back to the
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:31,392	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Paramount Theater NC
EDL	00:01:32,416	00:01:38,816	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Started off for us
EDL	00:01:38,816	00:01:45,216	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	You're at Purdue University and I study impact craters among other things
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:51,616	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Create impact craters with his mind but he and his colleagues have been investigating this moment
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:58,016	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Almost as if it were a crime scene that happened not 60 million years ago but yesterday
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:02:04,416	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	In the story that they put together it's more than just interesting it's frankly
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:06,720	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Twinkly terrifying
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:08,768	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Specific
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:10,304	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Take for example
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:14,912	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	The seemingly simple question of when when did it happen if you don't mean like the year
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:16,448	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	That would be a little too specific
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:19,520	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	No I don't know if you remember but Jay got even more specific
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:20,288	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Chicken at
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:22,080	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	This is a casual question that I threw up
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:22,592	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Listen to his
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:25,920	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	By the way do we know anything about seasons was it so warm
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:32,576	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Actually it was between well this is a bit of a stretch but it was sometime between June and July
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:36,416	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	You so specifically how would you know that
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:43,328	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	The reasoning is week we can for example this is the this is the first surprise kind of controversial ideas
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:43,840	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	The basic ghost
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:45,632	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Json
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:47,424	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Scientists have found some Paulo
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:49,472	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	In rocks which date from that
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:50,240	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Two different kinds of pain
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:53,824	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And based on an analysis of those two kinds of pollen
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:03:00,224	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	We know that the impact took place between the flowering of the lotus in the flowering of the waterline
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:04,320	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Lotus you see flowering on the left
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:08,160	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	The water lily flowering on the right you can see this if you look at our video online
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:13,536	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Fossils found at the impact site that had pollen from both of these flowers in the same Rock
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:15,840	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Would suggest
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:17,632	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	The impact did in fact take place
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:19,936	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Somewhere between June and July
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:23,264	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	It's one of those things in Geometry tweet
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:27,104	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	We got a glimpse of a moment far far back in time
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:27,616	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	2
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:29,664	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Let's go deeper into that Moana
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:42,720	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Let's collectively ruined our minds back in time 10 million
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:49,120	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	As of years into the past 66 million years ago to be precise
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:55,520	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	There they are Majestic beasts hanging out on the plains
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:04:01,920	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Eating their Lotus leaves sometime in
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:08,320	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	June June 17th let's say
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:14,720	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Everything on this day pretty much normal this particular
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:17,024	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	People day was no different than any of
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:23,423	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Millions and millions of previous days as far as the dinosaurs were concerned but if there were any astronomer
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:29,311	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Set the time with their work they might have had some inkling that something was coming because
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:35,455	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Had they looked up we would have seen a Time Little Dot of light in the sky
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:39,039	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Where is planets the Moon
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:42,367	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Move with respect to the Stars this would have had a constant bearing
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:44,671	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	An old Seaman could tell you that
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:48,767	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	But if you see something constant bearing that's on a collision course with you
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:50,047	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Nothing of course
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:51,071	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Is Arash
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:52,863	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Zeroing in on the Earth
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:56,191	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	I want to say that we do know quite a bit about
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:57,215	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	This asteroid
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:59,263	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	From the size of the creator
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:04,383	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And from the amount of certain minerals found at the impact site we know that the asteroid was roughly
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:06,175	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	6 miles wide
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:13,599	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And then again roughly 6 miles long which makes it approximately the size of Manhattan Island
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:15,391	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Mount Everest is roughly the size of Mount Everest
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:19,231	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	That is the Robertson a geologist who knows quite a bit about this asteroid
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:20,767	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And by the way it has a name
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:23,327	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	It's the asteroid called Baptists Tina
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:25,375	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Baptist email
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:27,167	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Why xtina
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:27,935	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Baptist in Idaho
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:29,727	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	The name Astrid
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,519	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	On another subject
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:37,919	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	We do know that the Earth's moon was probably produced by a collision with something the size of Mars
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:39,455	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Well
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:41,759	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	I just did that Inc
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:44,575	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	School doesn't really relate to our story
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:50,975	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	The whole evening he was just a do it okay the dinosaurs are here on Earth are eating their leaves meanwhile up in space are asked
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:57,375	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Asteroid Baptist peanut is now hurtling towards the Earth 20000 miles an hour
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:06:03,775	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Times faster than a very fast rifle bullet couldn't be sure what would happen that matter
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:08,639	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Mount Everest size bullet traveling at 20000 miles an hour our atmosphere
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:13,247	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	The atmosphere is really just a very very thin skin over the rest of the yard sale
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:16,063	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Scientists construct the story
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:17,599	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Just take a piece by piece and 1st
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:18,367	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Figure out
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:19,391	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	What would happen
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:20,927	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And when this big ball
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:21,951	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Hurtling through space
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:22,975	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Slams into our atmosphere
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:24,767	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Just made of gas
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:25,535	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Of course
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:28,607	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	So just aproximate let's fire a bullet through some gas
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:35,007	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And Watch What Happens live show de super slow motion
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:37,823	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Video of a gun firing a bullet underwater
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:40,895	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Can see it on the website radiolab.org very beautiful
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:44,223	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	See the ball coming out and freeze it right there at the edge okay
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:47,039	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Basically Seasons bullet steaming through the water
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:51,903	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	By the way we use water as an approximation for gas cuz and gas you would have the same effect I'm about to just
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:53,439	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Creating a wake
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,719	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Behind it in the wake
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:56,511	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	It's wider and wider as a
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:07:00,607	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Trails away from the bullets and if you imagine this shape in 3 dimensions
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:03,423	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Really what you're looking at is a kind of a cone like a funnel shape
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:05,983	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Inside the the
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:07,775	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	The waltz of the funnel
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:09,567	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Inside that cone
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:10,591	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Is nothing
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:12,383	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Nothing
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:19,295	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Nothing because it water so you saying there's a hole in the water that's what I'm saying
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:20,575	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	There's a vacuum in there
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:24,415	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Because the bullet is shooting through the water pushes the water out of the way
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:28,255	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And for a beat the water doesn't have time to come back together and so all you have is emptiness
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:32,607	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Right there this what you're seeing is a massive hole in the water
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:33,631	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Created by
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:36,959	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Now imagine that bullet
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:38,495	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Is 6 miles wide
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:41,055	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And the whole it is making is right above your head
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:43,615	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	What is that mean if your dinosaur look you up with what would happen
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:45,663	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Well if you were in the right
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:51,039	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Play sand in this is going to be the wrong place in a second or two were in the right place
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:53,087	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Tutu look behind the
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:55,391	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Asteroid is it came in
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:57,183	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	You'd probably be able to to
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,975	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	To see clearly through the space
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:04,863	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	What
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:07,167	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Does that mean you would suddenly
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:08,191	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Be looking at a
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:10,239	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Nighttime hole in the daytime sky
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:10,751	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Right
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:18,687	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Jay did tell us that you would need special kinds of eyeballs to see this Nighthawk

EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:27,903	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Just imagine what a last image
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:28,671	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	What do you see
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:29,439	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Day and night
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:30,719	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Come together in the same moment
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:32,767	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	But
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:34,047	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Coordinate
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:35,071	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Better not blink
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:42,239	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Because before you could open your eyes again
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:45,311	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	The asteroid would have hit the surface
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:50,175	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And if you're in a position to to see that then you're going to be in golf

EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:57,087	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	By the way the audience was just laughing at a dinos de los Muertos graphics
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:58,111	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	It just came on the screen
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:09:00,415	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	So we know it was a big explosion fine
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:01,695	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Oedipus violent fine
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:08,095	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	I think we should be a little bit subtle about this because obviously if an asteroid is the size of Manhattan and it lands on your head your
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:09,631	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	You're not going to feel very good about that
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:10,143	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	But if
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:11,679	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Manhattan is
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:13,471	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Is hitting a

EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:20,639	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	That's a little bit like a pebble hitting an enormous beach ball and I can imagine that the little Pebbles

EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:41,631	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Would you like any idea this way
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:43,935	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Let's the next question that we talked to Jay
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:46,239	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	How much damage would this thing a
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:48,287	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Actually do
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:55,199	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	We can produce things

EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:34,367	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	What Pete has he takes projectile so for example you're going to see him
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:40,767	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Take a little glass bullet over there and it's going to load it into the top of the cannon and then he's going to fire it right
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:44,863	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Into a stand up for planet Earth which for him will be a sandpit

EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:36,319	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	That
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:38,367	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Is the sound of a man
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:39,135	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Very happy
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:40,415	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	With his explosion
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:43,487	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	You can see
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:49,887	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Piece of this what's happening so based on experiments like this people like pecan figure out precisely what happened
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:51,679	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	When the asteroid hit the Earth
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:57,567	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	They can quantify the explosions Power by basically leveraging up experiments like this so according to Doug the amount of energy
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:12:01,407	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	That would have been on weeks when nothing came rushing in on Earth
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:02,687	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Roughly
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:04,479	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Are we at the Earth
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:11,135	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	With an explosion that 100 million megatons

EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:25,471	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Turn around had a metal moment
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:27,263	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Don't look at her wrong and she'll do that to you
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:30,591	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Okay so here's essentially how Doug broke that down
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:34,175	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	2 tons of TNT
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:36,991	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	We talk in tongues you're not megatons to tons of TNT
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:39,039	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Will essentially do
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:43,391	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	This
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:47,743	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	On one of the three screens you see a 10-story building in floating
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:50,047	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	2 tons of TNT will takedown build
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:50,815	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Now
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:55,935	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	15000 tons of TNT that is what the United States dropped on Hiroshima
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:13:02,335	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	In 1945 on a second screen we see archival footage of the atomic bomb
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:08,735	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	That chaos has 15000 tons of TNT Robertson a hydrogen bomb
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:15,135	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Current hydrogen bombs are typically of the order of one million tons of TNT
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:21,535	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Equivalent Now 1 million tons of TNT equivalent that's what we call a Megaton if you remember
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:27,935	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Duck said that the asteroid impact was equivalent to 100 million
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:34,335	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	In megatons really what he saying in concrete terms is that that impact was the equivalent of 100 million of those
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:37,407	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Bombs going off all at once in the same spot
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:39,967	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Which is a lot
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:43,551	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Dentistry
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:47,391	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	However I mean it's really depends on what you mean by a lot
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:49,695	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Because I was doing a little Googling
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:51,999	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And I was surprised to learn that
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:56,351	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	110 million megatons is not nearly enough to destroy the planet
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:57,887	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Destroy the entire planet
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:58,399	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	You would need
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:13:59,423	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Ready for this
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:02,495	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	110 quadrillion megatons
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:06,335	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	100 million * 110 million megatons of TNT
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:09,407	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	So going back to your hadrosaur situation Mother 3
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:10,175	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	New Zealand
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:12,223	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	If the thing came in Antipolo to her
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:15,807	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Maybe she would feel the ground shake a little bit
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:17,599	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	But after minutes should be like whatever
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:18,879	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	To go back to eating leaves
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:19,903	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Probably wouldn't notice it
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:23,487	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Oh no no no that's not what we were taught in homeroom
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:26,559	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Buy Mrs lagrou or whoever your teacher what
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:28,607	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Here's the classic explanation
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:29,631	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	There was an impact
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:32,703	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Of course and kicked up an enormous amount of dust to remember this
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:34,751	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	The Dustin kind of covers the planet
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:36,799	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Blankets the earth makes the Earth very cold
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:38,079	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Makes tears very nasty
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:42,687	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	All the big plants die little plants get sick the dinosaurs get hungry the dinosaurs get sick
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:44,223	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And then gradually your leg
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:44,991	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Dad
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:47,807	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Better and better and better from different thing
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:50,623	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	10000 years 30 thousand years for till you get like a
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:54,207	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	900000 years later
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:55,231	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Shivering the last

EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:03,423	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	That's the story we were told
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:09,823	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	In school is a long slow wintry collapse
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:11,359	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	That tired old story from Missy
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:13,919	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Is what it is Magruder's McGruder tonight okay
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:17,503	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	What is offer up a completely different tablets
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:19,039	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	All right
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:25,439	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	But we'll go with that what's actually flipped the understanding completely new science
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:26,463	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Keith
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:30,303	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Pull up that to ballistics video that we showed earlier with the red sand
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:32,095	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Can you put a pull that up and blow it up to the
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:33,375	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Three screens in the
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:34,143	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Yeah rewind it back
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:39,775	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Bitten
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:41,055	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Wilkie
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:44,895	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Okay so this is a 6000 frame a second video that you're sitting here

EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:48,479	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	This point on the screen all you're saying is
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:50,271	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Pit of red sand
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:56,415	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Now what you see in the first few frames as you see the laser hitting right there red sand flying in the air super slo-mo
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:57,695	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	The next
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:16:02,303	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Rainford right there you see some fire see little ball of fire erupts near the impact
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:05,119	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Right where the laser hits the sand there's a little
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:06,399	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Clump of flame in
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:07,423	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Refreeze on that spot

EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:09,023	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	To keep play that one more time
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:11,583	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Play the video again but this time as the ball drops

EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:24,895	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Thank you for the sad so what you would get the same effect
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:25,663	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	You would get that
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:33,343	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Simple boy that's just something we do

EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:40,511	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	So you get that same bounce-back effect
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:44,351	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	A fine blue shooting back in the opposite direction but we know

EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:17,375	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Well that.
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:18,911	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Basically Farm glass very quickly

EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:27,615	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	This is what it looks like

EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:04,479	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	When does the Earth's gravity
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:07,039	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	He's going to grab back hold of it and say come on back
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:09,087	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And 90% of them come back
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:09,599	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	The Earth
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:12,671	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	What does falling glass do
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:16,511	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Because what happens is it the the
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:17,791	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Glass out in space
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:21,631	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Starts to spread out like north and south and east and west
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:25,983	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And eventually it will appear in the sky over New Zealand
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:30,335	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	It's now a global phenomena and you know it's really hard to imagine what the hadrosaur would have seen
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:31,871	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	But the thing to keep in mind
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:33,919	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Is it these things are coming in
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:37,759	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	97% or burning up in the atmosphere
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:39,551	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	So very few of them were hiding the gray
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:41,343	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	From her point of view
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:43,135	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Probably would have looked
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:44,927	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Greatest meteor shower
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:46,975	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Anyone has ever seen

EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:57,471	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Depositing
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:59,519	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	A little bit of heat into the sky
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:04,127	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Collectively there's such a massive rain of these things coming in
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:06,175	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Well
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:08,479	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	The heat would build up the sky would turn red
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:14,623	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	It would be getting hotter and hotter
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:27,680	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Hot exactly would have gotten the cow much heat exactly would have built up there in the sky and then
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:34,080	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And started to radiate down calculated the amount of heat that would come
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:40,480	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	10 kilowatts per square meter and get this number well what what does that
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:46,880	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Well I went home and Ike current meter and
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:53,280	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Tried to measure the amount of heat produced in my oven for different amounts of power and I could get
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:59,680	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	About 7 kilowatts per square meter in my oven on broil and

EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:25,280	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	We're above the ground on the earth on that day you would have experienced some heat it is almost
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:31,680	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Unimaginable maybe it started it a hundred degrees cuz it was June was summer

EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:15,104	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	From the impact of the glass rain to the incineration of
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:17,408	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	All of these species on the planet
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:18,688	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	It would have taken a few hours
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:23,296	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	His best guess
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:25,344	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	He thinks Maybe
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:26,624	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	2
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:27,136	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Hours
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:31,488	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	I mean that's less time than
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:33,536	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	A business lunch
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:36,352	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	You tried getting East

EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:43,008	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Miss you think about it
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:46,336	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	That is less time than you will spend
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:47,104	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	In this theater
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:48,384	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Tonight
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:23,712	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	That means that you're saying that
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:25,504	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	An animal
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:28,064	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	That had been Supreme on the planet
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:30,880	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	100 million years
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:32,416	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Disappears
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:33,184	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	In
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:34,208	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Few hours
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:34,976	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Completely
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:36,512	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Yes
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:38,560	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	That's what
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:40,352	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	The evidence suggests
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:41,632	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	That's right
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:52,640	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Well you can consider the evidence but also you can consider common sense and we've got
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:54,176	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	A world
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:25:58,272	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Bills with terrestrial dinosaurs they were on every continent there even in Antarctica
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:02,368	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And just say that they all disappeared
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:03,904	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	In 2 hours and
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:05,952	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	All that wood that suggests
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:11,328	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	But there's none of them in out of Harm's Way none of them in the cave summer
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:12,864	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	None of them in the grotto
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:14,656	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	None of them in a in a
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:18,752	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Acted Paris that any climate the word all not connection
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:20,544	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	It's just too much
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:22,592	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	I just don't buy it
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:24,896	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	The truth is that the science is never going to be
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:27,456	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	So exact
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:27,968	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	To say
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:29,504	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Yeah all of them disappeared
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:31,040	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	It happened on a
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:31,552	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Single day
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:33,088	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Renewing mean
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:34,368	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Note that we have is
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:36,416	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	What json is
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:37,952	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Happen fast
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:39,488	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Very fast
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:40,256	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Nothing made it through
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:43,584	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	What I find interesting is It ultimately
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:45,632	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	You don't need the ballistics
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:49,728	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Anything we've shown you so far to know that something major and sudden
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:52,544	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Because you can see evidence
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:54,848	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Of it literally etched into the Earth
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:55,360	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	So
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:57,920	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Here's the spot
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:27:00,480	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Where we first found
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:03,296	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	You can see really well out in Colorado
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:07,392	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Actually we sent one of our producers Molly Webster out there to meet of paleontology

EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:10,976	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	They hiked over a couple of hills
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:16,608	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Stikbot dinosaur come around the corner and
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:18,144	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	He started to dig

EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:27,872	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	From where we were
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:29,664	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Turns out
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:32,224	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	33 ft down 10,000 years in time
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:34,016	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	See the Earth has layers
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:35,808	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Pelican tree has ring
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:38,624	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And every 3 ft down you go you're going back in
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:39,904	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Time about ten thousand years
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:42,976	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	When you go all the way down all the way back
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:46,048	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	66.09 million years
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:48,352	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	You will find this one little
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:50,144	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Skinny strip of Rock
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:58,080	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	That's
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:02,688	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	This one skinny Gray Line
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:06,016	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Grey crappie
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:09,856	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Doing a very real way that line that you're seeing that represents
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:11,136	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	D-Day
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:11,648	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	The asteroid
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:12,672	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	D-Day
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:14,720	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Just above that line
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:16,512	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	That's a little bit after the day
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:18,048	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Just below that line was a little bit before
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:20,352	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	The line is called the KT boundary
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:21,888	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And what school is Uconnect
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:23,424	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	You can touch
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:24,448	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Evidence of
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:28,032	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And in fact her what he did that day was he took it
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:30,336	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Peace out in hands at the mall
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:35,200	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	You hold in your home in the KT boundary
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:37,760	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	It's like
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:38,528	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Homosexual
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:39,808	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Yeah but it's not
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:42,112	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	What you're holding is a dark gray mudstone
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:43,392	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Carbon-rich meds
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:46,720	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	In that must own you'll find all kinds of things and you'll find
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:48,256	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	A very rare
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:49,536	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Minerals like iridium
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:51,840	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	It probably came in on the app
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:53,376	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	The Beltline
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:55,680	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Those little glass balls
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:56,960	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	I was talking about the little hell balls
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:29:00,288	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	We could get out a microscope and you look at that rock
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:01,824	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	You will see them in there
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:05,920	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	We put up a funny cartoon of the
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:08,736	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	They're all in that line
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:10,016	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Perfect you think that line is
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:10,784	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	What's it matter
EDL	00:29:10,784	00:29:11,552	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Inch
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:14,368	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Is hidden in there as sort of the story of the
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:15,904	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Absolutely
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:18,976	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And here's the crazy thing if this is the line right here this
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:20,000	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Strip here
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:22,048	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Robert chase the picture of the KT boundary
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:28,448	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	You didn't just below the line you were going to find over and over again dinosaurs everybody not going to
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:29,472	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Baby Alive
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:32,288	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	It's just putting some toy dinosaurs under the line and making the move
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:35,360	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Getting in a certain amount of energy which I shouldn't
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:36,896	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	But their fossils
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:39,712	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And you will find dinosaur fossils
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:40,736	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	From Europe
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:42,016	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Idaho
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:43,552	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And Montana this one
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:44,576	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Says with me
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:45,856	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	China
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:46,368	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	But
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:48,416	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Maybe just go above the law
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:51,488	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	You don't find any dinosaur So Below the line
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:53,792	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Find the sum look everywhere above
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:55,584	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	They haven't
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:29:58,912	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Everywhere they have looked anyway
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:29:59,680	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	They found
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:00,192	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Nothing
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:04,800	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	It's a different world that's the amazing thing is a different world

EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:53,856	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Basically I want to hear about this
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:55,648	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Did you know did something
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:57,696	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	It just means you lean back and say
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:31:58,976	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Wow
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:31:59,744	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	How do they do that
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:05,120	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:07,936	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:12,032	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:13,824	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Or maybe the kitchen mat
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:16,640	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Music in the margin of their geometry
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:19,200	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	We're interested in the

EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:03,232	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	You're thinking of something different
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:04,000	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	It was some
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:08,864	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Guy who sort of an amateur and he was lifting he went to South Dakota

EDL	00:33:10,400	00:33:12,960	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Maybe you should bring them to me
EDL	00:33:12,960	00:33:16,800	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	From our reporter Molly Webster who reported that story for us

EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:20,128	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Here again with
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:20,896	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Them
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:21,664	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	News
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:26,272	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Updating the apocalyptical episode which was
EDL	00:33:26,272	00:33:32,416	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Probably the last time I saw you
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:35,744	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And the reason we're updating it is because
EDL	00:33:36,256	00:33:39,328	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	This science article came out the basically if
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:42,400	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	It proves
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:43,680	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	To be true
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:45,216	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	It could be
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:47,008	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	One of the largest
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:50,592	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Paleontological discoveries of the day the dinosaur
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:55,456	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	First I day claims to tell the story of the first
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:57,504	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	15 minutes
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:33:59,296	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Two three hours
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:03,136	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	After the asteroid hit down in Mexico
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:07,744	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And basically what it is is geologic
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:09,280	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Formation that is
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:13,632	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Kind of like that line that we song Colorado but like that line on steroid
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:17,216	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	It's in the southwest corner
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:19,264	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Of North Dakota
EDL	00:34:19,264	00:34:19,776	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Those two
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:24,128	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Is not close to the Gulf of Mexico. It's like
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:26,432	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	3000 km away
EDL	00:34:26,432	00:34:29,248	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And this particular site used to be a guess
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:35,648	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	The assumption is 66 million years ago that it was kind of like a river but like a river valley that was muddy and
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:39,744	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Warm and it was near something about the Western interior Seaway
EDL	00:34:39,744	00:34:41,280	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	So then what did they find there
EDL	00:34:41,792	00:34:44,096	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	So one of the authors on this paper is
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:44,864	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	On this
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:47,424	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Super Famous paleontologist Ian Smith
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:48,448	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	He said
EDL	00:34:49,472	00:34:51,520	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	When he went to the site
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:53,056	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And he stood there
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:55,616	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	He's like what I see in this place
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:59,712	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Is a three-hour story of that day with all the victims
EDL	00:34:59,712	00:35:02,016	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And it feels like a movie is playing out
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:02,528	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Before me
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:08,928	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Puerto Rican started turned into a scene by scene by scene Adventure in time
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:11,744	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Story that they lay out in the paper
EDL	00:35:12,256	00:35:13,024	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Is that
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:18,400	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	This area within like 15 minutes after the asteroid
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:19,424	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	It was
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:21,216	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Hit by waves
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:23,008	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	From the Western interior sea
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:26,080	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And they brought with them
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:32,224	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Saltwater fish in like seashells and things like into this freshwater area
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:36,576	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And then at the same time remember like we talked about those glass balls
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:38,112	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	He fell from the sky view
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:43,232	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	So the story that this area tells is that there are actually kind of like
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:44,512	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Three phases
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:50,656	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Of those glass balls of various like size and proportions and some they wouldn't really really far until like space
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:53,472	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And came back and said they came back
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:54,240	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Later
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:56,544	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Then all the other ones and armoire
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:36:02,944	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	You know it's funny it's like all glass balls in the end really if you're a paleontologist you're really gay
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:08,064	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Taking out right now over like the different types of glass balls that this site holds stress balls
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:12,416	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Spill of the giant crash and some of them are actually made of
EDL	00:36:12,416	00:36:14,208	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Particles from the
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:20,608	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Actual impact site like in all of the previous sites they had found in the United States none of those
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:22,400	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Glass balls are actually still glass
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:27,776	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	They had decomposed into clay apparently glass will change into clay overtime I did not know this
EDL	00:36:28,800	00:36:29,568	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	But in this
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:32,384	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Location they actually have glass
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:35,200	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Unaltered by the passage of time
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:38,016	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	So it holds within it like the air
EDL	00:36:38,528	00:36:42,112	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	In geochemistry jobs that day
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:43,648	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And that place
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:49,792	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And they found some that were actually I feel like the such a Jurassic Park when they found some that were trapped in Amber
EDL	00:36:50,304	00:36:53,120	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	That haven't that are totally unaltered
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:37:00,288	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	I really don't know anything except for that like Jurassic Park made me think that anything and Amber is really important
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:01,312	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	14
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:07,456	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And Jerry Ojos
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:11,296	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And I'm just the backup
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:13,344	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Back in the day on the day that this
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:15,648	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	This asteroid hit the Earth
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:16,672	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	That was a
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:19,744	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Tropical whale population place
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:26,656	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Yeso subtropical well-populated have dinosaurs and it would have
EDL	00:37:26,656	00:37:29,984	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Stores that would have fish it seemed to be covered in trees
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:32,800	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Insects lots of insects
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:38,432	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Mammals looks like yeah whatever our oldest man was
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:40,736	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Yes it was a really like Lush
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:42,016	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Happening area
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:43,808	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And what they see
EDL	00:37:43,808	00:37:46,624	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	In this site that they've uncovered today
EDL	00:37:46,624	00:37:49,696	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Is what appears to be instantaneous death
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:51,488	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Describe
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:54,560	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Fish that are stacked dead fish besides fish
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:57,120	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	That are stacked like logs and it's
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:59,424	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Freshwater fish and marine fish
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:38:01,984	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And they do describe it as like a mass grave
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:03,264	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	There are fish
EDL	00:38:03,264	00:38:05,312	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Fossils like wrapped around
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:06,592	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Tree bases
EDL	00:38:06,592	00:38:11,456	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Like like creatures and plants and stones and Pebbles and shellfish and everything
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:15,040	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Saltwater freshwater everything with smooshed together
EDL	00:38:15,040	00:38:19,392	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Tumble of light that was like Throne like almost like thrown together in a wash in like
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:23,488	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Mixed up you know if you're if you're an animal
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:25,536	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	In that moment you're there
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:28,096	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And something happens in Mexico and you have no idea
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:29,632	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	But maybe about
EDL	00:38:29,632	00:38:35,520	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	15 minutes after that thing happened in Mexico that you have no idea about you might feel the Earth Rumble
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:41,408	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	There's some shaking and then that rumbling that shaking
EDL	00:38:41,408	00:38:44,992	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	I'm comes with it a big wave from the sea
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:46,784	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And so you get this big
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:48,832	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	It comes in
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:50,624	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And then what happens is that
EDL	00:38:50,624	00:38:53,696	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Comes in as you're already starting to get
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:55,744	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	The glass balls from the heaven
EDL	00:38:56,768	00:38:57,792	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And so
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:39:03,936	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And what they see is you get this like wave of kind of what seems to be almost like raining glass balls
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:06,752	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And then that's like Mick
EDL	00:39:06,752	00:39:09,056	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Stand with the mud from like the title
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:11,872	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And the layers of things that are dying
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:16,992	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	The fish like some of the details that stand out to me the most
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:19,808	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	The fish are all
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:21,856	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Generally pointed in the same direction
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:23,136	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And they're like
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:26,208	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Stacked pretty tightly mouths open
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:27,232	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And their fins
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:28,000	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Splayed
EDL	00:39:28,000	00:39:30,816	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	But one of the things I think it's super cool is that
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:35,680	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	All that different stuff we talked about happening across the globe in are original
EDL	00:39:35,680	00:39:36,448	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Show
EDL	00:39:36,448	00:39:37,472	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Probably got really hot
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:44,384	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	But you know that was Jay melosh was like it's really hot that Robertson was talking about like the boiler the boiler effect and then we talked
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:50,784	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	What about the flashing blue light we talked about things raining from the sky and we talked about June or July all that's
EDL	00:39:50,784	00:39:54,880	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Stuff a lot of that stuff was based on really smart models
EDL	00:39:55,648	00:39:58,720	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	This seems to be a place it actually will
EDL	00:39:58,720	00:39:59,744	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Provide evidence
EDL	00:40:00,256	00:40:02,304	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Either for or against those models
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:04,352	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	How much are tree trunks
EDL	00:40:04,352	00:40:08,960	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Which I think made like Jay melosh really happy cuz he was like I did get really hot
EDL	00:40:08,960	00:40:12,288	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Tea towel and then they're like the fish wrapped around trees
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:16,128	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And then there appears to be a dinosaur bone
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:18,688	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Possibly dinosaur bones
EDL	00:40:18,688	00:40:19,712	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Skin still attached
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:25,856	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Kirk Johnson said if if that is if it really is a dinosaur bone and that site is connected
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:29,696	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Did the asteroid impact like I think it is it would be the youngest dinosaur ever
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:34,816	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	My last question is is there something we need to know about the man whose
EDL	00:40:34,816	00:40:35,328	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Dig this
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:37,888	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	That would
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:40,704	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Color are feelings about the studies
EDL	00:40:40,704	00:40:44,544	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Author the main authors this guy Robert DePalma he's in his late 30s
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:46,848	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Does not have a PhD
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:48,640	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	He works
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:52,736	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	A lot outside of normal Academia but
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:55,808	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Jay melosh who is in our first thing
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:40:59,136	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	He is the editor on the on the article
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:41:00,416	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And then
EDL	00:41:00,416	00:41:04,000	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Walter Alvarez and Ian smitter in the article
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:05,024	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Are co-authors
EDL	00:41:05,536	00:41:09,632	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And then this other guy like Mark Mark Richards who's like a really famous
EDL	00:41:10,144	00:41:11,424	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Tsunami earthquake guy
EDL	00:41:13,216	00:41:19,616	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	So you think he's got a collection of people around him and I think everyone else says like if the stuff that they say that they have is
EDL	00:41:19,616	00:41:20,128	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	There
EDL	00:41:20,896	00:41:21,664	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	It's amazing
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:24,736	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	They do think one of the things in the paper like is like
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:27,040	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	People are like you are claiming
EDL	00:41:27,808	00:41:34,208	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	To know a 3-hour window 66 million years ago that is a very big claim right you're really
EDL	00:41:34,208	00:41:35,232	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Going to have to produce
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:37,280	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	A lot of evidence
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:41,376	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And I think that people think it could be there
EDL	00:41:41,376	00:41:44,448	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	But you convinced me if you got
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:50,848	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	It look like a animal all squished up together all at once and you got rain that you can account for
EDL	00:41:50,848	00:41:52,128	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	In different stages
EDL	00:41:52,640	00:41:54,431	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And that looks like you're right there at the
EDL	00:41:54,431	00:41:56,991	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Black moment plus 3 hours
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:41:59,551	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And everything's dead and
EDL	00:41:59,551	00:42:02,623	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	The forest is burned just like if it's almost like it's
EDL	00:42:02,623	00:42:08,255	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Exactly what we said I know I was like well I'm hooked it's just it does leave you at the end of the day
EDL	00:42:08,767	00:42:13,119	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Feeling a little bit nervous to be on this big safe blue.
EDL	00:42:13,887	00:42:16,703	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Recognizing that we are so vulnerable with life
EDL	00:42:17,215	00:42:18,495	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Is really fragile
EDL	00:42:19,263	00:42:20,031	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	When a pebble
EDL	00:42:20,543	00:42:21,055	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Can
EDL	00:42:21,823	00:42:24,895	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Murder know what I think is the crazy part is
EDL	00:42:25,407	00:42:27,455	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	If you were an animal
EDL	00:42:27,455	00:42:29,247	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Standing in North Dakota
EDL	00:42:29,247	00:42:32,063	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	You would have no idea what was happening
EDL	00:42:32,063	00:42:35,647	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	There's like I like logic I like to be able to say oh there's a source
EDL	00:42:35,647	00:42:37,183	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And then nothing happened
EDL	00:42:37,183	00:42:43,583	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	And to just be there and all of a sudden the Earth starts rattling like a bell around you and then a title
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:46,655	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Wave comes in and then I'm dead
EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:47,423	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Casino
EDL	00:42:47,935	00:42:54,079	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Like that to me is the most is the most stunning part is it should have salt on your mouth
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:57,151	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Yeah it's just
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:42:58,175	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	It's just like
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:03,039	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	To just be standing there unawares and then a
EDL	00:43:03,039	00:43:04,319	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Thing happens
EDL	00:43:04,831	00:43:06,879	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	That really has nothing to do with you
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:07,391	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	Nothing
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:08,927	| radiolab_podcast19dinopocalypseredux |	That's a weird
