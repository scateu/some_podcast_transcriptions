EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:20,544	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	One night this is 2010 I was sat in the office
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:25,664	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	She sitting there one night and Clive Stafford Smith who's the president of reprieve or the head of reprieve
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:26,688	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Calls and says.
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:28,480	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Execution tonight
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:33,088	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The execution in Arizona tonight
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:34,368	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	For killing Chester Drive
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:38,464	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Which found guilty of strangling and stabbing
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:39,744	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	In 1989
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:46,144	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The client says there's an execution tonight and we just found out that the lethal injection drugs that they're going to use
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:48,704	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	It came from a pharmacy in England
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:52,800	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	But we don't know which pharmacy because Arizona refuses to release
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:57,920	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Is the name does anyone in the office have some time alone to have some time to figure out where this trucks could have come from
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:03:00,736	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	She raises her hand she's like I have 30 minutes you know
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:04,064	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I didn't know
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:05,344	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	What I was starting when
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:06,880	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I started
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:08,928	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Supplier like why does it help them
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:11,744	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	What the drugs that they want to use an Arizona have to be FDA
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:18,144	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	So they can find who made these drugs and prove that they are not FDA-approved and they can probably stop there
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:22,752	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Execution do they have any reason to think the drugs weren't FDA-approved is kind of a Hail Mary
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:24,544	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Also
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:28,640	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I started the half-hour research task it is taking me now five and a half years
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:31,200	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I was trying to figure out with
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:32,736	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Limited information
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:36,832	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Where sodium thiopental could have come from in the UK to get to the US
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:42,720	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Sodium thiopental is an anesthetic and for a long time it was one of the most common anesthetics used in surgeries
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:45,792	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Is also one of the drugs used in lethal injection
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:47,072	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I was so
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:49,888	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I didn't
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:53,216	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The puppets full reset that I was doing but I was doing it very quickly
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:56,544	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Execution last night
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:57,824	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Is running out of
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:58,592	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Time
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,104	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And option
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:01,664	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	It was I was in the UK so
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:04,736	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The evening morning Arizona time we had
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:05,760	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Number of hours
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:07,808	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	She's like frantically searching
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:09,856	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Medical regulations
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:11,392	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And you know she can
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:17,791	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Figure out exactly what the name of the company is there's no way to know at that point But ultimately she does figure out that there are
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:19,327	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	No UK
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:20,095	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Companies
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:25,983	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Authorized to ship this drug to the US there was no effect Aveeno FDA approved supplier of
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:28,799	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Stop whatever this mystery Pharmacy was
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:30,591	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	It probably wasn't FDA approved
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:32,127	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And I remember
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:35,199	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Can I email that over I think we had the time to intern affidavit
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:36,735	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	From me or from 5

EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:42,367	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The execution that night
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:43,135	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Twist

EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:46,975	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	When I went to sleep having stayed and I just thought
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:49,023	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	You got a bit of time
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:51,071	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Next morning

EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:42,783	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Did rule
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:45,599	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	That there was no reason to believe that the drug wasn't

EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:00,863	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	She does next me just give you a little bit of context
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:09,567	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	In the fall of 2010 when Jeffrey landrigan was executed
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:10,847	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The drug that they use
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:17,247	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The lethal drug sodium thiopental suddenly in really short supply
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:23,647	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Is the only us company that still made that drug was having like a manufacturing problem so they had stopped many
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:24,927	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Factoring
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:25,951	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Producing this tribe
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:32,095	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	So you actually see these emails between states like dude you have any sodium thiopental
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:33,631	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	From right next door
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:37,727	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Arizona agreed to lend California a cup of death
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:44,639	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And there's actually someone great email exchange between like the California Department of Corrections they send Arizona
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:46,943	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Thank you email writing and I quote
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:53,855	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	You guys in Arizona are Lifesavers go buy you a beer next time I see you
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:56,927	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	You're a lifesaver at come on
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:08:02,559	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Yeah so when Jeffrey landrigan is set to be executed Arizona is out of that drug
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:05,887	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And this is how they end up at this mystery Drug Company in London
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:14,847	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	So after the execution my is doing all this research she's calling Pharma company on to these documents
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:21,247	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And very quickly she learns that the same company that is sending drugs to Arizona accent drugs till I can buy lots of different states
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:25,343	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	South Carolina Kentucky California and various other places
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:29,695	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	They actually become one of the primary suppliers that we've won Jackson Drugs to the United States
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:33,023	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Tell me again why was it so hard to find out information about this company
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:36,351	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	So what happens is that anybody involved with an X
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:37,631	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Excuse and your name is kept confidential
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:41,727	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And states have started keeping companies names confidential to
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:45,567	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	So next she starts calling suppliers and
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:47,103	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Distributors
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:47,871	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Like how did the
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:52,223	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	This drug get to that company thinking that maybe that'll later to it we had figured out
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:55,807	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	It had come originally from
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:58,623	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I was active ingredients made in Austria
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:01,695	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Some of those with sent over to Germany
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:08,095	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The package put into biles those were sent over to the UK that was one company that had got the marketing with citation
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:11,167	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	There's also another one that company chasing then
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:12,191	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	They were sent
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:12,959	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	2
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:14,495	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Company in England
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:17,311	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	But you still can't figure out the identity of
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:19,359	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	But then the real breakthrough came to
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:21,407	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Couple months after Jeffrey landrigan was
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:28,831	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I think it was a lot of material coming out to that time I'm going to California and the ACLU got a bunch of documents and in one of the
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:30,111	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	These batches of documents
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:31,647	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	She finds an invoice
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:32,671	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And this invoice

EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:49,311	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Figuring out
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:50,079	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The stuff
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:51,615	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And those with the document
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,895	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	That had the

EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:32,671	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	What's the country in 1972 the Supreme Court actually abolished the death penalty
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:35,487	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Cuz they said it was being applied unfairly herb
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:35,999	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Haphazard

EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:43,423	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	So Bill Wiseman is an Oklahoma Legislature and he's like
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:45,983	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Great this is not a problem we'll ever have to worry about
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:48,799	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The problem is the public is furious about this decision
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:55,199	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Support goes from 50 to 63% in just two years
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:57,759	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Absolutely I
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:18:04,159	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Very much in favor and favor of it we get some Law & Order into this country.
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:10,559	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I don't think I should have taken away in the first place and almost immediately 35 States rewrite their death penalty laws essentially saying like
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:11,839	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	We can do this right
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:13,631	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	End in 1976
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:14,655	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The Supreme Court says
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:15,423	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	All right
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:19,519	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	If you can administer the death penalty fairly and humanely you can have it back
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:26,175	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	So 9072a death penalty abolished 1976 it's reinstated
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:28,735	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Bill Wiseman get selected smack-dab in the middle of this
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:31,039	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	So you know 1976
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:31,807	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Suddenly
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:36,927	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	There's a bill in Oklahoma State Legislature about whether to reinstate the death penalty and bilhah
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:37,439	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Have to vote on that
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:38,975	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I know
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:40,767	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The capital punishment
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:43,071	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Interested it doesn't work doesn't
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:47,679	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I couldn't see any way to justify I also knew
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:50,751	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Terrified voted against it from my district
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:51,775	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I would
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:54,335	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Run a high chance of getting whooped
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:58,175	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Cuz 80% of his constituents were in favor of the death penalty
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:00,735	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	All that wondering
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:03,551	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	20 found this job that you love
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:06,367	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Last time I didn't want to get whooped so I was
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:07,391	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	In a real dilemma
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:08,671	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	What you do
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:10,975	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The wrong thing
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:14,047	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Devoted to reinstate the death penalty
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:15,327	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	For whatever reason
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:21,727	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Ego or vanity or need or the motivation to get reelected whatever the reasons
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:23,519	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I knowingly made it
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:25,055	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	A decision
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:27,103	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	When I know is wrong
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:27,615	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And ice
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:37,855	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Who's in the legislature and he's feeling like he just sold his soul
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:44,255	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And as they're debating various amendments to this law someone brings up something sort of vaguely about a more humane
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:47,327	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Anyway to execute people and he's like that yes that
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:49,631	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And he becomes obsessed with this idea
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:51,679	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I was like a way to assuage his guilt
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:58,079	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Yeah so he brings up some anesthesiologist and doctors and says I want to find a better way to do this and they say we can't help you cuz the
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:20:00,383	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Hippocratic Oath Do no harm death
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:04,991	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Is a little bit of firearms 3 goes to the State medical examiner a guy named Jay Chapman
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:09,855	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And Jay just sort of like freestyles has one line that that bill
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:13,951	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Literally just sits with a yellow legal pad and rights word for word it should
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:18,047	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I'm an intravenous saline drip should be established
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:20,607	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	High-end which be introduced
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:21,375	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Hey
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:23,679	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Ultra short-acting barbiturate
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:24,447	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	In combination
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:25,727	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Michael paralytic
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:31,615	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The idea is that these three drugs would allow them to execute people but but painlessly
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:35,455	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And right there in that office with just like
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:36,735	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Does yellow legal pad
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:39,807	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	They invent lethal injection in America
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:43,903	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	It's it would be
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:46,463	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Hard to overstate just how important this
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:48,767	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Moment in this offices because
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:50,303	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The supreme court of justice
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:53,119	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Given the country back the death penalty on the
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:57,215	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Grounds and the idea that we could we could do this right
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:21:00,287	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And what bill has just handed America
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:04,639	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Is is it a way to have the death penalty but but how to be humane
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:06,431	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The ideal death metal
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:07,455	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Yeah
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:12,063	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Oklahoma adopted and then the very next date
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:14,367	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Texas does and then dozens of states and
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:15,391	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Since that moment
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:17,952	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	88% of all executions
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:18,976	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Baidu
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:19,744	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Injection
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:23,584	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I don't hear the word lethal injection or execution or anything else without
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:25,888	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Feeling a tug
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:27,424	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	It's tied to me
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:28,192	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I mean I'll always be
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:35,360	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Which he live to regret he thinks that he actually extended the life of the death penalty and he actually eventually quit
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:38,432	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	This job becomes a pastor and becomes a very
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:40,480	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	A strong anti-death penalty
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:41,760	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Advocate
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:43,040	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	How does a man
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:44,320	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Who came up with the recipe
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:44,832	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	For lethal injection
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:47,392	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	What does he do on judging
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:50,208	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The same thing everyone else does
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:53,024	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	So ourselves on the mercy of God
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:55,072	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Say that way
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:56,352	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Have done wrong and where
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:04,032	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Nothing that I find really interesting is that if you look at the Modern lethal injection cocktail
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:08,128	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Three drugs affect drug special needs Society II drug paralyzes you
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:11,200	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And the Third Reich is the actor that stops the heart in
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:17,344	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Kelsey in this drug cocktail you kind of see everything that we want and need from the death penalty just kind of all
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:18,624	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Together
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:24,000	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The third drug that stops your heart that's kind of our sense of justice
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:26,816	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The first drug the anesthetic
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:29,632	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Kind of our sense of humanity or kindness
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:31,424	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	That second drug
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:33,216	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The one that paralyzes their muscle
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:34,496	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I told the second draw
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:36,032	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Is purely cosmetic
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:37,568	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	It sucks
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:39,104	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	No medical purpose
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:44,224	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The reason it was put into the lethal injection cocktail in the first place was
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:45,248	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	So that
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:48,064	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	It's the first truck doesn't work effectively
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:52,672	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The second drug will mask any signs of
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:57,792	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Visible suffering and it would be extremely significant
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:22:59,584	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Because potassium chloride
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:05,984	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Potent acid that people have described as being like fire going through your veins and beings
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:07,264	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Bentley from the inside
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:11,104	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	She said just imagine that that's happening to you
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:13,920	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	But something is wrong with the anesthetic and you become conscious
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:15,456	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	You have this
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:17,504	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Burning acid going through your body
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:21,600	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And you're paralyzed all your voluntary muscles are paralyzed
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:23,392	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	So you can't say
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:26,976	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I'm awake I can feel everything this is agony
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:32,864	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	She says that it's that second drug that is both the thing that could make the execution most torturous
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:35,680	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And the thing that meant that
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:37,472	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Tweed Witnesses reviews
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:38,240	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Public
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:39,776	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Wouldn't know that it was torture
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:42,080	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Because we weren't supposed to know that
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:49,504	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Two does she end up going after that second Reich the paralytic no actually seek she goes after the first ride the anesthetic and it's
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:51,040	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	A total coincidence this is just
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:53,344	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The one that had manufacturing problems with starter
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:53,856	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The arms race
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:57,952	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	But it turns out that this drug
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:58,464	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Sodium fire
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:00,768	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The anesthetic is the one that's
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:03,072	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The most constitutionally important Drive
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:09,472	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Because in 2008 when the Supreme Court ruled on lethal injection they said
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:12,800	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The first drug is necessary to prevent the prisoner
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:15,104	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	From experiencing severe pain
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:16,384	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	So there's no anesthetic
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:17,408	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	There is pain
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:22,784	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Which would be too severe and then be there for what an Eighth Amendment violation
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:24,320	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Cool unusual punishment exactly
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:27,904	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	So that drug the anesthetic is the key drug
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:34,048	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	But over the past five and a half years is Maya has like Wacom old her way across these different companies
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:36,608	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	She just made it harder and harder to get
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:39,168	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	There now 20 + companies
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:45,312	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Who have they said we disapprove of the misuse of medicines and executions and we're going to take steps to prevent
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:52,224	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And that has States scrambling the drug use and it's 32 death penalty States or now
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:58,624	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Running out they have run out of drugs and it's a result of what you've seen is that things have gotten very DIY
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:25:02,464	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I'm trying new procedures never used before in the history of execution
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:05,280	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Prison officials are in a difficult position
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:11,680	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Human have the DEA start raiding prison
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:18,080	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Their Central using illegal drugs at this point until reporters are just starting to pay more attention and
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:23,968	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	In the middle of all that he began kicking his feet lifting his head in his chest off the gurney grimacing
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:25,504	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	How do you also get
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:26,528	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Seems like this
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:29,856	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	High Country cast season in and a couple moments he actually mumbled
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:35,232	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	He would open his mouth and you'd see his chest move and we'll go all the way down to stomach so so clear gas
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:42,656	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	April 29th 2014 in Oklahoma a man in Clayton Lockett was being executed for murder rape in

EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:51,616	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Started thrashing
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:53,664	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Clenching his teeth and start moving the arm
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:56,736	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	43 minutes to die

EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:10,816	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Your situations like this in Arizona Ohio this drug formula is unconstitutional because boobs
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:14,400	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Started filing a bunch of lawsuits and one of these eventually got to the
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:14,912	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Supreme Court
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:22,592	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	1479 55in interesting Lee when it got to the Supreme Court
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:23,616	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Honest about what's going on
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:25,664	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Things got very tense
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:27,456	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	This is Justice Alito
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:28,224	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Is saying essentially
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:32,064	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Actually a problem you made it a problem
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:34,112	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Executions could be carried out
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:36,160	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Actually there many jurisdictions
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:38,208	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Their jurisdictions in this country their jurisdiction
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:47,424	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	By the Abolitionist Movement
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:51,776	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And this is Justice Scalia
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:54,592	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	So that the states cannot obtain
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:55,872	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Vote to Other Drugs
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:27:00,224	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And now you want to come before the court and say well
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:01,760	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	It's not 100% sure
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:12,256	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Is it appropriate for the Judiciary
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:14,304	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	To countenance what amounts
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:15,840	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	To a guerrilla War
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:16,352	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Against
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:19,680	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	What you think it means by Guerilla War
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:21,216	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Thank you
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:27,616	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Trying to say there are ways to 2 if you want to make the death penalty illegal you have ways to do it
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:30,176	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	You can call your legislator you can pressure them think about
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:34,016	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The law but you're trying to like hide in the trees and like pulled
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:34,784	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Drugs off
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:35,552	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:36,832	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Make themselves scarce
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:38,368	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	That you're forcing
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:40,160	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Illegal problem that doesn't exist
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:46,048	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Without you answer to the question
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:47,584	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	You've been interrupted
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:50,912	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Does justice has called you guys out kind of
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:51,680	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Yeah
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:52,192	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	It's
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:55,776	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Look into this a lot of narrative around this being
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,056	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Thriller activity
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:27:59,872	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	But this is nothing to do
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:01,664	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	With me or anyone else
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:03,712	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	It's that the companies
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:05,760	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Don't want that medicines ucinet
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:10,368	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Executions the manufacturers that Distributors the pharmacist anesthesiologist
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:13,184	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Whoever else it might be the Indian industry
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:16,256	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	None of them has to be positive
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:17,792	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Ohio capital punishment machine
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:24,960	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Listen to an argument to be made here I mean I get what you're saying that like all these different people in different countries have been like unknowingly
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:26,496	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Grafted onto Ohio sex
EDL	00:28:26,496	00:28:30,080	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Execution team which doesn't seem fair but is there an argument to be made that like
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:31,616	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Even so
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:35,200	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The effect is that she has taken a death penalty that is
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:37,760	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Kind of Humane Maybe
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:39,040	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And made it more cruel
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:41,344	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Because that's kind of the accusation in the air
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:42,368	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	It's
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:46,208	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I'm going to say two things one of them throw away
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:52,608	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	She didn't cause it she's the states are chasing the companies and she's chasing the states right so like you can't say that
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:57,728	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	She caused it but what you more importantly what you also can't say is that it is actually more cruel
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:28:58,496	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Because
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:29:00,032	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	There's no evidence
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:01,312	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	That there's been an increase
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:01,824	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Christen Bachelor
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:05,920	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Executions what I think is happening is just that we're paying
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:07,200	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	More attention to Lisa Lynch
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:08,480	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Tonight we're just
EDL	00:29:08,480	00:29:08,992	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Looking at it more
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:10,528	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Oh you mean like a
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:13,600	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Bosch excuses been happening forever and we're just now noticing
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:14,368	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Yeah
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:18,976	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Nonetheless people do accuse her of making this more cruel and not just because of
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:19,744	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The drugs
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:20,512	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Because
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:22,816	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	States in their sort of desperation to
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:25,376	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	To still be able to do this are looking for other ways
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:25,888	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	To do it
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:27,680	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And some of those ways
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:29,984	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Might seem like we're going
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:31,776	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The lady that was
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:37,152	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Spearheaded they getting rid of the injections all she did is basically force people to be shot
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:41,248	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	This Paul Wray state representative house district 13 Utah
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:44,576	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	He says one day he was sitting in his office
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:48,928	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I was actually listening to the local NPR station and federal judge in Oklahoma is
EDL	00:29:48,928	00:29:54,048	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And they were talking about European pharmaceutical companies used to provide this controversy
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:56,096	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Drug but now refused to sell it to America
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:30:00,192	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Do prisons have the European drug companies no longer selling the drug cocktail
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:04,800	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	So I called our department of corrections and says hey do we have access to the drug and they said no we don't
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:07,616	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	How you know we have a set amount and then we're out
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:11,456	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	He says he hung up the phone did a little thinking a little bit of research
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:12,992	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Kind of deep into the history and
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:14,272	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Eventually
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:18,624	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Came to the conclusion to the firing squad
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:26,816	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Play me like firing squad John Wayne firing squad like line up against the wall know it's like they have a chair and they bring the
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:33,216	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Person into the room and they strap them to the chair they put a hood over their head physician will look at the heart and I'll pin a Target where the heart is
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:39,616	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And then there's five men with rifles and one of them had the blank but none of them know which one it is
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:41,664	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And they all shoot the individual in the higher
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:48,576	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Doughmakers in Utah supposed to bring back executions by firing squad
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:54,976	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	What is Lethal Injections are not readily available already says he was just trying to solve a problem
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:31:01,376	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I was completely taken off guard by the media frenzy that
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:07,776	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	That half of cruel relic of Old West Justice International condemnation
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:13,920	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Adopting it now is an embarrassment of barbaric

EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:33,888	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	In fact
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:35,680	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I would argue you want to look at

EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:55,648	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And it was fast
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:31:57,952	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	With the firing squad

EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:15,104	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	To some degree that bothers me
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:17,664	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And that seemed to carry on

EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:49,408	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And the people who were part of the firing squad are actually volunteers

EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:09,120	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Talk to a volunteer
EDL	00:33:10,656	00:33:12,448	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	If you put me in touch with somebody who's
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:14,496	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Actually been involved with the firing squad
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:17,056	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Okay
EDL	00:33:18,336	00:33:20,128	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I wait till this thing
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:29,856	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	16th and Hill Air Force Base bombing range right I like it the sound of Freedom this is Kenny we agreed not to use his last name
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:32,672	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Weekends Dad ran the firing squad for a couple of deck
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:38,048	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	So as you see there's two cottonwood trees over here those old cottonwood trees made setup
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:39,840	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And that's what they would drill the firing
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:40,352	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Squad app
EDL	00:33:40,864	00:33:43,424	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	These men were selected because for one there

EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:45,984	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	2
EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:47,520	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	They just had moral clarity.
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:49,056	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	They
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:52,128	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Many of them did not want to be on there but once
EDL	00:33:52,128	00:33:52,896	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	They were called
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:54,944	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	They felt obligated to see it
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:56,992	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Ken told me that on
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:34:03,136	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Keisha days he died and the other Shooters they would sit down together at the kitchen table
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:04,160	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Family breakfast
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:05,952	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	His mom should make coffee and
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:10,048	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	She would do scones or biscuits and gravy and she wanted those men to know
EDL	00:34:11,328	00:34:13,120	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	That it wasn't easy and that she appreciated him
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:16,704	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I know there was a lot of prayerful times around the house and nose
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:20,032	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Mentor over getting ready I know that
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:21,824	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Ian
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:25,152	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	It's pretty solemn moment I prayer
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:27,200	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Is it for the person Phoenix
EDL	00:34:27,200	00:34:28,480	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	You did the victim with the
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:30,784	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The prayer I think you have to pray for strength
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:31,808	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The follow through on what you have to
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:35,648	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I think that
EDL	00:34:36,928	00:34:40,512	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	You know you might need a little guidance and you might need a little understanding and
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:42,560	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And something bigger than yous out there
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:48,960	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I think that if we're going to have the death penalty people just have to understand that there's some savagery involved in it
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:51,008	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And nah
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:52,544	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	It's unfortunate
EDL	00:34:52,544	00:34:53,312	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	But it is but
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:55,616	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	If we have it to do list
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:57,152	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Let's do it let's do it humanely
EDL	00:34:59,200	00:35:02,016	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	One of the things that I found kind of striking is that
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:04,832	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Maya foa is against the death penalty in Europe
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:06,624	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The folks in Utah that are for it
EDL	00:35:06,624	00:35:08,672	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	But everyone seems to agree that
EDL	00:35:09,952	00:35:16,352	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	We shouldn't fool ourselves favors the death penalty but one thing I've never favored in some common ground between
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:17,632	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	When me and the abolitionists
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:21,728	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Is that lethal injection is a terrible method of x
EDL	00:35:21,728	00:35:22,496	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Execution
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:26,848	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	That's Robert blecker at a New York law school Professor sounding a little bit like Maya
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:33,248	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	But he says he objects to lethal injection not because it's cruel not because it might cause pain
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:36,832	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	But because it certainly causes confusion I attended
EDL	00:35:37,344	00:35:38,880	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	An execution in Florida
EDL	00:35:39,392	00:35:40,416	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Bennie Demps
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:45,536	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And I also was with my father-in-law when he was in a hospice dying
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:47,328	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	From an incurable and very painful
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:47,840	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Cancer
EDL	00:35:48,352	00:35:50,912	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And the death scene in both
EDL	00:35:50,912	00:35:52,192	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Situations was
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:53,472	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Bizarrely similar
EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:55,264	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	In both cases
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:35:56,032	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Served
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:58,080	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The person dying was
EDL	00:35:58,080	00:36:00,896	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Lying on a gurney with an IV coming out of his arm
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:02,688	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Wrapped in white sheets
EDL	00:36:03,456	00:36:05,504	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Medical technicians at his side
EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:06,784	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Surrounded by loved one
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:10,368	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And it struck me as bizarre
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:13,184	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	That we are killing Those whom we love
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:15,488	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	In a fashion
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:20,096	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	That's so nearly resembles how we are killing those we rightfully
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:20,608	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Detest
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:24,192	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	There should be no resemblance this isn't medicine this is
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:24,960	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Punishment
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:27,264	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The firing squad
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:28,032	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Is honest
EDL	00:36:28,032	00:36:29,312	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And acknowledges
EDL	00:36:29,312	00:36:30,080	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Itself
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:31,104	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	For what it is
EDL	00:36:31,104	00:36:34,176	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I want objection to the traditional firing squad
EDL	00:36:34,176	00:36:39,552	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	That Utah uses he says he doesn't like the fact that one person get the blank and that nobody knows who that poor
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:41,856	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Person is that to me is symptomatic
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:46,464	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Of our failure once again to take responsibility for what we do
EDL	00:36:46,464	00:36:47,488	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Nobody should have a blank
EDL	00:36:48,000	00:36:50,048	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	If we cannot face what we're doing
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:51,584	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And acknowledge
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:53,120	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Then we shouldn't do it
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:06,432	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And we may be coming to a moment where we are about to do that to it look at this and acknowledge
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:07,200	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Because
EDL	00:37:07,200	00:37:12,576	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	In 2014 in a case that was really just about lethal injection just as viruses look like
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:14,624	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Stop
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:19,232	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Just talking about the details I questions about which medicine that we use
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:23,072	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Eight more basic question
EDL	00:37:23,840	00:37:27,424	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Weather
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:29,216	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	In other words what he's saying is
EDL	00:37:29,984	00:37:33,568	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	It's time to talk about not just like the mechanics
EDL	00:37:33,568	00:37:34,336	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	So what we're doing
EDL	00:37:36,384	00:37:38,688	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	But whether we should even do it at all
EDL	00:37:45,344	00:37:51,488	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Reporter Karen Duffin
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:38:04,544	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Now when Justice Breyer said that in 2014 he was in The Descent but a lot of people
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:10,944	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Heard that statement as kind of an invitation like Briar saying to the lawyers of America

EDL	00:39:10,080	00:39:12,640	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Because of the attorney-general's recent announcement
EDL	00:39:12,640	00:39:19,040	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I just a moment ago at the conclusion that second we heard Justice Breyer inviting cases about the death penalty up to the sky
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:20,320	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Supreme Court saying basically it's
EDL	00:39:20,320	00:39:22,368	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Time for the court to revisit the question
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:23,904	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Constitutionality
EDL	00:39:24,416	00:39:28,256	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	At the time we first reported this we wanted to find out a little more about that
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:33,376	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	What exactly does that mean when will it happen when might it happen I should say
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:34,656	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	What might it look like
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:37,472	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	So we set
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:40,544	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Reporter Sean rameswaram out
EDL	00:39:41,312	00:39:42,592	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	To look into that
EDL	00:39:43,104	00:39:44,384	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	What are you to stand on the death penalty
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:45,408	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Guess
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:53,088	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I figured I'd just ask and we found two siblings actually who dedicated their lives

EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:30,976	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	We have a great line people often ask us how we met
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:34,560	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And I say our parents brought him home from the hospital
EDL	00:40:35,072	00:40:36,608	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I wasn't very impressed
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:38,912	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	So our story
EDL	00:40:39,936	00:40:40,704	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Starts

EDL	00:41:18,848	00:41:19,616	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	When we were Locklear
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:20,640	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	On the court
EDL	00:41:22,432	00:41:23,712	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Late 1980s
EDL	00:41:24,480	00:41:27,040	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	We would stay until late in the evening it was the job of
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:28,576	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Whoever.
EDL	00:41:28,576	00:41:30,368	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The clerk was in each Chambers
EDL	00:41:30,368	00:41:31,136	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Who was
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:32,160	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Responsible for that
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:33,696	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Mycase
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:35,232	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Just stay in Chambers
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:37,280	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Until the case
EDL	00:41:37,280	00:41:38,048	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Made it
EDL	00:41:38,048	00:41:39,840	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	To the court and was either
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:41,120	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Stayed or
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:42,400	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The Condemned with x
EDL	00:41:42,912	00:41:44,704	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Okay there was
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:45,216	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Prominent
EDL	00:41:45,728	00:41:46,752	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Clerk in the
EDL	00:41:46,752	00:41:47,776	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Clerk's Office
EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:50,080	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Of the Supreme Court who is known as the deathclaw
EDL	00:41:51,104	00:41:53,663	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	His job was to keep track is to keep
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:57,503	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Keep track of all of the death cases that are coming to the court
EDL	00:41:57,503	00:41:58,783	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Their execution date
EDL	00:41:58,783	00:41:59,807	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And to stay in touch
EDL	00:42:00,319	00:42:02,111	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	With the attorneys on both sides
EDL	00:42:02,623	00:42:07,743	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Do we think a death clerk gets paid more than a regular clerk for having maybe the worst job in the building
EDL	00:42:08,511	00:42:10,559	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Good question don't know the answer.
EDL	00:42:11,327	00:42:11,839	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Okay
EDL	00:42:12,351	00:42:14,399	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I'm curious where are
EDL	00:42:14,399	00:42:15,423	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Current 9 Justice
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:16,703	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Is come down
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:17,727	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	On the death penalty right
EDL	00:42:19,263	00:42:20,031	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Evenly
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:21,311	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Split the train
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:22,335	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Justices
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:26,175	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	To just a quick note obviously that conversation happened a little while ago
EDL	00:42:26,175	00:42:30,271	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The story of Justice Antonin Scalia passed away
EDL	00:42:30,271	00:42:32,575	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Justice Anthony Kennedy retired
EDL	00:42:32,575	00:42:33,343	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	To New Jersey
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:36,415	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	This is her now on the court Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh which means
EDL	00:42:36,415	00:42:37,183	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Course the court looks
EDL	00:42:37,695	00:42:38,207	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	A bit different
EDL	00:42:39,231	00:42:40,511	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	When we check back in with Carol
EDL	00:42:41,023	00:42:46,143	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	She said that while she thinks that this court is much less likely to strike down the death penalty
EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:49,983	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	She still thinks that given recent events in States like
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:50,495	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	California
EDL	00:42:51,007	00:42:53,567	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	We're Governor Newsom recently stay all X
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:54,335	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Executions
EDL	00:42:54,335	00:42:55,359	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	There is
EDL	00:42:55,359	00:42:58,175	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Still a general movement away from the desk
EDL	00:42:59,199	00:43:04,319	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Carol also pointed out that while the Attorney General's announcement may seem to be pointing Us in the opposite direction
EDL	00:43:04,831	00:43:08,415	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	There are only six federal prisoners on death row where is in California
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:10,463	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	That stay of execution
EDL	00:43:10,463	00:43:11,743	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Applied to more than
EDL	00:43:11,743	00:43:12,767	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	700
EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:13,279	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Death row
EDL	00:43:14,047	00:43:15,071	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	We do think
EDL	00:43:15,071	00:43:17,375	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	That the death penalty will eventually
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:19,167	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Be struck down as
EDL	00:43:19,167	00:43:21,215	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Unconstitutional under the 8th Amendment
EDL	00:43:22,239	00:43:28,383	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Simply because the way the court has thought about it and the cases in which has narrowed the death penalty recently
EDL	00:43:29,151	00:43:32,735	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	So that in the last 15 years the Supreme Court has said that people
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:36,063	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	With intellectual disability
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:38,879	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Can't get the death penalty that juvenile offenders
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:40,415	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Can't get the death penalty
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:44,511	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	That people who commit interpersonal crimes other than murder
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:46,047	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Can't get the death penalty
EDL	00:43:46,559	00:43:48,863	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	In these cases where the Supreme Court has
EDL	00:43:49,375	00:43:50,399	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Constrained
EDL	00:43:50,911	00:43:52,959	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The scope of the death penalty
EDL	00:43:52,959	00:43:54,495	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	They made it clear that
EDL	00:43:55,007	00:43:57,823	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The analysis involves considering weather
EDL	00:43:58,591	00:43:59,615	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The practice
EDL	00:43:59,615	00:44:02,431	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Violates evolving standards of decency
EDL	00:44:03,199	00:44:04,479	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	It seems like
EDL	00:44:04,479	00:44:06,783	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The death penalty is on a collision course
EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:08,319	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	With the Supreme Court's
EDL	00:44:08,319	00:44:09,599	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Eighth Amendment jurisprudence
EDL	00:44:10,879	00:44:12,927	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And it's close court-watchers and
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:14,463	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	People have service clerks in the court
EDL	00:44:15,231	00:44:15,743	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Yourselves
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:17,791	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	When do you think that case
EDL	00:44:17,791	00:44:18,303	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Coming
EDL	00:44:19,327	00:44:24,191	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	It's hard to say 2 years ago many people thought then when that when justices
EDL	00:44:24,703	00:44:25,727	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Breyer and Ginsburg
EDL	00:44:26,239	00:44:27,519	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Signed on to that $0.02
EDL	00:44:28,031	00:44:31,359	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	They were signaling that the time was nigh and that there were
EDL	00:44:32,127	00:44:33,151	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Perhaps five votes
EDL	00:44:34,175	00:44:38,271	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	On the court why else would they call for the court to take this
EDL	00:44:38,271	00:44:38,783	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Issue up
EDL	00:44:41,087	00:44:42,111	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Record
EDL	00:44:43,135	00:44:44,159	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Not A legislature
EDL	00:44:50,303	00:44:51,839	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Bacon
EDL	00:44:54,655	00:44:55,167	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Cruel
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:56,447	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And unusual
EDL	00:44:56,959	00:44:57,727	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Punishment
EDL	00:45:00,543	00:45:01,311	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:04,383	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	With a specific constraint
EDL	00:45:04,383	00:45:06,943	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Set the Constitution imposes
EDL	00:45:08,991	00:45:09,503	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Process
EDL	00:45:10,527	00:45:11,295	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Namely
EDL	00:45:11,295	00:45:12,063	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Through the 8th Amendment
EDL	00:45:12,831	00:45:15,903	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	In the two years since there have been many opportunities
EDL	00:45:15,903	00:45:16,927	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Is for the court to do so
EDL	00:45:17,695	00:45:18,207	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And it has
EDL	00:45:19,231	00:45:20,767	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	So that suggests
EDL	00:45:21,279	00:45:24,607	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	That the time is last night
EDL	00:45:24,607	00:45:25,631	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Court watch
EDL	00:45:25,631	00:45:27,167	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I thought it might be 2 years ago
EDL	00:45:27,935	00:45:30,239	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	We also think that the one major difference
EDL	00:45:30,751	00:45:33,311	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	This time which makes it so much more likely
EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:36,127	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	At the death penalty will eventually be abolished
EDL	00:45:36,895	00:45:38,431	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	If the extent to which the United States
EDL	00:45:39,199	00:45:40,479	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Stands virtually alone
EDL	00:45:40,991	00:45:42,015	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	In a few
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:43,551	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And retention of the death penalty
EDL	00:45:44,063	00:45:44,831	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Among
EDL	00:45:45,599	00:45:46,623	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Western democracy
EDL	00:45:47,391	00:45:48,927	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	All of our peer Nations
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:49,951	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Have
EDL	00:45:50,463	00:45:51,487	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Jettison the death penalty
EDL	00:45:52,255	00:45:53,279	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And it's not
EDL	00:45:53,279	00:45:58,399	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The outlier status is more remarkable than that it's not just that we're the only Western democracy
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:45:59,423	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Say to retain the death penalty
EDL	00:46:00,447	00:46:03,775	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	We're still one of the world's leaders in executions even with the
EDL	00:46:04,287	00:46:07,103	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Decline and executions the United States were
EDL	00:46:07,103	00:46:09,663	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	In a very small Club of active
EDL	00:46:09,663	00:46:10,943	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Executing countries
EDL	00:46:11,455	00:46:12,991	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Along with countries like
EDL	00:46:12,991	00:46:14,527	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Iraq around China
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:17,855	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	United States is really in a very
EDL	00:46:17,855	00:46:19,647	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Small group of Nations that
EDL	00:46:19,647	00:46:21,183	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Uses the death penalty
EDL	00:46:21,695	00:46:22,975	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	An irregular way
EDL	00:46:23,487	00:46:28,607	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Seabright who's a anti-death penalty lawyer for most of his career is quite well known
EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:31,935	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	He used to joke that in 1970
EDL	00:46:31,935	00:46:37,311	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	If you would ask anyone in 1970 which of the following three countries would be the only one
EDL	00:46:37,311	00:46:40,639	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	That would still have the death penalty at the turn of the millennium
EDL	00:46:40,639	00:46:42,431	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Russia South Africa
EDL	00:46:42,943	00:46:43,711	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And United States
EDL	00:46:44,223	00:46:45,247	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Yeah nobody
EDL	00:46:45,247	00:46:46,783	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Would have picked the United States
EDL	00:46:46,783	00:46:48,575	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Bread in the 1970s
EDL	00:46:49,343	00:46:51,903	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Only sixteen countries in the world
EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:53,439	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	We're fully abolitionist
EDL	00:46:54,207	00:46:55,231	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	By law
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:46:58,047	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Today more than 2/3
EDL	00:46:58,047	00:46:59,327	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Of the countries in the world
EDL	00:46:59,839	00:47:01,631	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Are abolitionists by law
EDL	00:47:02,911	00:47:05,983	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Last I heard 60% of people approve of the death
EDL	00:47:07,263	00:47:08,031	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Is that true
EDL	00:47:08,031	00:47:10,079	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Well depends on how you ask
EDL	00:47:10,079	00:47:12,639	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The question the Gallup polling organization
EDL	00:47:13,151	00:47:15,711	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Has been asking people the same very simple
EDL	00:47:15,711	00:47:16,479	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Question
EDL	00:47:16,479	00:47:18,015	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Do you support the death penalty
EDL	00:47:18,015	00:47:18,527	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Kiefer murder
EDL	00:47:19,039	00:47:20,319	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	For almost a hundred years
EDL	00:47:20,319	00:47:23,391	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	So it's easy to compare you're comparing Apples to Apples
EDL	00:47:24,159	00:47:24,671	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And
EDL	00:47:25,183	00:47:28,255	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Support for the death penalty is around
EDL	00:47:28,255	00:47:30,303	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	60th percent now
EDL	00:47:30,303	00:47:33,119	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Which is down from 80 something percent
EDL	00:47:33,631	00:47:35,167	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	In the early 1990s
EDL	00:47:36,191	00:47:38,239	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	But if you ask
EDL	00:47:38,239	00:47:40,799	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The question in a different way for example if you ask
EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:43,103	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	People whether they support the death penalty
EDL	00:47:43,615	00:47:46,687	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Or life without possibility of parole
EDL	00:47:46,687	00:47:49,759	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I see you got very close to 50/50
EDL	00:47:49,759	00:47:51,551	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And if you ask people
EDL	00:47:51,551	00:47:54,111	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Whether they support the death penalty or
EDL	00:47:54,111	00:47:55,903	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Life without parole
EDL	00:47:55,903	00:47:56,671	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	With a
EDL	00:47:56,671	00:48:00,767	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Prisoner working for restitution to the victim's family
EDL	00:48:01,279	00:48:03,327	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Support for the death penalty drops below
EDL	00:48:04,607	00:48:06,399	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	It's one of the more striking
EDL	00:48:06,399	00:48:11,007	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Figures is the number of states that have legislatively repealed the death
EDL	00:48:11,007	00:48:11,775	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Penalty
EDL	00:48:11,775	00:48:14,335	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	In recent years so seven states
EDL	00:48:14,335	00:48:15,615	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Passed repeal bills
EDL	00:48:16,127	00:48:17,151	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	In the last
EDL	00:48:17,151	00:48:18,431	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	10 or so years
EDL	00:48:18,431	00:48:22,527	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	One of them Nebraska really the only Red State to do so
EDL	00:48:23,039	00:48:27,135	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Brought the death penalty back to a referendum procedure last November
EDL	00:48:27,647	00:48:31,999	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	But the fact that it's Republican legislature repealed the states that pain
EDL	00:48:33,023	00:48:35,583	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And then the Republican Governor veto that repeal
EDL	00:48:36,351	00:48:41,727	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And then the Republican legislature overrode the governor's veto bike with a two-thirds majority
EDL	00:48:42,495	00:48:44,799	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Is a pretty striking indication
EDL	00:48:44,799	00:48:46,079	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Of change
EDL	00:48:46,079	00:48:46,847	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And public attitude
EDL	00:48:47,871	00:48:48,895	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	So what do we think is change
EDL	00:48:50,431	00:48:54,015	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I think there are a couple of things that have accounted for the decline in public
EDL	00:48:54,015	00:48:54,527	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Support
EDL	00:48:55,039	00:48:58,111	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	One thing that happened in the 1990s with there was a
EDL	00:48:58,111	00:48:59,135	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Growing awareness
EDL	00:48:59,903	00:49:01,183	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Of wrongful
EDL	00:49:02,463	00:49:05,023	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Write the decline in violent crime
EDL	00:49:05,023	00:49:07,583	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The 1970s and 80s
EDL	00:49:07,583	00:49:09,119	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	An extraordinary Rising
EDL	00:49:09,631	00:49:10,911	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Violent crime in the United
EDL	00:49:10,911	00:49:11,679	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Stay tuned.
EDL	00:49:11,679	00:49:13,471	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	That trend has reversed
EDL	00:49:13,983	00:49:15,519	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Took some significant extent
EDL	00:49:16,287	00:49:18,591	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And I also think that the concern about
EDL	00:49:19,103	00:49:22,431	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Ordinary crime has been displaced Abid
EDL	00:49:22,431	00:49:24,223	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I concern about
EDL	00:49:24,735	00:49:26,015	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Terrorism in
EDL	00:49:26,015	00:49:27,039	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And other threats
EDL	00:49:27,039	00:49:27,551	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Better
EDL	00:49:28,063	00:49:28,831	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	More X
EDL	00:49:28,831	00:49:31,135	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Existential than ordinary crime in the United
EDL	00:49:32,159	00:49:33,439	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	It's also been the case that
EDL	00:49:34,207	00:49:38,559	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Because of the Court's intervention the death penalty the death penalty has become
EDL	00:49:38,559	00:49:40,351	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Extraordinary expenses
EDL	00:49:40,351	00:49:41,119	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Yeah just
EDL	00:49:41,887	00:49:43,167	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Put a figure on that
EDL	00:49:43,167	00:49:44,447	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	If you look at how much
EDL	00:49:44,447	00:49:45,471	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The state of California
EDL	00:49:45,983	00:49:47,775	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Has spent on a death penalty
EDL	00:49:48,799	00:49:51,359	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Trials appeals maintaining death row
EDL	00:49:51,871	00:49:53,151	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And you add that money up
EDL	00:49:53,663	00:49:55,711	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And you divide it by the 13
EDL	00:49:56,223	00:49:57,759	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Situations that California has
EDL	00:49:57,759	00:49:58,527	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Has carried out
EDL	00:49:58,527	00:49:59,807	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	In the last 40 years
EDL	00:50:00,575	00:50:01,855	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	You got a price tag
EDL	00:50:01,855	00:50:04,671	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Of more than a quarter of a billion dollars
EDL	00:50:04,671	00:50:06,463	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Rice serious
EDL	00:50:06,463	00:50:12,863	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Did you give everyone in America knew that we'd still be a 60% it's kind of hard to imagine
EDL	00:50:12,863	00:50:13,887	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	What you could do
EDL	00:50:14,399	00:50:16,959	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	To address legitimate concerns about
EDL	00:50:16,959	00:50:18,239	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Crime and Public Safety
EDL	00:50:18,239	00:50:20,543	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	With a quarter of a billion dollars
EDL	00:50:21,055	00:50:23,103	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Other than execute another person
EDL	00:50:24,639	00:50:27,199	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I think it's important to realize that in
EDL	00:50:27,199	00:50:28,735	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	All of our Pure Country
EDL	00:50:28,735	00:50:29,503	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Is that abolish the death
EDL	00:50:30,527	00:50:32,319	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	A majority of the public
EDL	00:50:32,319	00:50:33,599	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Supported the death penalty
EDL	00:50:33,599	00:50:34,879	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	At the time of abolition
EDL	00:50:36,159	00:50:36,927	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The
EDL	00:50:36,927	00:50:39,743	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Support for the death penalty in Western Europe
EDL	00:50:39,743	00:50:41,279	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Tell only after
EDL	00:50:41,279	00:50:42,047	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The abolition
EDL	00:50:42,047	00:50:42,559	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Have the death penalty
EDL	00:50:43,071	00:50:43,839	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Not before
EDL	00:50:44,351	00:50:46,399	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	But those countries have much more
EDL	00:50:46,911	00:50:48,959	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Parliamentary procedures
EDL	00:50:48,959	00:50:52,287	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	They're more insulated from populist lawmaking
EDL	00:50:52,287	00:50:54,335	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And they tend to defer to Elites
EDL	00:50:54,847	00:50:57,663	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And to expertise on criminal justice
EDL	00:50:57,663	00:50:58,431	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The policy
EDL	00:50:58,431	00:50:58,943	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The other
EDL	00:50:59,455	00:51:01,503	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Truly extraordinary exceptional
EDL	00:51:01,503	00:51:02,271	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Facet
EDL	00:51:02,271	00:51:06,367	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The American death penalty in the modern era is that
EDL	00:51:07,135	00:51:10,463	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And I think most people my age I'm 32 I was born in the 1980s
EDL	00:51:10,975	00:51:14,047	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I feel like most people my age don't even really know
EDL	00:51:14,047	00:51:15,839	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Is that we got rid of it for 4 years
EDL	00:51:16,351	00:51:19,167	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	We got rid of it actually for longer than that
EDL	00:51:19,167	00:51:24,799	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Because the litigation that led up to the case Furman versus Georgia that abolished the death
EDL	00:51:24,799	00:51:25,311	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Penalty
EDL	00:51:26,079	00:51:29,663	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Brought the death penalty to a halt for five years
EDL	00:51:29,663	00:51:32,735	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Prior to that ruling so there were no X
EDL	00:51:32,735	00:51:34,271	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Secretions in the United States
EDL	00:51:34,271	00:51:35,551	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Between 1960
EDL	00:51:35,551	00:51:39,135	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	87 and 1972 when the Supreme Court abolished at
EDL	00:51:40,671	00:51:41,439	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	524 again
EDL	00:51:41,439	00:51:42,463	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	What's the death penalty

EDL	00:53:13,343	00:53:14,111	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Was
EDL	00:53:14,111	00:53:16,671	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	One of the most turbulent moments in American history
EDL	00:53:16,671	00:53:17,439	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	It was
EDL	00:53:17,439	00:53:18,719	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	You know right in the wake of
EDL	00:53:20,255	00:53:22,559	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Violence of the late 1960s
EDL	00:53:22,559	00:53:25,631	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	That brought that swept Richard Nixon into
EDL	00:53:26,143	00:53:26,911	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The presidency
EDL	00:53:27,423	00:53:30,751	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And his promise was to restore Law and Order
EDL	00:53:31,263	00:53:32,287	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	There was
EDL	00:53:32,287	00:53:33,311	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	An enormous
EDL	00:53:33,311	00:53:35,615	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Political backlash when the Supreme Court
EDL	00:53:36,383	00:53:40,223	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Struct down the prevailing death penalty statutes in 1972
EDL	00:53:40,991	00:53:43,039	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	So even though it was a. Without X
EDL	00:53:43,039	00:53:43,807	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Profusion
EDL	00:53:43,807	00:53:45,855	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	It was not a. Free
EDL	00:53:47,391	00:53:49,183	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	No pro-death penalty
EDL	00:53:49,695	00:53:52,511	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Agitation impact it might have been
EDL	00:53:52,511	00:53:55,839	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The most extreme. A pro death penalty agitation
EDL	00:53:56,351	00:53:58,911	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Because of the perception that the Supreme Court
EDL	00:53:59,423	00:54:00,703	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Was taking away the
EDL	00:54:00,703	00:54:01,727	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Best power from the state
EDL	00:54:02,495	00:54:03,007	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Anythink

EDL	00:54:05,055	00:54:06,847	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Hypothesis Bears out in the
EDL	00:54:06,847	00:54:07,615	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Supreme Court
EDL	00:54:07,615	00:54:08,383	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	What does abolish
EDL	00:54:09,663	00:54:10,175	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The death penalty
EDL	00:54:12,223	00:54:12,735	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	In the neck
EDL	00:54:13,503	00:54:15,295	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	10 20 30 40 50 years
EDL	00:54:15,807	00:54:17,343	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Do you think it will be gone
EDL	00:54:17,343	00:54:18,111	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	For good
EDL	00:54:18,111	00:54:18,623	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	This time
EDL	00:54:20,159	00:54:22,463	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I do think that this time would be different
EDL	00:54:22,975	00:54:25,535	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Last time when the Supreme Court abolished
EDL	00:54:25,535	00:54:28,095	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And then four years later blinked and brought it back
EDL	00:54:28,863	00:54:30,399	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	It did so in a way
EDL	00:54:31,935	00:54:32,959	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Of saying
EDL	00:54:33,471	00:54:34,239	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Well
EDL	00:54:34,239	00:54:37,055	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	These new statutes look like they're going to fix
EDL	00:54:37,055	00:54:40,127	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Some of the concerns about arbitrariness and
EDL	00:54:40,127	00:54:42,175	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Discrimination and lack of adequate
EDL	00:54:42,175	00:54:42,687	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Process
EDL	00:54:43,455	00:54:44,479	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	That was 40 years ago
EDL	00:54:44,991	00:54:46,527	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	It's pretty clear those statutes
EDL	00:54:47,039	00:54:48,575	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Didn't do what many p
EDL	00:54:48,575	00:54:49,855	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	People who pooped that they would do
EDL	00:54:50,367	00:54:52,415	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I don't think it's possible for the court
EDL	00:54:52,415	00:54:58,815	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	To take another mend it don't end it approach you know they tried that and we've all tried that for really
EDL	00:54:58,815	00:55:00,863	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Long time if it happened next year
EDL	00:55:00,863	00:55:02,399	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	If the Supreme Court abolished
EDL	00:55:03,167	00:55:03,935	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The death penalty
EDL	00:55:04,447	00:55:05,471	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Next year
EDL	00:55:05,471	00:55:05,983	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	With some
EDL	00:55:06,495	00:55:07,519	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Degree of finality
EDL	00:55:08,287	00:55:12,383	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	What do you think you guys would do what's the second what's the second biggest issue for
EDL	00:55:12,895	00:55:15,199	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Oh there's so many Sean
EDL	00:55:15,967	00:55:17,759	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I'd say probably
EDL	00:55:17,759	00:55:19,807	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The two biggest issues are
EDL	00:55:19,807	00:55:23,391	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Mass incarceration the number of people that the United States
EDL	00:55:23,391	00:55:24,159	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Loksatta
EDL	00:55:24,159	00:55:26,463	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And for how long wear an outlier
EDL	00:55:26,463	00:55:28,255	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	In that area as well
EDL	00:55:29,023	00:55:33,887	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	And the ways in which our criminal justice policies really punish people for poverty
EDL	00:55:34,399	00:55:40,799	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	The incredible fees and fines and bail amounts that end up locking people up in prayer
EDL	00:55:40,799	00:55:41,823	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Prisons and jails
EDL	00:55:41,823	00:55:45,919	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Not actually for the crimes which are often pedi that they've committed
EDL	00:55:46,431	00:55:47,967	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Because they can't pay
EDL	00:55:48,735	00:55:52,575	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	Court cost for court fines or bail in order to get out
EDL	00:55:52,575	00:55:54,879	| radiolab_podcast19cruelandunusual |	I'll just add that I would be thrilled for the captain
