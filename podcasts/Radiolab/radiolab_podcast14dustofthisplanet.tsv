EDL	00:00:28,672	00:00:29,952	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	I thought in this podcast
EDL	00:00:30,464	00:00:36,864	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	I want a little bit
EDL	00:00:36,864	00:00:43,264	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Generally and that should be in front of your mouth start with a conversation
EDL	00:00:43,264	00:00:46,848	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	That the Brooke Gladstone and I said Brooke from on the media
EDL	00:00:46,848	00:00:49,408	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	She and I had with my brother-in-law
EDL	00:00:49,408	00:00:55,808	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Ugim Eugene Thacker I'm an author and professor at the new school in New York City
EDL	00:00:55,808	00:00:57,856	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Very weird thing that happened to Eugene
EDL	00:01:00,416	00:01:06,816	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Felt like a kind of story I've been wearing black since I was 13
EDL	00:01:06,816	00:01:09,888	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Two-tone black right now set it up
EDL	00:01:09,888	00:01:11,424	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Eugene is a hard
EDL	00:01:11,424	00:01:13,984	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Quartz color of philosophy
EDL	00:01:13,984	00:01:15,264	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	And he writes his books
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:19,360	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Let them be little use words like
EDL	00:01:19,360	00:01:20,384	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Exegesis
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:22,176	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	And ratiocination
EDL	00:01:22,176	00:01:23,712	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Until the family joke
EDL	00:01:24,224	00:01:24,992	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Is that
EDL	00:01:24,992	00:01:26,272	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	He writes books
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:32,672	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	For now on I think the a joke started out I write books that nobody reads and then
EDL	00:01:32,672	00:01:38,304	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	After a slow long. Of acceptance I started to think well maybe I should write books
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:41,888	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	I'm for no one to read to just started embrace.
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:48,288	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Meeting at a certain point if you do this kind of work you're going to have to ask yourself if you knew that this would not be published would you still write it
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:49,312	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	How committed are you
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:52,128	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	And he decided he was committed he would write it no matter what
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:58,528	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	So the Story begins couple years ago 2011 Eugene writes this book called in the dust of this planet
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:02:00,832	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	In the dust of this planet
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:05,952	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	It's kind of a hard book to describe but if you had to sum it up in a sentence it's about the end of the world
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:09,280	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	But not in the Hollywood
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:14,656	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Sense darker than that your hypothesis is the greatest horror
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:15,936	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Is that
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:23,104	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Nothing exists and nothing matters and the world that we live in that weed
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:29,504	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Define in terms of humanity doesn't care about us is often referred to
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:35,904	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	To his nihilism or pessimism that there might not be a purpose to things or to your life or to our
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:38,976	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Distance or to the cosmos there might not be in order
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:45,376	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	The things we might not be here for a reason this all might be purely arbitrary in an accident that there's no inherent meaning
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:49,472	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Anything but it just doesn't matter is what Nietzsche called most difficult thought
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:57,152	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	And in the book Eugene traces this idea through all of these different horror movies
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:03:03,552	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	He's from slasher films to sort of more supernatural horror music
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:09,184	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	One point he goes into the sea construction of how different types of black metal deal with a thought I don't know it's
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:14,816	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	It's something it's other way of thinking I've always found really intriguing and ironically kind of
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:16,864	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Inspiring are you a pessimist
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:18,400	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	All my better days
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:20,448	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Are you a nihilist
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:24,032	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Not as much as I should be
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:28,384	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Okay so Eugene writes this book in 2011 it is dark
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:32,736	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	It is dense he writes it at his house for no one and as expected
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:35,040	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Beyond a few philosophy types
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:37,344	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	No one really pays attention
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:42,464	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	So keep your head down teaching writing but then
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:49,888	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Something's Happened 2014
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:56,288	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	It's all one ghetto man giant gutter in outer space
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:04:02,688	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	The show True Detective comes along comes a big head and at the center of the show is this character Russ
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:09,088	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Nicole is Louisiana detective who is one dark dude human consciousness
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:15,488	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Tragic misstep in evolution these rant about how there's no order in the world how humans are just as accident
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:21,887	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	You was at a god consider myself very last time but in philosophical terms I'm what's called a pessimist
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:24,447	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	And I just remember watching it and being like wow
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:31,359	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Sugs wife Priya Murthy my sister-in-law has so many conversations that we've had
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:37,759	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Add in the car she's like where they listening in on us Dairy soprema goes online fix around
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:39,551	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Then I see this article
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:43,135	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	About the True Detective
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:49,279	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	The director was an article where I actually the writer of the show Nic pizzolatto was asked how did you create that character
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:51,071	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Wireless police detector
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:56,447	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	And he lists a bunch of things he was reading at the time in that list was
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:57,983	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Eugene
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:04:59,519	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Which I was like
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:00,287	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Cool
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:06,687	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	At least one person but I really just try to
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:10,015	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Keep my head to the ground and just keep riding just doing what I'm doing
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:11,295	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	But then
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:16,159	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Things got weird okay so now he has pull up the

EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:23,839	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Short time later Prima is flipping through this fashion magazine Lucky Magazine and there was
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:30,751	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	A spread with this actress Lily Collins 25 year old actress I never heard of pretty big right now she's standing on a
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:31,263	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Any street corner
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:33,823	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Dressed up in all of this sort of God
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:38,943	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Makeup and clothing and in the photo she is
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:41,759	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Where is Eugene's Buck on her chest
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:43,807	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	She had on and one of the shots
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:44,575	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Sweatshirt

EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:48,927	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	In the dust of this planet big letters
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:52,511	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Right on her chest and I was just like no way it was definitely
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:58,143	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	What The Hell she's just casually wearing my husband's
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:06:00,447	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Book cover I don't know I can't I didn't
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:05,567	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	React to but it was just strange to that a Norwegian artist had made a painting of the book
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:10,431	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	That eventually gotten picked up by a fashion label and turned into some very expensive clothes
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:11,199	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Yep
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:16,575	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	I write books for now under himself obviously I'm not pulling in a lot of royalties
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:20,415	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Honest but you know Eugene says he's not going to sue I'm not
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:23,487	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Going to see or take any legal action
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:25,279	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	I really do anything about it
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:26,559	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Cuz he says that's not why you right
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:29,631	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Okay so that happened
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:36,543	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Banana gets weirder still
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:41,663	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	My wife Karla Murthy is online this is the day that Jay-Z and Beyonce announce they're going to do the
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:42,431	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Big International
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:46,271	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Carlos watching the video that they released
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:52,671	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Fake movie trailers guns fire
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:58,815	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Hookers
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:01,631	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Bonnie and Clyde thing
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:08,031	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Ranking the running from someone you not quite sure who fiance is in a wedding dress and that Avail on
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:14,431	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	But she's shooting semi-automatic weapons in wedding dress cut the car chases cut the money flying everywhere but at
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:20,831	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Exactly 37 seconds in
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:25,183	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	You see Jay Z turn stick a giant gun out to his right
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:30,559	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	And he is wearing Eugene's book
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:37,471	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Right there on his back in the dust of this planet
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:41,823	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	What is the point of which I was like
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:43,359	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Okay what do we make
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:50,783	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Could it be that Eugene is no longer writing books for knowing that somehow he is become a conduit
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:53,343	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	With this idea that we all
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:57,695	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	In that Subterranean way that pop music operates that we all are channeling right now
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:07:59,743	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	That was my
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:01,791	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Yeah and I think that's
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,327	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	That's the question
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:07,167	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Is whether this is something particular
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:09,471	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	To the moment we're living in and Eugene
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,775	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	His knee-jerk reaction is
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:15,359	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	I think it could have been this cover or a million other covers
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:16,127	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	No
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:20,479	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	This is just meaningless appropriation I don't think there's anything more than that
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:26,879	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	To me then it's just the looks like a cool phrase to go on a t-shirt to put on a goth girl and Son photoshoot
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:27,647	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	And why is it
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:28,415	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	The cool
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:29,183	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Right
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:29,951	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Cuz my heart
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:35,839	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Is you might be right but you also might be wrong because of the answer that you're about to give to Brooks Quest
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:42,751	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	It's cool because some publicist this was her the conversation one to have and swipe
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:46,847	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Brooke like what is behind all of this nihilistic entertainment this everywhere
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:51,199	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	No Brooke for her part agree that Eugene probably is tapping into
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:51,967	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Yes
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:54,271	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	But is this unique to this moment
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:57,599	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	And to that I would say no really
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:09:00,927	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	You don't think this says anything about now I think there are Cycles
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:01,695	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	In which
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:04,767	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	The sense of meaninglessness
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:07,071	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Comes out in sharper relief
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,863	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Then other time
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:13,471	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	But you can identify them over and over again
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:16,031	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Nihilism
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:16,543	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	All the way back
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:19,871	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Brooke actually turned it down to this guy

EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:22,751	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	But when I ran Simon through the Eugene jacket situation then I asked him like
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:29,151	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Is there something different about today's nihilism vs. nihilism of the past
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:30,687	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Play something more potent about it

EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:33,503	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	He said

EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:47,071	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Simon says it was more of a gut feeling
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:49,887	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Based on this class that he taught last year
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:56,799	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	With Eugene I didn't actually know they knew each other but they have taught this class together so the seminar the wages in the

EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:33,663	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	People start to leave
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:38,527	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	They tell to leave and go into the desert
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:40,319	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	People wander off
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:41,855	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	And they seem to want something else
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:43,903	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	The sissy doesn't just doesn't do anymore
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:45,695	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	It's corrupt

EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:53,887	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	He said crime is rampant pollution and so people just started to wander off into the desert
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:13:00,287	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Live in these caves and vision tense forms of assessment practice became like he had these women who were

EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:17,183	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	In order that you can free the capacity for love
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:22,303	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	I got a classic Mystic idea right the body is just getting in the way of

EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:35,359	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	As he was talking about all this he would
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:36,383	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Glanced out at the student
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:38,431	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	And he would notice this
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:39,455	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Look in there
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:42,015	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	I just felt in the room there was this
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:45,087	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	This deep need was being fulfilled by these
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:46,879	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Strange Mystics
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:48,159	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	He said the students
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:50,975	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	In any way that almost never happens when your
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:55,583	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	We want no saving Souls but it was it was hitting something really really deep
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:59,167	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	What exactly I mean do you think they were starting
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:00,191	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Deform the thought of
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:06,591	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Wandering into the desert so to speak
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:10,175	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Secede walk away you know that's where a lot of people right
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:11,967	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	As for what's behind it all
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:19,135	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	He says just turn on the news video showing the beheading of a second American journalist has now been verified

EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:38,847	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Crazy mutually assured destruction but it makes sense and you can understand and principal terms that was United States was

EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:49,599	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	You're near a nostalgic for mutually assured destruction is that what's happening now seems a much simpler
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:51,391	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	You at least knew who to blame for it right
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:55,487	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Atlanta again look at the Cold War
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:15:02,399	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	And you could see like pacifically like you Soviets the Americans the nukes
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:08,543	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	That's right that's right now

EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:17,503	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Speaking of which today the world's leading climate scientists warn it will get worse no doubt one of the reasons for the current
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:20,575	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Gloom is that we are in the middle of an uncomfortable shift
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:26,975	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	And how we talk about climate change in the ipcc
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:30,047	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	The intergovernmental panel on climate change released a report
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:32,351	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	We're for the first time they stopped
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:34,655	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Using the language of prevention
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:37,727	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	And shifted to the language of adaptation in other words
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:40,031	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Hundreds of scientists and policymakers
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:42,591	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	What's the world's top Organization for assessing climate change
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:44,383	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	We're now saying
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:45,151	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	We Can't Stop
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:46,687	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	It's inevitable
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:53,087	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	So now we need to talk about dealing with the mask that is now on our doorstep that's David Victor professor of international relations
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:55,135	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	University of California at San Diego
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:56,159	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	And he is one of the authors of
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:16:01,791	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	When the ipcc first began back in the late 1980s you could imagine
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:05,631	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	The people would take the climate change problem seriously
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:09,471	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	They would start to control emissions and then over a. Of decades climate
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:15,871	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Would stop changing and it said what's happened is people have talked a lot about climate change but they haven't actually done much to catch
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:20,735	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Emissions now he says we're all in this strange Middle Ground where we're trying to find the language
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:24,831	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	To say why it's important to keep working at this while at the same time
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:30,975	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Admitting some degree of failure and that's the kind of inevitability that I think you see in the new
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:35,327	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	The new reports in any reports are bending over backwards to try and find ways
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:37,887	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	To be optimistic the report says
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:44,543	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	If you put into place all these Technologies and international agreements we could we could still stop warming at 2 degrees
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:46,591	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	My own assessment is that
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:50,175	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	The kinds of actions you need to do that are so heroic that
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:51,455	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	We're not going to see them
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:17:00,415	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	All of which reminded me of that True Detective moment I consider myself for real
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:06,815	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Some what's called a pessimist okay what's that mean well pessimists like nihilist agreed
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:13,215	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	There's no meaning they're just a little more mopey about it less likely to do something means I'm bad at parties
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:16,799	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Means that we're all headed you know in a recent Wall Street Journal
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:19,615	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Poll 76% of people 18 and over

EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:26,527	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Which brings me back to Brooks question why is it cool
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:30,111	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Collet nihilism pessimism whatever shouldn't be depressing
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:37,279	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Why would you want to put a phrase like in the dust of this planet afraid deliberately negates the person wearing it why would you want to

EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:47,327	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Depressing

EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:51,935	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Talking to this way
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:55,263	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Who turns out was the person who made the decision to put it on Jay-Z's back
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,543	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	I should say my name I guess
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:58,079	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	My name is June Ambrose

EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:32,127	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	That was you know my God
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:33,663	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Of course
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:42,111	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Jay-Z and Beyonce that's like culture basically
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:45,695	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Nazi stuff it occurred to Andy and I during the interview that June has
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:51,327	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Probably influence the fashion sense of a significant portion of the human beings on this
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:54,143	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Planet and she was very clear that a costume
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:55,167	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	It's more than just a cost
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:57,727	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	It's like a conversation
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:59,775	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Without words
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:02,335	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	What she's doing what she sows someone is
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:09,247	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Bring me to all the people that are going to watch the videos come in contact with the Billboards go to the concerts
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:10,783	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	I don't have to talk to you
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:12,831	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	But I can create this conversation
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:17,696	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	With a pair of pants and how they fall and how they fit in the texture in the color in the feeling
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:20,512	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	He says with Jay-Z for that video
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:23,840	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	She knew she needed something Epic
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:30,240	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	But like Australis I knew I wanted to biker jacket it was a motorcycle scene but I knew that I just couldn't give up The Lacs
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:33,312	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	I need it I need it to say something feel like something
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:36,128	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	We're on the hunt
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:42,528	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Her nurse assistant went to doesn't the place of cilia Studio the showroom looking at all these leather jackets it's like finding a needle in the hay
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:48,928	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Nothing was right then the soundtrack to This one place black denim this place it does for high-end grunge.
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:55,328	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	They're flipping through the racks when she sees the jacket those were
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:57,120	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Words and that was it I knew it
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:00,960	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	I said I need this is what I need
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:03,008	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	It just felt it was just
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:04,032	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Perfect
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:05,568	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Questions why
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:11,712	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	This one I hadn't really told her the whole back story so I pulled out a screen capture from the video is one where you see Jay Z
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:18,112	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Standing in the desert shot from behind in the dust of this planet on his back
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:21,184	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Really long Dirty Harry gun off to his right sode up
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:24,256	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	About to shoot the sun you think he's about to shoot
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:26,816	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	I printed it out cuz it's just got this like
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:33,728	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Billboard quality to it right have a really cool one of my phone to this nevermind okay so we'll just look at it
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:38,336	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	And why did you choose that jacket
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:41,152	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	You know something very menacing about it
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:44,480	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	It's almost like
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:52,160	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	The aftermath that there was something going on it was paralleling
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:23:00,096	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	The end of an era the beginning of something new she says the back of her head she was thinking about
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:06,496	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	How the music industry might be dying it's definitely in a place where it's like what now you can hear it in the music
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:12,896	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	And you know this the biggest war in history really what now these are the Whispers that you here
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:19,296	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	But she says one of the loudest Whispers was super simple just here's a guy
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:24,672	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	About to go down the end of the world is literally on his back
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:28,256	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	It was almost as if he didn't even know that was on his back
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:30,304	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	You know what I mean it's like
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:31,584	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	That was the afterthought
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:33,632	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Like oh yeah the world ending
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:34,912	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	I don't care it's going out of style
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:37,216	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	In other words he wasn't afraid
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:38,752	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	He wasn't afraid
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:41,824	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	You know what that's what that's what this we talked about Whispers
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:49,760	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	That's what I get from it and I know you said that it's not so much I don't give it I'm not afraid I mean we all have to
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:52,576	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	To leave the planet you know everybody has their day
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:56,160	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	But you work on his not being afraid when you have to leave
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:05,376	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Thank you
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:10,752	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	This was actually refreshing AccuWeather
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:17,152	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Walking out of that interview after we had told her that the phrase on Jay-Z's back was lifted from a book written by
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:23,552	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Find my brother-in-law Eugene oh wow now I need to get the book in which she was very interested to know
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:28,160	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Yeah let's do that and we did send in the book haven't heard back walking out of there
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:30,464	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Keep thinking is that what this is all about
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:34,816	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	It always pop nihilism around us is not about
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:38,400	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Turn down power structures or embracing nothingness it's just
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:39,680	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Look at me
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:41,216	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Look how Brave I am
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:42,240	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	If I can wear it on it
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:47,872	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	And this is why as you pointed out you know from Dada to punk
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:49,152	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	This is a recurring
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:51,200	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Motif of how
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:54,784	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	How badass you are in facing mortality
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:56,320	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	King Kyle badass
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:57,088	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	That's what I was
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:58,624	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	I think
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:25:00,928	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	But that is nothing more than a posture
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:08,608	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	I mean it's all fine when you're 18 to wear that t-shirt but when you're like in your 50s dealing with k
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:13,728	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Cancer like okay you know maybe maybe then is when you really have to confront this thing
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:16,288	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	So I just it's it's simply
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:23,200	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	The posture and that's why it's in pop culture
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:27,552	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	So you know why we love not listening pop culture is they saves us having to be done with it
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:30,112	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Simon critchley again saves us from feeling it
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:33,952	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	We can we can enjoy in our rooms
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:36,256	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	We can get off on it and then we let it go
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:39,072	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	And we got we got to work
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:42,912	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Simon says you don't have to be cynical about this if you don't want to be
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:43,680	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	I mean
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:44,448	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Nietzsche
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:45,984	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	It's a dark pessimist himself
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:49,056	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Had this idea about nihilism that it was just
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:49,824	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	The beginning
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:52,128	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	But if you really
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:55,712	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Dealt with it took it in accelerated it to its logical end
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:57,248	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	You could get to the other side
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:00,832	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	What she called a revaluation of values
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:02,368	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Some you
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:04,928	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	We're thinking about who we are with small creatures
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:06,464	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	County where I am
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:08,000	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Unloved
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:09,536	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Love is that
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:11,840	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Capacity which can
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:13,120	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	See through that
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:20,032	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	And that he suspects is why his students were so interested in those Mystics cuz they had found a way through these people lose
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:20,544	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Mystics
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:23,360	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	The uncompromising
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:24,640	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Commitment to Samuel I love
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:27,200	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	The fact that they were ready to go all the way
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:30,528	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Can you gate even their own bodies
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:32,064	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	For that love
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:34,624	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Brighten the world web
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:37,184	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	Where love has been reduced to Tinder exchanges
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:41,792	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	If that's the hell that you're living in his 25-year old then yeah you going to read this Mystic something
EDL	00:26:42,304	00:26:48,704	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	I want what she's having turn my flash
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:50,752	| radiolab_podcast14dustofthisplanet |	And you could argue
