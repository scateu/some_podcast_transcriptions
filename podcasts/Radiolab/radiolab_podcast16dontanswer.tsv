EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:31,583	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Behind closed doors had nothing to do with whether you were going to be a good president or not
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:33,119	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	I mean through a certain
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:33,887	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Uncertain
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:35,679	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Standards I guess
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:37,215	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	This is the world that hard
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:40,543	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Still thinks he's living in that as long as it doesn't burst into public View
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:41,823	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	It won't be a star
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:44,383	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	The map by says that world is X
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:45,151	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Changing
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:46,943	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Because of a political earthquake
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:48,991	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Just over a decade
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:49,759	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Before
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:55,903	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Talking about the Watergate break-in
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:08:02,559	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Knocked out breaking that wall five people have been arrested and charged with breaking into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:05,887	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Yale arguably the biggest scandal in White House history
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:08,447	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Yeah Nixon tapping phone line compiling enemy list
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:10,495	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	And for the reporters covering neck
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:12,543	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	It really is an embarrassment
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:17,151	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	You had an entire White House Press Corps
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:17,919	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Political process
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:18,943	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Campaign dresser
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:22,015	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	I followed this man Richard Nixon for decades
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:26,367	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	And somehow either missed the fact or failed to report the fact
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:33,791	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	He had some significant psychological issues and was paranoid
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:36,351	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	And could be corrupted I think there was a sense that
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:38,399	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	We let the public down
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:45,567	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Leslie Stahl remembers it this way regular White House Press reporters
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:46,847	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	They should have been digging
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:55,551	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Chipping away chipping away chipping away they should have been looking behind the curtain and so right
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,575	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	After Watergate
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:58,623	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Reporters became tougher
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:00,415	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Saying okay
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:01,951	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	We have to be skeptical about
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:02,719	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Everything
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:03,743	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	And in particular
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:05,535	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	The characters
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:12,191	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Meaning suddenly your makeup your personal Behavior who you are and your private moments
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:17,567	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Matters a whole hell of a lot for the kind of President you can be in whether or not we can trust you
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:19,103	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	As a publicly
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:27,551	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	What character is the subject tonight of our weekend Journal
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:33,951	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	What Americans choose president's personal character traits are important
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:35,231	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	A great deal of scrutiny
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:36,255	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	I remember
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:38,815	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	There was a bit of a shift in
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:40,607	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	The kinds of reporters who are covering Nashville
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:43,167	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	They had a different orientation
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:44,191	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	And they were really interested
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:48,287	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	That's Kevin Sweeney again he says he was initially fresh
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:49,823	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Grated 5 reporters
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:52,895	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Strange obsession with things that we're not really
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:59,807	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Issues important issues in the campaign like age there was some confusion about heart Sage the fact that
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:06,207	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	He changed the family name his signature changed at a certain point is life he says when those stories
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:12,607	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Usually popped up I I thought it was a false set of issues I didn't really take it seriously
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:16,191	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Came to the rumors of quote womanizing or marital infidelity
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:17,983	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	You felt like you needed to talk to
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:23,103	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	I I did say it if if anything is happening it needs to stop
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:26,687	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	I mean this can't whatever it is I mean I understand he said you know nothing's
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:29,759	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	And he shot back and said they have no right to cover that that
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:33,599	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	That's ridiculous it's not an issue that you know why is that an issue that's not their job
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:35,903	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	And I kept pushing back tonight on max
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:36,415	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Kara weather
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:38,207	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	I don't care what you think
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:40,511	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	This is the new Conte

EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:42,559	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	I don't know why or how
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:43,327	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	The rules of chain
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:44,863	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	The rules of chess
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:53,823	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Joe Webb
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:54,847	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	This brings us back to
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:57,663	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Did Tom Fiedler the Miami Herald he was covering Gary
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:59,455	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Heart going with him to all the stops
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:00,479	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Iowa
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:01,759	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	New Hampshire and so forth
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:02,527	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	And at
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:05,855	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Seems like at every stop along the way
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:08,415	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Someone some reporter wood
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,183	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Raise
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:13,023	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Her his hand and would say what about the rumors of his woman I
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:19,935	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Dump says that he would see reporters asking all these questions and he he was a little bit trouble so on April 27th
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:20,959	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	1987
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:21,727	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	He wrote a column
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:23,007	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Asking the
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:28,383	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Is it ethical for journalists to be even raising this kind of a
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:29,407	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Of a question
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:32,991	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Tonight I really came down to the conclusion that unless
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:34,527	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	The
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:37,599	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Mediamaster reporters involved had actual proof
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:43,231	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	That this was a problem that he was a womanizer we just shouldn't be printing that
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:45,279	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Column runs on a Monday morning
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:46,303	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	That night
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:47,583	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	He gets the call
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:50,911	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	The voice on the other side says Gary Hart
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:53,215	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Is having an affair with
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:54,751	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	My best friends
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:58,079	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Stumps truck as we know I told her that
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:12:01,919	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	My position had to be that I couldn't believe what she had to say unless they would
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:06,783	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	And I'm finally she said my friend is going to fly up to Washington
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:11,647	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Next weekend and she's going to spend the weekend with Senator Hart
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:15,487	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	She said so all you have to do is buy a ticket on that plane
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:18,815	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	I thought well
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:20,863	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Would that be ethically
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:23,679	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Okay what is inbound and what is out about
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:29,311	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	I mean character was his new obsession political journalism but according to Matt by no one had taken that character
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:31,359	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Into
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:32,383	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	A candidates bedroom
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:35,711	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	That was new
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:37,759	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	This is inbound because
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:39,807	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Gary Hart was publicly
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:42,111	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Denying that
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:44,927	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	He had been carrying on affairs with
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:45,695	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	With anyone
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:49,279	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Clear oftentimes when Gary Hart was asked about these rumors
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:51,071	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Never asked directly to
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:51,583	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	It's about the rumors
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:52,863	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	He say something like that
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:55,167	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	It's no one else's business
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:56,959	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Now why is it not anyone else's bills
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:57,471	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Because it is
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:13:02,335	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	No but hasn't been the business of the American public for 200 years and it isn't today
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:03,359	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	He say something like that
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:04,383	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	The Fiedler says
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:08,735	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	A couple times when he's asked he did say something that amounted to an o
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:15,135	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Such as if there was any truth to these allegations it would have come out long before the kinds of answers that
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:16,415	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Work non-denial
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:17,695	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Denial another phrase
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:20,511	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Came out of Watergate so my view at that
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:25,119	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Point was if in fact there was
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:25,887	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Proof
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:32,287	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	That he was carrying on an affair privately while publicly insisting that
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:33,823	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	There really was no Bass
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:36,895	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	To this event that was irrelevant issue relevant to his
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:37,663	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Performances
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:39,199	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Dispute future president yes
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:40,991	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Was a question of integrity
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:45,855	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	So we thought the only way that we are going to
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:46,879	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Find out if
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:48,415	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	If what the caller told us is

EDL	00:18:57,663	00:19:00,479	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Pepe reee he asked what who are you
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:04,063	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Well we're from the Miami Herald and
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:05,599	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	He didn't really say anything
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:07,391	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	So
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:08,927	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	So I told him that
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:14,047	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	He wanted to know why he was meeting with this woman in his townhouse
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:17,119	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	A woman who at that point we knew
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:21,215	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Had spent the night with him he says in Myriad ways myriad Times
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:22,495	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	I'm not going to tell you that
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:23,263	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	That woman was
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:24,543	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	This is private
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:28,127	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	This isn't public but he says there's no Affair which he would maintain Forever After
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:32,991	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	And I ultimately he's had. I've said enough
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:36,063	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	And he turned and walked inside
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:38,367	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Slam the door
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:42,719	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	We did tell him though he said we're going to write this story
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:44,511	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Unless
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:47,071	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	We you give us a reason as to why
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:49,119	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Explain this to y
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:52,447	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	What we are seeing and what we're concluding is wrong
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:52,959	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	He never did
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:55,775	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	So we kind of look at our
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:57,567	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Cells and said well now what do we do
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:04,479	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Ultimately the call was
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,759	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	We have the proof
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:07,295	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	We feel we needed
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:13,183	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	We know that publicly he was saying these things and we now know that privately he was engaged
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:18,047	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	So they ran back to the hotel room Fiedler frantically typed out the story
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:19,583	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Gary Hart
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:25,471	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	, who's presidential campaign has been dogged by rumors of womanizing

EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:32,895	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Friday night and much a Saturday with a woman who came from Miami to meet
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:41,855	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	I finally went back and I I probably slept for three or four hours you're going to do the story The only thing that
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:46,463	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	It gives me pause as if you're under this standard you lose Jack Handey certainly
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:49,023	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Yeah lose Woodrow Wilson
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:49,535	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	I think
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:50,815	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	So
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:52,095	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	You lose a lot of
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:52,607	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	People
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:58,495	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	You might not want to lose but you know I a leap to the conclusion that the
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:21:00,031	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	The public would vanish
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:01,055	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	A person for that
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:01,823	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	And I I don't
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:02,847	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	I don't go there
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:05,663	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	So are you worried about how it's going to land
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:07,199	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	That's a pretty sure Jamie York

EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:26,048	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	You know that's not a bomb
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:27,840	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	What business is it

EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:04,448	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	This was character suicide
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:10,848	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	He did it we didn't even ask that debate heats up over the ethics of its coverage of Gary Hart

EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:42,112	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	As this moment when all these forces
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:43,392	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Way outside of Gary Hart's
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:44,160	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	People come together

EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:50,048	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	But
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:52,352	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	As with all cultural shifts
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:55,424	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	There's more than one way to look at this so just for a gut check

EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:27,680	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	But it wasn't just that it's important to keep in mind here is that there were many more women
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:28,704	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Covering Canada
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:30,496	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	It's at that point then there had been but
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:31,264	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	The four
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:32,544	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	There were women on the bus
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:34,336	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	And in the case of
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:35,104	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Gary Hart
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:37,664	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Several of those women had had
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:38,944	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Personal encounters
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:44,320	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	There were times when you be in a room where he had to hit on every woman in the room
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:45,088	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	So
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:46,880	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	This was not somebody that
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:49,952	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Women who recovering campaigns
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:50,976	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Ignorant of
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:53,792	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	And the other thing to keep in mind
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:54,816	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Robert is that
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:56,096	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	IHome
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:29:57,120	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Women's movement
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:29:58,400	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Did talk
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:30:00,448	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Quite a bit about the
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:01,216	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	The personal is
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:01,728	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Is political
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:06,080	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	And because the way women were treated with something that
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:08,896	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	We thought and I continue to think
EDL	00:30:09,408	00:30:10,688	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Is a
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:12,224	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	A good gauge of character
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:15,296	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	And there was something of a sense that
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:17,600	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Have you treated women like Kleenex
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:19,136	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	So
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:20,416	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	We work
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:23,488	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Expanding the universe of what was a major Cara
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:28,096	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	So then are you kind of are you kind of routing Fiedler on absolutely
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:29,632	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Finally somebody
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:31,168	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Nevada and fight and thank God it's
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:37,824	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	As much as you were cheering them on was there any concern that that was changing the rules
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:38,848	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Journalism
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:40,128	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Why
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:41,152	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Because
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:44,736	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	The rules of Journalism were constantly changing
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:46,272	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	As they should
EDL	00:30:46,272	00:30:48,832	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	According to Cokie Roberts this was less about journalism
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:50,112	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Then
EDL	00:30:50,112	00:30:52,160	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	About journalism catching up
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:53,952	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	With the ethics of the time
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:56,256	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Look we elect our presidents
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:59,072	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Are based on who they are not on what

EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:10,496	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	That
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:12,544	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	There's propriety
EDL	00:32:13,056	00:32:13,568	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	And
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:16,640	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	I'm old-fashioned I guess am I I don't know
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:19,968	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	I'd intended
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:22,528	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Quite frankly to come down here this morning
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:28,160	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Read a short carefully-worded political statement this is Gary Hart statement
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:29,440	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	A few days after that person
EDL	00:32:29,952	00:32:30,720	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Saying that
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:33,280	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	I was withdrawing from the race and then
EDL	00:32:34,048	00:32:35,328	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Quietly disappear
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:38,912	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	And then
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:41,728	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Frankly tossing and turning all night by myself
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:42,752	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Hell no
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:49,920	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	I'm not going to do that because it's not my
EDL	00:32:49,920	00:32:50,944	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	My style and because
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:53,504	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	I'm a proud man and I'm proud of what I've accomplished
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:56,064	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	In public life
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:57,600	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Some things may be interested
EDL	00:32:58,624	00:33:00,672	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	That doesn't necessarily mean they're important
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:03,744	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	We're all going to have to seriously question the system
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:05,280	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Selecting our national leader
EDL	00:33:06,304	00:33:08,864	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	That reduces the Press of this nation to Hunters
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:11,424	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	The presidential candidates to being hunted
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:14,240	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Politics in this country take it from me
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:18,848	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Is on the verge of becoming another form of athletic competition or sporting match
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:21,408	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	We all better do something
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:23,200	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	To make this system
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:23,712	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Work
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:28,320	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	We're all going to be soon rephrasing Jefferson to say I tremble for my country
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:30,624	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	But I think we may in fact
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:32,672	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	Get the kind of leaders
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:33,184	| radiolab_podcast16dontanswer |	We deserve
