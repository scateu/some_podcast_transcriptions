EDL	00:00:14,848	00:00:21,248	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	End NPR
EDL	00:00:21,248	00:00:27,648	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Religious Radiolab and our show today is about being witness to something especially not something you really
EDL	00:00:27,648	00:00:34,048	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Choose to witness and you feel like it should I be saying this is a story that for me speaks to like what it's like to live
EDL	00:00:34,048	00:00:40,448	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	The city when you look out the window we're somewhere Elso Jam together that suddenly you're seeing into the live to somebody else
EDL	00:00:40,448	00:00:42,240	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Through their window and the
EDL	00:00:42,240	00:00:48,640	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	You just kind of fall into it without even want to in this particular tale it what is observed is so sad
EDL	00:00:48,640	00:00:55,040	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Surprising and so forth tenderness and forth quiet love that we it's a rare thing to see so we wanted to send it
EDL	00:00:55,040	00:01:01,440	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Your way from our friends over radiotopia Nick Van Der kolk and Brendan Baker to here we go this is how their Story begins
EDL	00:01:01,440	00:01:07,840	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Started Living in
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:14,240	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	In my apartment about 15 years and one evening
EDL	00:01:14,240	00:01:20,640	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I walked in the living room which has three bay windows which Facebook Gardens in the back
EDL	00:01:20,640	00:01:27,040	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And over half a block of Gardens and across a small Street there was this bright window
EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:33,440	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	That I've never noticed before it but it's at the exact eye level of my third floor
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:39,840	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Apartment and after a while I realized that I never seen it because there had always been curtains
EDL	00:01:39,840	00:01:46,240	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And so I think dimly-lit the curtains were often closed and all of a sudden there's this bright light and milk
EDL	00:01:46,240	00:01:52,640	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Curtains and it was like a movie screen
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:59,040	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	15 years and that window is meant nothing I haven't even know
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:05,440	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Noticed it and now it's all I think about
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:11,840	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	There were new tenants and it had always been a live
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:18,240	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Living room and now it was suddenly a bedroom and there are these two people in there and they
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:24,640	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	We're naked this young couple in their twenties they were really lovey-dovey and they were
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:31,040	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Always naked csdn wiper who tells the story and she told it to
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:37,440	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Radio voter Brianna Breen who produces peace with Megan Brennan the thing is they pushed their
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:43,840	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Bed so that the head was up against the windows so their heads you could see the both of their heads
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:50,240	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Lying there so you'd see things that you just like there were just shocking I just had been there all of this time and
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:56,640	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And suddenly you could see people having sex really clearly like this like amazing we clearly I-84
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:03:03,040	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I had no idea that you could see so well across such a distance and it was
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:09,440	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Was really uncomfortable my husband and I were still adjusting to Parenthood
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:15,840	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And it wasn't the most romantic time in our in our lives and my son was probably 3
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:22,240	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And when your new parents to a toddler especially because he sleeps in bed with us
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:28,640	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	That's too so he's like literally right between us the last thing you need is a couple of hotties getting it on
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:35,040	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Across the window reminding your husband of everything
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:41,440	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I have this really beautiful young woman that was really thin and and and naked
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:47,840	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Really you know it was very frustrating and end in if she had this beautiful
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:51,424	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Tall lanky well-built boyfriends
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:58,848	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Anti first I die just because I felt like my husband was going to be staring at the naked woman all the
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:05,248	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	What time I started closing the living room curtains which is really kind of silly and it made our room really dark and we know
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:07,552	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Never close those curtains and so that didn't work
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:14,464	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	So I thought about like making a really big sign that says like close your curtains
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:20,863	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Buy curtains they didn't even have curtains by curtains we can see you and I thought about going by their building
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:27,263	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I have no idea what their unit was and leaving a note and then I started
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:33,663	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	That was really silly and prudish and started realizing that they were just young
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:40,063	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And I had to just get over it and live with it and move on and so
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:46,463	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	So that's what I did
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:52,863	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	We got really used to them and then they became sort of the symbol of what we used to be
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:59,263	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	In our twenties and they were living the really care free time and that's another thing that was kind of hard
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:05,663	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Hard not to sometimes when you're in early Parenthood you get a little bitter I think that some of those freedom
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:12,063	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Then we'd watch them sleeping till 11 while we've been up since 5 with our toddler in and we saw them
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:18,463	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Eating breakfast on the roof together so we got used to it only we know we would notice like a new
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:24,863	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Can I plant in there and they became sort of part of our Lives you know because they were just always there and never
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:31,263	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Ever bought curtains do you think all the Neighbors in your building and the surrounding building
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:37,663	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Also saw this it's funny I think that the way that we are positions
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:44,063	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Because all of the buildings around us are different sizes and our building is the tallest one on
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:50,463	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Tarblock but it's exactly at the right level to see their their windows
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:56,863	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I have a friend next door and then a friend across the way and and all of them have Windows facing the gardens but not
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:06:03,263	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	All of them are blocked and I look at the other windows of the buildings around us and I don't think anyone has
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:09,663	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	This perfect level view the irony is that I'm such a private person
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:16,063	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And I don't know if my supposed to have maybe respected their privacy and just looked away but it's
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:22,463	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	It's impossible because that's the way the chairs face to face the window I couldn't I couldn't not see
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:26,559	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	If I wanted to but I guess I could have not gotten the binoculars
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:39,615	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Set a timer
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:46,015	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	By and this is maybe a year-and-a-half later two years later and I remember seeing the room
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:52,415	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And the light was on but it was empty and I thought that was strange because it was 5 in the morning and
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:58,815	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	They never went anywhere early and it was like that for like a whole week was just as empty room with a lighter
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:05,215	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And I thought that was strange they they didn't seem to be there as often
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:11,615	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Or maybe just she would be there and he was gone for long periods of time and we just kind of forgot about them you know
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:18,015	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	There were they weather wasn't as much action going on and they were in his presents and so we just kind of
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:23,647	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Lived our lives and forgot about them for maybe 7 or 8 months
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:28,767	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	The end of last year in December
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:35,167	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	There was this night when my husband and I separately had both seen this woman naked sitting
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:41,567	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	The window kind of chubby slump shouldered woman who was just looking down at
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:47,967	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	The street and we both thought it was so strange just couldn't figure out who she
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:54,367	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	He was and what she was doing and why she was naked and a few nights later there was
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:08:00,767	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Was this young man standing right at the window by the bed and he was
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:07,167	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Skeletal he was so thin and he was bald completely
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:13,567	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And we realized it was the same couple they had completely changed
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:19,967	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	You sick there's something serious
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:26,367	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Wrong with him
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:32,767	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	After that I just watched the window all the time
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:39,167	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	We're going to pause it right here
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:42,239	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Here let's just be right back

EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:25,407	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I am Jedi Broad River coach this is Radiolab let's get back to our story from Brianna Breen and the folks eleven radio
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:29,503	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Nick Van Der kolk and Brendan Baker so we're just going to go back to the room C
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:35,903	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	See what's what we can see through the window you're staying wiper I just watched the window
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:38,975	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	All the time and
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:45,375	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	He would sit all day he was there because I work from home and I would see him
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:51,775	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I'm all day in the bedroom either lying down or sitting at the computer and then after
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:58,175	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	A couple of weeks he was just lying down and he was just there and his bald head would be
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:11:04,575	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Up against the the pane of glass all the time and she would be there
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:10,975	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	There and she come in and she would bring him things but mostly it was just him there by himself and
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:17,375	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Sometimes he would have liked his knees bent and you could just see how skeletal they were they were just bone
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:22,495	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And sometimes you kick off the blankets and he was just lying there naked in it
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:24,287	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Emaciated
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:32,223	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And then after awhile he should always burrowed under the blankets like I found myself
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:38,623	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Thinking like what maybe she's been through chemo and he's recovering and you guys going through this
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:45,023	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	The six phase before he gets well because you so young he didn't you know he's just such a young guy
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:46,303	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:53,215	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	So we had to go to Colorado to see my family for Christmas and worry
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:59,615	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Read all the time I was there I would have thought about them and I worried that he wasn't going to be there when we got back
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:06,015	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Back I worried all the time about it when we got back about 10 days later
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:12,415	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	He was still there but his head looked so much smaller and
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:18,815	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And there were a lot of people there and and then I got out
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:19,839	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	My binoculars
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:26,239	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I got my birding binoculars I'm not proud of it but at that point
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:32,639	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I felt so invested
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:39,039	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	They look like people coming to say goodbye
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:45,439	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And there was this sort of short blond Midwestern look
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:51,839	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Looking woman who I guess was his mother and then there was this young guy who just kept pace
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:58,239	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Chasing the Halls you know you could just see their two doorways leading out of this room and you could just see him go down one side and 3
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:13:04,639	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Other than back and forth and back and forth and I figured he was the brother and
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:11,039	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	It look like the girlfriend's sister was also there was just I was just a guess looked like her
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:17,439	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I remember there was just this little gathering going on in the living room
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:23,839	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Right below the neighbors were standing around and having drinks and they have no idea at all
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:30,239	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	What was going on right upstairs I would watch people come and go then after a while
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:36,639	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Everyone left except for the girlfriend and the mother and and I spent
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:43,039	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And I spent all that evening like sitting vigil in
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:49,439	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	On the back of the couch and and watch it and and
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:55,839	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I remember the girlfriend lying beside him for a long time on our own and she was just stroking its face
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:14:02,239	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	So tenderly it was so much affection that really transcend
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:08,639	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	The kind of young love that you expect all I could see was the top of his head all that time
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:15,039	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And I remember later seeing her standing by the
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:21,439	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	The bed when the mother on the other side and they were just all talking and she put a hand on his forehead to the back
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:27,839	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Back of her hand on his forehead and then she was wiping at her eyes and you could tell that there was
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:32,703	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	This that there was the sense that something that it was getting closer
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:42,175	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Then I could see this Reckoning or she she was wiping her
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:45,759	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Her eyes and touching his forehead and wiping at her eyes and
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:54,719	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	There were candles lit and in this
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:15:01,119	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Young woman was on one side and his mother was on the other side
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:07,519	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And they just were lying there for a really long time and I had
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:13,919	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Their hands just resting on his chest and so I watched it
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:20,319	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Prolong time
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:26,719	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	The mother in the girlfriend relying on either side of him and you could tell it was his this was the end
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:33,119	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I thought now all that's left is the girlfriend in the mother and inexplicably
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:39,519	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Me me
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:41,823	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Three people at the Deathbed
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:48,991	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And I lay there for a long time and then they just got up and they hate went into the other room
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:55,135	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And I realized that must have been the moment
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:15:59,487	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Aunt
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:05,887	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	All this time you know what I always have the sense that you know that they're going to break up
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:12,287	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	They're going to move out nobody that age stays together very long and
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:18,431	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I had no idea it was just like this beautiful love story
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:25,343	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	So the next day the next day I got up and went
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:31,743	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	The window first thing and they were folding up blankets and stay
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:38,143	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Stacking them on the bed and I figured that he had been taken away and so
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:44,543	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I was in the kitchen and my husband called because he had maybe knew how obsessed I'd gotten with the sea
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:50,943	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Situation and he said there's activity over there and I came running and I got my binoculars and I
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:57,343	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I looked him and realize that he was still there he was still in the bed his body was still there
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:17:03,743	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And it was the coroner so the coroner and his assistant came and they had these white plastic glue
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:10,143	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Gloves on and they pulled his body to the edge
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:16,543	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Shut the bed and onto this white sheet and I just remember the lifelessness of it it look
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:22,943	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	So shrunken it almost looks like a shrunken rubber proxy
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:23,967	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Everybody
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:30,879	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	So incredibly dead they wrapped him in a sheet and they zipped mm
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:37,279	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Into a vinyl bag and they put him on this kind of Gurney they took the gurney out
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:43,679	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I just had this very strange impulse and I ran and threw on my coat
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:48,287	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Kind of over my pajamas and ran out to the street ran to the corner
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:54,687	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And I got there just as they were calling him out they were carrying him out
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:18:01,087	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And the girlfriend was there she was talking to one of them in the doorway
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:07,487	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And they loaded him into this van and I realized that
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:13,887	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	They know me at all like I had you know I have no place to be there and
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:20,287	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	They looked at me I remember the coroner's assistant looking at me like I was sort of a like a rubbernecker
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:26,687	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Girl in the street you know looking at this grisly scene and I realized that's that's what I was
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:33,087	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I had no place to be there and suddenly it all felt so perverse and so I went home
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:39,487	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Home and I felt very strange about the whole thing
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:45,887	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And I tried to tell myself that I never wanted to be part of their lives I want it I was the one that wanted them to
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:52,287	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	How to put up curtains I wanted them to just shut the intimate stuff out I was uncomfortable with it I was the one
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:53,823	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	It wanted out
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:19:00,223	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Can I started remembering all of a sudden when I moved to that apartment so many years ago
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:06,623	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And I was in my mid-twenties that had to share the apartment with a roommate cuz it was too
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:13,023	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Expensive my bedroom was in the living room and I remember how when I first moved in
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:19,423	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And I pushed the head of my bed up against the three bay windows so so that in the morning I could see
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:21,471	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	See the sky and
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:28,383	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I remember that I had no clue it never occurred to me that anyone could see me that
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:34,783	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I remember that I felt like whenever I looked out the window I never saw anyone and
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:37,599	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I never close my curtains either
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:43,999	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Did you ever find out either of their names I I never
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:50,399	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Have found out their names and I looked through the local obituaries obsessively
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:56,799	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	4 weeks and there was never anyone that fit his description there was never anyone young enough for
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:20:03,199	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	That looks like him so no idea I walked by their place ever
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:09,599	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	What times and there's only their only numbers on the mailboxes in the buzzards and there's
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:15,743	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	There are no names so I can't look up anything I don't know I've no idea who she is
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:18,047	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I have no idea who he was
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:21,375	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	No idea what he was sick with
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:23,167	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I don't know
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:30,079	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	If I've gotten anything right maybe they were married but I didn't get the fact that he died
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:30,847	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Because
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:35,455	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I was there I was there for that
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:37,247	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Because I saw it all
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:43,391	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I think about that a lot how he chose
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:47,743	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	But he chose to die in that in that bed in that bedroom
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:52,607	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And he didn't choose to Goodwill hospice or
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:55,167	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Anywhere he wanted to be in his bedroom
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:21:01,823	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	All of those long days from the morning when I looked out in the evening he was just exactly the same position
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:03,615	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	That was where he wanted to be
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:07,455	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And I
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:13,087	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	It's where all of the happy times where I guess in the end times you know
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:21,536	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Just a couple days after it happened she was up on the roof with a friend doing
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:27,936	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Doing yoga and I watched her lying around a lot she
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:34,336	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	When out-of-town I think for a bit and she still there
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:40,736	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I have been watching her recovery and instead of being this
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:41,760	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Young woman
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:48,672	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	She looks totally different she looks so changed she just
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:54,816	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Looks like this very experienced world-weary person
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:22:01,728	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	She has a job now that gets hurt very early cuz I get up at 6 and she's already dressed
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:08,128	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Kids out at like 6:15 and the other night I saw her
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:14,528	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	And she was in her bedroom and she was wearing this bag
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:20,928	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	A T-shirt and all the lights were on and and she was dancing
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:27,328	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Just dancing around her room so yeah
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:33,728	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	On her I want her to move on this this young woman that I was so
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:40,128	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Cranky and bitter about you know now she's now she's that way.
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:43,712	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Protective and kind of maternal you know
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:50,112	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	If you ran into her at the corner market or something do you think you could ever say anything to
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:56,256	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Yeah if I ran into her I wouldn't say it
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:23:04,704	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	What would I say I've been watching you through your window how creepy would that be
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:08,032	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	Yeah no way
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:15,712	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	She doesn't know she doesn't know that
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:22,112	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	She doesn't know that there's this person that
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:28,512	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	I don't know if it's a complete stranger
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:34,912	| radiolab_podcast15thelivingroom |	But that they're really rooting for her and I
