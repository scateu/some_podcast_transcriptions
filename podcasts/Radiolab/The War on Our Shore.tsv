EDL	00:04:43,625	00:04:44,750	| The War on Our Shore |	He's a historian and he wrote a book
EDL	00:04:44,750	00:04:46,458	| The War on Our Shore |	that's pretty much the definitive account

EDL	00:04:47,958	00:04:48,833	| The War on Our Shore |	Anyhow, Thermopolis,

EDL	00:04:50,791	00:04:52,666	| The War on Our Shore |	And there are three miners at a place
EDL	00:04:52,666	00:04:54,083	| The War on Our Shore |	called the Highline Coal Mine,
EDL	00:04:54,083	00:04:55,375	| The War on Our Shore |	which is outside of Thermopolis.

EDL	00:05:01,583	00:05:03,333	| The War on Our Shore |	And just as they step out of the mine,
EDL	00:05:03,333	00:05:04,333	| The War on Our Shore |	they hear this whistling
EDL	00:05:04,333	00:05:05,500	| The War on Our Shore |	sound over their heads.

EDL	00:05:11,916	00:05:13,375	| The War on Our Shore |	A tremendous explosion.

EDL	00:05:27,083	00:05:27,500	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:05:27,500	00:05:29,125	| The War on Our Shore |	But above them, there's sort of this

EDL	00:05:35,625	00:05:36,625	| The War on Our Shore |	They get in their car
EDL	00:05:36,625	00:05:38,583	| The War on Our Shore |	and they chase after it
EDL	00:05:38,583	00:05:39,750	| The War on Our Shore |	until eventually they lose

EDL	00:06:43,458	00:06:46,416	| The War on Our Shore |	Warren Hyde actually died in 1989, so...
EDL	00:06:46,416	00:06:47,833	| The War on Our Shore |	I'm the oldest son of Sheriff Hyde.
EDL	00:06:47,833	00:06:48,708	| The War on Our Shore |	We talked to his son.

EDL	00:07:04,458	00:07:05,291	| The War on Our Shore |	Said there's this strange

EDL	00:07:07,166	00:07:09,416	| The War on Our Shore |	Some kind of balloon parachute looking

EDL	00:07:25,416	00:07:26,250	| The War on Our Shore |	because a man can't run
EDL	00:07:26,250	00:07:27,750	| The War on Our Shore |	with a .38 pistol on his waist.
EDL	00:07:27,750	00:07:28,166	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:07:28,166	00:07:29,500	| The War on Our Shore |	And took off after the balloon.
EDL	00:07:29,500	00:07:30,750	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:07:30,750	00:07:32,000	| The War on Our Shore |	Here's what he sees in that field.

EDL	00:07:32,916	00:07:34,625	| The War on Our Shore |	It was, I mean, if you look at a picture

EDL	00:07:40,291	00:07:42,958	| The War on Our Shore |	And then coming down from this globe are

EDL	00:07:44,541	00:07:45,041	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:07:45,041	00:07:48,416	| The War on Our Shore |	And at the bottom, attached to it, is a

EDL	00:07:53,541	00:07:55,791	| The War on Our Shore |	And Sheriff Hyde, he sees this thing,
EDL	00:07:55,791	00:07:57,250	| The War on Our Shore |	runs out into the field,
EDL	00:07:57,250	00:07:58,333	| The War on Our Shore |	grabs onto the ropes
EDL	00:07:58,333	00:07:59,791	| The War on Our Shore |	to maybe tie it down.

EDL	00:08:00,166	00:08:01,750	| The War on Our Shore |	But just as he grabs it...

EDL	00:08:06,333	00:08:08,333	| The War on Our Shore |	Like he was a paper doll.
EDL	00:08:08,333	00:08:09,541	| The War on Our Shore |	And so he's dangling from

EDL	00:08:20,000	00:08:21,333	| The War on Our Shore |	Still trying to wrangle it
EDL	00:08:21,333	00:08:23,375	| The War on Our Shore |	like some bucking bronco.
EDL	00:08:23,375	00:08:24,291	| The War on Our Shore |	He lands again.
EDL	00:08:24,291	00:08:25,583	| The War on Our Shore |	He tries to tie it to a

EDL	00:08:27,041	00:08:29,125	| The War on Our Shore |	But the wind catches it again and goes
EDL	00:08:29,125	00:08:30,583	| The War on Our Shore |	back over the canyon.
EDL	00:08:30,583	00:08:31,541	| The War on Our Shore |	Back to the first side?

EDL	00:08:32,625	00:08:33,750	| The War on Our Shore |	And they started to

EDL	00:08:35,041	00:08:36,208	| The War on Our Shore |	He kept wrestling this
EDL	00:08:36,208	00:08:37,458	| The War on Our Shore |	balloon for a long time.
EDL	00:08:37,458	00:08:38,875	| The War on Our Shore |	He's nauseous from being
EDL	00:08:38,875	00:08:40,583	| The War on Our Shore |	spun around on this balloon.
EDL	00:08:40,583	00:08:42,166	| The War on Our Shore |	His vision's getting blurry.
EDL	00:08:42,166	00:08:44,250	| The War on Our Shore |	His hands are becoming raw from the rope.
EDL	00:08:44,250	00:08:46,875	| The War on Our Shore |	But he feels this like sense of duty.
EDL	00:08:46,875	00:08:48,041	| The War on Our Shore |	He knew that the government
EDL	00:08:48,041	00:08:49,541	| The War on Our Shore |	wanted one of these balloons.
EDL	00:08:49,541	00:08:50,458	| The War on Our Shore |	It's his territory, so
EDL	00:08:50,458	00:08:51,500	| The War on Our Shore |	he's got to take it down.
EDL	00:08:51,500	00:08:52,250	| The War on Our Shore |	That's right.
EDL	00:08:52,250	00:08:54,083	| The War on Our Shore |	He finally lets himself
EDL	00:08:54,083	00:08:56,500	| The War on Our Shore |	freefall so he can grab it again.
EDL	00:08:56,500	00:08:57,708	| The War on Our Shore |	So his weight will jerk
EDL	00:08:57,708	00:08:58,791	| The War on Our Shore |	the balloon to the ground.
EDL	00:08:58,791	00:08:59,625	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:08:59,625	00:09:01,583	| The War on Our Shore |	Then finally the balloon came down in
EDL	00:09:01,583	00:09:03,375	| The War on Our Shore |	kind of a little ravine
EDL	00:09:03,375	00:09:05,583	| The War on Our Shore |	where sagebrush were growing.
EDL	00:09:05,583	00:09:05,958	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:09:05,958	00:09:08,791	| The War on Our Shore |	And a root had been exposed on the side
EDL	00:09:08,791	00:09:10,500	| The War on Our Shore |	of the ravine from a sagebrush.
EDL	00:09:10,500	00:09:12,625	| The War on Our Shore |	And he hooks his arm around this root.
EDL	00:09:12,625	00:09:14,208	| The War on Our Shore |	Then he was able to hold the balloon
EDL	00:09:14,208	00:09:16,416	| The War on Our Shore |	without being carried into the air.
EDL	00:09:16,416	00:09:16,833	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:09:16,833	00:09:18,125	| The War on Our Shore |	So he actually captured the thing?
EDL	00:09:18,125	00:09:18,333	| The War on Our Shore |	Yeah.
EDL	00:09:18,333	00:09:18,708	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:09:18,708	00:09:19,875	| The War on Our Shore |	J. Edgar Hoover wrote him a

EDL	00:09:21,541	00:09:23,125	| The War on Our Shore |	They end up shipping all of the evidence
EDL	00:09:23,125	00:09:24,166	| The War on Our Shore |	off to the Aberdeen
EDL	00:09:24,166	00:09:27,458	| The War on Our Shore |	Military Research Facility.
EDL	00:09:27,458	00:09:29,000	| The War on Our Shore |	Where they had gathered all this
EDL	00:09:29,000	00:09:29,666	| The War on Our Shore |	different evidence
EDL	00:09:29,666	00:09:31,083	| The War on Our Shore |	from all over the country.

EDL	00:09:31,666	00:09:33,958	| The War on Our Shore |	And they were able to tell that...
EDL	00:09:33,958	00:09:35,791	| The War on Our Shore |	Apparently this bomb matched known
EDL	00:09:35,791	00:09:37,541	| The War on Our Shore |	characteristics of Japanese bombs.
EDL	00:09:37,541	00:09:39,083	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:09:39,083	00:09:39,541	| The War on Our Shore |	So it's Japanese?
EDL	00:09:39,541	00:09:40,125	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:09:40,125	00:09:40,541	| The War on Our Shore |	Yeah.
EDL	00:09:40,541	00:09:43,166	| The War on Our Shore |	But it's impossible to send a balloon
EDL	00:09:43,166	00:09:45,041	| The War on Our Shore |	across the Pacific Ocean at this point.
EDL	00:09:45,041	00:09:47,000	| The War on Our Shore |	I mean, it's never, never been done.
EDL	00:09:47,000	00:09:48,416	| The War on Our Shore |	I mean, it's basically an
EDL	00:09:48,416	00:09:50,166	| The War on Our Shore |	intercontinental ballistic missile.
EDL	00:09:50,166	00:09:51,000	| The War on Our Shore |	So they're trying to figure
EDL	00:09:51,000	00:09:52,375	| The War on Our Shore |	out where it's coming from.
EDL	00:09:52,375	00:09:53,333	| The War on Our Shore |	They thought maybe they were being
EDL	00:09:53,333	00:09:54,666	| The War on Our Shore |	launched from submarines.
EDL	00:09:54,666	00:09:55,625	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:09:55,625	00:09:57,666	| The War on Our Shore |	Maybe they were coming from beaches in
EDL	00:09:57,666	00:09:59,625	| The War on Our Shore |	North America, from saboteurs.
EDL	00:09:59,625	00:09:59,958	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:09:59,958	00:10:01,541	| The War on Our Shore |	There was even speculation at one point
EDL	00:10:01,541	00:10:02,500	| The War on Our Shore |	that maybe they were coming
EDL	00:10:02,500	00:10:03,833	| The War on Our Shore |	from Japanese internment
EDL	00:10:03,833	00:10:05,625	| The War on Our Shore |	camps in North America.
EDL	00:10:05,625	00:10:05,833	| The War on Our Shore |	Ah.

EDL	00:10:07,125	00:10:07,416	| The War on Our Shore |	Then...

EDL	00:10:14,583	00:10:18,958	| The War on Our Shore |	And it has two sandbags still attached to

EDL	00:10:35,041	00:10:36,625	| The War on Our Shore |	What happened was the sand from the

EDL	00:21:37,416	00:21:39,000	| The War on Our Shore |	occasionally up there.
EDL	00:21:39,000	00:21:40,416	| The War on Our Shore |	They took their Sunday

EDL	00:21:42,458	00:21:43,291	| The War on Our Shore |	There were five children
EDL	00:21:43,291	00:21:44,708	| The War on Our Shore |	that went along on that trip.
EDL	00:21:44,708	00:21:46,875	| The War on Our Shore |	Ages 11 to 14.
EDL	00:21:46,875	00:21:47,916	| The War on Our Shore |	And one of the kids,
EDL	00:21:47,916	00:21:49,041	| The War on Our Shore |	we called him Dickie.
EDL	00:21:49,041	00:21:50,875	| The War on Our Shore |	He had a crush on my sister who was a
EDL	00:21:50,875	00:21:51,875	| The War on Our Shore |	little younger than me.
EDL	00:21:51,875	00:21:52,375	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:21:52,375	00:21:53,291	| The War on Our Shore |	And they wanted her
EDL	00:21:53,291	00:21:54,500	| The War on Our Shore |	to come on this picnic.
EDL	00:21:54,500	00:21:54,833	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:21:54,833	00:21:56,291	| The War on Our Shore |	So they came by and stopped.
EDL	00:21:56,291	00:21:58,583	| The War on Our Shore |	The pastor and his wife stopped trying to
EDL	00:21:58,583	00:21:59,583	| The War on Our Shore |	talk and convince my
EDL	00:21:59,583	00:22:01,041	| The War on Our Shore |	mom to let my sister go,
EDL	00:22:01,041	00:22:02,208	| The War on Our Shore |	or both of us, or whatever.

EDL	00:22:02,541	00:22:04,083	| The War on Our Shore |	But mom didn't want us to go because
EDL	00:22:04,083	00:22:05,666	| The War on Our Shore |	Saturday was our chore day.
EDL	00:22:05,666	00:22:06,250	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:22:06,250	00:22:08,833	| The War on Our Shore |	And my day to work the switchboard, which
EDL	00:22:08,833	00:22:10,208	| The War on Our Shore |	usually made me pretty
EDL	00:22:10,208	00:22:12,208	| The War on Our Shore |	angry, but that was my job.
EDL	00:22:12,208	00:22:12,958	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:22:12,958	00:22:15,666	| The War on Our Shore |	And she said, no, no way.
EDL	00:22:15,666	00:22:17,625	| The War on Our Shore |	Well, my sister didn't really want to go
EDL	00:22:17,625	00:22:20,291	| The War on Our Shore |	because she really wasn't encouraging
EDL	00:22:20,291	00:22:22,916	| The War on Our Shore |	this relationship too much.
EDL	00:22:22,916	00:22:23,958	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:22:23,958	00:22:24,875	| The War on Our Shore |	Dickie, yeah.

EDL	00:22:26,875	00:22:28,125	| The War on Our Shore |	So Archie and Elsie and the
EDL	00:22:28,125	00:22:29,625	| The War on Our Shore |	five kids get back into the car.
EDL	00:22:29,625	00:22:31,416	| The War on Our Shore |	And they drove up to Gearhart Mountain.
EDL	00:22:31,416	00:22:33,000	| The War on Our Shore |	A couple miles up a logging road, they
EDL	00:22:33,000	00:22:34,125	| The War on Our Shore |	pass some forest service
EDL	00:22:34,125	00:22:35,375	| The War on Our Shore |	guys working on the road.
EDL	00:22:35,375	00:22:36,916	| The War on Our Shore |	They go a little further to where the
EDL	00:22:36,916	00:22:38,416	| The War on Our Shore |	road comes near a creek.
EDL	00:22:38,416	00:22:39,791	| The War on Our Shore |	And Archie pulled the
EDL	00:22:39,791	00:22:41,333	| The War on Our Shore |	car around and parked.
EDL	00:22:41,333	00:22:41,750	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:22:41,750	00:22:43,958	| The War on Our Shore |	The kids jumped out of the car and
EDL	00:22:43,958	00:22:45,791	| The War on Our Shore |	started running down toward the creek.
EDL	00:22:45,791	00:22:47,041	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:22:47,041	00:22:49,916	| The War on Our Shore |	Elsie, who was pregnant, as I mentioned,
EDL	00:22:49,916	00:22:51,416	| The War on Our Shore |	and she was feeling a bit car sick,

EDL	00:22:52,125	00:22:54,333	| The War on Our Shore |	she jumped out to get some fresh air and
EDL	00:22:54,333	00:22:55,583	| The War on Our Shore |	to chase after the kids.
EDL	00:22:55,583	00:22:56,333	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:22:56,333	00:22:58,250	| The War on Our Shore |	While Archie went around to the trunk of

EDL	00:23:11,916	00:23:14,083	| The War on Our Shore |	balloon of some kind spread out on the

EDL	00:23:17,125	00:23:18,583	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:23:18,583	00:23:20,625	| The War on Our Shore |	The children and Elsie apparently
EDL	00:23:20,625	00:23:22,125	| The War on Our Shore |	gathered in a tight

EDL	00:23:24,083	00:23:25,500	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:23:25,500	00:23:27,625	| The War on Our Shore |	Archie later reported that while he was
EDL	00:23:27,625	00:23:28,375	| The War on Our Shore |	getting the picnic

EDL	00:23:39,583	00:23:42,041	| The War on Our Shore |	And at that moment, we'll never know

EDL	00:31:37,833	00:31:39,041	| The War on Our Shore |	Because they would have known, yeah.
EDL	00:31:39,041	00:31:41,416	| The War on Our Shore |	At the end of the war, the War Department
EDL	00:31:41,416	00:31:43,416	| The War on Our Shore |	destroyed all of the evidence.

EDL	00:32:04,958	00:32:07,625	| The War on Our Shore |	It's estimated by the War Department that

EDL	00:32:09,500	00:32:10,416	| The War on Our Shore |	they thought that maybe
EDL	00:32:10,416	00:32:14,125	| The War on Our Shore |	7 to 10 percent of the total would have
EDL	00:32:14,125	00:32:16,291	| The War on Our Shore |	survived the Transoceanic

EDL	00:32:18,125	00:32:18,708	| The War on Our Shore |	That's 900.

EDL	00:32:23,125	00:32:25,750	| The War on Our Shore |	So that means there are dozens, perhaps

EDL	00:56:45,666	00:56:49,791	| The War on Our Shore |	There was a connection between the German

EDL	00:56:54,000	00:56:56,083	| The War on Our Shore |	not only because of the

EDL	00:57:02,458	00:57:04,000	| The War on Our Shore |	David told us that he's looked at the

EDL	00:57:05,708	00:57:06,166	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:57:06,166	00:57:08,291	| The War on Our Shore |	the German laws against the Jews were
EDL	00:57:08,291	00:57:11,166	| The War on Our Shore |	essentially copied from
EDL	00:57:11,166	00:57:14,166	| The War on Our Shore |	the Mississippi black codes.
EDL	00:57:14,166	00:57:15,083	| The War on Our Shore |	We couldn't confirm that they were
EDL	00:57:15,083	00:57:16,333	| The War on Our Shore |	literally copied, but
EDL	00:57:16,333	00:57:17,916	| The War on Our Shore |	there are similarities
EDL	00:57:17,916	00:57:19,833	| The War on Our Shore |	and a bunch of official Nazi documents
EDL	00:57:19,833	00:57:20,541	| The War on Our Shore |	from that time

EDL	00:57:23,041	00:57:27,000	| The War on Our Shore |	So there was already a connection between

EDL	00:57:30,250	00:57:30,708	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:57:30,708	00:57:32,083	| The War on Our Shore |	This is the most horrifying thing I've

EDL	00:57:33,541	00:57:33,958	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:57:33,958	00:57:35,375	| The War on Our Shore |	I mean, is it really true that like all
EDL	00:57:35,375	00:57:36,833	| The War on Our Shore |	the niceness was just a
EDL	00:57:36,833	00:57:38,166	| The War on Our Shore |	perverse form of racism?
EDL	00:57:38,166	00:57:38,708	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:57:38,708	00:57:40,041	| The War on Our Shore |	Well, I would say racism plays an
EDL	00:57:40,041	00:57:41,291	| The War on Our Shore |	enormous role in why
EDL	00:57:41,291	00:57:42,916	| The War on Our Shore |	Japanese citizens were interned
EDL	00:57:42,916	00:57:44,041	| The War on Our Shore |	in the first place. I don't think there's
EDL	00:57:44,041	00:57:45,333	| The War on Our Shore |	any question about that.
EDL	00:57:45,333	00:57:46,291	| The War on Our Shore |	That's Paul Springer.
EDL	00:57:46,291	00:57:47,666	| The War on Our Shore |	He's a military historian.

EDL	00:57:48,000	00:57:49,708	| The War on Our Shore |	Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama.
EDL	00:57:49,708	00:57:50,583	| The War on Our Shore |	He's not quite sure that
EDL	00:57:50,583	00:57:51,875	| The War on Our Shore |	race explains all of this.
EDL	00:57:51,875	00:57:52,250	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:57:52,250	00:57:53,583	| The War on Our Shore |	He says, you know what, you've got to be
EDL	00:57:53,583	00:57:55,333	| The War on Our Shore |	careful because you're comparing
EDL	00:57:55,333	00:57:56,791	| The War on Our Shore |	treatment of citizens
EDL	00:57:56,791	00:57:57,125	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:57:57,125	00:57:58,291	| The War on Our Shore |	to treatment of prisoners
EDL	00:57:58,291	00:58:00,041	| The War on Our Shore |	of war. And that's different.
EDL	00:58:00,041	00:58:02,000	| The War on Our Shore |	It's not a fair comparison for the case
EDL	00:58:02,000	00:58:04,375	| The War on Our Shore |	of why you treat the German POWs better.
EDL	00:58:04,375	00:58:05,416	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:58:05,416	00:58:07,500	| The War on Our Shore |	Well, because they're prisoners of war,
EDL	00:58:07,500	00:58:08,791	| The War on Our Shore |	the Japanese POWs were
EDL	00:58:08,791	00:58:10,541	| The War on Our Shore |	also exceedingly well treated.
EDL	00:58:10,541	00:58:12,000	| The War on Our Shore |	They were treated much better than the
EDL	00:58:12,000	00:58:14,250	| The War on Our Shore |	Japanese citizens of the United States.
EDL	00:58:14,250	00:58:16,416	| The War on Our Shore |	And I think that's the comparison. That's
EDL	00:58:16,416	00:58:17,000	| The War on Our Shore |	probably more
EDL	00:58:17,000	00:58:18,625	| The War on Our Shore |	interesting is why did you treat
EDL	00:58:18,625	00:58:19,125	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:58:19,125	00:58:22,041	| The War on Our Shore |	enemy soldiers from Japan better than you
EDL	00:58:22,041	00:58:23,625	| The War on Our Shore |	treated citizens of the
EDL	00:58:23,625	00:58:25,625	| The War on Our Shore |	United States of Japanese heritage?
EDL	00:58:25,625	00:58:26,750	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:58:26,750	00:58:28,833	| The War on Our Shore |	And he says very simply that with
EDL	00:58:28,833	00:58:30,833	| The War on Our Shore |	prisoners of war, it's
EDL	00:58:30,833	00:58:32,125	| The War on Our Shore |	because we had a rule.
EDL	00:58:32,125	00:58:33,666	| The War on Our Shore |	Governing international law.
EDL	00:58:33,666	00:58:34,958	| The War on Our Shore |	Like the Geneva Conventions.
EDL	00:58:34,958	00:58:35,291	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:58:35,291	00:58:38,375	| The War on Our Shore |	There's no similar law at that time that
EDL	00:58:38,375	00:58:39,375	| The War on Our Shore |	says what you can and
EDL	00:58:39,375	00:58:40,958	| The War on Our Shore |	can't do towards your civilian
EDL	00:58:40,958	00:58:41,708	| The War on Our Shore |	populations.

EDL	00:58:42,416	00:58:43,875	| The War on Our Shore |	That's interesting. So it's like maybe
EDL	00:58:43,875	00:58:45,541	| The War on Our Shore |	we're not racist or noble,
EDL	00:58:45,541	00:58:48,083	| The War on Our Shore |	but both. And it's the rules
EDL	00:58:48,083	00:58:49,916	| The War on Our Shore |	that allow us to be our better selves.
EDL	00:58:49,916	00:58:51,500	| The War on Our Shore |	I mean, here's what I take from this.
EDL	00:58:51,500	00:58:52,833	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	00:58:52,833	00:58:55,041	| The War on Our Shore |	I think that in a time of war, it's
EDL	00:58:55,041	00:58:56,541	| The War on Our Shore |	incredibly difficult to
EDL	00:58:56,541	00:58:58,000	| The War on Our Shore |	be good to your enemy.

EDL	00:59:02,083	00:59:05,916	| The War on Our Shore |	It's about having 97 really nit picky,

EDL	01:00:37,541	01:00:39,500	| The War on Our Shore |	The concern the debate here was about, if
EDL	01:00:39,500	01:00:40,875	| The War on Our Shore |	you don't do it here,
EDL	01:00:40,875	01:00:41,250	| The War on Our Shore |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	01:00:41,250	01:00:42,083	| The War on Our Shore |	then U.S. soldiers
EDL	01:00:42,083	01:00:43,500	| The War on Our Shore |	could be mistreated abroad.
EDL	01:00:43,500	01:00:44,166	| The War on Our Shore |	Isn't that correct?
EDL	01:00:44,166	01:00:46,916	| The War on Our Shore |	And so, isn't that a big motivation here
EDL	01:00:46,916	01:00:49,166	| The War on Our Shore |	to make sure that U.S. soldiers get the
EDL	01:00:49,166	01:00:50,208	| The War on Our Shore |	same kind of treatment?
EDL	01:00:50,208	01:00:52,375	| The War on Our Shore |	It's important for all nations throughout
EDL	01:00:52,375	01:00:54,708	| The War on Our Shore |	the world to treat any prisoners well.

EDL	01:00:55,500	01:00:56,791	| The War on Our Shore |	And that is something the United States
EDL	01:00:56,791	01:00:58,333	| The War on Our Shore |	always expects, and the
EDL	01:00:58,333	01:00:59,208	| The War on Our Shore |	United States always does.
EDL	01:00:59,208	01:01:00,458	| The War on Our Shore |	We have time for one more question, and
EDL	01:01:00,458	01:01:01,125	| The War on Our Shore |	then there's a pullback.

EDL	01:01:08,291	01:01:10,041	| The War on Our Shore |	Wasn't this an important concern?

EDL	01:01:10,416	01:01:11,958	| The War on Our Shore |	I understand what the expectations are,

EDL	01:01:12,291	01:01:13,541	| The War on Our Shore |	but it was important for this
EDL	01:01:13,541	01:01:14,583	| The War on Our Shore |	administration to be able
EDL	01:01:14,583	01:01:16,208	| The War on Our Shore |	to say, "Look, we want to be able to
EDL	01:01:16,208	01:01:17,416	| The War on Our Shore |	protect our soldiers in similar

EDL	01:01:19,791	01:01:23,583	| The War on Our Shore |	and if we don't afford privileges under

EDL	01:01:24,625	01:01:26,000	| The War on Our Shore |	our soldiers would be in peril."
EDL	01:01:26,000	01:01:27,833	| The War on Our Shore |	David, I was not in the NSC deliberations
EDL	01:01:27,833	01:01:29,833	| The War on Our Shore |	where various issues were raised,
EDL	01:01:29,833	01:01:31,291	| The War on Our Shore |	and so really there's no way I can
