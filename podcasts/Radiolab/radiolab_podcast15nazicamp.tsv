EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:39,744	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Junior High
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:42,304	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	No this was not talked about
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:44,608	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	We just don't talk about it we just don't
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:46,144	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	I think we don't
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:47,680	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	I don't know
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:50,752	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	But today we are going to talk about it
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:54,080	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And not just physical historical thing but because
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:03:00,480	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Raises a question breaking news this Nunes stunning report looking into how the CIA interrogated detainees
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:03,296	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Question that you know
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:06,112	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	With the torture reports
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:13,280	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Abu ghraib Guantanamo Bay
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:19,680	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Today which is when you capture Navy Soldier taken out of the battle out of the fight how should you treat
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:26,080	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	That person and it's both sides agreed to follow certain rules and one side doesn't
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:26,848	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	What do you do
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:30,688	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	An interesting thing was it 70 years ago this question was playing out in this
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:32,480	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Really dramatic way in
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:34,272	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	In all of these towns across America
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:37,856	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	There were about 200 basecamps that were huge they were like
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:38,624	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	To 8000
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:43,744	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And by the way that's like seventy times the size of Guantanamo Bay currently
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,024	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Case
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:48,608	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	That she was researching Karen sword to zoom into one camp in particular
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:51,424	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	So this is really a Lester tivid what happened
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:54,240	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	There's this one camp in Aliceville Alabama
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:58,592	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	It's a Tiny Town of like 1500
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:00,128	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	But the camp has
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:01,152	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Thousand
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:03,968	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	I was like four times the size of the town
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:04,736	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Yeah
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:07,808	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	So I went and interviewed a bunch of people guards prisoners locals
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:09,856	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	From Aliceville and
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:10,880	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	It was quite a day
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:13,952	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	That's Thomas sweet he worked in Ellisville
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:20,351	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Any told me that the day that the prisoners came to a thousand of them came at first and the police were like nobody is allowed on the
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:23,167	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	But of course one word got out that the first
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:24,959	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Try and load was coming
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:32,895	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Everybody rushed out on the street today the train come in there wasn't supposed to be any townspeople
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:34,431	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	But the course that was
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:40,831	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Everybody was saying his from 3 years old people
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:42,111	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	70 years old
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:46,463	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	So these voices are from an oral history project that was recorded in 1994 about the
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:47,487	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The prison camp analysis
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:50,047	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	So we all kinda Lumbertown
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:51,071	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	So that we could
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:55,167	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Liam when they got off the train everybody super nervous
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:59,519	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Debbie's images in their head
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:04,639	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Just like a lot of people that was really didn't know what kind of devils was going to get off that train
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:07,455	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Guys with horns on their head
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:10,015	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	So these prisoners that were sent to Aliceville were actually part of
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:14,367	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Rommel's Afrika Corps in these guys were the most feared of Hitler
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:19,231	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Fighters that were supposed to be the elite
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:21,279	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Superman right so if the train pulled up
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:27,167	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	They stopped right on the main Highway doors open
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:30,751	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Hundreds and hundreds of German soldiers get out
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:32,031	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And they were marching
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:35,871	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	German March
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:42,271	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And they're singing their military songs in German
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:48,671	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Tell us about forty.
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:50,463	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	What you thought when I got off the
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:56,095	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	What did they look like when you listen to the oral histories
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:06:02,239	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Really clear that this was a really complicated moment for the people in Aliceville Mayfield owls for Westgate
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:08,127	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	I didn't know what I was going to be mad at him when they first come in or what but when I seen it it was just a bunch of
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:12,223	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Cryptkins fan with a ceiling off
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:15,551	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	A concern
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:19,647	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	In our hearts for them
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:20,927	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Hey young lady

EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:45,503	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	I've been drafted into the Army against his will and captured in North Africa and then he was sent to America in the
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:46,271	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The bottom of the sea
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:48,831	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Big cargo ship runs in one room
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:50,879	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Clouded 700

EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:09,823	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	But on the other hand and you hear this too in the oral histories
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:12,895	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The people in Aliceville are thinking these are Nazis
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:16,991	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	These are the men who are killing our son will you know I had three brothers
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:18,783	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	I will cease at the same time
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:20,319	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	So
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:21,343	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	We didn't like
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,647	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	That's just the way we felt
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:29,279	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	They said there's that question in people's mind in this is playing out all across the country
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:31,839	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Here's the enemy at your mercy

EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:39,775	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	You can do whatever you want with them at that point in theory
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:41,055	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	In practice
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:43,871	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Will actually this was a significant moment
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:49,759	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	For the world I mean 14 years before a bunch of countries have gotten together and they'd made-up rules
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:51,295	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	For exactly this kind of moment
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:53,855	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	1929 at Geneva
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:57,951	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Long before Hitler and his Partners began to lie the real estate of the world
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:59,487	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	That was an International Conference
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:05,119	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Erin Nations solemnly promise to uphold the rules governing the treatment of prisoners of War
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,911	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	So it was a series of
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:08,191	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Do's and don'ts
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:12,799	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	That's a story in Arnold Kramer he's a professor at 6
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:16,127	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And then some of the rules he says they're pretty basic
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:18,175	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Women and children should be protected
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:24,575	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	She had to give prisoners a certain amount of food
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:30,975	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And then there's rules about medical attention labor
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:37,375	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Can use people for labor Kathy Kirkpatrick again you also should be paying people for labor
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:42,751	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Payment was $0.80 a day the Geneva conventions are this attempt to kind of
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:46,591	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Civilize the most uncivilized thing which is war
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:48,895	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The first world war was so horrific
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:53,503	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Hundreds of thousands of prisoners died in p o w Camp there were no real regulation
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:55,039	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	With regard to prisoners
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:57,343	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Besides did almost anything you want
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:09:01,695	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	So the Geneva conventions of 1929 was an attempt to kind of set things right
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:03,231	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Because people just
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:05,023	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Couldn't fathom
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:05,791	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Another
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:06,559	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	War 2 end
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:09,119	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	We were well-trained and
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:10,655	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The Geneva Convention
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:14,751	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Best Thomas sweet again he was actually one of the guards at Camp Aliceville
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:16,031	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And what she said is that
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:22,431	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Even before the pows arrived at the Geneva conventions were drilled into their heads they had lectures the rules were
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:23,967	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Posted in the Rec Hall and
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:29,343	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Officers Club where you had to the prisoners had to be treated the same
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:30,879	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	As you would
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:33,439	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Your own fellow soldiers
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,719	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Which sounds kind of basic
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:38,815	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	But for somebody like Han to Stepping off this train and wondering how
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:39,327	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Is he going to be treated
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:43,167	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	I should say it was
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:46,239	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	A sort of
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:47,775	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Heaven
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:52,383	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	When I got into the

EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:04,159	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Styles and shaving equipment for each one on each other each one's bunk
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:08,767	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The prisoners washed up and then the guards opened up the cafeteria
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:13,631	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Then we got to eat good things this is water filter he's another prisoner at Alice

EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:33,599	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And I think on which times and I think on peanut butter
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:37,183	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Here's the funny thing
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:38,719	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Did you look into this
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:42,559	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	You start to realize that we're not just following the Geneva conventions
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:44,351	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The letter of the law we're going up
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:44,863	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Above and beyond
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:47,167	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And according to Hans
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:52,287	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	What started out as a great thing getting all this food ended up to be kind of a
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:55,359	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Problem The Voice came to me everyday
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:59,711	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Please tell him we don't want to have so much ham

EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,279	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	So
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:14,303	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	They buried the hatchet
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:17,119	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And and a lot of it
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:19,423	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	That is a lot of the him
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:21,215	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Because we didn't know what to do with it
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:26,079	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	They also didn't like corn but they kept getting corn and so they bury corn
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:30,943	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And then they get caught because corn starts growing
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:34,527	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Everyone's like wait a minute bad corn hiding

EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:44,735	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Maybe it was the moment that I
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:47,807	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Kids started reading back
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:48,575	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Do you
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:50,879	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:54,975	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:59,839	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework

EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:11,519	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Quite a few men who might be able to do some work here

EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:18,687	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	So some of the farmers would bring them in the house for lunch they would drink with them there were drunk
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:25,087	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	There's some really funny stories of like probably moonshine the prisoners getting drunk with the fire
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:28,159	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Farmers and then they get in trouble cuz they come home late
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:34,559	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	One of the biggest things at the war department says when they start sending the men out is like if you if you make friends with these pows hits
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:35,071	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Against the rules
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:36,351	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	They do it
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:38,655	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	All the time anybody fall in love with anybody
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:39,167	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:44,031	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	I mean not a lot but it definitely happen
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:48,639	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Suit as these prisoners are out in the community and their forming friendships
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:51,455	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	A few of them are falling in love where it starts to get out about
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:56,575	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	How they're being treated and meanwhile Across America there's rationing
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:57,855	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	That's when they learned that the
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:17:00,671	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Pows are getting food that they might not be getting
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:01,951	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	A lot of the American public
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:02,975	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Bigot
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:10,399	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Especially this radio guy Walter Winchell
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:16,799	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	They calling The Rush Limbaugh of World War II
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:23,199	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Supporters in America
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:29,599	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Spokane is funny nasal but that's exactly what it sounds like
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:35,487	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Find out about the Nazi pure W program Walter Winchell just starts to rant about it
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:41,631	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Radio
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:51,359	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And he would do this week after week
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:57,759	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Start writing articles in the New York Times
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:18:01,599	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Tribune the Boston Globe citizen start flooding the war department of letters
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:04,671	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	I know that y'all YMCA War prisoners Aid
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:11,071	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Does all the time in the meantime according to Thomas sweet
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:12,351	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Inside the camp some of these
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:13,631	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Prisoners are
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:14,911	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Starting to get kind of Bolt
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:17,727	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	For couple night side cutouts wall stickers
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:20,543	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Took the title
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:26,431	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Flying the Kite had to swap stickers in the box underneath the kite
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:28,991	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	With a string that down to the ground
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:32,063	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And they handed the string to one of the
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:33,855	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	One of the guards and said
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:36,159	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Turles Dragon when they pull the string
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:40,255	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The Trappe door open on
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:41,535	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The gadget that made
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:42,559	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And always
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:43,839	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Swastika
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:49,727	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Over the camping in Aliceville to in the townspeople
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:51,263	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Started calling the base
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:53,311	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Mad about that
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:54,591	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	How to that
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:19:00,991	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	We don't have enough men to guard a lot of these camps so so the prisoners are starting to get more and more control of the camp
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:02,783	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Presidents heads around as a cat
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:07,391	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And some cases the Nazi hardliners would would starts at torment and now I'm not
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:09,183	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Threaten them they might be
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:10,719	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Beat them up there were even
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:14,303	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	A couple of murders was not a Nazi inside of you
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:20,191	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	I'm if you would had been drafted but you didn't you weren't Idol
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:22,751	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	So the perception is coming out of these camps
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:26,847	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Is that we created these hotels on American soil where Nazis
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:30,175	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Could start radicalizing and people get so mad
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:34,783	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	That there's actually a congressional investigation into the coddling of prisoners of War
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:43,487	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	So I spend a lot of time at the National Archives trying to get to like all right what are the arguments and and here's kind of how it was
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:44,255	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	But you have this
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:50,399	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Congressman on one side Richard Harless and he saying you're cuddling them
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:54,751	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And on the other side you have
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:20:00,895	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The guy who's now running the prisoner-of-war program Archer alert and he's basically saying no
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:07,807	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Jesus we're just following the Geneva conventions and the reason that he gave was the same reason that Joe Biden would give almost
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:09,087	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	60 years later
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:10,879	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	There's a reason why we sign these treaties
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:12,671	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	To protect
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:14,975	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	My son in the military
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:20,607	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	We are torturing them they'll touch that's why we have these trees
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:22,655	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	So when Americans
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:23,679	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Our capture
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:25,727	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	They are
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:26,495	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Not
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:27,007	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Torture
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:28,287	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	That's the reason
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:30,079	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Case anybody forgets it
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:31,615	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	At 3
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:33,663	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	One problem though
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:35,967	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Just one month
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:40,831	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	After that hearing in 1944
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:42,623	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Sound of a machine gun
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:48,255	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	News breaks that 84 American soldiers prisoners of War now in Germany are gunned down
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:49,791	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	After they surrendered
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:51,839	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Later that frozen body
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:53,631	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And the mangoes found
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:21:00,287	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Found what I felt then go on to liberate American soldiers from pewww camps in Germany and refine
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:03,103	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Nothing like Allah

EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:26,400	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	By the one side of Geneva Convention rules and if you
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:26,912	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	2 months later
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:29,472	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Things get even worse
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:33,824	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	It was impossible to fully realize the horror of a Nazi concentration camps
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:35,872	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	We start going into concentration camps
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:44,576	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Germans have done what the Nazis have done
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:49,696	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Call sense of dead bodies were piled everywhere. Never having received
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:52,768	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The Living Dead
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:20,672	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The Congress decides to hold a second investigation into the treatment of prisoners
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:22,464	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	But this time it's
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:23,232	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Real
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:29,632	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Soul searching I mean we just seen the full horrors of the Holocaust were thinking you know anything we do to these guys
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:31,168	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Guys at this point they deserve
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:33,984	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	We've also realized we're not really getting rest
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:35,520	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Prosody the we don't really have
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:38,080	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Medical reason to treat them well anymore
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:44,992	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	So at this point the question has really become do we continue to be good
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:47,552	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Even when we're not getting anything in return
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:52,928	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The kind of amazing thing to me is that we decide yeah
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:56,000	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	We're going to stick to the Geneva conventions
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:23:00,864	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Archer alert to Runza pow program at this point he gets up and he says
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:07,264	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	We are not going to lower ourselves to Nazi standards we are not going to let the enemy decide Who We Are
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:08,032	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Another country
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:10,336	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And that argument stock
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:11,616	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Yeah
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:14,176	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	I think that most people associated with the prison camp
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:19,040	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Experience in Arnold Kramer against treated them well not because
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:21,088	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	They treated her as well
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:24,416	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	But that we are decent people and we probably would have done this anyway
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:25,696	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	What makes an American
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:28,000	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	It's not any special pressure sort of blood
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:30,048	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	But the tradition we have inherited
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:31,840	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	It's tradition
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:32,864	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Rokblok
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:35,168	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The problem with the way we think
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:35,680	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	I'm acting
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:41,056	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	There's a great belief
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:45,152	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	That we have a special mission
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:46,688	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	I am we have a special
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:47,200	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	History
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:51,040	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	This is David Goldfield he's a historian at UNC Charlotte
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:52,064	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Now that's the
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:52,576	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Baidu
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:55,136	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	But
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:55,648	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	No
EDL	00:23:56,672	00:23:58,464	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	I mean don't you only have to look
EDL	00:23:58,464	00:24:03,328	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	At the treatment of Japanese-Americans during World War II
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:05,120	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	It says don't forget
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:09,216	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Right as we're giving the Nazis massive amounts of ham were also rounding up
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:10,240	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Tens of thousands of
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:11,520	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Japanese American citizen
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:12,544	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Citizen
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:14,848	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And we're throwing them into these
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:15,872	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Cramps camp
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:17,920	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	That are way worse in Aliceville
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:21,760	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And if you ask David why are we treating the Germans so much better
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:22,784	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	They look like
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:26,368	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	These people look all right
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:27,648	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	A mailman
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:29,184	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The farmer
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:31,744	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	All look pretty much like a back home
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:33,024	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The major reason
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:34,304	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Race
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:36,096	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The Germans were white
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:38,144	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	They seemed familiar
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:39,424	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	But there was
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:40,192	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	A connection
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:43,776	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Between the German pows
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:46,336	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And the folks in the American South
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:48,128	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Not only because of
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:49,920	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The ethnicity of
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:50,432	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The Germans
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:54,272	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Not only because of their economic benefit
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:54,784	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	To the region
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:56,832	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	David told us that he's looking

EDL	00:24:58,112	00:24:58,624	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Thanks
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:00,160	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The German laws
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:02,208	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Eventually

EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:04,512	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	From

EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:06,816	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Black Codes
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:08,096	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	We couldn't confirm that they were
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:08,608	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Literally copy
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:09,888	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	But there are
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:10,656	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	There are similarities
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:11,680	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	A bunch of a fish
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:13,472	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	In that time
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:15,008	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Praise Southern Raceway
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:16,288	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	So
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:18,080	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	There was already
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:18,592	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Connection
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:21,408	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Between the American South
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:22,944	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And that's a German
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:24,992	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	This is the most horrifying thing ever
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:31,392	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Is it really true that like all the niceness was just a perverse form of racism
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:37,792	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Well I would say racism plays an enormous role in why Japanese citizens were interned in the first place I don't think there's any question about
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:44,192	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	That's Paul Springer he's a military historian Maxwell Air Force Base Alabama
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:44,704	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	All of this
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:48,544	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	He doesn't know what you got to be careful because you're comparing
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:50,080	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Treatment of citizens
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:51,872	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The treatment of prisoners of War
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:54,176	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And that's different that's not a fair comparison
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:25:57,504	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	For the case of of why you treat the German pows better
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:26:00,320	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Well because the prisoners of War
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:03,392	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Japanese pows were also exceedingly well treated
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:08,512	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	They were treated much better than the Japanese citizens of the United States and I think that's the comparison
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:11,840	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	That's probably more interesting is why did you treat
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:13,632	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Enemy soldiers from Japan
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:15,168	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Better than you treated
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:17,984	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Citizens of the United States of Japan
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:18,496	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Heritage
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:22,592	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And he says very simply that with prisoners of War
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:26,688	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	It's because we had a rule governing international law
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:27,968	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Like the Geneva Convention
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:29,760	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	There's no similar law
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:34,368	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	At that time that says what you can and can't do towards your civilian population
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:38,720	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	It's like maybe we're not racist or Noble
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:39,232	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	But both
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:44,096	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And it's the rules that allow us to be our better selves
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:52,032	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	I think that in a time of War it's incredibly difficult to be good to your enemy it's not Justa
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:56,128	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	About aspiring to be good this American ideal it's about having
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:57,664	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	97
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:27:02,528	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Really nitpicky tiny tedious rules to tell you exactly what you can do
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:04,576	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And what you can't do
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:05,856	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Because it would just be
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:08,928	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	So easy to not be the person that you
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:09,696	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Want to be
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:10,976	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	In that moment
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:16,096	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Just going to make you think back to February of 2002
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:18,400	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Good afternoon
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:20,192	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	I have an announcement to make
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:23,264	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	President Bush today has decided that
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:24,032	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	At the Geneva Convention
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:25,568	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Will apply to the
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:27,104	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The Taliban detainees
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:28,384	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	But not
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:30,176	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The Arcada International terrorist
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:34,272	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The president has maintained the United States commitment to the
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:35,040	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The principles of the
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:35,808	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Geneva Convention
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:37,344	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	I'll recognize him
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:39,392	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Vention Sibley does not cover
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:41,952	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Every situation in which people may be captured
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:43,488	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Detained by military forces
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:46,048	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	As we see in Afghanistan today
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:52,704	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Prisoners
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:55,520	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Will not get any more protection than they already
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:59,616	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Are given under the Geneva Convention what you seem to be telling us is that the
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:00,896	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Detainees will get fewer
EDL	00:28:01,408	00:28:03,968	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Nope there's no change in the protections they will be
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:04,480	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Provided
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:05,760	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	There
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:08,832	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	They've always been treated consistent with the principles
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:09,856	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Geneva Convention
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:10,880	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Which means I'll be treated well
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:13,440	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	If you're looking for anything that will not happen.
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:16,000	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	As a result of this announcement is that they will not receive stipend
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:16,768	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	American taxpayer
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:18,816	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	They will not receive musical instrument
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:20,864	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Courtesy of the United States military
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:23,936	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	They would have received those had they been declared pows
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:27,264	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	They will continue to be treated well
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:28,544	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Because they're in the custody of America
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:33,920	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	That's the concern the debate here was about if you don't do it here
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:35,200	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	The US soldiers
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:37,760	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	To be mistreated abroad is not correct and so is not a big
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:40,064	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	A big motivation here
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:44,416	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Did the u.s. soldiers get the same kind of treatment is important for all nations
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:45,952	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Route the world
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:47,232	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Treat any prisoners
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:48,256	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Well
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:50,304	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And that is something nice as always expect
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:54,144	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And United States always.
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:56,192	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Lakota
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:57,472	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	David
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:28:59,520	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	David will get one more
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:00,032	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And then look around
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:05,152	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Wasn't this an important concern
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:07,200	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	It was important for this Administration
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:10,528	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	To be able to say look we want to protect our soldiers
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:11,296	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Equations
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:12,064	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Down the line
EDL	00:29:12,576	00:29:14,112	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	And if we if we don't Accord
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:15,904	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	If you don't work.
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:18,720	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Phillies out of the Geneva Convention in Arkansas to be in peril
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:21,792	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	I was not in the NFC deliberations were various
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:25,120	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Issues were raised inside really just no way I can actually answer that question
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:34,592	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Horses they don't they often do not wear uniforms they often do not carry their weapons out really if they're captured
EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:39,200	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	If they wouldn't be convention apply to all and those turn speaker themselves
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:39,968	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Okay thank you
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:02,240	| radiolab_podcast15nazicamp |	Thank you
