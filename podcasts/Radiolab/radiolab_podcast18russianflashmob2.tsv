EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:02,272	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Small town near kha'zix
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:05,856	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And he said from an early age it was clear that he
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:07,648	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Just really didn't fit in up there
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:12,768	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Blue hair for a Time dressed like a goth
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:19,168	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	To be this kind of alternative character in Siberia is not an easy
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:20,448	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Anything let me know
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:24,544	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Which of these stories about walking down the street

EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:38,880	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	When he gets a chance to to get out he does he moves to st. Petersburg considered one of the most liberal cities in Russia
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:42,464	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And he moved they're not looking for just any job but
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:43,232	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Specifically
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:44,512	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	To be a journalist
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:48,608	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	He really felt was his calling
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:52,704	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Superheroes that refers to journalist as like supercar
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:53,728	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Batman
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:57,056	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	If we had the same Petersburg and he
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:03:58,592	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Thinks he's all set up he's got
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:00,640	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	A job with a local website
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:02,432	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Editing for them
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:02,944	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Writing
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:04,992	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	But right away with Within
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:09,088	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Short order I believe the story is their business dried up and so did the newspaper in
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:10,368	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And suddenly it Batali's out of
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:12,672	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	What's next
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:14,976	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And so it's kind of a crisis moment
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:17,536	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Muscle shirtless
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:21,631	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	He starts looking around and he's
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:28,031	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	As he describes he gets up every day start sending out all these resumes
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:32,383	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Doing searches 2-speed find anybody to do anything that would let him
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:35,711	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Use his writing skills just trying to find something to do with text
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:38,015	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Until finally after almost a month of this
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:40,063	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	He comes across this one ad
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:40,575	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	That's
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:43,391	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	It's not really clear what their offering or
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:46,719	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Who's offering it but it mentions that there's some
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:48,767	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Copy editing to be done some writing
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:50,303	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:57,215	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	The pay scale seems a lot higher its if they're promising double the money is at the most people are offered for
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:58,751	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	The working in journalism in Russia
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:00,031	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And then right away he just stopped
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:02,079	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Weird but
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:02,847	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Of course he's in
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:05,151	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	I'm how could he not be in so he
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:06,175	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Places to call
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:08,223	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Now it's worth noting everything that
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:11,551	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Is about to happen vitally we weren't able to fact-check 100
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:15,391	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	But that being said it does lineup squarely with
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:16,415	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	What others have
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:17,183	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Reported
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:18,207	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Anyway
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:22,303	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Fast forward a couple days he ends up having the interview and they offer him the job
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:23,327	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	I would she accept
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:24,863	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Or the whale
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:27,423	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Still not really knowing
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:29,471	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	What the heck it is he will be doing
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:30,239	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Exactly
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:31,519	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	It's just not really clear what
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:32,031	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	What it is
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:34,591	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Okay so tell me about that first day like
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:39,967	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Popeyes
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:42,015	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Entering into the foyer of the building
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:42,783	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	The entrance
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:46,623	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	The building itself is cement for story
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:50,207	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Tall and the security is is oddly strip
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:54,303	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Like when he went up to them they required him to hand over a bunch of document
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:55,071	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	It's like his
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:55,839	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Passport
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:57,887	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Just to get in that's his first term
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:06:04,543	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Mythical man and his boss shows up this woman named Anna she walks
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:05,567	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Halsey
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:08,127	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	He said the whole place had like the feel of a hospice
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:12,223	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Long corridors with little rooms
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:13,247	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Left and right
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:14,527	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	People behind
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:16,319	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Keyboards working at computers
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:17,855	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And it's almost completely silent
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:22,975	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Except for the tapping of fingers on
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:23,487	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Keys
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:28,351	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Anyway eventually they they duck into a room on a shows his desk
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:29,631	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	This
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:32,191	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Is finally when you get two cents
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:33,983	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Of what exactly is going on
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:38,079	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Anna sitting down says we're doing news about Ukraine
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:40,895	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	We just want you to write articles
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:43,967	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	20 articles a day you had to do sort of massage the text
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:46,783	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	4 but the thing is he didn't have to be brand new Arctic
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:51,647	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	But instead he was told since we take this article it's already been written
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:52,671	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Somebody else's article
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:53,951	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:57,023	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Or add to it and then change the contents of 70% original
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:07:01,375	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	So what's important to know here is this was 2014
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:07,519	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And complain with in the early days of War
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:09,055	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	The apocalyptic
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:15,199	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Scene in central Kiev tonight's morning Kiev again I woke to the sound of gunfire
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:19,807	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	A civil war that Russia wanted to influence the outcome
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:22,111	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And to do so
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:25,695	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	They started experimenting with his new form of propaganda
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:27,487	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	That's right
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:31,583	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	What you saw was this Keno campaign it was going on two fronts
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:37,983	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	When on the one hand you had State media influencer program intermediate here broadcast from Russia
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:39,007	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Ukraine
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:40,543	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Spinning the narrative for those watching
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:41,311	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	But
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:43,359	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Then you have a certain amount of the population that
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:44,383	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Rastas in watch Dayton
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:47,455	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And this is where you get into this effort

EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:02,303	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	They told him to
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:04,095	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Take an article that was
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:09,471	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	About Ukraine for example according to Vitaly there was an incident in which a group of
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:15,103	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Pro-russian Rebels had taken over a school in Ukraine essentially holding the kids hostage
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:19,455	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	When the pro Ukrainian soldiers when they when they stormed the school
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:20,991	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Children die
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:27,391	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	This actually happened and was covered by
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:28,927	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Vibe Ukrainian media
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:30,719	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	But
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:32,255	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Arnavut Ali's boss
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:38,655	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Says your goal is to take this real news story and rewrite it leaving out the fact that there were

EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:41,215	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Pro Russian troops there
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:47,615	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Treating the impression that the pro Ukrainian troops had stormed the school in Massacre these children for
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:48,895	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	No reason at all

EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:10,559	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Important moment where he's trying to decide what to do
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:12,351	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	He says himself that he had cut
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:13,375	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	2 thoughts which is

EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:23,359	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And it gets this idea that you know it
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:25,663	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Maybe I've got a scoop here maybe I can do in bed
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:27,711	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Navigation he sort of assign themselves
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:29,759	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	To become an undercover agent
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:31,039	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Exactly
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:36,415	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Okay just to to zoom out here for a second
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:42,559	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	The job that Vitaly had taken was with an organization known as the internet
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:51,263	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Shadowy Russian organization Shreveport so much about in the past 72 hours
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:54,335	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Private company established in 2013
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:11:00,735	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Buy a Putin Ally name
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:07,135	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Along with being the bearer of a rather strange nickname of President Vladimir Putin
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:13,535	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Also one of the Russian Nationals mentioned in the Mueller indictment in the early days when Vitaly was working there
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:17,631	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	It was his impression that there were roughly a couple hundred people working
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:20,959	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	At the internet research agency but at its peak
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:27,103	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Organization grew to a to employ as many as a thousand people for the annual budget of millions of dollars
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:29,151	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Headed by a Management Group
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:32,735	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And arranged into departments including graphics
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:35,039	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Search engine optimization
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:37,599	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Information technology and finance
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:42,207	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Now as the Polly told us it was hard to know exactly what
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:43,487	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Happened in this place
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:49,119	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Because everyone was so silent but over his time there he was able to make sense of some of it
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:51,935	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	The first floor was filled with people just like Vitaly
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:53,215	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Writing fake articles
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:53,983	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Fake sites
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:59,615	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Second floor was known as the social media department and the folks were responsible for pumping out knee
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:04,991	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Like Hillary Clinton is shaking hands with the devil people writing fake
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:07,295	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	The same blog that the tollywood pull quotes from

EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:36,223	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Lost quite a few people from other towns of Russia that moved to St Petersburg
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:38,527	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	They were some people he said we're frankly you know
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:40,319	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Activists in the opposition
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:41,599	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Are there alot of people there
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:42,111	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	You know like
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:45,439	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	You know they check in the checkout for work they just punch the clock
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:48,767	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And yeah for them it was just like mopping a floor
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:49,535	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Where are you know
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:51,839	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Are taking out the trash did you feel some guilt
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:53,119	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Or
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:55,167	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Misgivings about what you were doing
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:13:02,079	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	What about really stressed out
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:05,151	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Miss her. She was
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:07,455	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	You know on the one hand I suppose he's Gathering good
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:08,223	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Material for
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:10,527	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	What will hopefully be some
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,807	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Grand expose
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:12,575	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Alright
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:15,647	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	The other hand he just felt like he was just living this lie
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:17,695	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Eventually after three and a half months
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:18,463	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Vitaly did quit
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:20,255	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And if he tells it
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:21,279	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	He had enough
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:24,351	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And just didn't feel like he could learn anything else
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:26,911	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And so with his months of research
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:31,775	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	He went on to write an article in Russia that really didn't make a splash at all
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:35,103	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	In part because the internet research agency was
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:37,919	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Already a pretty well-known organization in Russia at the
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:38,687	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	That time
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:41,503	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Essentially other journalists had just beaten him to the punch
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:43,039	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	But then
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:54,303	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	In the wake of the 2016 election with accusations of Russian meddling beginning to swirl
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:56,863	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Inside russian disinformation campaign
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:14:01,215	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	From twenty-six-year-old Vitaly best for the American Media took notice and
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:02,751	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Vitaly got a call from NBC
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:05,567	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	This is the building
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:07,359	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Yes yes yes

EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:16,831	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Fake accounts
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:19,391	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Yes he says
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:22,463	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Do you believe that this operation was backed by the Kremlin
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:26,815	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	He said
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:28,095	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Still up and running
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:29,887	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	The Kremlin denies it
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:32,447	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Suggesting reports the factory even existed
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:33,727	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	My feet face
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:36,287	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	NBC NBC The Bully
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:41,407	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And from that moment on he really became the go-to guy if you wanted to
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:43,455	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Talk to somebody who had worked inside
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:49,087	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Journalists from all over the world started reaching out to him with nothing to you asking for interviews
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:50,111	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Comments

EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:05,984	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	They basically told her that they want her to do this like performance arts theater protest outside
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:09,056	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Now at the same time she was talking to these guys
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:14,176	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	On the other side of Palm Beach County
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:20,064	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	The name of Harry Miller
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:23,392	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Someone in there but she also got contacts on Twitter and over the phone
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:25,184	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	There was a conversation about
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:30,048	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	The desire to put on a something like a flash mob or something
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:33,376	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And supporting Donald Trump
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:39,264	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	I believe his name is Matt what did Matt say in his original sort of communication
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:40,544	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	This is it
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:44,640	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Extremely paraphrase because I don't have a distinct memory of Oliver
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:49,504	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And initially I was very suspect up and the reason I was so
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:51,808	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Is because
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:53,088	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	A headache
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:55,136	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Strong accent
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:24:00,256	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And at the time it was a lot of commotion about Muslims
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:05,376	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	I thought he was some who is one of some kind I was trying to set something up
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:06,400	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	What did his voice sound like
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:13,568	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	It wasn't like you articulate it was
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:15,360	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	It was broken
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:16,128	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	What in Turkey
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:19,456	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	He said he wanted a flash mob and what did he
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:26,112	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	What did he say he wanted you to do it I he was asking me about making a trailer with a jail type of thing
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:30,464	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	It's actually the guy with the accent told him I want you to Stage an event
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:31,488	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	We have a cage
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:33,536	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	I'm going to need to build this cage
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:38,144	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	But you're going to have this Cajun at the event there will be a Hillary Clinton impersonator
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:39,680	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Bill Clinton impersonator
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:41,728	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	I want you to put them in the cage
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:43,264	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Like you're putting them in jail
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:49,664	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And you should do this outside but lots of people can see you and they can chant lock her up lock her up and you should take lots of photos
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:51,200	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Videos and you should send them to us
EDL	00:24:51,200	00:24:55,552	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And I did eventually say yes because he had an elaborate wedding
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:25:00,160	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	But shiny told me his part of a big group of people
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:02,720	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Being patriotic
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:07,584	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	It's dismantled according to the FBI now
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:12,192	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	I can't get a bigger

EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:15,264	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	They sent
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:17,312	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Me to 8

EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:21,664	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	That found an estimate
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:26,016	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And I written estimate around $505 for it
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:30,112	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	But it did come from out of the country I do do recall that

EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:26,976	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	I don't think
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:31,072	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	You or Greg North or Harry Miller
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:35,936	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	I think that you all had really good intentions that you believed in this man and you wanted to go out and support him
EDL	00:31:36,448	00:31:37,984	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And I think what gets complicated
EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:39,264	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Here now is we find out that
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:41,056	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Even though you supported this
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:44,384	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And maybe in the end of the day you you helped him win
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:46,688	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	That there was some nefarious
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:51,296	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Work going on behind the scenes that led you to do this and I
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:52,832	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	I would have complicated feelings
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:55,392	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	I'm just trying to figure out if you do or don't
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:32:02,048	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	No because I do not believe that it be the case for the people that I dealt with I do not think it was a Russian movement
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:04,864	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	I've done article up here in front of me
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:06,656	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And in the indictment
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:11,776	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Are they refer to Matt skiba who is I think that the Hollywood man that you talk to
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:14,336	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	They refer to him as
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:20,736	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	From Texas and he went to UCLA
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:21,760	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	He was going home
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:25,856	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Yeah I'm I'm looking at a document right here saying that Matt skiba isn't invented person
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:28,160	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Well maybe that's invented name
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:30,720	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	He was a young guy ass
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:36,096	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	He sounds like what he said he was maybe he did give me a
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:37,376	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Bogus name
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:39,680	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	But you don't believe he was working for Russia
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:44,288	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Why don't know because if he lied about his name who knows
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:46,080	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	That's what he told me
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:48,384	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	He said his name was Matt
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:51,200	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	The email that I had
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:51,968	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Was this
EDL	00:32:51,968	00:32:52,992	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Josh
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:55,296	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Josh Milton
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:32:57,600	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	I'll let you know that
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:01,696	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Josh Milton they're saying is also a made-up
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:05,024	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Nobody
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:06,304	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	On my TV
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:09,632	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	I'm not usually wrong
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:12,192	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Puckett O'Leary's I really do
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:15,776	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Because obviously what happened from what I gathered from this
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:20,128	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	If I was the one dealing with the Russians
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:22,688	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	How about that one
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:26,784	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	What do what do you think about that how does it make you feel
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:37,024	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	I don't think I'm stupid but I don't see a real motive here and how this could change
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:40,864	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Heather claiming it disrupted the
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:42,656	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	The election
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:54,944	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	I don't know how that could be by really again had they not contact me I never my whole life
EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:58,272	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Been up there
EDL	00:33:58,784	00:34:04,672	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Harry says he understands that book invisible men the other end of the phone seem to want but you create a visual stunts
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:08,768	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	One that they can take on the road they wanted me to go to New York
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:10,816	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	They didn't want you to bring the key to New York
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:18,496	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And the whole thing to him was it just didn't matter if it were Russians or not
EDL	00:34:19,264	00:34:21,056	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	But the answering Craig
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:22,336	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	The guy who played Bill Clinton
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:24,896	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	He thinks about the whole thing very differently
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:29,504	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And I known
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:32,320	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	That I was working for
EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:33,600	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Directions
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:35,648	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	I would have asked for a lot more money
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:38,208	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	But
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:41,536	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	I have never felt good
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:44,352	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	About the same because
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:46,656	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	I might have had a little bit
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:48,960	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Of influence
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:50,240	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Donald Trump
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:51,008	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Being elected
EDL	00:34:51,776	00:34:54,080	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And I think that was a mistake for America
EDL	00:34:55,872	00:34:56,640	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And he doesn't feel like
EDL	00:34:57,152	00:34:57,664	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	But I do
EDL	00:34:58,176	00:35:00,224	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Cities is the feeling almost assertive guilt
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:06,880	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	I'm not I don't feel guilty
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:10,464	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	I was being paid to do a job and I did
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:11,488	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Goblins at the job
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:14,560	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	To the best of my ability
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:16,864	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	And people told me that I did the job well
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:22,752	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	How does it feel to know that you were sort of used
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:24,800	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Nobody likes to be used
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:28,384	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Irritating to me feels like a bit of a mild word
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:29,664	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	For how I might feel
EDL	00:35:30,432	00:35:30,944	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Well
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:38,368	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	I don't know I'm thinking that this might be played on the radio so I can't really use the words that I would like to
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:49,120	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	UPS to ship
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:56,032	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	When it sounds like you and Ann have very different interpretations of whether Russia was involved or not
EDL	00:35:56,800	00:35:58,080	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	The second between your relation
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:03,712	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	You know I love money yes I do

EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:08,576	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Now we don't
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:11,648	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	We all do crazy things
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:15,488	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	For love you can dress up like Bill Clinton shave our beards and
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:19,072	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Go in a prison cage so I don't crave your attention that but
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:20,352	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	I feel
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:21,888	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Astute
EDL	00:36:22,912	00:36:23,936	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	As an American
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:24,960	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Not
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:26,496	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	By the Russians
EDL	00:36:28,800	00:36:29,568	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	But

EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:42,368	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	I don't know if I'm making me something that sounds a little bit like you're saying that
EDL	00:36:43,392	00:36:44,672	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	What's frustrating is the fact
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:45,952	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	That
EDL	00:36:46,464	00:36:48,000	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	It wasn't actually Russia that
EDL	00:36:48,000	00:36:48,768	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Started the fire
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:51,840	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Fire they were just blowing on it and maybe making it a little worse
EDL	00:36:51,840	00:36:53,120	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	But the truly disheartening thing is
EDL	00:36:53,632	00:36:54,144	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	Accident
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:56,448	| radiolab_podcast18russianflashmob2 |	The fire was ignited here
