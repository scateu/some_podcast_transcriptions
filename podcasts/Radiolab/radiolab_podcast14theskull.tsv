EDL	00:00:39,936	00:00:40,448	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	So that's the place
EDL	00:00:41,728	00:00:44,800	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	This is the place the story about a thing
EDL	00:00:44,800	00:00:46,080	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Lives inside a Steel Vault
EDL	00:00:46,848	00:00:48,384	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Inside this huge Laboratory
EDL	00:00:49,664	00:00:51,968	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	At wits University in Johannesburg South Africa
EDL	00:00:52,736	00:00:58,368	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Real estate Professor their doctor Bernards FL to pull it out and show it to a reporter
EDL	00:00:58,880	00:00:59,648	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Patricia Hume
EDL	00:00:59,648	00:01:00,928	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And this is the original
EDL	00:01:00,928	00:01:03,232	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	This is it
EDL	00:01:05,536	00:01:06,816	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	We have a driver
EDL	00:01:06,816	00:01:07,584	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	In front of us here
EDL	00:01:07,584	00:01:08,096	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	I mean
EDL	00:01:08,608	00:01:11,424	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	I had to listen up when I get this fish every time I
EDL	00:01:11,424	00:01:11,936	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Take this out
EDL	00:01:14,240	00:01:16,032	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	The reason it Gibson gooseflesh
EDL	00:01:16,544	00:01:17,568	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Goosebumps is because
EDL	00:01:17,568	00:01:21,152	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	This object seems to completely up and two basic questions about
EDL	00:01:21,920	00:01:22,944	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	You know human history
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:24,480	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Amazing
EDL	00:01:24,992	00:01:26,272	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Where Do We Begin
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:30,880	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And when we began who was trying to take us out
EDL	00:01:31,648	00:01:32,928	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Producer Andy Mills takes
EDL	00:01:33,952	00:01:34,720	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Break
EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:36,000	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	With thunder and vigor and gust
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:38,304	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Yes I'd like to ask us
EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:41,120	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Alright it's one of those discoveries
EDL	00:01:41,120	00:01:42,400	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	That almost didn't happen
EDL	00:01:42,400	00:01:46,496	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And here to help me tell you the story okay I'm Professor Lee Berger
EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:49,312	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Is late I am a research professor
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:52,640	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	At the University of witwatersrand in Johannesburg in an acre
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:54,688	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Explorer in Residence at the National Geographic
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:02:01,856	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And explorer-in-residence that's a weird title it seems like you didn't you should be one or the other
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:08,256	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Oxymoron is yeah we said that our Story begins back in the 1920s in South Africa at a place call
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:10,048	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Call Tong Tong
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:14,144	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	It's tea and Yugi is the proper lane in Suwanee
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:15,424	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	The Western way of saying his tongue
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:18,496	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	It's a a desert area on the
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:22,080	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Southern edge of the Kalahari escarpment
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:22,848	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Typical picture of Africa
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:26,432	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Roxbury about trees running gazelles and
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:27,968	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Back in the 1920s
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:30,016	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	The place was crawling with Europeans
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:34,624	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Blasting away with with with dynamite
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:36,672	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Drilling with big steam girls and
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:39,488	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Huge explosion would take place in one day these miners
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:43,328	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	They're blowing their way through bit of this Hillside and
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:45,888	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	As The Rock Falls away
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:48,960	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And Smoke Clears they realize that they've opened up this
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:50,496	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Cate Blanchett cave
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:54,080	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And inside of that cake
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:55,616	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	They found dozens of these
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:56,384	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Strange looking Rock
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:57,920	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Almost like animals
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:02:59,712	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	What are the miners
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:02,528	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	He takes those bones given to a geologist geologist
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:07,392	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Box them up and send them to this Australian guy who's living in Johannesburg
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:08,160	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Named
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:08,928	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Raymond.
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:11,744	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And that's probably the first miracle in the story
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:12,512	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Raymond Dart
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:13,792	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Was it neuroanatomy
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:15,328	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Comparative neuron
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:19,168	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	When the only ones in the world this was a guy who knew his fossils
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:21,472	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	When does box arrived who's actually wearing at 3
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:26,336	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	He's going to be best man at a wedding in fact later that afternoon but he's like
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:27,104	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	That can wait
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:28,896	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	He reached into the box
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:33,504	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Shuffle through some Antelope skull was full of baboon skull monkey skulls
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:35,296	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Until he got to this one
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:37,600	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Note to your me
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:40,672	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	If this would have just looked like a big chunk of limestone
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:42,976	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	But Raymond are immediately realized
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:45,280	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	He had something special and he started
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:47,840	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	He actually went and got his wife knitting needles
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:49,376	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And started
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:52,704	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Scratching away at this rock much to his wife discussed
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:55,008	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	He then spent the next several months
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:59,872	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Delicately chipping away at the Limestone until the rock literally
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:00,640	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Top free
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:03,200	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And there he stared
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:03,968	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Into
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:05,504	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Perfect
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:06,272	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Little
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:12,160	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Fix you can see here the face is quite flat and inhumanly
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:20,607	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	What was the face of a child a human child humans have a larger brain
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:24,959	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	According to doctors that felt this child's brain was smaller than a human child
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:27,263	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	It was closer to the size of a chimpanzee
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:32,127	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	So it had features of the human it had a brain more like a chimpanzees
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:33,151	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Stranger still
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:38,015	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Start to remember study the sort of thing he looked at the foramen magnum
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:43,647	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Hole in the base of your skull for your spine goes in for creatures that walk on four legs
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:45,951	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	That hole is generally towards
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:46,719	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	The back of the skull
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:49,279	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	So they can look forward but here
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:50,559	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	The holes on the bottom
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:52,095	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Which suggested to him that
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:53,119	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	This creature
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:55,167	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Walked upright
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:58,239	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	It was not a monkey
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:05:00,031	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Wasn't an app as we know it
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:04,383	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Today it was certainly not a modern human being this was something in between
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:06,431	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	If you were walking across a broken Woodland
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:08,479	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Queer little conch shell might have lived
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:10,271	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	You would have seen
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:12,063	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Person off in the distance
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:18,463	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	As you approach though you begin to see that something was wrong with the proportion arms are probably in the long
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:21,023	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Longer legs a little bit shorter
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:27,423	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And as you step closer you see the little phone shows body would have been covered in this thick hair
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:33,823	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	More like an ape then then we have but it'd be like Noah ever seen because it would be standing there
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:37,407	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	In very much the way you would be standing staring at
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:37,919	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Onto
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:43,039	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	So if it is a little bit human a little bit
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:46,111	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Kind of in the middle it seems that he did he feel like this was
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:47,391	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	The quote Missing Link
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:51,999	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	We don't use that term because Evolution doesn't happen that way there's certainly dark today
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:54,815	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	He even back wrote a book called adventures with the missing
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:57,375	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And right after he discovered the skull he sent
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:06:00,191	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	The paper off at amazing speed to journal Nature
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:02,239	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Published in February
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:06,079	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	1925 e. This was going to revolutionize ever
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:08,639	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	But he was wholeheartedly
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:09,919	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Rejected
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:13,759	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	By the great scientific community
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:14,271	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Of your
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:16,319	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Batiri
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:18,879	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	First we already knew that humans didn't evolve in half
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:21,183	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Yeah Africa was backwards
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:23,231	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	That was the belief
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:29,631	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Says Chris Stringer on a research leader in human Origins at the Natural History Museum in London
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:35,007	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Back in the early 20th century people of the time felt that if you can you can see
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:41,407	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Who is wonderful kyva painted many thousands of years ago they prefer to think that you are or Asia one more
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:43,199	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Would like to send to Savannah Origins
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:43,711	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Inextricable
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:46,015	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Second
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:50,111	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Scientist already found a skull that they believe belong to the quote-unquote
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:50,879	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Missing Link
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:52,415	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	What's something cool piltdown man
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:53,439	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	It was this
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,207	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Ancient
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:54,975	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Man
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:57,023	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Fossil thing that they found in a golf
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:59,839	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Course in England so in their mind that was the right place
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:04,959	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And also improved them then you've got this very large Brain and a brain case that looks
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:06,751	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Really quite like a more than human one
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:08,287	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Which made sense to them
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:10,847	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	You know clearly European ancestors
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:12,639	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Would have had big brain
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:14,943	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Because they're European
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:19,551	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	I'm in the Tomb individual at a smooth brain
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:21,343	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Primitive look right
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:22,111	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	So dark
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:22,623	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	He spent
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:23,647	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	The next
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:24,927	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	20
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:25,951	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Plus years
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:27,743	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Arguing with people
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:29,535	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	This is our ancestor
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:30,559	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And getting nowhere
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:31,327	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Until
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:38,239	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	In the late 1920s other fossil started showing up and showing up South Africa Kenya Ethiopia
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:41,311	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Fossils they were from roughly the same era as the filter
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:45,919	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Their brains are teeth or bone structures they were all totally different
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:47,967	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	So this was very weird I mean
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:50,015	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	How do you explain that for decades
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:53,343	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Nothing else not till that man turns out from anywhere in the world
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:59,743	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Soaps in forensic experts at the London Museum of Natural History they decide
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:03,583	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	I started looking material under microscopes right off the bat
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:04,607	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	They found it
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:06,911	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	One of the teeth clearly showed
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:08,447	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	The marks of a metal Fallout
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:14,591	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	The deed has been filed down to look flat
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:17,919	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	No it down was a fraud
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:24,319	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	The fake forgery hoax in the hucksters were never caught they will questions in the house is a pond
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:30,719	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	About the competence of the Natural History Museum that it deletes expert shipping food through this time
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:33,535	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	This wasn't even a very good fake like for Tricare
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:38,911	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	The Jawbone of an orangutan they took some Motrin human skull pieces they then stain
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:40,191	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Bat material
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:45,055	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Doc Brown so eat the same, like stone tools
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:46,079	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And all this time
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:47,871	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Right there in front of them
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:49,407	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Was the poncho
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:57,343	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	It is estimated Inspirion estimate of being around 2 million 2.2 million years old
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:59,647	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Which still today is the oldest
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:00,415	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Not
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:02,719	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Quite yet human fossil that we have
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:04,255	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	This this would be
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:05,535	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Probably
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:07,071	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	The greatest
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,351	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	One of the greatest
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:12,191	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Ever been argued to be the most important
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:17,055	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Single fossil ever discovered in the history of humankind surgery
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:19,103	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	It brought to the full
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:20,639	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	That Humanity originate
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:21,151	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	In Africa
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:24,735	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	But every human on earth
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:25,247	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Is an African
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:27,039	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Will of African origin
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:30,111	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Butts butts
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:31,647	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	More than just
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:32,927	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Where
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:35,231	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	We came from which I think it's totally cool
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:38,559	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Super interesting weekend we can look at the skull and we can see things
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:39,071	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	About
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:41,119	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	You know what life was like
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:41,887	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	For this
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:43,423	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Like little version of us
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:45,215	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	That lived so long ago you were looking
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:45,727	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	The teeth
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:46,751	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	It was eating
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:51,359	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Was it eating like what we eat surprisingly similar
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:52,127	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Tortoise
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:53,663	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	So yeah it wasn't it wasn't like
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:55,199	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Hugely differ
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:56,223	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	From what we eat
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:57,247	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	But I think
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:59,039	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	The most exciting thing
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:00,063	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Vatican telescope
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:02,367	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	You know not just about what our life
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:02,879	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Was like
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:04,159	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	But
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:05,183	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	What was
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:06,719	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Lurking in the shadows
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,743	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Waiting
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:08,511	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	To take us out
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:12,607	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	You can tell that from this
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:14,143	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Diamond Vista school is it
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:17,215	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Kind of at the center of this murder
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:19,263	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Who killed the tongue shop
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:21,823	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	At the time when when when Raymond dark
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:24,383	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Made that Discovery he had this sort of
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:27,967	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Gut feeling that this Taung Child was killed by one of its own
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:33,855	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	You know cuz this is like 19-24 we were between two Wars War
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:34,623	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	One hitter
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:40,255	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Record the horrible destruction that was actually a medic in that war and he walked away convinced
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:42,303	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Humans were were inherently
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:47,679	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Evil creatures that were inherently violent and that we are probably a lot worse in the past
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:52,287	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	In fact the opening of 2001 A Space Odyssey
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:56,383	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Where you see the monkeys
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:11:00,991	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Beating each other with the bones was based on Raymond darts theories of the violet
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:01,759	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Origin
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:02,783	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	On the continent of Africa
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:07,135	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	So that was darts like pets
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:10,975	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Siri that maybe tongaat Club down by his brother or his name
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:12,255	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	But
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:13,279	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	That ignores one big
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:19,679	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	In that Limestone mine where the tongs go was found there were also all these others
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:23,775	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Boone schools monkey skulls and roses like little collection of Bones
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:25,567	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	More like what you would expect
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,847	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Defined in a predator set
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:28,127	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Donut
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:29,151	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Datong
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:31,455	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Like creature but maybe
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:33,503	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Cat
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:34,271	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Big cat
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:37,599	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	At least a large mammalian Predator then because that's perfectly acceptable
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:39,135	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	We're tough
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:39,903	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	They're tough
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:41,695	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	It's okay to be killed by something mean and vicious
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:43,743	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	That became the new Theory
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:44,511	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Because
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:45,791	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	What else do humans have to fear
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:52,191	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Write what now here's where I think maybe you come into the story for some reason when you arrive
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:53,983	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Many many many years later
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:55,775	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	This idea
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:57,567	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	The cat did it
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:11:59,871	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Seems to disturb
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:06,271	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	I was addicted to that story is anyone else I've been brought up on it through my anthropology classes every every
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:07,551	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Book I ever read said that
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:08,319	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	But
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:10,623	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	One day in in 1990
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:15,743	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	For he bumps into a completely new idea Eureka moment
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:19,071	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Is there I was
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:20,607	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	At Gladys field
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:27,007	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	An excavation site in South Africa Lee and his team we're doing what they do digging for fossils I just finish Excavating
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:29,311	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Haitian Almighty mid left and I was sitting there watching the Sun
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:32,383	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And I looked up on the hillside
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:36,479	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	There was a troop of vervet monkeys are small gray monkey
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:38,527	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Never coming down to Ford's down the hill
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:40,575	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	It also sent her an alarm call
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:42,879	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	I looked up in the sky
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:44,159	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And there came
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:45,183	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Huge eagle
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:47,231	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	The Monkees
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:49,791	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Scatter is Eagle swooped around the edge of
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:53,631	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And as it came down around the edge of the hill I realized you
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:54,143	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	The Trap
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:56,959	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Because coming around the other agent Hill
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:58,495	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Was that Eagles make
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:12:59,775	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Edit
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:00,543	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Zoomed in
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:03,615	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And whack one of those large monkeys
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:04,383	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Right in front
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:06,175	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And everything went silent
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:11,295	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	The other Eagle landed this Eagle sitting on top of a now-dead monkey
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:13,343	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Eagle staring at me
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:14,879	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	I'm stranded it probably would
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:17,183	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	My mouth open looks at me for a moment
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:19,743	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And then leaps off the edge of this cliff
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:20,511	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Cliff with the dead monkey
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:22,303	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And flies away with
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:22,815	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Is it down
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:25,375	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And I had no idea
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:27,679	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	So I got into my car
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:33,311	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	I chase the direction it went I knew it was going I knew but he's Black Eagle Nest where they were up on a cliff face
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:36,895	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	I crawled up under crossing the river crawled up under the
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:38,431	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	The nest and there was

EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:21,087	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	They went on for
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:21,855	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Ears
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:23,135	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	He couldn't convince people
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:27,231	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	We need something more until one night about 9 at night
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:30,303	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Years later his home scene in my little study
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:36,191	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	He was reading an academic paper about eagles and how eagles sometimes when they kill little mammals
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:38,495	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	They'll reach into their eye sockets
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:42,591	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And pluck out their eyes to get it the nice juicy brain on the inside
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:46,175	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And in the paper it was a really beautiful image
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:47,199	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	What's beautiful to me
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:48,223	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	People who study dead things
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:50,783	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Beautiful image of skull of a primate
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:52,831	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	With the interior socket
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:54,111	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Eyes
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:55,391	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	With these Jagged marks
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:58,207	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	These very particular scratch marks
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:16:00,767	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	On the underside of the eye socket
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:02,815	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And I was staring at these images and
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:03,327	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	I went
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:10,495	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Oh my goodness or something to that effect I got in my car
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:12,543	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Drove down to the lab open up the safe
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:13,055	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Hold on
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:15,359	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Turn the face over
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:17,663	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And there they were
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:24,575	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	On the base of the inside of the eye socket where these Jagged Richard Marx
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:26,623	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	That you had to have done
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:28,159	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	By reaching into the orb
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:29,951	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	The exact
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:30,719	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Same
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:37,119	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Mark you can see little little exclamation mark
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:38,399	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Cummins
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:39,679	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	No one had noticed
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:44,543	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	In Imagine I'm sitting in the middle of this Anatomy Department in the middle of the night
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:48,895	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	In a vault containing million-year-old fossil a Magic Moment
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:52,223	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	It's so now you know
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:55,039	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	A little bit about how this creature lived and how it died
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:57,855	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	I mean Beyond solving the murder mystery what does that tell you
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:17:01,695	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	First to say solving the murder mysteries kind of cool
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:05,791	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	There's nothing wrong with just doing that
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:07,327	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Have you ever thought
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:09,375	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Why when you're standing out on a
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:09,887	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Playground
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:12,447	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Or standing out in open field
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:15,007	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And a shadow passes over you
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:21,151	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Do you know that feeling that occurred whether it be from an airplane or whatever
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:24,223	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	First you get that tingly feeling on the back of your neck and then you
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:27,039	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Yank your head up you ever wondered why you do that
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:29,855	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	You do that
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:33,183	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Because the little Tong child died two and a half million years ago
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,975	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Because he didn't look up quick enough
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:41,631	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Producer animals
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:44,959	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	What did you say
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:50,335	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	One very important thing to say is actually didn't experiment with the story we hooked up with some people at MakerBot
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:51,615	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	It's a very nice folks
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:53,407	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	The field museum in Chicago
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:59,039	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And we had 3D scans made of the taung child skull next to holding on right now
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:05,951	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Mine's purple Instinct replicas of the
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:06,975	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Taung child skull menu
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:11,839	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	The Ridges you can feel the scratches in the eyes if you could listen to the store YouTube
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:16,447	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	While holding the tongue child in your hair well that's exactly the reason we did this
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:19,519	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	We have partnered with a museum
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:20,799	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	World Museum
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:26,175	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	That's spelled with forums two in the front two in the back Museum
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:28,991	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	It's this tiny little Elevator Shaft size place
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:33,343	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Here in Manhattan where they display all these sort of like Oddities you know like little
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:35,647	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Objects from Saddam Hussein's Palace
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:37,183	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	I have a
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:39,999	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Cool toys that were banned from Saudi Arabia right
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:43,071	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And they will also be displaying error
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:45,119	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	3d replica of the taung skull
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:47,167	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	So if you go there
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:53,567	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Can I see hold the skull you dial in a little number and you can hear part of the Peace
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:55,871	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Is to listen to the story while holding this
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:57,919	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	Not only that if you have a 3D printer of your own
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:19:04,831	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	And you go to radiolab.org you can download a scanner 3D scan of the tongue skull
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:05,855	| radiolab_podcast14theskull |	You can put your own
