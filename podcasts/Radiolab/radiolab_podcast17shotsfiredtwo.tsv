EDL	00:00:03,840	00:00:08,192	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Earthquake warning this podcast contains some descriptions of graphic violence
EDL	00:00:08,704	00:00:10,496	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	And also some strong language
EDL	00:00:11,008	00:00:11,520	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Be warned
EDL	00:00:13,568	00:00:14,848	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Weight units

EDL	00:00:30,976	00:00:33,024	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Look at
EDL	00:00:33,024	00:00:33,792	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	It's hard to
EDL	00:00:34,304	00:00:37,888	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Kill another human being anymore right we are fangs have retreated
EDL	00:00:37,888	00:00:38,912	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Hands are weak
EDL	00:00:38,912	00:00:40,192	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	But
EDL	00:00:40,704	00:00:42,752	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Possibility kill each other weave
EDL	00:00:42,752	00:00:46,336	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Games and ability to read each other's tone of voice
EDL	00:00:46,336	00:00:47,872	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	And facial expression
EDL	00:00:48,896	00:00:54,784	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	And often what's missing in these interactions is one side of that equation
EDL	00:00:54,784	00:01:01,184	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Whether it's the police not seeing somebody because of running through an alley with their guns drawn and
EDL	00:01:01,184	00:01:07,584	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	And start or shining a flashlight in someone's face where that person can't
EDL	00:01:07,584	00:01:13,984	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Can see the officers expression there's some mask with some breakdown in that in that equation that makes
EDL	00:01:13,984	00:01:20,384	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Handicap sauce from a normal human interaction
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:26,784	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Hey I'm Jared home run by Robert krulwich this is Radiolab and today we are once again taking a deep dive in
EDL	00:01:26,784	00:01:33,184	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Into Tampa Bay Times Reporter Ben Montgomery's mountain of data about police shootings in Florida
EDL	00:01:33,184	00:01:39,584	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Soap to refresh your memory from with try to account for every single police shooting from January 1st of two
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:41,632	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	2009 to
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:48,544	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	December 31st of 2014 and we just remind you ban in his team at the Tampa Bay Times collected data from
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:50,080	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	828
EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:51,360	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Police shootings
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:57,760	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	And there's all kinds of stories that you can tell about the status last week we looked at police training and racing
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:01:58,784	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	And racism
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:05,184	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	And obviously there's so much more they can and should be said about all of that but this week we're going to go in a very different
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:09,792	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Direction maybe Matt you just want want to set this up for us
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:15,680	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Plays out this this idea that then just mentioned that this is her Communication Breakdown it happens
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:17,984	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	And it doesn't in a very particular way
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:19,520	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Because when one of these cases
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:22,848	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Comes before a court the court more often then I will only look at the moment
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:25,408	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	That the cop involved in the shooting
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:31,552	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Pull the trigger you don't consider any other moment it's only the objective facts on the ground of the moment the officer
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:33,088	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Applies Force
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:37,184	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	So the thing that we found compelling about this story is that
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:39,232	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	In this case you can actually see
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:40,768	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	And kind of a rare instance
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:45,632	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	You can lie cats you can step in and see all the little moments that lead up to that moment
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:46,912	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	You realize how
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:48,960	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Complicated
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:50,496	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	These interactions get
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:52,800	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Citizen to give a story to story about white couple
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:55,616	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Andrea and Rick Sheldon
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:58,176	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	And rushing to start story with Rick
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:03:04,576	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	So on one of my trips to Florida Ben and I drove to the northeast corner of the state of
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:07,136	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	I'm your Jacksonville to Rick's place
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:13,536	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	It's sort of like the the Wilds of Florida if they're guilty
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:15,840	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Wild Big Bird back there
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:23,008	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	What on whenever you're going to property pretty much a little bit of everything to collect rainwater in barrels he's got potatoes tomatoes
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:29,408	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Squash eat organic Gardens Ducks goats animals turkey

EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:49,632	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Eventually we all sit down lyrics living room Rick
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:55,776	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Sat cross-legged on the couch Rick I was just wondering if we could I pull up a chair across from him we can talk about your case
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:59,104	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	But even backing up before everything happened

EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:14,783	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	And Rick didn't want to get into it I'd rather not make statement about that right now
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:18,623	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	About the conversation
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:25,023	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	All we can say according the police report is that Rick and Andy got into this screaming match and Rick says that he felt himself
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:30,399	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Shortness of breath chest pain loss of concentration inability to think

EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:21,631	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Rick Sheldon and a deputy were on the phone shots were fired in the background
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:22,911	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	And then the line went dead
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:24,959	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	We pick back up with our reporter Matt kielty
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:27,263	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	2
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:31,615	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	What we know is while the deputy was talking to Rick
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:34,431	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	The other officers that were with the deputy
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:35,967	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	I have gone ahead
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:37,247	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	And going up to the house
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:39,039	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Rick's wife Andy
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:42,879	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Heard something came out of the house with a shotgun
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:45,951	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	The deputies say that she pointed a shotgun at one of the deputies
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:48,511	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	They open fire and she was shot and killed
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:55,423	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	They're on the front porch did they say did they identify themselves
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:59,263	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Ben and I were able to get all of the police dispatch recordings
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,287	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	From that night
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:03,359	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	And if you go to these recordings what you hear is
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:10,015	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Discreetly drawn-out version of what Ben was talking about at the top of the story
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:11,807	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	The disconnected happens between
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:16,415	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	The deputies and the dispatchers and what they're thinking hearing and seeing what's actually
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:17,183	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Happening
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:25,375	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	So if you rewind about 40 minutes before that shooting the first thing that happened was Rick called his boss
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:31,775	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	We don't know exactly what was said in that phone call because it wasn't recorded but what we do know is that Rick's boss left
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:37,151	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Conversation bleeding a trick might be possibly suicidal that there been a fight at the house that Rick
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:43,551	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	I had some guns with minutes truck cuz it's freaking idiot on camping and that there was a gun back at the house
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:49,951	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	But anyways the first thing that happened after that call is Rick boss his fire chief calls fire.
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:56,351	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Dispatch calls a sheriff dispatcher who raped in another
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:14:02,751	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Daltrey dispatches get on the line what we can figure out what's going on
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:09,151	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Sheriff dispatch number 3 he's just like
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:15,551	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Information
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:21,951	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Right around the time that dispatch number three is making that call somehow or another Sheriff's dispatcher afford dispatcher
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:28,351	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	How to call for a welfare check
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:34,751	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Is it he is in the woods that has a handgun
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:41,151	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	But then things start to get more complicated because when dispatcher number three gets ahold of Rick's pasta fire cheese
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:47,551	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Details what is issue with the deal
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:53,695	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	I said she come out you're hiding in the woods my wife chasing me with a gun just couldn't take it anymore
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:06,751	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Some of it back but things are emotions then
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:13,151	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Number for relays to teach story to the deputies in route or a handgun but it's chasing the male who took
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:19,551	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Medication hallucinating what's going on
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:25,951	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Is chasing him
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:32,351	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Which Rick said he said but you said there was a gun in the house that's it
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:35,423	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	In the woods
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:36,959	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	I didn't say anything like that
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:43,871	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Clarification male hath is hiding from his wife who signal zero with a handgun in fear of her
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:50,271	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	I'm trying to get more 1043
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:56,671	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Howard's of miscommunication Because by the time the police show up at this house for what is normally a welfare check
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:16:03,071	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Now she has a shotgun inside the house
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:09,471	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	I'm off into the woods what's that address also armed deputies they
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:12,287	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	So damn dark out here with blacked-out walk
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:18,687	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Pull up in a blackout
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:22,271	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Place to gather their flashlights and I start walking down this road
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:28,671	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Rick's place in one of their views even puts on these night vision goggles because they think this woman is chased her husband in the woods
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:31,487	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Supposably he's in the Woods by his house
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:31,999	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Spell
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:35,071	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Working out to
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:41,471	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Start walking down the straight road towards Creek Place
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:47,871	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	The neighbors dog gets freaked out eventually
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:54,015	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Vi at least get to the edge of Rick's driveway
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:57,343	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Detective around here about 40 minutes after Rick
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:17:03,743	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Made that first called was boss the Ricky said call from the deputy

EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:16,799	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	No I took all the guns with mags
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:23,199	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Okay
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:23,967	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Okay
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:26,527	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Domestic dispute
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:33,695	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	But as the deputy is talking to Rick for the deputies start walking up
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:40,095	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Rick's driveway so they get up to the house two of them walk up onto the porch one of the Moon looks through the bed
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:46,495	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Bedroom window where Andy is and she has no reason to believe the police or anywhere on her property
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:51,359	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Sleep a presumably she heard a noise grab the shotgun in the house and came outside
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:56,735	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	In This Moment all we really have to go on is what the cop said they saw
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:18:01,343	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Which is Andy came out through the front door wearing nothing but her underwear
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:02,367	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Holding shotgun
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:07,743	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Cop saved a identified themselves they were her screaming at her to drop the gun
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:10,303	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	They say that Andy took a step forward
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:12,095	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Level 2 shotgun against your shoulder
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:13,631	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	And then
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:18,495	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	They open fire if I 24 Shots to hit Andy at least 8 times
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:20,031	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	She fell to the porch
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:24,127	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Some of the peace officers rescuer begin performing first aid
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:26,943	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Let me see the radio for an ambulance and paramedics showed up
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:29,503	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	And pronounce and eat at the same
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:36,671	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	At this point you have any idea what's happening now
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:37,951	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Medical
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:40,255	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	I never realized I needed to
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:42,047	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Snap out wake up
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:44,863	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Get my ass in gear and find out what's going on
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:45,631	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Buttrick
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:52,031	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Check the stock and so it took three hours for them to the cops figure out where he was Santa Cruz over to meet him Joe the ground crew came over and
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:56,895	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Pick me up handcuffed me and put me in the back of a four-wheel drive pickup truck and took me to headquarters
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:19:01,503	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	I got another car brought me to headquarters put me in a room typical interrogation type room
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:03,807	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	And then I start noticing that they were drum
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,623	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Being very very friendly
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:13,023	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Some people are saying something about you oh my my camping equipment in the truck I remember them
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:15,327	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Authorizing me to have a cigarette
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:16,863	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	And the broom
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:24,543	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	And then we pretty much went through the same questioning that we've gone through so far and at which time they
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:25,567	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Inform me that
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:26,847	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	They had a

EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:38,367	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	That was the breaking news
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:40,671	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	Pretty much
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:45,023	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	When you hear something like that I mean
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:46,559	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredtwo |	I can't even fathom
