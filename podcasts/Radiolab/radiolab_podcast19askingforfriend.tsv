EDL	00:01:26,016	00:01:26,528	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So
EDL	00:01:27,296	00:01:27,808	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Last year
EDL	00:01:28,832	00:01:30,112	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	We decided
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:32,416	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	To do a thing where I
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:35,488	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	We went to the inbox
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:36,512	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What's the Radiolab inbox
EDL	00:01:37,536	00:01:38,560	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	4 years
EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:40,352	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	People had been sending us
EDL	00:01:41,120	00:01:42,144	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Questions they want dance
EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:45,216	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Stupid questions if we are calling them collect
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:46,240	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Wait we say that love
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:47,520	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Sometimes they would say
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:51,104	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Question I don't know it may seem too simple.
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:52,896	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Why
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:54,176	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Do and then some
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:56,480	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Sure thing, is the sky blue
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:01:59,808	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I think so do a lot of these kind of question to accumulate in the inbox
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:01,600	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Last year we took a bunch of those Quest
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:03,904	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And we try to answer them
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:07,488	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And it was very fun everyone got to do one and one pic
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:08,768	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Question and ran after it
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:11,840	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And there were some questions left over there was also
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:13,888	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Questions that we ourselves
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:15,936	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	They were here.
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:17,472	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It's like filed away in
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:18,240	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And so
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:19,520	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	We decided we were going to do this
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:21,568	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Except this time
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:24,384	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Broadneck constraints so there's not just
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:27,968	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Questions that are sent to us but we questions we ourselves had questions that were given to us by
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:30,528	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Friends of the show
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:32,832	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Came into our heads and never gone away
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:33,856	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Here's the deal

EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:41,792	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But you thought
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:48,192	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I don't know and it never left your head take that question the one you
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:49,728	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Still think about never answered

EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:47,328	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It was June 25
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:49,632	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Okay and it was a gorgeous day
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:50,656	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Sunny day
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:52,448	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Good temperatures
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:53,472	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:56,288	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I had decided about 1
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:57,312	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	In the afternoon
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:59,104	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	To take a walk
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:02,944	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And as he was strolling along cross the River from our house
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:05,504	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I felt my phone
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:06,784	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Vibrate in my pocket
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:09,344	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:12,160	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I looked at it and saw that he had a voice
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:14,720	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And it said
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:16,768	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Hi this message is for Kim
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:21,375	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Are Timothy on this is Carrie calling from UW hospital in the transplant Department

EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:46,719	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	This this is hard to believe thank you
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:50,559	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	If I can back up here
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:55,679	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Go back 25 years back my dad was diagnosed with sarcoidosis
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:59,007	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It's a relatively rare disease with no cure
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:01,055	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Better Century triggers the immune system
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:02,079	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	To attack the body
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:06,175	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Typically it it targets and wreaks havoc on the lungs
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:10,271	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Usually sarcoidosis goes away on its own after a few years
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:13,087	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Hoping would happen if I dad
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:16,159	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But in his case the disease became chronic
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:20,511	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It's a beer after your breathing became harder and harder
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:27,167	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Can't stop running a marathon runner at the time and suddenly just walking a mile became difficult
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:29,983	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	10 years back he
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:35,615	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Started using oxygen at album get around and then five years ago things finally got so bad
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:37,407	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That he was
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:39,455	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Place on waitlist for a lunch
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:44,831	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Inside that call was the transplant team
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:45,855	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Calling him to say that
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:48,671	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	After five years of waiting they had
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:50,975	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Awarded this long to me
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:53,023	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	If I was still on board
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:56,095	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Assembly was almost like you're a sweepstakes winner
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:06:01,727	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What did you feel like a sweepstakes winner or you would like
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:02,495	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Well
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:03,775	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Ice I had to ask
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:06,079	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:10,687	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I always said that if one was made available I would take
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:13,759	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And it's going to make a great story
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:15,295	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	When it's all said and
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:19,903	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I unlock back I called and I said we're in
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:22,975	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And Damn the Torpedoes Full Speed Ahead
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:27,583	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And from there this years-long glacial Pace process
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:29,119	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Started moving
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:31,423	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Very fast
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:33,727	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It was pretty much honey pack your bag
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:40,639	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	My folks hop in the car drove the three and a half hours south of the hospital in Madison Wisconsin
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:42,175	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	About 5:30
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:47,551	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	You know within 45 minutes I was basically immobilized
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:50,111	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Because I had things coming out of every orifice
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:56,767	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And then just a couple hours after that very early that next morning the surgeon came in and said
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:58,047	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It's time
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:00,095	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	They just told me to relax
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:11,103	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What's the next thing you remember
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:13,407	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Well
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:15,455	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I woke up
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:21,343	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And my arms were strapped to the gurney
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:24,415	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And I had a breathing tube down my throat
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:25,439	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:27,743	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yeah you just got hit by a bus
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:29,279	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Operation
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:32,351	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That was the beginning
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:40,543	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Now sitting in my dad's hospital room
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:41,311	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Is he was coming to
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:43,359	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I really realized for the
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:44,127	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The first time
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:44,639	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Then
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:46,687	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That this was
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:48,735	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Like this wasn't over
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:51,039	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The phrase
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:51,551	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Is
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:53,087	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	You're just a
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:55,903	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Exchanging one major set of problems
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:57,439	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	For another's
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:58,463	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Majors that a problem
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:01,023	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The biggest being the threat of rejection
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:03,327	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	In fact about 50% of folks
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:06,143	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	To get a lung transplant
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:07,423	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Only live about 5 years
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:09,727	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And you can always be on the wrong side of that
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:12,799	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I'm sure that that had sort of been
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:13,311	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Explain to us
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:15,103	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But I am
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:16,127	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I didn't really
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:17,407	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Imagine what that meant
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:17,919	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Until
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:19,455	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	We saw him lying there
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:22,527	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Sister said they weren't they were all these sort of terrifying question
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:25,343	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Surrounding
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:26,367	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	All of us
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:28,159	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	In
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:29,695	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	My
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:32,767	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I think we wanted to find a way to talk about all the
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:33,535	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Terrifying
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:34,303	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Oceans without
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:34,815	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Having to ask
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:36,095	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Disgusting
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:38,655	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And so
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,191	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The way we
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:41,983	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Decided to talk about this was
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:44,031	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	We inserted this
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:45,823	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Intellectual or legal
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:47,359	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The question was
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:49,407	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Who had
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:50,431	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Ownership of
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:50,943	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	This long
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:52,223	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Throughout the
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:52,991	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	This entire process
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:55,551	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Because like I don't know if they're transporting a
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,575	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Suitcase full of
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:09:00,927	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Hundred dollar bills like somebody has to be responsible for that suitcase every step of the
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:03,999	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Oregon is essentially
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,535	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Valued at
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:06,559	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Much is a suit
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:07,327	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	K400
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:08,095	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Dollar bills
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:11,935	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So who the heck was responsible for and who owned it who is liable for a teacher
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:13,471	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Wager
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:15,519	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	When
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:16,799	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Did I
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:18,079	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	They have complete
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:19,103	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Ownership
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:19,871	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I was alone
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:21,663	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That was that was the Ulta
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:23,711	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Wait so you and your
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:25,759	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Are you just you and your
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:27,039	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Your mom and
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:30,879	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Brother talking about the sources like are you talked about this with your dad
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:31,903	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Started between Barbara and
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:38,559	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Barber you're my partner from there that the circle of conversation group
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:40,095	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	As
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:42,143	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Search as the week went on
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:44,959	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And eventually my dad was roped into it in my dad
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:47,007	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Lawyers that he had some thoughts on all this
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:53,407	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yeah it's awake but isn't it kind of a simple matter I mean I would imagine that when the longest in the donor
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,711	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But you know anything about the donor
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:58,783	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	We we don't know it's all
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:01,087	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Kept quite confidential
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:04,159	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Essentially there's a process through which my dad is
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:05,439	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Send a thank you note
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:09,279	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Start of into a black box that is the
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:10,815	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Nonprofit
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:11,839	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Organ donation
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:12,607	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Machinery
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:16,703	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And that will be delivered to them and then if they would like to reach back out to him they can do
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:18,495	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But up until this
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:22,847	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Okay so getting back to it so
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:25,919	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I would think that when the longest in the donor's body
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:29,247	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It is in that person's possession then it taken out and then if that's
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:30,783	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Intermediate stages in the hospital
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,063	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Possession is a trend
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:36,927	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And then when it goes into your Dad's Body he then immediately assumes owners
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:37,951	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Simple as that
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:40,511	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What you think so
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,535	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Right okay
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:46,143	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Nothing that really looks simple ever is very simple at least when lawyers get involved
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:53,823	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	This is Fred now I'm afraid Kate I'm a professor of law at Indiana University Maurer School of Law keep the guy
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:56,895	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I ultimately called to try to tease out an answer here
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:58,943	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Because he's written a lot on the laws surrounding
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:01,759	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	He said the first thing you got it
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:07,135	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	First of all property is a really special thing in the law
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:08,671	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Code of laws
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:14,815	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Hammurabi in by Daddy means many of the oldest written laws we have as humans
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:16,095	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	We're about
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:22,239	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Acting property historically protecting property was in a very much at the heart of it
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:28,127	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Set up to settle disputes over ownership
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:29,151	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	An enemy take away from him
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:32,991	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Assess damages the broker shall be free of obligation
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:40,159	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And overtime the number of things the law protects has only grown you know intangible things like
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:46,559	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Intellectual property you know I can own a copy right now and so we have a respect for property that's
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,583	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Reflected in the law
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:50,655	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That is really quite distinctive
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:56,799	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Okay but having said all of that we don't really allow property rights in most body parts
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:12:00,383	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And moreover the law doesn't let us call the human body
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:00,895	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Property
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:04,479	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Obviously in this country there was a time when it did
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:11,647	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But then you have the 13th Amendment which ended slavery and since then have a squeamishness it could
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:13,183	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	To be a reaction to the
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:19,583	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Prohibition on slavery that we don't want to ever give the notion that one person can own a another person's body
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:20,351	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Austin princess
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:22,399	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	US law has gone very silent
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:24,191	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	On questions of ownership and by
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:26,239	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And so as a consequence
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:29,311	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	When someone donates you in Oregon
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:32,895	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Legally you have no ownership claim over
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:35,199	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Back working we're just not willing to
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:36,479	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	SEPTA call it proper
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:38,015	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Okay
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:42,623	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I think I get that strange then however
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:43,647	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Is that
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:44,671	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Apparently
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:47,999	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That same provision applies to your own by
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:54,399	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yeah you don't have property interested in your body and so although you can donate them and you can leave them
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:57,215	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	When your will we don't really treat them like
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:57,983	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Property
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:13:01,055	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Wait so you're born with along in your body
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:04,639	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	You don't own that thing that's been with you since birth
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:06,687	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Correct it is yours but you don't own it
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:12,575	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What are we quibbling over the word property here or ownership cuz rental lawyers do we
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:14,623	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	We we don't come equivalent this is what we
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:17,183	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Making money doing is arguing over property
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:17,951	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	If
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:21,791	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It's not property what what is it what's the what's the term at that point
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:24,863	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I don't think we really have a term for that
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:27,679	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Now
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:28,447	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Near me
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:32,543	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	When I relayed this to my dad don't own your own
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:33,055	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Oregon
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:35,359	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yeah
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:37,663	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	She was as
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:39,199	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Confused design
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:40,735	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	At the risk of a pond made
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:41,759	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Certainly carved out
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:43,295	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Interesting
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:43,807	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Concept
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:49,951	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And it turns out the consequences of this legal carve-out are
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:51,231	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Spectacularly spray
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:55,327	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Let's say you drew a little bit of blood out of your arm one evening
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:56,863	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I don't know why and you
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:59,679	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	You put it in a vial in your refrigerator and that night
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:01,471	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	A burglar breaks into your
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:03,775	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Your home your apartment goes into the refrigerator
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:04,543	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And steals app
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:06,079	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That that
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:07,871	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Thief would not be charged
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:08,383	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	With that
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:13,759	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	For for stealing that but there might be criminal claims like breaking and entering
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:17,599	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But I just don't think it's going to be a property claim there because they didn't actually
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:18,367	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Steel
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:19,391	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Something that was your possession
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:21,439	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Equally strange
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:25,279	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	This is come up a couple times where
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:31,679	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	His wife John Elway husband in this case a guy by the name of Richard Batista
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:32,703	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Donated kidney to his
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:35,775	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	My priority was to save her life operation
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:37,055	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Well
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:37,823	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	To save
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:38,591	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	True love
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:44,735	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But then says his wife began having an affair about 2 years after the trans
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:47,807	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The marriage falls apart
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:54,207	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Enter divorce proceedings uibe so stunning demand husband Bautista
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:55,487	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Bat once the kidney
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:56,767	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Shut up
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:58,303	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	True story and of course
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:14:59,839	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Was thrown out by the judge
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:00,607	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	In part because of
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:02,911	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But also because
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:08,543	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	In the judge never said this but he could have it like sorry bub you never owned your your kidney to begin with
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:10,847	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Let alone after you donated it
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:11,615	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	To your wife
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:15,455	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So I don't think you would ever find a situation where that would be treated as marital property
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:20,063	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But ironically and this is just going to make it even more complicated
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:26,463	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Blood skin and corny is tend to be an exception in the way we think about this in the law meaning
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:32,607	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That you can sell your blood or or your skin the law allows that don't ask why that's just the way it is
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:34,911	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Even still in these cases
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:35,935	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	This cannot call it
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:36,703	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Property
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:37,471	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I don't
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:39,519	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Own it but I could sell it exactly
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:41,567	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What did they eat when they took that blood
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:45,407	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I would assume that they don't own it either well the purchaser
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:51,039	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The folks who do buy it from you the blood bank the hospital that is that have collected it
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:52,319	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	They own
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:55,903	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Here's the kicker
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:58,719	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So if you then broke into the blood bank
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:16:00,511	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Steal back your own blood
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:02,815	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	You could be charged with
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:05,631	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Right we have cases on this
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:07,423	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Okay that's definite
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:09,215	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Marriott
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:12,543	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	All right
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:14,847	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Well
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:16,895	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What I think is interesting here is
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:20,223	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Like I think we we first
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:21,503	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Started wondering this Quest
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:24,831	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	As a as a tangible way
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:26,367	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	2
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:27,903	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Think about this
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:28,671	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Barb
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:31,231	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	More abstract
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:33,279	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Impossible to answer question which was like
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:35,327	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	When would we feel like
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:39,167	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	This long was really yours like when would we
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:41,983	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Feel like we didn't have to be worrying
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:43,007	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Right
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:45,311	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I don't know I guess that I'm not
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:46,847	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I'm not fully there yet
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:48,639	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Oh

EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:53,503	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Call from

EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:05,279	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I think you're going to
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:07,327	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Stick around a long time with the
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:09,375	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It's long because it's going so well
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:12,191	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And I I didn't know what

EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:16,031	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It first and then she went on to explain that
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:19,615	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Autism mortality rate after 5 years yeah
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:20,127	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	50%
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:22,687	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The nun

EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:25,247	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But I don't
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:26,271	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I think you have to worry about that
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:29,343	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I think you're going to be one of our 30 year candidate
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:32,159	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Well I never I never seen
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:35,743	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Consider a 30-year planning anything I've always lived on it
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:37,535	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Five year plan
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,071	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Because
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:40,095	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	When I was
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:40,863	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	45
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:42,655	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Given that
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:43,423	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Decline of
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:44,959	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Pulmonary function
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:46,495	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I said
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:48,543	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	To myself I am going to be lucky
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:51,871	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I'm going to be the luckiest man in the world if I could
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:52,895	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	60
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:58,527	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	In order to get 260 I had to get 250 and then 255
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:03,135	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And then at age 60 when I got listed or thereabouts
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:04,671	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	You know then
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:07,743	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	On A Five-Year Plan where no longer came along

EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:23,423	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	See if you can get the pound of flesh but if any blood of Antonio comes

EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:38,432	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Okay so here's my question
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:45,088	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	How far by myself out cuz it's such a complicated question
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:46,368	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Are we going to start
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:48,160	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I do have a question
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:48,672	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Okay
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:50,976	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So here's my question why question is
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:53,792	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	How far back in time
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:54,560	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Could I go
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:57,376	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And say a word that
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:22:01,216	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	You are like an English word a word that means whatever it means to me in English
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:02,752	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:05,824	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	No I didn't do it yet
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:11,968	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Hard Rihanna so hard I know I can't even write this in an email so that it was communicated to you
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:12,736	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I don't know
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:14,784	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Okay so here's my here's my question
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:16,832	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	If I could walk
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:21,952	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Into Bill and Ted's time machine and go back as far as possible
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:24,512	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Step out and say a word in English
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:26,304	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What word could I say
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:32,960	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That the person whose hearing they would understand exactly what it means because the same
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:34,496	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Sounded meaning
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:36,288	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Have been retained across time
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:41,152	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What is the oldest word that I can say in English that the
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:43,968	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Possible person from
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:47,040	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Totally different Ivan culture like they would think I'd say the word and they be like
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:54,976	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yes I understand you don't know how they would respond cuz I don't know their language but they would they would know what I'm saying
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:55,488	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Know what I'm saying
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:57,024	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	How what is that word
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:58,048	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Does that make sense
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:23:01,376	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yeah I think that's it I think it's great
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:06,240	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What an odd question what is the oldest English word
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:07,520	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It hasn't changed
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:09,568	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yeah and I asked Jason do you have a guess
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:10,848	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Oh
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:13,920	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	He was like maybe something basic tree
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:15,456	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Like something just Elemento
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:16,224	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Grass
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:16,992	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Dirt
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:17,760	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Water
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:18,528	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That's
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:19,808	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Probably where it would go
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:23,136	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:24,416	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:26,976	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Just started calling around hello
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:29,280	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Sara Sara hello
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:31,328	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	1st percentile
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:32,864	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Westerra
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:39,264	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Thomas and professor of linguistics at the University of Michigan and she told me I can get you six thousand years back
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:41,824	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	4000 BC
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:43,872	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Which is when you have this language known as
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:44,896	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Proto-indo-european
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:46,432	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Pro 200 European
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:47,712	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	FB
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:54,112	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Ultimate ancestor of English and all its relatives are known as Indo-European languages
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:24:00,512	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So proto-indo-european is like the great great great grandparent of Greek German
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:04,096	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Dutch most languages in India all over the world
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:08,448	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Colonization by the way
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:11,776	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The Proto Indo Europeans
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:12,800	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So we talking about like
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:18,176	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Tribal Forest people from in the people in Eastern Europe near the Black
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:23,808	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Sort of fisherman little bit of hunting
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:24,832	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:28,416	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So how long was this against 6000 years
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:30,208	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And I think my best guess
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:33,792	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Forward that would have been understood way back then
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:35,072	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Is
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:36,096	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The word is
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:38,400	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And why did she think that was the oldest one
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:40,704	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So the way that you thinking about it was
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:41,984	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Certain
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:46,336	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Consonants like T&K or 6000 years changed a lot
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:46,848	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But ass
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:49,152	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Didn't change very much
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:51,200	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Underground
EDL	00:24:51,200	00:24:53,248	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But they're told me that the way you would have pronounced is
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:54,784	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Is
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:55,808	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	St
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:25:02,208	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	At the end that's not to say it's not the same I know I know it's not the same so I kept calling
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:03,744	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Around
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:09,888	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Describe on another linguists and I work on language change and language documentation
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:14,240	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	My question and she was like okay
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:16,544	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	How about the word for me
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:17,824	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Me
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:18,592	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yep
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:24,736	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Simple it's Elemental and turned off that 6000 years ago me

EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:57,504	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Love you
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:26:00,320	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Words that really have not changed that much
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:01,600	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So the English word
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:02,112	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	3
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:06,208	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	6 eat an apple into what would those like
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:11,840	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Proto-indo-european pronunciation speed
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:12,608	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Estrellas
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:13,376	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	+ 6
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:14,144	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Is swac
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:16,448	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Apple is horrible
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:19,264	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Eat is Ed
EDL	00:26:19,264	00:26:20,544	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	No none of that
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:26,944	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yeah well maybe the answer is there is no word to survive so they're just going to get as close as they can
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:30,784	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Answer your question exactly but I can get under the
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:35,136	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Under the cloud that covers the subject switches
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:40,256	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Super satisfying right I mean like why what I want isn't it as a very precise
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:41,536	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	You know
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:43,584	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Literally the exact same word
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:46,656	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And so I thought like well maybe I can't go back to 6
EDL	00:26:46,656	00:26:48,192	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Thousand years I can go back
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:48,960	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	600
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:53,824	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Something and so how's it going
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:55,616	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I got in touch with this guy Andrew rate
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:27:01,760	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Professor of English at the University of Louisville
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:03,296	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Period in England
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:05,088	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Pretty much between 500
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:07,136	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	In 1066
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:13,536	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Very modern now okay what's what's the word
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:15,840	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Word must be an Old English word
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:21,216	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So much of our language obviously comes from Old English words
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:24,032	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Percent or so
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:25,312	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Come to us directly from molding
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:27,360	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It has to be holding
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:29,920	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Thinking
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:30,432	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What if
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:35,296	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Not what if it were something all the way back with
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:39,136	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Proto-indo-european
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:42,720	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Cuz Andrew went about this a different way
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:46,816	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Keith Wade Andrew was thinking about this
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:49,120	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Is he was looking for an English word
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:49,888	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Sounds
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:51,936	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The same or really similar in a
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:53,984	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Bunch of other Indo-European languages
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:57,568	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Cuz if you could find that word that was shared among these languages
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:28:01,152	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That it would it would mean that they were all holding on to
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:01,664	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Something
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:08,832	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	From Proto Indo European European languages together
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:09,856	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	More words for father
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:12,672	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Dough Latin
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:14,208	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Has popped air
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:17,536	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Old English has father North Bossier
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:18,560	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	German boxer
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:22,912	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And then you also realize that mother in German
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:26,240	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Masters polish the same way
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:32,640	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So he went to his dictionary of proto-indo-european and he's looked up father and mother and they're not quite the same
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:33,408	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Mother is
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:36,480	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Something like mother and father is
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:37,760	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Something like
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:42,624	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But we did find is at in the dictionary right under the words mother and father
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:43,904	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Ready to other words
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:44,928	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Mama
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:45,952	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And Papa
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:49,280	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Mama and Papa Mama and Papa
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:50,816	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Mama and Papa
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:57,216	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So yeah if we almost almost certainly if we went back to Eastern
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:29:00,032	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Millennium BCE and we said
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:00,544	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Mama
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:01,568	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Or Papa
EDL	00:29:02,080	00:29:03,104	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	They would have understood
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:07,200	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That's just a little
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:08,224	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Who
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:12,576	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	God are you raining on my mind
EDL	00:29:12,576	00:29:14,112	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Of course
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:18,464	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Why do I think about myself of course it would be sure it's like babies
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:18,976	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	First words
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:25,632	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The thing that did surprise me that I thought was really cool and talking to Andrew is that the words Mama and Papa
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:27,168	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	In virtually
EDL	00:29:27,168	00:29:27,936	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Every
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:28,704	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Language
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:31,264	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So obviously all the languages that come from Proto into your
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:35,360	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Mama in Norwegian
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:36,896	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Mama in Italian
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:37,664	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Papa's
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:39,456	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Or apus grandfather
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:45,088	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But also the more sound patterns in Chinese
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:48,416	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Amma and APPA like it's not just Indo-European language
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:49,952	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The sound show up in
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:54,560	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Swahili in Eskimo and Hebrew Arabic
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:56,096	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The linguistic Universal
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:29:57,888	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	They just go right across the board
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:30:00,960	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	She just came up with an answer that's I get for everybody
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:03,776	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yeah you find me sounds in a vast majority of languages
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:09,920	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And why is that because you said that no one's really quite sure but maybe the
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:10,432	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:13,504	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	M sound because it only involves the lips
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:14,272	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The vocal cords
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:16,064	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Papa's
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:16,832	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The sound
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:18,880	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I was just to take away easy for babies
EDL	00:30:18,880	00:30:20,160	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It's been gif
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:20,928	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Perhaps
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:22,720	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The whip movie
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:24,512	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Involved in Fang
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:25,024	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Mama
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:26,816	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Similar to lip movement
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:28,096	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Involved in
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:29,632	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Latching onto a woman's breast
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:32,960	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Ultimately we don't really know
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:36,288	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Why release the babies know what they're not telling
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:37,568	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But you know what
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:38,848	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The very fact
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:41,152	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	First words we learn to say as babies
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:43,456	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The oldest word
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:46,016	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Potential really lovely thought
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:49,344	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Oh

EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:55,744	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Is that where they come from
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:31:01,888	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Are we saying mama and papa because desert sounds babies can make yes the easiest sounds I can make ya exactly that's awesome

EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:11,616	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Was thinking at first about basics
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:15,200	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Trees and stuff but this is this but actually that wasn't
EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:15,712	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Basically
EDL	00:31:16,480	00:31:18,784	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The most basic thing is the
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:22,368	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	First relationship that you can understand
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:24,672	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And the first sound that you can make about it
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:27,744	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That's the most basic cats

EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:46,688	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	For some reason
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:48,480	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Shouldn't

EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:06,816	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It just means you bring back and say
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:10,656	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Maybe it was the moment that I
EDL	00:33:10,656	00:33:14,240	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:16,800	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Or maybe the kid was a piano
EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:20,896	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of the musical score
EDL	00:33:21,408	00:33:25,760	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:27,296	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	We're interested in the

EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:40,512	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Maybe we could start by
EDL	00:34:41,792	00:34:42,560	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	How would you feel if I
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:43,584	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Called you a neanderthal
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:44,864	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I would feel
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:46,144	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Like a
EDL	00:34:46,656	00:34:47,424	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Dummy
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:48,448	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Dum dum yeah
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:50,752	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Feels like something you said to me
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:51,776	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Big dumb men
EDL	00:34:54,336	00:34:56,640	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And then so if I see the word Neanderthal what do you visualize
EDL	00:34:57,408	00:34:58,688	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Like a bigger
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:35:00,224	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Had like a big block head
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:02,016	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	A really big barrel
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:02,784	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Chest
EDL	00:35:02,784	00:35:03,552	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And what is that
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:04,576	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What is the per
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:05,088	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Person doing
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:07,136	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Punching stuff
EDL	00:35:10,208	00:35:13,280	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What country
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:17,632	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Anything around I think the image that comes to mind is something Harrier
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:19,424	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Club
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:20,704	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Hunched over

EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:24,032	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	This is Evelyn Jugo de IMAP
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:25,824	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Blind in Harvard
EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:27,360	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Human evolutionary biology Department
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:31,968	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Unlike most people you know researching a topic she's got a Google alert
EDL	00:35:31,968	00:35:33,504	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Set up for the word neanderthal
EDL	00:35:33,504	00:35:34,528	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	About half
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:40,928	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The time it's an actual size story about neanderthals and the other half of the time
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:47,328	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Absolutely Andrew Saul on trefoil using the word Neanderthal to me in
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:48,864	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Finance referred to her
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:50,400	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Eyes and I quote
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:55,520	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	A neanderthal make me angry
EDL	00:35:55,520	00:35:58,080	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Evelyn says his image of Neanderthals is just
EDL	00:35:58,592	00:35:59,616	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Just not quite
EDL	00:36:01,920	00:36:02,944	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It needs an update
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:07,296	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yes I remember you saying last we spoke on the phone kind of the way that we think about Android
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:10,368	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Did you say Saul or tall
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:12,672	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I honestly can never decide what I say
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:19,840	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I think so but I feel like a bit of a weiner when I say meander
EDL	00:36:19,840	00:36:24,704	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I feel like such a
EDL	00:36:24,704	00:36:27,264	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	OK Google when do the wrong image
EDL	00:36:27,776	00:36:28,800	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Stuck in a brain
EDL	00:36:28,800	00:36:30,848	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yeah so it got that her brains about
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:37,248	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	100 years ago in France with this guy named Marshall on bull use a payload paleoanthropologist
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:41,600	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And when he was in his lab in Paris
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:44,160	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And he was brought
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:45,184	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	This
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:47,744	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	This at the time with most complete
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:48,768	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	NFL skeleton ever found
EDL	00:36:49,280	00:36:53,120	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Which is very exciting and so we took a look at the skeleton and what he sees is
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:55,680	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Something small something
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:57,216	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Curled over
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:36:58,496	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Hunched
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:37:00,032	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Decrepit
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:04,896	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Any interpreter set insert a famous drawing based off his interpretation turns out to look like this
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:07,456	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Hunched-over 8-man
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:10,784	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That is where we get our ideas about one skeleton then
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:11,552	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Became
EDL	00:37:11,552	00:37:13,088	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What we now think of today
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:15,904	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Colloquially as what Indian Palace
EDL	00:37:16,416	00:37:16,928	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:23,328	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It turned out that this particular skeleton actually had regular arthritis
EDL	00:37:24,864	00:37:26,656	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Skeleton
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:29,472	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Oh but you just thought that's the way it was
EDL	00:37:30,240	00:37:34,336	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Exactly yeah it's like an alien species coming and finding the
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:36,384	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The skeleton they find that represents Humanities
EDL	00:37:37,152	00:37:42,784	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	85 year old woman in a wheelchair something like everybody looks like this
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:48,928	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And it's so tell me a little bit about what do we know about neanderthals now what are the things that are
EDL	00:37:50,720	00:37:51,744	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	We are learning
EDL	00:37:51,744	00:37:53,536	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	How are they evolving in our mine
EDL	00:37:53,536	00:37:57,120	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I would say that going from that brutish woolly mammoth
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:58,400	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Primitive Neanderthal picture
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:38:00,192	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Okay a lot of Sciences
EDL	00:38:00,192	00:38:00,704	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Today
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:05,568	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Have more of a sense of esl as a different flavor of you
EDL	00:38:08,384	00:38:09,408	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Bring me to my question
EDL	00:38:10,432	00:38:15,296	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Hey so so a few months back and I we were making this
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:17,088	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Story about using help his leader
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:19,648	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Speed hybrid polar bear grizzly bears
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:22,208	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	You were there
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:25,280	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And while we were hanging out in studio
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:31,680	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I thought that two different I was trying to explain to you just how far apart evolutionarily
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:38,080	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	These grizzly bears and polar bears are evolutionarily like hundreds of thousands of years ago
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:44,480	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Pretty much the same time that we broke off from the Neanderthals and so be like us meeting a neanderthal
EDL	00:38:44,480	00:38:48,064	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Odin the you know is the Crown Heights bar or something
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:51,392	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Going home a person and creating
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:58,304	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It's really specific it sounds like you had
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:39:01,632	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Franklin Ave April 10th
EDL	00:39:01,632	00:39:08,032	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Show me the kind of dumb joke it is very silly
EDL	00:39:08,032	00:39:14,432	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The question kind of stuck around my mind at the Lutheran like wheat what would that be like as a funny image meeting NFL in a bar
EDL	00:39:14,432	00:39:18,784	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Relate to each other what would we do we have anything, are we at all
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:22,880	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Tools that you question like if you met of the installer bar what would it be like
EDL	00:39:23,392	00:39:24,928	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yeah like could we communicate
EDL	00:39:24,928	00:39:25,952	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What would it sound like
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:27,232	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Ha
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:28,768	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	This is why I originally called Evelyn chicken
EDL	00:39:29,280	00:39:29,792	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Okay
EDL	00:39:30,304	00:39:31,328	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Help me imagine
EDL	00:39:32,352	00:39:36,192	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And we can be suspected of here so you're free to step out of here I like
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:42,848	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Scientist hiding from your artists hat or whatever you want to do
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:46,944	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I was even today I was even put that part and I will see I will
EDL	00:39:47,456	00:39:49,248	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Okay
EDL	00:39:49,760	00:39:52,320	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	You want to tell me you would have said the same okay
EDL	00:39:52,320	00:39:53,088	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So where are you
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:54,880	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Okay let's just say I'm at
EDL	00:39:54,880	00:39:55,648	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	A

EDL	00:39:57,696	00:39:59,744	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Cool the lights really dim
EDL	00:40:00,256	00:40:02,048	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The music is kind of like that likes
EDL	00:40:02,048	00:40:06,144	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Amy Rush on the symbols type of bags
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:12,288	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Maybe it's raining outside or just finished raining and I'm shaking my umbrella
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:17,408	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And I look around and I see you at service scattering of homo sapiens
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:23,040	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Summer summer playing pool
EDL	00:40:23,040	00:40:25,856	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Tell me why are we living in reality
EDL	00:40:26,368	00:40:30,720	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Sometimes it's homo sapiens and sometimes your standard fellows or is this just how you be a special night
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:38,400	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I'm looking around at all the people and interests
EDL	00:40:38,400	00:40:41,728	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	On this one guy
EDL	00:40:43,264	00:40:44,032	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Fairly robust
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:51,456	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	He's got red hair red hair red hair brown hair and most of it was on their head
EDL	00:40:51,456	00:40:53,248	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So they didn't really have much more body hair than
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:58,368	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The implication of that is that you must have had fire
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:04,512	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Are you playing it cool or you or you just like gawking what are you doing how close are you
EDL	00:41:04,512	00:41:08,864	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I don't like Sidle up to him and and then slip into the the stool next to him
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:09,632	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	You notice
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:10,400	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	His Highness

EDL	00:41:27,040	00:41:30,112	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It's been a long day
EDL	00:41:31,392	00:41:34,464	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Evelyn says that there's no evidence that neanderthals use plants
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:36,000	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	To make medicine
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:37,536	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	For more incredibly they also like
EDL	00:41:38,048	00:41:40,096	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	After their sick in their elderly
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:44,704	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The good people I know you got to get home to care for his grandma
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:49,312	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	You're captivated you like this is something different but
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:50,336	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Familiar
EDL	00:41:50,848	00:41:56,735	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	You don't realize it's nobody guess that's just how short he is completely by
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:42:01,087	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I'm like oh my gosh
EDL	00:42:01,087	00:42:04,159	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	We are aware in my question
EDL	00:42:04,671	00:42:05,439	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	We're just looking at each other
EDL	00:42:05,951	00:42:10,559	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And I just wonder what's the next step
EDL	00:42:10,559	00:42:12,607	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Any talk could neanderthals talk
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:18,495	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	This is one of the great debates about whether it is Alzheimer's
EDL	00:42:18,495	00:42:20,543	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	We don't technically know if they could
EDL	00:42:20,543	00:42:24,383	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Talk but it's really hard to tell just by looking at their DNA and their skeletal remains
EDL	00:42:24,895	00:42:25,663	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:27,455	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	There's the check out all this stuff
EDL	00:42:28,991	00:42:31,551	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Evelyn says that they had a variety of
EDL	00:42:31,551	00:42:36,927	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	They're able to hunt mammoths Robin ball game art yes like
EDL	00:42:36,927	00:42:37,695	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Geometric
EDL	00:42:37,695	00:42:38,719	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Keep getting
EDL	00:42:38,719	00:42:41,535	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And furthermore the other things that there's
EDL	00:42:42,047	00:42:45,119	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Evidence of dance on Saturday
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:48,191	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And you think like with all those things
EDL	00:42:49,215	00:42:52,799	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	How could they have done it without communication they just make me think they had language
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:54,335	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yeah
EDL	00:42:54,335	00:42:55,359	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yeah it makes me think that too
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:43:00,479	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Okay so if they could talk
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:02,015	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What would that sound like
EDL	00:43:02,015	00:43:04,575	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What would this guy at the bar what would his voice
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:07,647	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Oh goodness that some
EDL	00:43:07,647	00:43:08,415	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Hesperian
EDL	00:43:09,951	00:43:11,231	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	This is a human
EDL	00:43:11,231	00:43:12,255	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	This is a human throat
EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:14,303	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	This is a neanderthal
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:16,351	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	BBC documentary
EDL	00:43:16,351	00:43:18,655	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Made back in 2005 where they tried to answer the
EDL	00:43:18,655	00:43:23,775	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The question so I imagine that they wouldn't have Shuffle sound it would be loud very loud
EDL	00:43:23,775	00:43:26,847	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Very very loud vocal coach and she is
EDL	00:43:26,847	00:43:32,735	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Third of interpreting all the things that they then knew about neanderthals bigger head bigger nasal cavity
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:35,295	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Chest and then getting dressed
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:37,087	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Into an actor
EDL	00:43:37,087	00:43:38,367	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So this voice is it create
EDL	00:43:39,903	00:43:40,671	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Bring it back
EDL	00:43:41,695	00:43:42,719	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Into my barsi
EDL	00:43:42,719	00:43:44,511	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And imagine my Asus neanderthal
EDL	00:43:45,023	00:43:46,559	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I have your number
EDL	00:43:46,559	00:43:49,887	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	According to BBC his response would have sounded something like this
EDL	00:43:49,887	00:43:50,655	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	No
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:51,167	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Speak
EDL	00:43:58,079	00:43:58,847	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Now let's make
EDL	00:43:58,847	00:43:59,871	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Make a sound
EDL	00:44:00,383	00:44:00,895	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Huge
EDL	00:44:04,223	00:44:10,367	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Again is it that that was the voice that came up with base in the science
EDL	00:44:12,415	00:44:16,767	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But you know I got like 14 years of past in a probably decides his updated
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:17,791	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What is
EDL	00:44:18,559	00:44:21,887	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What is the better answer that question today what is a more up-to-date version of this voice
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:24,959	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Dr. Barney are you there
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:26,495	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So I called up dr. Anna Barney
EDL	00:44:28,543	00:44:34,431	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Institute of sound and vibration research in University of Southampton
EDL	00:44:34,431	00:44:36,479	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Does question partly by focusing on this
EDL	00:44:36,479	00:44:37,503	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Tiny little u-shaped
EDL	00:44:40,831	00:44:42,367	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The tongue
EDL	00:44:42,367	00:44:43,647	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And anybody who reads
EDL	00:44:43,647	00:44:45,695	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Murder mysteries will know that because it's the one that
EDL	00:44:46,207	00:44:48,511	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Tax when you strangle so sweet baby.
EDL	00:44:50,047	00:44:52,863	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Sodus bone is a very important little bone for me
EDL	00:44:52,863	00:44:53,375	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Sounds
EDL	00:44:54,399	00:44:55,935	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	A neanderthal skeleton
EDL	00:44:55,935	00:44:56,447	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Habitue
EDL	00:44:56,959	00:44:59,007	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But it hasn't really been clearly
EDL	00:44:59,007	00:45:00,031	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Exactly how they used it
EDL	00:45:00,543	00:45:01,823	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Did they use it in the same way we do
EDL	00:45:02,335	00:45:08,735	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So doctor Bernie's team using computer modeling they sort of did a bunch of things to figure out where the hyoid bone probably sad
EDL	00:45:08,735	00:45:10,271	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	In the neck of a neanderthal
EDL	00:45:10,271	00:45:13,087	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Escape is a slightly different shape of vocal tract
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:16,671	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Turn human
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:18,719	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Digitally push something like
EDL	00:45:18,719	00:45:19,999	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Rest through it
EDL	00:45:19,999	00:45:21,023	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Puffs of wind
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:22,559	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What sounds were you going for
EDL	00:45:22,559	00:45:24,095	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	We were interested in water
EDL	00:45:24,095	00:45:25,119	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Kodachrome sold out
EDL	00:45:26,911	00:45:33,055	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And then those are the ones if you can produce those then you've got the range of sounds that the mobile human can make income
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:35,615	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The primary colors of
EDL	00:45:36,127	00:45:37,407	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The basis of
EDL	00:45:37,407	00:45:41,503	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Speeches that right that's right yes you could think of some assessment and Atticus to this primary
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:45,343	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So the idea is if they could say these three vowels
EDL	00:45:45,343	00:45:47,647	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It would have been physically tape
EDL	00:45:47,647	00:45:49,183	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Full of some kind of language
EDL	00:45:49,183	00:45:51,231	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Which structure is okay and what
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:55,583	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Did you find a note we found a very good match
EDL	00:45:56,863	00:45:58,655	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It sounds a bit
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:45:59,935	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Stole compared
EDL	00:45:59,935	00:46:00,703	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	2
EDL	00:46:00,703	00:46:01,983	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The most inhuman
EDL	00:46:01,983	00:46:03,263	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What does it sound like
EDL	00:46:03,775	00:46:05,311	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	A bit more like
EDL	00:46:07,871	00:46:08,895	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Their ass be
EDL	00:46:08,895	00:46:09,919	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Become Oz
EDL	00:46:09,919	00:46:12,991	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yeah so they still screaming yelling like the thing in the BBC
EDL	00:46:12,991	00:46:17,599	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What would a saint about that she said based on what we know now there's no real evidence
EDL	00:46:18,367	00:46:22,719	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That account see why they wouldn't have the whole range of being able to whisper and being able to shout
EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:31,423	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I feel like Neanderthal women
EDL	00:46:31,423	00:46:36,287	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Just like excluded from the depiction of true
EDL	00:46:41,151	00:46:42,687	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	There were Neanderthals live in
EDL	00:46:42,687	00:46:46,527	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Wow okay maybe I should have maybe I should meet an ESL women across the bar
EDL	00:46:48,575	00:46:49,855	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That's my kind of story
EDL	00:46:49,855	00:46:51,391	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Okay so let's return to our nyanners
EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:52,927	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It's over this time
EDL	00:46:52,927	00:46:54,207	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Inside of a man
EDL	00:46:56,511	00:46:57,279	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	All right
EDL	00:46:57,279	00:46:59,583	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It's 100 Fun character switch
EDL	00:47:00,095	00:47:04,959	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And like the BBC 14 years ago I bought a new voice actor
EDL	00:47:04,959	00:47:06,751	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Sandra Clark
EDL	00:47:08,031	00:47:10,079	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	To be my Neanderthal how tall are you
EDL	00:47:12,127	00:47:12,895	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Perfect
EDL	00:47:12,895	00:47:15,711	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Beforehand that actually Workshop it's a couple
EDL	00:47:15,711	00:47:16,223	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Of
EDL	00:47:16,991	00:47:19,039	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	In a bar appropriate phrases
EDL	00:47:19,039	00:47:21,087	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I guess you could say with Anna Barney the sounds
EDL	00:47:21,599	00:47:23,903	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Like what could we have this man
EDL	00:47:24,927	00:47:26,719	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I was thinking like
EDL	00:47:28,255	00:47:30,303	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Hello you are beautiful or
EDL	00:47:30,303	00:47:33,631	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Did it hurt when you fell from heaven that kind of thing
EDL	00:47:33,631	00:47:36,447	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Buttchin kind of a different idea and you gave me this one
EDL	00:47:36,447	00:47:41,055	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So weird but it really does highlight that special vowels
EDL	00:47:43,615	00:47:44,127	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Patience
EDL	00:47:44,895	00:47:47,199	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Nugget so I'm standing next to this
EDL	00:47:47,199	00:47:47,711	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Women
EDL	00:47:48,479	00:47:50,271	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	They just imagine the sister of the other
EDL	00:47:50,271	00:47:54,111	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	She's got brown hair
EDL	00:47:54,111	00:47:55,903	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The same piercing brown eyes
EDL	00:47:56,415	00:47:57,695	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And I just say
EDL	00:47:58,207	00:47:58,719	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Hey
EDL	00:47:59,743	00:48:00,767	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And she pauses for ammo
EDL	00:48:03,071	00:48:04,095	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And then she says
EDL	00:48:05,631	00:48:06,143	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The cart
EDL	00:48:06,655	00:48:07,167	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Thought
EDL	00:48:07,679	00:48:08,447	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	On the mall
EDL	00:48:08,959	00:48:10,495	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The cat sat on the map
EDL	00:48:12,799	00:48:15,871	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Pink sheep
EDL	00:48:15,871	00:48:21,759	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	There's back there's vowels in it you got your vowels
EDL	00:48:21,759	00:48:23,551	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Kind of lean in you know it's mysterious
EDL	00:48:24,831	00:48:25,599	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So
EDL	00:48:25,599	00:48:26,623	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Come here often
EDL	00:48:27,391	00:48:27,903	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yes
EDL	00:48:28,927	00:48:29,695	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I'm Annie
EDL	00:48:30,207	00:48:32,767	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That's right my name that's my name
EDL	00:48:34,815	00:48:35,583	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Can I have your number
EDL	00:48:36,863	00:48:38,143	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Can I have yours
EDL	00:48:38,655	00:48:39,167	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yeah
EDL	00:48:40,191	00:48:40,959	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It's one two three
EDL	00:48:44,543	00:48:45,567	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Revere Aires
EDL	00:48:46,591	00:48:50,687	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I'm picking you up at school
EDL	00:48:50,687	00:48:51,967	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	No face looks
EDL	00:48:52,735	00:48:54,527	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So it's not too dramatic this
EDL	00:48:55,295	00:48:57,087	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Which I think is itself dramatic
EDL	00:48:59,647	00:49:02,719	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	No I just think it's so totally amazing how similar their
EDL	00:49:03,231	00:49:07,583	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The more and more we learn about them the closer and closer they become to being
EDL	00:49:08,095	00:49:09,631	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Very close cousins
EDL	00:49:09,631	00:49:10,143	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The caught
EDL	00:49:10,655	00:49:11,167	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Thought
EDL	00:49:11,679	00:49:15,007	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	On the mall not only a close cousin or actually a part of us
EDL	00:49:15,007	00:49:15,775	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	For a lot of things
EDL	00:49:19,359	00:49:21,919	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	For a lot of us we have a 2% Neanderthal DNA
EDL	00:49:21,919	00:49:22,687	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Init
EDL	00:49:22,687	00:49:23,967	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	When I spoke to another scientist
EDL	00:49:28,575	00:49:31,647	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Asking all these scientist what would it be like to meet and yes I want a bar
EDL	00:49:31,647	00:49:32,927	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	She actually had this.
EDL	00:49:38,559	00:49:44,447	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	All around today because if we each carry about 2%
EDL	00:49:44,447	00:49:45,727	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I'm leaving.
EDL	00:49:45,727	00:49:50,335	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Especially when you consider
EDL	00:49:51,359	00:49:52,895	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So actually a monkey
EDL	00:49:53,663	00:49:54,943	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	She was living today
EDL	00:49:54,943	00:49:59,807	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	We have that I'm guessing it's very right now but
EDL	00:49:59,807	00:50:02,111	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	70%
EDL	00:50:02,111	00:50:03,903	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Beijing, Japan
EDL	00:50:03,903	00:50:04,927	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Living today
EDL	00:50:04,927	00:50:06,975	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What is she saying if you take all the 2%

EDL	00:51:35,039	00:51:41,183	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yes it comes from our gang like the other ones but this one just is so
EDL	00:51:41,183	00:51:42,207	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Wonderful
EDL	00:51:42,207	00:51:46,559	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Weird Siri quality this one so if this time it won't be I want to dedicate
EDL	00:51:46,559	00:51:47,583	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What's about to happen
EDL	00:51:47,583	00:51:51,423	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	2 people who are living in New York when I was growing up named mr. and mrs. purple
EDL	00:51:52,191	00:51:55,263	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Are these people who just drove on a purple bicycle dress
EDL	00:51:55,263	00:51:57,823	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Can only purple and lavender tie dye clothing
EDL	00:51:58,335	00:51:59,871	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Had purple colored hair

EDL	00:52:02,175	00:52:03,199	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And they were just
EDL	00:52:03,199	00:52:05,247	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Very purple and they were always
EDL	00:52:05,247	00:52:08,575	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Here there New York and they became a kind of legendary
EDL	00:52:08,575	00:52:10,623	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Free prints free prints
EDL	00:52:10,623	00:52:11,391	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And I'm sorry
EDL	00:52:11,391	00:52:12,671	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Sicknesses purple
EDL	00:52:13,183	00:52:13,951	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Right now
EDL	00:52:13,951	00:52:15,231	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Heaven
EDL	00:52:15,231	00:52:15,999	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But there
EDL	00:52:15,999	00:52:19,071	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Heaven might very well be perfectly described
EDL	00:52:19,583	00:52:20,095	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Bible Church
EDL	00:52:20,863	00:52:21,375	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Interesting
EDL	00:52:21,887	00:52:22,399	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Pinterest
EDL	00:52:22,911	00:52:26,239	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Okay so me let me set it up so this is this comes from producer Rachel Cusick
EDL	00:52:26,751	00:52:29,567	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Rachel in addition to making radio with us
EDL	00:52:30,591	00:52:32,895	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Formerly was a professional maker of food
EDL	00:52:33,663	00:52:34,687	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Xi'an
EDL	00:52:34,687	00:52:36,735	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	She worked in a she worked in a restaurant for 2 years
EDL	00:52:38,015	00:52:39,551	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I would call her a professional cook
EDL	00:52:39,551	00:52:40,319	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Although Apparently that is
EDL	00:52:41,087	00:52:42,111	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Maybe putting a
EDL	00:52:42,111	00:52:42,879	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Strongly
EDL	00:52:42,879	00:52:44,671	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Queen Rachel but she's a food wizard
EDL	00:52:46,463	00:52:47,743	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Regularly every couple of weeks
EDL	00:52:48,255	00:52:49,535	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	We'll bring in these like
EDL	00:52:50,303	00:52:52,351	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Food inventions that she makes
EDL	00:52:52,863	00:52:54,655	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	In the wee hours of the night
EDL	00:52:54,655	00:52:57,727	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Like a hallucinogenic lees colored rainbow
EDL	00:52:57,727	00:52:59,519	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Shortbread cookie things
EDL	00:52:59,519	00:53:01,311	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Incredibly delicious
EDL	00:53:01,823	00:53:03,615	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But also incredibly weird
EDL	00:53:03,615	00:53:05,663	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That will set you up for what's about to happen
EDL	00:53:05,663	00:53:06,431	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	For sure
EDL	00:53:06,431	00:53:08,735	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yes so she ran into this question that
EDL	00:53:08,735	00:53:09,759	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I guess you could say
EDL	00:53:10,271	00:53:11,551	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Combines all of that
EDL	00:53:11,551	00:53:17,695	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And throws in a bit of science as well as science meets food meets journalism like intersection that I'll
EDL	00:53:18,207	00:53:20,255	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yeah this is my wheelhouse
EDL	00:53:20,255	00:53:21,791	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Customer begins with this guy
EDL	00:53:21,791	00:53:22,303	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	How are you doing
EDL	00:53:22,815	00:53:29,215	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Hi how's it going with excellent but can I ask you to introduce yourself so I'm under Sandberg
EDL	00:53:29,215	00:53:33,567	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I'm a senior research fellow at the Oxford Martin school at
EDL	00:53:33,567	00:53:35,359	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	University of Oxford
EDL	00:53:35,359	00:53:39,711	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So I guess to start I was wondering if you could tell me how you first
EDL	00:53:39,711	00:53:40,991	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Stumbled across this
EDL	00:53:40,991	00:53:44,319	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Set the scene for me where were you what were you doing well
EDL	00:53:48,159	00:53:50,719	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That was going back to my office in Oxford
EDL	00:53:50,719	00:53:51,743	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Use on a bus
EDL	00:53:51,743	00:53:53,023	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Coming back from a meeting
EDL	00:53:53,023	00:53:58,655	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It's summer it's warmer than the I'm tinkering with my laptop because the counter side is pretty boring
EDL	00:53:59,679	00:54:05,823	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So deserving around do they like Wi-Fi on buses
EDL	00:54:07,871	00:54:08,639	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So dedicated that
EDL	00:54:08,639	00:54:09,407	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	He brings his own form of
EDL	00:54:10,175	00:54:11,455	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Anyhow
EDL	00:54:11,455	00:54:12,223	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Who's on the bus
EDL	00:54:12,735	00:54:16,831	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And she starts answering questions from this website called stack
EDL	00:54:16,831	00:54:18,367	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Exchange
EDL	00:54:18,367	00:54:20,415	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It's it's I think of it like Yahoo answers
EDL	00:54:20,415	00:54:25,023	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But for like science nerds where people post questions summer science related
EDL	00:54:25,023	00:54:26,815	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And then anyone can come in answer
EDL	00:54:26,815	00:54:33,215	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Who are these people are these all smart like atomizer and no I think it's kind of like teenagers who want help with homework and then there's
EDL	00:54:33,215	00:54:35,519	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	They're just random Joe schmoes who like are taking a break
EDL	00:54:35,519	00:54:37,055	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Reddit and they're like let me
EDL	00:54:37,055	00:54:38,079	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Show you how I can
EDL	00:54:38,079	00:54:39,871	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	China right now
EDL	00:54:39,871	00:54:41,663	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And then there's Anders
EDL	00:54:41,663	00:54:43,711	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Scrolling
EDL	00:54:44,223	00:54:48,319	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Baby looking out the window every now and then and then he like that a certain point on the ride
EDL	00:54:50,367	00:54:51,135	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Cease
EDL	00:54:51,135	00:54:51,647	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Bizquest
EDL	00:54:52,159	00:54:53,951	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What if Earth turn into blueberries
EDL	00:54:55,487	00:54:58,303	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It was probably just like that like what if the Earth turned into blueberries
EDL	00:54:58,815	00:54:59,839	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	More or less
EDL	00:54:59,839	00:55:02,655	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Golf courses
EDL	00:55:02,655	00:55:06,751	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Blueberries Robert I'm already compressed blueberries
EDL	00:55:06,751	00:55:07,263	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	In other words
EDL	00:55:07,775	00:55:11,615	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Take this Earth We're living on replace that dirt and water and rock within Earth's
EDL	00:55:11,615	00:55:13,407	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Size ball pit of blueberries
EDL	00:55:14,175	00:55:14,687	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What would that look like
EDL	00:55:15,455	00:55:15,967	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What
EDL	00:55:17,247	00:55:18,271	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Why would someone
EDL	00:55:18,271	00:55:18,783	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That quiz
EDL	00:55:19,807	00:55:25,951	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I want to I want to take a moment right now because I think I would not ask that question
EDL	00:55:31,071	00:55:35,167	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Also the kind of person who just needs to be convinced why is this an amazing Quest
EDL	00:55:36,447	00:55:39,775	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Hardcore science is on this website next to sirius science
EDL	00:55:39,775	00:55:40,287	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Questions
EDL	00:55:40,799	00:55:45,663	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But it's also like the most Fantastical form of that it's like let me work within this
EDL	00:55:45,663	00:55:46,943	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Structured world
EDL	00:55:46,943	00:55:48,223	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Like a lot of physics
EDL	00:55:48,223	00:55:50,271	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Planetary science and see where we can
EDL	00:55:50,783	00:55:54,367	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I love what this question I'm a big fan of
EDL	00:55:54,367	00:55:56,671	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Taking some assumptions it where does it live
EDL	00:55:56,671	00:55:59,231	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So Ender says the moment he saw that question pop up
EDL	00:56:00,767	00:56:03,071	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I can totally see how one can answer is
EDL	00:56:03,071	00:56:05,119	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But as soon as enters got started
EDL	00:56:05,631	00:56:10,751	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That the people over at stack exchange the moderators close the question because
EDL	00:56:10,751	00:56:12,287	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Apparently they thought it was too stupid
EDL	00:56:12,287	00:56:16,895	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	When the moderators on Stock Exchange that took down the question Michael's really angry
EDL	00:56:16,895	00:56:17,919	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Why
EDL	00:56:17,919	00:56:23,807	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Wait tell me why you was doing this is a good question because it allows us to exercise
EDL	00:56:23,807	00:56:25,855	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	He's not even a physical ability
EDL	00:56:25,855	00:56:26,623	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I'm an amateur
EDL	00:56:27,135	00:56:33,535	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	He's just like look I'm not even in this world but like these formulas are out there for everyone to use this is like why we have laws
EDL	00:56:33,535	00:56:35,583	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The physics is so that we can imagine
EDL	00:56:35,583	00:56:37,119	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	These new world
EDL	00:56:37,119	00:56:37,631	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Tom Waits
EDL	00:56:38,911	00:56:39,935	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Angelby
EDL	00:56:40,703	00:56:43,775	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Anna
EDL	00:56:44,543	00:56:46,079	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That's actually why I wrote the paper
EDL	00:56:46,591	00:56:51,199	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Array technical paper about the physics of it how
EDL	00:56:51,199	00:56:52,991	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Behave what it would look like what it was
EDL	00:56:52,991	00:56:53,503	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	You like
EDL	00:56:54,527	00:56:58,879	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Can you walk me through just so I have an image in my mind I'm on this blueberry Earth
EDL	00:56:58,879	00:57:00,159	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What's the first thing that I would notice
EDL	00:57:01,183	00:57:02,463	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What you would feel like
EDL	00:57:05,279	00:57:08,095	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	All right this morning
EDL	00:57:08,607	00:57:09,375	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Why is that
EDL	00:57:09,375	00:57:15,775	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Well results show that the density of afterlife in the temperature range between 303 and 353
EDL	00:57:15,775	00:57:21,663	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Ender says if you calculate the density of uncompressed blueberries are about 700 kilos
EDL	00:57:21,663	00:57:22,687	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	A cubic meter
EDL	00:57:22,687	00:57:29,087	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	They got plugged into another formula to calculate how much less Mass with blueberry or have
EDL	00:57:29,087	00:57:31,903	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I'm from / r
EDL	00:57:31,903	00:57:38,047	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	R squared formula to calculate the surface gravity and it turns out that you get about the same crime
EDL	00:57:40,351	00:57:43,679	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	16% of the gravity that you would have on regular
EDL	00:57:44,191	00:57:45,727	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So we can bounce
EDL	00:57:45,727	00:57:51,871	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Accepted so you would be able to bounce around surface of blueberries
EDL	00:57:59,807	00:58:00,575	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Blueberries
EDL	00:58:01,599	00:58:02,623	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Welliver squishable
EDL	00:58:04,159	00:58:10,303	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So Ender says will happen is that as you're bouncing on the surface of blueberries will radiate
EDL	00:58:10,815	00:58:17,215	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Pressure downwards into the center of the planet score
EDL	00:58:17,215	00:58:20,543	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Hooters at the center of the planet will start bursztynowa squishing
EDL	00:58:21,567	00:58:22,591	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	1st and 1st and Bruce
EDL	00:58:23,103	00:58:26,175	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Until it more liquid than it was blueberries at the center
EDL	00:58:27,711	00:58:30,271	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And is that happened
EDL	00:58:30,271	00:58:31,807	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Planet starts to compress
EDL	00:58:31,807	00:58:38,207	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And normally when you pack a blueberry they're like little corners of are tucked in between each one but once that's being replaced with
EDL	00:58:38,207	00:58:40,511	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Liquid that is being squeezed and squeezed
EDL	00:58:40,511	00:58:43,583	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That air has to go somewhere and it gets pushed up
EDL	00:58:43,583	00:58:45,631	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	About like a volcano
EDL	00:58:46,143	00:58:47,935	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Through the core up
EDL	00:58:47,935	00:58:49,215	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	To the surface of blueberry
EDL	00:58:49,983	00:58:50,751	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Who haven't been
EDL	00:58:51,519	00:58:52,287	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Then
EDL	00:58:52,799	00:58:59,199	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Another gaesser start the total gravitational energy of the constant
EDL	00:58:59,199	00:59:05,599	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Density sphere remembers Luna gravity so you going to get the cases
EDL	00:59:05,599	00:59:11,999	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Dairy farm small letter
EDL	00:59:11,999	00:59:18,399	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	We tell me tell me how high up I never seen a geyser this is not a funeral at the Geyser in Yellowstone
EDL	00:59:18,399	00:59:24,799	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Kilometer of the rookie on the water boiling
EDL	00:59:24,799	00:59:28,383	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Meters of moving air a blueberry powder
EDL	00:59:28,383	00:59:32,735	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Just go to be tremendously dramatic
EDL	00:59:33,247	00:59:35,807	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	These guys are they hot they must be hot
EDL	00:59:37,599	00:59:43,999	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	One of those things where you might have noticed if you were pumping up your bike
EDL	00:59:43,999	00:59:48,351	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Prussic acid gets warmer Heat
EDL	00:59:48,351	00:59:53,983	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	You're going to get boiling blueberry jam all over the place
EDL	00:59:55,263	01:00:00,639	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The geishas I think some of them are likely to notice it some of the blueberries into orbit
EDL	01:00:00,639	01:00:07,039	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Well, they're streaking across the sky shooting stars
EDL	01:00:07,039	01:00:07,807	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Imagine
EDL	01:00:07,807	01:00:10,623	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And meanwhile geysers are exploding everywhere
EDL	01:00:10,623	01:00:15,999	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Because all this Jam is a shooting out from the center it has to go somewhere and when it drops back down to earth
EDL	01:00:17,279	01:00:20,351	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It just covers the earth in warm blueberry jam
EDL	01:00:23,423	01:00:25,471	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And so it's no longer like a surface of
EDL	01:00:25,983	01:00:27,775	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Full blueberries it's just like
EDL	01:00:27,775	01:00:33,151	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	An exoplanet like an ocean planet of blueberry jam
EDL	01:00:33,151	01:00:34,431	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yeah
EDL	01:00:34,431	01:00:34,943	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Noland
EDL	01:00:48,767	01:00:50,815	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That's pretty cool to imagine
EDL	01:00:50,815	01:00:54,911	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Is it like an ocean like we would think the notion of kind of similar but
EDL	01:00:54,911	01:01:00,287	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It's going to be like a little bit more nothing like there's going to be massive waves
EDL	01:01:00,799	01:01:05,151	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But here on Earth at some point the wave Galaxy squishies down cuz I be like nah
EDL	01:01:05,151	01:01:11,551	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Gravity Falls Gravity so they can be actually much taller can you
EDL	01:01:11,551	01:01:14,111	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	East Coast surfing on blueberry jam ocean waves
EDL	01:01:14,111	01:01:15,391	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I think you come
EDL	01:01:15,391	01:01:21,791	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	This might be easy for us with not to use the surfing is that they going to be moving more slowly
EDL	01:01:21,791	01:01:27,423	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	That kind of sounds like my ideal to learn how to surf is just to let go slowly in a jam wave
EDL	01:01:27,423	01:01:32,543	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yep and if you fall and you just get to Lake Lane Jam
EDL	01:01:33,055	01:01:33,823	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Okay so
EDL	01:01:35,103	01:01:38,943	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Address Artemis Jam wave which by the way is now your amazing life
EDL	01:01:38,943	01:01:39,967	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	University things
EDL	01:01:40,479	01:01:42,783	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	First you noticed that the air is pretty
EDL	01:01:43,295	01:01:49,695	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	About 10 times bigger than it is on regular Earth which means you go to have enormous clouds
EDL	01:01:49,695	01:01:55,327	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The scale height of the atmosphere
EDL	01:01:55,327	01:01:57,119	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Disgruntled hazy
EDL	01:01:57,119	01:01:58,399	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Disguises
EDL	01:01:58,399	01:02:01,727	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Blue purple white milky color
EDL	01:02:01,727	01:02:02,495	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Swirls
EDL	01:02:02,495	01:02:05,567	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	I think you would probably find that it's going to be relativity
EDL	01:02:06,079	01:02:12,479	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Another thing I noticed is that the days will be a little bit shorter because blueberry or the compressor
EDL	01:02:12,479	01:02:17,087	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	We end up with a planet with .89 time angular momentum conservation gives
EDL	01:02:17,855	01:02:20,671	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So you're there you're surfing and then you look up
EDL	01:02:20,671	01:02:26,815	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The problem for the Moon is it's bound to Earth right now but only because the Earth
EDL	01:02:27,839	01:02:33,215	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Western States blueberries if the mass goes down a lot
EDL	01:02:33,215	01:02:36,799	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Keep hold of it I got a lot of other things that has to worry about
EDL	01:02:36,799	01:02:39,871	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Orbit around the Salton Sea
EDL	01:02:39,871	01:02:40,895	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Recede into the sky
EDL	01:02:44,479	01:02:46,271	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But now we have an interesting problem
EDL	01:02:48,575	01:02:54,207	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	You better or if he's going into an orbit around the Sun and the Moon is also orbit
EDL	01:02:54,207	01:02:55,743	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Roughly in the same orbit
EDL	01:02:56,767	01:02:58,303	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But they're very close
EDL	01:02:58,303	01:03:01,631	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So from time to time you might just see the moon
EDL	01:03:02,143	01:03:08,287	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Swirl by at night time and then eventually according to the mass there will come a time
EDL	01:03:09,311	01:03:15,711	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Bangkok Get Closer Closer Closer
EDL	01:03:15,711	01:03:18,271	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	No pairs of time it's pretty like living
EDL	01:03:20,063	01:03:21,087	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Sooner or later
EDL	01:03:27,999	01:03:34,143	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	They will collide
EDL	01:03:35,167	01:03:37,215	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The blueberry Earth and the moon will collide
EDL	01:03:37,215	01:03:37,983	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Oh yes
EDL	01:03:37,983	01:03:39,519	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It's going to be a big splash
EDL	01:03:40,799	01:03:45,663	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Who's going to win my guess is that the Moondance office of Court on there
EDL	01:03:45,663	01:03:47,199	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Then and now Friday
EDL	01:03:47,711	01:03:48,991	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	It says if we just like
EDL	01:03:48,991	01:03:53,343	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Absorbed the moon and put it into blueberry Earth in this mood and gets to live
EDL	01:03:53,855	01:03:54,879	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	With in blueberries
EDL	01:03:54,879	01:03:55,391	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Forever
EDL	01:03:55,903	01:03:56,927	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	More or less yes
EDL	01:03:56,927	01:04:02,303	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Even imagine the moon splashing into it is probably go to sell blueberry jam at Roseville solar system
EDL	01:04:02,303	01:04:08,447	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Deleting too also two very hilarious to call of the craters on other planets
EDL	01:04:09,471	01:04:10,751	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Innovative
EDL	01:04:13,823	01:04:16,383	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So the calculations have been describing
EDL	01:04:16,383	01:04:18,687	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	You do them at when you do planetary science
EDL	01:04:20,479	01:04:21,247	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Is no
EDL	01:04:22,015	01:04:23,295	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Lifeline
EDL	01:04:24,831	01:04:27,135	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Will come
EDL	01:04:27,647	01:04:28,927	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Pure Imagination
EDL	01:04:29,695	01:04:30,719	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Our brains
EDL	01:04:30,719	01:04:33,535	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Developed it to handle the normal world around us
EDL	01:04:34,303	01:04:38,655	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But in some sense there was a overshoot we can imagine things but they're not here
EDL	01:04:38,655	01:04:40,703	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	We can think about stuff at
EDL	01:04:40,703	01:04:43,007	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	What to be here or could be here
EDL	01:04:43,007	01:04:44,287	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Door must not be here
EDL	01:04:44,799	01:04:47,615	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Supplemental imagination with science
EDL	01:04:47,615	01:04:50,943	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	So we got ways of reasoning about strange situation
EDL	01:04:54,271	01:05:00,671	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	This is an expression of being Uomo imagining other worlds I think it's worth
EDL	01:05:00,671	01:05:01,695	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Really makes us human
EDL	01:05:02,719	01:05:09,119	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Thank you so much for coming in on a
EDL	01:05:09,119	01:05:15,263	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Saturday to Talk About Blueberries this is awesome
EDL	01:05:21,919	01:05:28,319	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Producer Rachel Cusick
EDL	01:05:28,319	01:05:31,903	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Also special thanks in this episode to Sandra Clark and Alexander glacier
EDL	01:05:32,927	01:05:38,559	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Weather, I'm Diamond I'm on team blueberry now and second. I'm just not like I'm antagonist anymore
EDL	01:05:39,839	01:05:41,119	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Maybe I'm just lost my
EDL	01:05:41,887	01:05:42,655	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Joie de vivre
EDL	01:05:43,935	01:05:46,495	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	You think you did if you did
EDL	01:05:47,007	01:05:47,519	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Succumb
EDL	01:05:48,799	01:05:50,591	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Some people get Chihuahua early
EDL	01:05:50,591	01:05:52,383	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Some people getting y middle
EDL	01:05:52,383	01:05:53,663	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Some people get Schwab
EDL	01:05:53,663	01:05:54,687	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Thrust upon them
EDL	01:05:54,687	01:05:57,247	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Shakespeare yeah of course
EDL	01:05:58,015	01:05:59,295	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yeah but maybe maybe
EDL	01:06:00,063	01:06:05,183	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The distance one has to travel I can pick you pick you pick a person out like at 3:33
EDL	01:06:05,183	01:06:06,207	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	On Any Given Tuesday
EDL	01:06:06,719	01:06:07,487	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And you say
EDL	01:06:08,255	01:06:10,303	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	How far emotionally spirits
EDL	01:06:10,303	01:06:12,095	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Do you have to travel to get to Joy
EDL	01:06:12,863	01:06:14,399	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	How far is that that that Journey
EDL	01:06:15,167	01:06:18,239	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	My journey used to be like I'll just take one step to the left I'm there
EDL	01:06:18,239	01:06:24,383	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Now it's like I got to board a plane I got to take off I got to fly all the way across the world I got to land the plane in Tahiti
EDL	01:06:24,895	01:06:26,175	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And then then I'm enjoy
EDL	01:06:26,687	01:06:28,479	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yes you have you have
EDL	01:06:29,503	01:06:30,271	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Slid
EDL	01:06:30,271	01:06:31,295	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Further from the
EDL	01:06:31,295	01:06:32,831	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	From the ideals and you wish
EDL	01:06:32,831	01:06:33,599	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	B
EDL	01:06:33,599	01:06:37,439	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	You should just troubling me but that's what she that's the advantage of a story like this
EDL	01:06:37,439	01:06:38,719	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	This is a story that
EDL	01:06:38,719	01:06:39,487	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Can
EDL	01:06:39,487	01:06:40,767	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Gently tug you
EDL	01:06:40,767	01:06:41,279	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	The way
EDL	01:06:41,791	01:06:42,815	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Gravity.
EDL	01:06:42,815	01:06:44,607	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	And then land you
EDL	01:06:44,607	01:06:46,143	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Totally Magic
EDL	01:06:47,423	01:06:48,447	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Chamois

EDL	01:06:55,103	01:06:55,871	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yeah
EDL	01:06:55,871	01:06:58,431	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	But you know what I will say just be just as a closing thought
EDL	01:06:58,431	01:07:00,479	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Your 80 Hertz is really good right now
EDL	01:07:01,247	01:07:02,271	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Is it
EDL	01:07:02,783	01:07:05,599	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Yeah. You got a little bit of a little bit of a gravel
EDL	01:07:05,599	01:07:07,391	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Happening
EDL	01:07:07,903	01:07:10,207	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Under the gravel I hear some really good ATR
EDL	01:07:11,231	01:07:12,255	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	Well thank you gif
EDL	01:07:12,255	01:07:15,071	| radiolab_podcast19askingforfriend |	You're welcome
