EDL	00:00:47,104	00:00:50,432	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	So we thought we would share it with Radiolab listeners who haven't heard of
EDL	00:00:51,200	00:00:53,504	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It's reported by a guy named Sean ROMs

EDL	00:01:10,144	00:01:11,680	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I think we should start with one of the most
EDL	00:01:11,680	00:01:15,264	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Confusing sentences in the constitution in the Bill of Rights not We the People
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:17,312	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Not that one I got
EDL	00:01:17,312	00:01:19,104	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	A well regulated militia
EDL	00:01:19,616	00:01:20,128	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	,
EDL	00:01:20,640	00:01:23,200	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Being necessary to the security
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:24,480	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Of a free state
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:25,760	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	,
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:27,552	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The right of the people to
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:29,344	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Keep and bear arms
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:29,856	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	,

EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:36,000	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	From the top and do it do it with the comments
EDL	00:01:36,512	00:01:39,072	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Sure a well regulated militia
EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:42,656	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	, being necessary to the security
EDL	00:01:42,656	00:01:43,680	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Of a freezer
EDL	00:01:43,680	00:01:44,448	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	State
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:48,800	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Oh, the right of the people to keep and bear arms
EDL	00:01:48,800	00:01:51,104	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Totally unnecessary,
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:52,640	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Shall not be in
EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:55,456	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Is that the one that's about guns
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:56,992	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Adam Winkler who wrote the book
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:02:00,064	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	On the 2nd Amendment end of book is called gunfight is a journal
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:02,880	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	He's a professor of law at UCLA
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:09,280	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	He said it's almost as a James Madison the author of the amendment I just discovered this wonderful new thing the, and why
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:10,816	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Wanted to put it in there as many times as
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:13,120	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Which is like
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:15,424	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Nrt professorial joke
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:17,472	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But like seriously what is it in like
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:23,872	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It has to be this one couldn't have been the amendment about like quartering soldiers in your house that was really confusing
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:24,640	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And that they made like Jess
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:26,432	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Indecipherable
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:27,200	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Never since
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:28,992	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Generations of Americans have been
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:30,784	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Confused by the language of the Second Amendment
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:34,368	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	So when the singers written we had just fought this war with the British
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:36,416	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	This Revolutionary War
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:38,720	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And they try to win it right from the get-go
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:40,000	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Viking braggot
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:44,096	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	So these new states are looking at this new federal government they're going like
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:45,888	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	We don't know if we want to trust you quite yet
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:47,424	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	So does the Second Amendment says
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:48,960	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	You guys can fight back
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:51,520	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Like the feds aren't going to disarm you you can your malicious to keep your
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:52,800	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Stats
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:53,568	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I think what we agree on
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:56,896	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But then after that you just look at the sentence
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:59,200	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	That is not just a commas that are confusing
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:00,992	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	If you look at the sentence as a whole
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:02,784	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Pieces don't seem to fit
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:04,320	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Get together there's some now I'm confused
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:05,856	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I mean
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:09,440	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It's obvious that the sentence is about someone's right to bear arms but who
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:10,976	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Who get that right
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:13,280	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	At the beginning of the sentence
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:15,328	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	You got a well regulated
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,096	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Militia
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:16,608	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Demolition
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:18,656	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	States have a right to form militias
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:19,680	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	What's to assemble
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:22,240	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Groups of people and those people got to have their guns
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,264	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	That's easy enough
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:24,544	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But then later in the sentence
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:26,848	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	There's, the right of the people to
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:27,872	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	To keep and bear arms
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:29,920	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	, shall not be infringed
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:30,688	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The people
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:32,992	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Which people
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:34,784	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Those people over there in the militia
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:36,064	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	All people
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:37,600	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	If you mean all people
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:39,392	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Why'd you say militia
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:40,160	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It's like
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:41,440	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The first clause
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:43,744	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The point of some sort of collective right to bear arms
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,792	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And the second clause
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:48,096	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Seems to point to some individual right
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:51,168	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Right to bear arms if it's supposed to be a popularly ratified document
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:53,728	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It's actually not that easy to read
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:57,312	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And it's not it wasn't that easy to read done
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:59,616	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	This is Jill Lepore staff writer at the New Yorker mag
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:02,432	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	She's also a professor of American history
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:03,712	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I studied 18th century
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:08,832	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I'm really trying to the 17th and 18th century American political story
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:10,880	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And Jill says
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:15,232	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	From the beginning when people thought about the Second Amendment they tended to just focus
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:18,815	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	On the first part that the primary motivation for the amendment is
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:21,375	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	About militia well-regulated
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:22,143	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Militia
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:23,935	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	That is confusing sentence was
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:25,471	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Widely read as the
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:26,495	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	This Collective
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:32,895	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Militia right not an individual one truth that the Second Amendment fact guarantees the right of
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:36,479	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	An individual to bear arms and that the government federal government
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:37,503	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	In any fashion
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:39,551	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Juices that just didn't exist
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:45,695	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I disagree with the way you characterize that
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:51,839	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Although what you said is stated in the media frequently the Stephen halbrook he's represented the NRA in several
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:55,167	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Cases I've written several books on Second Amendment issues
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:56,191	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	He actually thinks
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:05:01,055	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Hey the sentence is just fine as is as complicated at all
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:06,687	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The framers were thinking about an individual right to there aren't the Second Amendment refers to the right of the
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,455	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The people to
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:08,223	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Keep and bear arms
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:11,807	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	First Amendment refers to the right of the people peaceably to assemble
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:17,439	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I mean who is that if it's individuals or not some kind of collected that doesn't exist in reality
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:18,975	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	So which
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:19,743	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Which was it
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:22,047	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	That that's a really good question to add I mean
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:25,375	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	If it's complicated 1/2 what I can tell you is that
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:27,423	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	No people I spoke to for the story said
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:31,775	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	At least in the 20th century when the when the second amendment was taught in law schools
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:32,543	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It was taught this
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,079	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It was taught as a sort of
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:34,847	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Antiquated
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:36,383	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Outdated
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:39,199	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Thing that have to do with malicious not so much
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,223	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Individual rights
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:41,247	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:44,575	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Tulip or Stephen halbrook and their respective side something they can both
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:45,087	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Agreeance
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:46,623	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Is that this
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:50,463	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Super sacred Second Amendment the third rail
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:52,511	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Of our American politics today
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:53,791	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	That just was not
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:54,559	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I think
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:56,351	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It was not like that it was
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:57,375	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Utterly ignored
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,911	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	People ignored
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:01,471	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	This amendment When I Was An undergraduate
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:03,775	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Undergrad at Florida State University
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:09,663	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	What did the Florida Supreme Court and start looking up law review articles on constitutional law issues and I found that
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:13,247	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	There was hardly anything written about the Second Amendment
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:17,599	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Except for the third amendment the zoo there was no Amendment it was less written about less
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:19,135	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Legislated less
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:19,903	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Activated
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:23,743	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	That's a subjective Supreme Court conversation
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:24,767	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And the second
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:27,839	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Don't get me wrong this is not to say people didn't think about guns
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:32,703	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	People had guns States regulated guns but for most of our history the Second Amendment
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:33,727	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It was like
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:39,615	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Heavenly sword of the runt of the Bill of Rights literally like no one argued about it it's a striking thing to think about
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:42,687	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	There was no fight no fight how surprising that is
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:44,223	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Is giving its centrality to our
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:44,735	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Political compass
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:46,783	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	What is
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:48,063	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Extraordinary transfer
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,367	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Because there was this
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:51,647	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Window of time where
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:52,927	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	All of this
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:55,231	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Changes that the scriptures
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:55,743	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Best flips
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:57,279	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	There's two hundred years
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:06:59,071	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Of everything being chill
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:00,863	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And then suddenly
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:01,887	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	You got
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:03,167	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	This
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:04,703	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I want say those fighting words
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:07,007	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	From my cold
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:18,015	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	So basically in
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:21,087	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The Flash the Second Amendment goes from being
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:25,183	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Ignored to being
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:31,583	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Supposed to be Radioactive
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:37,983	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And in the process we start to read the thing totally differently all of a sudden this is hot
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:42,079	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Lead debated thing that's got nothing to do with that first part and everything
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:42,847	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	To do
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:45,663	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	What the second part of her judges
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:50,015	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Nothing you can do folks
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:50,783	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And me
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:55,391	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	What are the Second Amendment people maybe there is I don't know
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:57,695	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And what I want to know is how did that happen
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:02,815	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	How do we start reading the Second Amendment the way we do now
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:06,399	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And and what I found out is that
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:09,471	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	In the modern history of the gun rights movement and
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:11,775	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And how we read the second amendment can you boil down to these
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:13,311	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	3
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:14,079	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Totally

EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:28,991	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Yeah so this transition from the militia to the individual my right to bear arms
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,527	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	You could argue that
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:33,855	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	That whole individual gun rights movement started
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:35,135	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	In the 1960
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:36,927	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Cities with the Black Panthers
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:37,695	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	In Oakland
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:42,815	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It's an unlikely and got a surprise in origin for what's known as individual rights interpretation of the

EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:24,287	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The late 60s there were several high-profile incidents of Officer shooting unarmed black man
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:25,567	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	This is what was happening
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:27,359	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	You know and
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:30,943	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	What we did is that yet we took a position
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:34,783	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	October 1966
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:39,391	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Barcelona Spain Huey P Newton they start this organization called the Black Panther

EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:51,679	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:56,543	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	One day he sitting there as as you doing law school thinking about the law think about Malcolm X
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:58,335	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Thinking about what you can do in Oakland
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:59,359	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And it hits
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:02,687	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The Second Amendment of the Constitution guarantees
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:06,271	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The citizen's right to bear arms on public property
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,575	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But they can argue
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:10,879	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	That the Second Amendment gave them a right
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:11,647	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Have a gun
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:18,047	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	He said pass a constitutional Democratic civil human right

EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:21,631	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Claim that the Second Amendment protect an individual right
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:25,215	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Right to bear arms people who argued that were in the minority
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:27,007	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	They want taken too seriously
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:30,847	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Play this is one of the first times that the individual rights reading was forced
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:32,895	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Into the mainstream because
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:35,967	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Did the
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:39,551	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	We have a right to bear arms we individuals then

EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:51,071	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	What did he ghost you in law school so what legal status do we have
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:55,423	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	That second half of the Second Amendment right to bear arms
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:13:00,287	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Possessing bear arms okay he also pointed to a California state law
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:03,615	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It said you could carry a gun as long as it wasn't concealed

EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:32,991	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Particularly after Huey Newton shooting happened at 5 a.m.
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:39,391	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Later that same year was arrested for shooting and killing a cop approved blood marks the spot
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:40,671	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Parole officer John Frey
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:42,463	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Was found fatally wound
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:43,999	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The case was eventually dismissed
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:44,511	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:49,119	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	What seems clear is that the Black Panthers decision to use the Second Amendment
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:50,655	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Turn on themselves
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:51,935	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	To show up armed
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:54,751	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	At the state capitol in California inspired
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:55,775	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	A big respect life
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:20:04,223	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	FBI director J Edgar Hoover today asserted that the Black Panthers represent the greatest internal threat to the nation
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:07,551	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Chicken spot a Revolution was about to break out right here at home
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:13,183	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	This led to a whole new wave of gun control laws in California but also
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:15,999	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Federal gun-control many of which seemed
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:22,143	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	To be targeted towards African-Americans rather than just reducing gun violence
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:24,703	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	We've got to get guns off the street
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:26,751	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But the irony was
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:29,311	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Even though those laws were designed to
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:30,079	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Disarm

EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:35,455	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Many white rural conservatives
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:39,807	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Thought that they were next
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:43,647	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	That government was going to take their guns next
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:47,231	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Every action
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:47,999	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Create a react

EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:50,815	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Panthers thing is

EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:03,871	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And Republican
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:05,151	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	In fact
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:07,711	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	There is absolutely no reason why out on the street

EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:19,744	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	With a shotgun
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:23,584	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Listen to gun control has fingerprints all over
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:25,632	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	What's Happening Here

EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:28,704	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Sacramento
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:29,984	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And Ron Reagan react
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:32,032	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	They create some gun control
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:35,360	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Then there's even more gun control even federal gun control
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:38,176	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And a lot of people are sitting home watching this
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:39,712	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And they start to get very
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:40,480	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Upset
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:42,528	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Which brings is to chapter 2
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:43,552	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The revolt
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:48,928	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	You know we can't allow this to happen
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:52,512	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I can buy the damn pistol that I wanted
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:56,864	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	These two guys John aquilino live in Rockport Texas

EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:19,904	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Little things that moved in the shooting gallery but neither one of them
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:23,744	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Piccalilli hardcore about their gum police until around the time
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:24,512	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The Black Panthers
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:29,632	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Give me the fact that here bunch of people who were
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:31,680	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Slightly darker
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:33,728	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Complected then New England
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:37,312	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Ivy league grads running around with firearms
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:39,360	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Did did that scare people
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:39,872	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Hell yeah
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:43,456	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Did it scare you know I didn't scare me I didn't
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:48,064	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	John told me Joe is well that it wasn't the Panthers themselves that was a problem
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:52,928	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I don't like anybody to tells me I can't do something it's all the gun control laws
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:53,696	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Came
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:54,208	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	In the wake
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:56,768	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	When the gun control Act
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:57,280	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	First pass
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:23:01,376	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Today we begin to disarm the criminal
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:02,912	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Careless
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:04,448	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And then say
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:07,264	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	A lot of things just appeared that I had been used to
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:10,336	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Joe says he starts the gun shops in his neighborhood close
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:13,920	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Like the furniture store in Buffalo that used to have shotguns
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:15,712	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	$5 think they stop selling them
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:18,016	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And he says that is really bothered him because
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:22,112	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The reason you have a gun is for protection
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:24,160	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It's like another form of insurance
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:28,512	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Which wasn't an abstract idea for him buffalo in the sixties and seventies
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:30,560	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Not the safest place in the world
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:31,840	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	His house
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:32,864	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Was even broken into
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:34,400	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I could only
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:35,168	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Describe
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:35,936	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Wangjing beijing
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:37,728	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	These guys actually
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:38,496	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Better
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:39,008	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Their way
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:40,544	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	2 Doors
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:44,640	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Joseph seen his wife and his dog huddled in one room with a gun
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:46,944	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Wally's two guys storm through his house
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:47,712	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:48,480	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Rotten
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:50,016	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I didn't take care of my wife
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:50,528	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Purse
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:52,064	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Some other money
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:53,856	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And they are
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:56,416	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I mean by the time the police got there
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:23:57,440	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Devon
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:24:01,536	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Joe's whole relationship with Firearms is there a predicated upon that
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:04,352	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	This idea that it's for self-defense and
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:05,376	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Hear he's got
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:06,912	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	People breaking into his house
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:08,192	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	He's got
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:13,568	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The cops not being there for him he's got the government trying to take his gun away so what do you do
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:15,360	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	You join
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:16,384	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The end
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:17,664	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Ra
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:19,456	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Fight this gun control
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:21,504	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:24,320	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	This came at a moment where the NRA was at this
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:26,624	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Crossroads unlike
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:27,904	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Any edit seen before
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:29,184	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Orson
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:35,584	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Guangzhou join in the early 70s the NRA
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:38,656	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Was not the die-hard supporter of gun rights
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:39,936	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Let me know today
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:41,728	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Because according to Adam Winkler
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:45,568	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It was never meant to be the idea behind the NRA
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:46,336	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Continue
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:47,360	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Three fundamental right down to
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:53,504	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Today was to increase Civilian Marksmanship training so that the next time there's a war Americans would be
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:54,528	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Capable of fighting
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:57,088	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	You know you don't hear much about the NRA's founders
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:25:03,744	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But the NRA was formed in the 1870s right after the Civil War by a reporter for the New York Times
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:10,912	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Who thought that the Union Soldiers had been so ineffective in the Civil War because they were not familiar with
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:11,680	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Firearms
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:18,080	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Really yeah like a hundred years their main focus was like teaching Boy Scouts how to shoot straight not
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:18,592	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The sacrament
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:22,432	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And apparently if you go back through issues of American Rifle
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:24,224	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	In the forties
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:24,992	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	50s
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:27,552	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The animated version of Playboy guns instead of girl
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:28,576	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	You'll be amazed
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:31,648	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	That you can't find a single mention of the Second Amendment
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:32,928	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Anywhere in those magazine
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:35,744	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The NRA at that point was
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:37,792	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Sort of like a gun trade group they were
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:39,840	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Not super political and
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:42,400	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And the people who ran it they were Hunters
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:43,424	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	John Hunter
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:47,264	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	They were just like these wealthy businessmen who like to hunt
EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:49,056	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	According to John Rich guys who
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:50,592	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	You don't give her Hobbies
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:52,896	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But you had all these people coming in
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:57,760	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Like Joe and like John who were convinced that guns weren't about
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:25:58,528	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Shooting.
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:00,064	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	They were about self defense
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:02,368	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Protecting yourself against criminals
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:06,976	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	In a time of starkly Rising crime rates this would lead to this straight up
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:08,256	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Head on collision
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:09,280	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	At the NRA
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:11,840	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Now
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:14,144	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Joe and John join the NRA
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:17,216	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The organization had just for the first time
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:18,752	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Sort of set-up this lobbying
EDL	00:26:19,264	00:26:22,592	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Yeah it was the brand new Institute for legislative action
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:26,432	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	John actually got hired to work there in 1976
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:29,504	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And district for legislative action
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:30,784	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Supposed to fight for gun rights
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:33,344	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Capitol Hill that's what they both wanted it
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:33,856	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Did it but
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:35,648	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Let's put it this way
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:36,928	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	We were the
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:40,768	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	If you would the bastard stepchildren of the National Rifle Association
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:42,816	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Really yeah
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:44,608	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	When the institute for legislative action
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:47,680	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Was formed in 1975
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:48,704	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The NRA
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:52,032	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Refuse The Institute any Office Space
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:53,312	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	In the building
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:57,152	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	In the mid-seventies the part of the NRA that Lobby politicians
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:27:00,224	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Had to rent office space from the hotel neck
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:02,784	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Door to the NRA is crazy
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:04,576	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And then
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:07,136	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Right after he was hired 78 people
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:07,648	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Fire
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:11,232	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Very interesting leaves big firing
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:13,792	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And then there was word
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:15,840	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Did the NRA wanted to move

EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:37,216	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The leadership of the NRA
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:38,752	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	That was one of the meetings they just sat there

EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:57,440	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Would start to speak for and against

EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:14,592	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Going in

EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:27,392	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	That discussion debate
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:29,696	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Less than 8 hours

EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:41,984	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I mean we really didn't know whether to pull this off
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:44,544	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But Joe says one of the big turning points
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:47,616	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Is when a guy named Bob Kukla gets up to the mic
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:49,664	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	He was at the time the head
EDL	00:32:49,664	00:32:51,968	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Of the institute for legislative action
EDL	00:32:51,968	00:32:54,016	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	To get into the mic and
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:55,552	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	He played it take
EDL	00:32:55,552	00:32:56,320	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Remember
EDL	00:32:56,320	00:33:02,720	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	This was one that Bob Kukla secretly recorded I don't know how he did it but what you hear on this tape is babka
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:07,328	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Cuckoo talking to his bosses at the NRA and they're yelling at him berating him
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:09,376	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Or going to orbit
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:10,400	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Time somebody talks
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:12,704	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	They're basically like
EDL	00:33:12,704	00:33:13,216	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Bob

EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:13,952	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	They start pouring millions of dollars into lobbying and just
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:16,000	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	A few years after that Cincinnati revolt
EDL	00:36:16,512	00:36:18,304	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The NRA endorses its first

EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:42,880	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Which is why Americans eventually start to forget
EDL	00:36:42,880	00:36:43,648	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	That
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:46,208	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The militia clause or whatever you want to call it even exist
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:48,768	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I wish I could save that instead of the last
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:53,632	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Winter things that most surprised me when I was doing some research
EDL	00:36:53,632	00:36:54,912	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	This is Jill Lepore
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:58,240	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	By the 1990s the new interpretation of the Second Amendment
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:36:59,520	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Had so penetrated
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:01,312	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Popular opinion
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:05,152	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	That people were more familiar with the Second Amendment then with the first
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:05,920	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	By 1991
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:08,224	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The First Amendment
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:11,040	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	That Eclipse really
EDL	00:37:11,040	00:37:11,552	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Kind of shocks
EDL	00:37:12,576	00:37:17,952	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Even if even if the Panthers and the president American people are all down to sort of forget about this militia
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:19,744	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Clause of the 2nd Amendment
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:21,792	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It didn't mean a lot without the
EDL	00:37:21,792	00:37:22,560	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The courts
EDL	00:37:22,560	00:37:23,328	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And the courts
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:24,864	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Particular
EDL	00:37:24,864	00:37:25,888	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Supreme Court
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:26,912	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Woodbine
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:29,984	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court from 19
EDL	00:37:29,984	00:37:33,056	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	69 to 1986 Warren Burger
EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:35,360	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I think you saw me giving a television interview and he says
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:36,640	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But this new interpretation of the
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:37,920	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Second amendment was
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:39,456	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The greatest pieces of
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:45,600	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	One of the greatest pieces of fraud I repeat the word fraud on the American public
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:47,392	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Do I have ever seen in my lifetime
EDL	00:37:48,416	00:37:52,512	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And this was a republican appointed by Richard Nixon now
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:53,536	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Yeah
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:59,424	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Yeah so the Supreme Court obviously not dying to have this conversation at the moment
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:38:02,752	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But it's not just the Supreme Court if you look at the federal courts the entire
EDL	00:38:02,752	00:38:04,800	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Federal court system in America
EDL	00:38:04,800	00:38:06,336	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	There is not one
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:07,616	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	In our history at this point
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:09,152	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Over 200 years
EDL	00:38:09,152	00:38:10,944	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Been a single instance
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:13,760	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Of some gun law some State local gun law
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:17,856	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Getting up to a court and the court going you know what you can't do this
EDL	00:38:17,856	00:38:20,672	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It violates the second amendment that does not even happen
EDL	00:38:20,672	00:38:24,768	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It's really not even there wasn't I like an amendment Smackdown anywhere in federal court
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:26,560	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	This isn't this isn't a thing
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:29,120	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Why I'm getting Supreme Court to weigh in on it
EDL	00:38:29,120	00:38:32,960	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	That doesn't even look like it could be a thing it doesn't even look like much more than a fantasy

EDL	00:41:10,400	00:41:16,800	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Dolor in 2008 revives the Second Amendment or you could even say
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:23,200	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Breathes life into the Second Amendment because the Second Amendment
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:28,320	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Had never been taken truly seriously by federal courts
EDL	00:41:28,320	00:41:29,600	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Until 2008
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:35,744	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	That Cindy levenson professor at the University of Texas law school
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:37,792	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Jad abumrad here with

EDL	00:41:40,864	00:41:42,912	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It's I guess now it's time for chapped
EDL	00:41:42,912	00:41:45,216	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	3D color I never going to get to dick
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:46,240	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But first
EDL	00:41:47,008	00:41:48,288	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Here's what's going on in America
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:50,336	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	2nd Amendment have become
EDL	00:41:50,336	00:41:52,384	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	One of those issues that can get you elected
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:56,735	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Academics have begun to have a vigorous debate about its meaning
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:41:58,527	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But the Supreme Court
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:41:59,807	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Is still staying out of it
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:01,343	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	They're leaving this up to the states
EDL	00:42:01,855	00:42:04,415	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Which already have all sorts of gun laws of their own to deal with
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:06,463	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But then December 12
EDL	00:42:06,975	00:42:07,743	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Mm
EDL	00:42:07,743	00:42:10,815	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Republican George W Bush become president elect
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:13,887	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	After divided US Supreme Court effectively
EDL	00:42:13,887	00:42:18,751	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Recounts in Florida contested presidential vote tally George W bush is elected
EDL	00:42:18,751	00:42:21,823	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The NRA likes George W bush
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:24,383	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And he likes history
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:26,175	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I'm protecting the second
EDL	00:42:26,175	00:42:27,455	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	To the United States cost
EDL	00:42:28,223	00:42:34,367	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And in 2001 the Bush Administration declared that the Second Amendment protected and individual rights
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:34,879	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	To own guns
EDL	00:42:35,391	00:42:37,951	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	UCLA law professor Adam Winkler again
EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:39,487	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Right that was not limited
EDL	00:42:39,487	00:42:40,767	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Is most courts have held
EDL	00:42:40,767	00:42:41,791	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	To service in the militia
EDL	00:42:42,303	00:42:47,167	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And almost right after he gets into office Bush's Attorney General John Ashcroft
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:48,191	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Put out a letter
EDL	00:42:48,191	00:42:51,519	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	This public letter to the NRA announcing that the Department of Justice
EDL	00:42:52,287	00:42:55,359	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Adopted a new interpretation of the Second Amendment
EDL	00:42:55,359	00:42:59,455	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And then right around the same time as the Bush Administration memo came out
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:00,991	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Corp
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:01,759	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	In
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:02,527	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Texas
EDL	00:43:02,527	00:43:06,623	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Ruled that the Second Amendment did protect an individual right to bear arms
EDL	00:43:06,623	00:43:07,647	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And that was a first
EDL	00:43:08,159	00:43:10,719	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The big deal before this all the decisions and kind of
EDL	00:43:11,231	00:43:12,511	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Beard in the other direction
EDL	00:43:12,511	00:43:14,815	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And because of that Court ruling
EDL	00:43:14,815	00:43:16,863	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And John Ashcroft letter
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:19,167	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	List three libertarian lawyers
EDL	00:43:19,935	00:43:25,567	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Alan gura constitutional attorney Bob's easy a chair the board at the Cato Institute and
EDL	00:43:25,567	00:43:27,615	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Clark neily
EDL	00:43:27,615	00:43:31,455	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Thought the timing was right we thought it was a good time for some litigation
EDL	00:43:31,455	00:43:34,783	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I want thing you need to know about these guys is that they weren't necessarily doing it
EDL	00:43:34,783	00:43:40,159	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	For the guns they had no association with the NRA or the gun rights movement for them it was
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:45,535	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	More about getting the government to back off in our country when the government wants to restrict our Liberty
EDL	00:43:45,535	00:43:51,167	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It isn't coming on the government to make the case for it as income in the government to say here's why you shouldn't be permitted
EDL	00:43:51,167	00:43:52,703	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	To exercise that right
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:56,799	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	So that was their ankles adedeji I've always wondered why the gun rights movement has become such
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:43:58,847	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The proxy war for like anti-government
EDL	00:43:58,847	00:43:59,615	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Mint
EDL	00:43:59,615	00:44:03,711	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Is Mmm Yeah well I mean if you think about this something professor
EDL	00:44:03,711	00:44:05,503	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Sandy Levinson told me
EDL	00:44:05,503	00:44:06,271	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Is that
EDL	00:44:06,271	00:44:08,831	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Sort of embedded in this amendment
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:09,599	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Is
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:12,927	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The very idea that you can take up arms
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:14,463	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Against the government
EDL	00:44:14,463	00:44:15,999	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	To protect yourself
EDL	00:44:15,999	00:44:18,815	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And your fellow man from tyranny on the far right
EDL	00:44:19,583	00:44:21,631	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Or occasionally on the far left
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:24,447	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	You find people who are willing
EDL	00:44:24,447	00:44:25,215	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	2
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:28,799	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Say this that this is really what's terrific about the Second Amendment
EDL	00:44:29,311	00:44:32,895	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But mainstream conservatives in mainstream liberals
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:34,175	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Arnott
EDL	00:44:34,175	00:44:37,759	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Very happy with those arguments they are embarrassed by them
EDL	00:44:38,527	00:44:40,831	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And so mainstream conservatives
EDL	00:44:41,343	00:44:44,415	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Want to talk about self defense against
EDL	00:44:44,415	00:44:45,183	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Burglars
EDL	00:44:45,695	00:44:47,999	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And mainstream liberals
EDL	00:44:48,511	00:44:50,047	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Want to talk about
EDL	00:44:51,583	00:44:54,911	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The second amendment protects State organized militia
EDL	00:44:55,423	00:44:56,447	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And
EDL	00:44:56,447	00:44:57,471	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Almost nothing else
EDL	00:44:58,239	00:45:00,031	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Anyway getting back to the story
EDL	00:45:00,031	00:45:02,847	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	These three libertarian lawyers they decide
EDL	00:45:02,847	00:45:06,431	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Together case and their idea was to Target this really was
EDL	00:45:06,431	00:45:07,455	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Strictest gun law
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:08,223	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Indeed
EDL	00:45:08,223	00:45:14,623	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	All handguns were banned you could own a shotgun or rifle but the law specifically made it illegal to ever put a round in the chamber
EDL	00:45:14,623	00:45:16,159	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Even in self-defense or there was
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:18,975	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	There's really funky we described it as a
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:20,767	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Ban on all functional firearm
EDL	00:45:20,767	00:45:24,351	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But in order to challenge that law they needed to find a plaintiff
EDL	00:45:24,351	00:45:26,143	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Interesting how do you find a
EDL	00:45:26,143	00:45:26,911	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Plaintiff
EDL	00:45:26,911	00:45:28,191	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	You look for somebody who
EDL	00:45:28,191	00:45:29,727	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Got robbed what do you do
EDL	00:45:29,727	00:45:31,775	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Well we can actually instigate
EDL	00:45:31,775	00:45:33,823	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Litigation and we can take out a
EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:35,871	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Full page ad in the New York Times saying
EDL	00:45:35,871	00:45:40,479	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I want to vindicate your second amendment rights give us a ring just sent we got the word out talk to
EDL	00:45:40,991	00:45:43,807	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I would say between 2 and 3 dozen
EDL	00:45:43,807	00:45:50,207	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	People they all had really interesting stories they found a guy who was gay gentleman named Tom Palmer
EDL	00:45:50,207	00:45:56,607	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Previously been assaulted when he lived in California because he was gay was almost murdered by a skin
EDL	00:45:56,607	00:45:57,887	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Pinhead mahbuba phobic
EDL	00:45:57,887	00:45:59,167	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Subs and he wanted
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:05,823	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	To protect himself that are lead plaintiff was an African-American woman named Shelly Parker she was trying to protect herself again
EDL	00:46:06,335	00:46:10,175	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Local drug dealers and the cops actually told her she should get a gun
EDL	00:46:10,175	00:46:11,455	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Which was illegal
EDL	00:46:11,967	00:46:17,087	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Weird so they have this whole group so we ended up with three men and three women mid twenties to do
EDL	00:46:17,087	00:46:22,207	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Early 60s formal way to am African-American and the problem they ran into
EDL	00:46:22,207	00:46:25,279	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Was that all of these super sympathetic plaintiff
EDL	00:46:25,279	00:46:26,559	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Didn't have the
EDL	00:46:26,559	00:46:28,607	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Very special thing they needed
EDL	00:46:28,607	00:46:29,375	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	To bring a case
EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:30,143	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Standing
EDL	00:46:30,143	00:46:36,543	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Standing which is just a legal term meaning they didn't have a sufficient grievance to be in court like if you can bring a case you have to show that
EDL	00:46:36,543	00:46:38,847	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Actually harmed the by
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:41,919	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Not being able to get a gun you have to show some physical
EDL	00:46:41,919	00:46:43,199	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Concrete proof
EDL	00:46:43,199	00:46:45,247	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The harm has been done that you've been
EDL	00:46:45,247	00:46:46,015	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Denied a gun
EDL	00:46:46,527	00:46:48,063	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And none of the plaintiff had that
EDL	00:46:52,927	00:46:54,719	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Except for one.
EDL	00:46:55,231	00:46:55,743	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Dick
EDL	00:46:57,791	00:46:58,303	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	That's me

EDL	00:47:14,175	00:47:16,479	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It looks like you drew a trigger out there that what you did
EDL	00:47:16,479	00:47:18,271	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Oh well it was missing the trigger so
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:20,063	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	We had to update it
EDL	00:47:20,575	00:47:21,087	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Who's we
EDL	00:47:22,367	00:47:23,391	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Okay

EDL	00:48:09,727	00:48:12,031	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Most of the protesters that were passing us wear white but
EDL	00:48:12,543	00:48:16,639	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Just as a few young black men pacify
EDL	00:48:16,639	00:48:17,663	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	He says
EDL	00:48:18,175	00:48:20,735	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	See you on the plantation
EDL	00:48:22,271	00:48:24,063	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Freedom
EDL	00:48:24,063	00:48:25,343	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Make America Trump again
EDL	00:48:27,135	00:48:28,671	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	See you on the plantation

EDL	00:48:37,119	00:48:40,703	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	You kids are about to be slaves or something cuz that's how I interpreted it
EDL	00:48:41,215	00:48:46,079	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The more power government has the less Freedom you have the closer you get the ball and chain
EDL	00:48:46,591	00:48:47,615	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Other Plantation
EDL	00:48:49,919	00:48:51,711	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	This pretty good place to eat right there
EDL	00:48:51,711	00:48:54,783	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	If you here for a couple of days if you've been in there I have not

EDL	00:49:04,767	00:49:07,839	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And explain to me that his journey with guns like
EDL	00:49:07,839	00:49:09,375	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	John and Joe
EDL	00:49:09,375	00:49:10,655	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Began pretty casually
EDL	00:49:11,167	00:49:12,191	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Flight 1976
EDL	00:49:12,703	00:49:13,983	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Is living in DC
EDL	00:49:14,495	00:49:16,799	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And one day you sitting at home
EDL	00:49:16,799	00:49:18,079	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I was watching
EDL	00:49:18,079	00:49:20,639	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	My hero Matt Dillon
EDL	00:49:20,639	00:49:22,431	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Gunsmoke
EDL	00:49:23,711	00:49:24,479	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Different Matt Dillon
EDL	00:49:26,271	00:49:29,599	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And he had this long-barreled handgun
EDL	00:49:31,647	00:49:33,183	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I was about 30 years old
EDL	00:49:33,695	00:49:34,975	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And I figured collie
EDL	00:49:34,975	00:49:37,023	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I should own my first gun
EDL	00:49:37,023	00:49:38,047	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	So when I went and bought
EDL	00:49:38,559	00:49:40,607	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	My when I call my Matt Dillon special
EDL	00:49:41,119	00:49:44,447	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Hi standard 22 revolver Matt Dillon Buntline
EDL	00:49:45,215	00:49:45,983	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And it was just
EDL	00:49:46,495	00:49:47,775	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I live in America
EDL	00:49:47,775	00:49:49,311	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	We're Cowboy Society
EDL	00:49:49,311	00:49:51,103	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I should have a cowboy gun and weave
EDL	00:49:52,639	00:49:59,039	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Nothing no really deep thought to it but then just a few months after he got that gun in October
EDL	00:49:59,039	00:50:02,623	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	1976 a trend that started with the Mulford Act
EDL	00:50:02,623	00:50:04,927	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And the Black Panthers back in Sacramento
EDL	00:50:04,927	00:50:09,535	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Hits Washington DC DC gun control regulations outlawed
EDL	00:50:09,535	00:50:13,119	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Firearms ownership get that gun law which outlawed
EDL	00:50:13,119	00:50:15,167	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	All hang up so I had some choices
EDL	00:50:15,679	00:50:19,007	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I could turn it into the government not going to happen
EDL	00:50:19,007	00:50:21,311	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I can throw it in the Dipsy dumpster
EDL	00:50:21,311	00:50:22,335	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Not going to happen
EDL	00:50:23,103	00:50:24,127	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Or
EDL	00:50:24,127	00:50:26,175	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	There was no other option I could go to jail
EDL	00:50:26,943	00:50:27,967	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Not going to happen
EDL	00:50:27,967	00:50:30,015	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Eventually he decides on option D
EDL	00:50:30,527	00:50:33,599	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Give the gun to his brother my brother lived in Maryland
EDL	00:50:33,599	00:50:35,135	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	So that made it very convenient
EDL	00:50:35,903	00:50:39,487	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Did you just go visit your gun in Maryland what you do I would go visit
EDL	00:50:39,999	00:50:41,535	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And caress and use my gun
EDL	00:50:42,559	00:50:43,071	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	What do you use it for
EDL	00:50:43,839	00:50:44,863	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Target practice
EDL	00:50:46,143	00:50:47,167	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Take me to
EDL	00:50:47,167	00:50:49,727	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Gun visitation situation sound functional but
EDL	00:50:50,239	00:50:53,823	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I think like any long-distance relationship they mostly sucked because
EDL	00:50:53,823	00:51:00,223	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	More and more he didn't feel safe where he lifts I lived about 10 blocks from the Capitol building right across the street
EDL	00:51:00,223	00:51:00,991	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	From
EDL	00:51:00,991	00:51:05,599	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The number one most infamous drug dealer Den
EDL	00:51:05,599	00:51:08,671	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	In the city called Kentucky courts
EDL	00:51:08,671	00:51:10,463	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Every night at 2 a.m.
EDL	00:51:10,975	00:51:14,559	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The chief drug dealer would fire a 9 mm
EDL	00:51:14,559	00:51:16,351	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Into the air empty the clip
EDL	00:51:16,863	00:51:19,935	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And that was the signal every night at 2 but
EDL	00:51:19,935	00:51:21,727	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Drug dealing was over
EDL	00:51:21,727	00:51:22,495	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	For the day
EDL	00:51:24,287	00:51:27,615	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It's clear that living through the crack epidemic in DC really
EDL	00:51:28,383	00:51:30,175	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Shaped a lot of dicks views on gun
EDL	00:51:31,967	00:51:32,479	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	So
EDL	00:51:34,783	00:51:36,575	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	In the years after the handgun ban
EDL	00:51:37,087	00:51:42,719	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Dick starts the very long process of finding a way to get his gun back to DC and he eventually then quits his desk job
EDL	00:51:43,231	00:51:45,791	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	To pursue getting his gum back full-time
EDL	00:51:45,791	00:51:48,607	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I'm all over Capitol Hill and I see
EDL	00:51:49,887	00:51:51,167	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Security guards
EDL	00:51:51,167	00:51:51,679	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Have done
EDL	00:51:52,959	00:51:53,471	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Well
EDL	00:51:54,495	00:51:55,007	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Dali
EDL	00:51:55,519	00:51:57,055	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Why can't I be a security guard
EDL	00:51:57,823	00:51:58,591	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Golly
EDL	00:51:59,103	00:52:00,639	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Maybe that would help me
EDL	00:52:00,639	00:52:01,663	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Have a gun
EDL	00:52:01,663	00:52:03,199	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But I can't have on my own
EDL	00:52:03,967	00:52:07,039	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Let's see how easy or not easy this is
EDL	00:52:07,807	00:52:08,319	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Dali
EDL	00:52:08,831	00:52:11,135	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	One Step leads to another
EDL	00:52:11,135	00:52:11,903	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Just like that
EDL	00:52:12,415	00:52:14,463	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Dick was able to have a gun in DC
EDL	00:52:14,463	00:52:17,535	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But only during the day and only while he was working
EDL	00:52:17,535	00:52:18,815	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Like Barney Fife
EDL	00:52:18,815	00:52:22,399	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	At the end of my shift I have to turn in my gun and my bullets
EDL	00:52:22,911	00:52:23,935	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And they kept it there
EDL	00:52:23,935	00:52:25,215	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And they kept it on side of nose
EDL	00:52:25,983	00:52:28,287	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	He finally starts looking for some help
EDL	00:52:28,287	00:52:32,895	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Some legal help but I knew Washington cuz I lived here and I've gone to something tanks
EDL	00:52:32,895	00:52:34,943	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Cato in Heritage and some others
EDL	00:52:34,943	00:52:38,015	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I knew they existed and right around the time out there looking for some help
EDL	00:52:38,783	00:52:41,087	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Turns out these lawyers are out there looking for some dick
EDL	00:52:42,879	00:52:43,903	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	No no
EDL	00:52:44,415	00:52:47,231	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	She wasn't there ideal sympathetic guy
EDL	00:52:47,231	00:52:51,327	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I was told repeatedly and it was in print that I was the worst
EDL	00:52:51,327	00:52:55,935	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Choice less-than-optimal
EDL	00:52:55,935	00:52:58,239	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	He was always talk smack about
EDL	00:52:58,239	00:52:59,775	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The federal government an interview
EDL	00:52:59,775	00:53:01,567	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	One day Clark Neely
EDL	00:53:01,567	00:53:02,847	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Put a note in my hand
EDL	00:53:02,847	00:53:04,127	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	NSAID dick Heller
EDL	00:53:04,127	00:53:05,151	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	This is what you say
EDL	00:53:05,663	00:53:07,711	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I just wanted a Gun 2
EDL	00:53:07,711	00:53:08,735	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Protect my house
EDL	00:53:09,247	00:53:10,015	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Shut up
EDL	00:53:11,551	00:53:13,343	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Play it wasn't their favorite princess
EDL	00:53:13,343	00:53:16,415	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But the one thing that no one else has done
EDL	00:53:16,415	00:53:22,303	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Which is besides just wanting an illegal handgun in DC he actually fill out an application
EDL	00:53:22,815	00:53:26,143	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	To register a gun that he already possessed again in Virginia
EDL	00:53:26,143	00:53:32,287	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And had that application denied and he had this denial slip or whatever it's called be like literally had this physical proof
EDL	00:53:33,567	00:53:34,335	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Of his grieving
EDL	00:53:34,847	00:53:38,175	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And simple technical arbitrary little
EDL	00:53:38,175	00:53:39,711	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Stupid piece of paper gave him
EDL	00:53:39,711	00:53:46,111	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	What's known as standing to bring the case stick however ended up being kind of Last Man Standing that was nothing to do with that was not
EDL	00:53:46,111	00:53:47,391	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Regardless
EDL	00:53:47,391	00:53:51,743	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Again that we came there guy and these three lawyers they take the case of the DC Court
EDL	00:53:51,743	00:53:52,767	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And the judge
EDL	00:53:52,767	00:53:53,791	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	After
EDL	00:53:54,303	00:53:57,119	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Inspecting it said the case can go forward
EDL	00:53:58,655	00:53:59,423	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Magic Moment
EDL	00:54:12,735	00:54:14,783	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	This Magic Moment
EDL	00:54:15,295	00:54:18,879	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The Supreme Court is entering the debate over the Second Amendment right to bear arms

EDL	00:54:33,215	00:54:35,775	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The day the Heller case was argued
EDL	00:54:35,775	00:54:38,847	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	In court everyone understood how high the stakes
EDL	00:54:38,847	00:54:39,871	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Square
EDL	00:54:40,383	00:54:46,527	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Outside in front of the Supreme Court protesters by the hundreds were marching and
EDL	00:54:48,063	00:54:49,599	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Panting

EDL	00:55:20,319	00:55:22,879	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The clerk yelled at the top of his lungs
EDL	00:55:22,879	00:55:24,927	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And then there's a strange sound
EDL	00:55:25,951	00:55:26,975	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	What can that be
EDL	00:55:27,487	00:55:32,863	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It was the swishing of the Robes of the justices as they ascended the steps
EDL	00:55:33,375	00:55:33,887	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	To the bench
EDL	00:55:35,935	00:55:36,703	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Unbelievable
EDL	00:55:37,727	00:55:44,127	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	We will hear argument today in k07 290 District of Columbia vs. Heller
EDL	00:55:44,127	00:55:47,967	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Time in our history the Supreme Court would directly try to figure out what the Second Amendment mean

EDL	00:55:56,415	00:55:59,487	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And jumps right into it
EDL	00:55:59,487	00:56:01,791	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Essential question like
EDL	00:56:01,791	00:56:06,655	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	What was James Madison thinking when he wrote the super confusing sentence like 200 years ago was he
EDL	00:56:06,655	00:56:11,775	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Thinking about the individual people and the right to own a gun or was he thinking about the collective right
EDL	00:56:12,287	00:56:14,335	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Of the militia
EDL	00:56:14,335	00:56:16,383	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	In the first text to consider
EDL	00:56:16,895	00:56:19,199	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Is the phrase protecting a right to
EDL	00:56:19,711	00:56:20,991	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Keep and bear arms
EDL	00:56:21,503	00:56:24,831	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	If you look at the phrase the phrase keep and bear arms
EDL	00:56:24,831	00:56:28,415	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	How was used at the time to use the phrase bear arms
EDL	00:56:28,927	00:56:30,975	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Used to refer to the use of arms
EDL	00:56:31,487	00:56:32,767	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	In connection with
EDL	00:56:34,047	00:56:40,447	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Madison's rough drafts of the Second Amendment it's pretty clear that when he says people
EDL	00:56:40,447	00:56:41,983	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I have a right to bear arms
EDL	00:56:41,983	00:56:43,519	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	All he really means is
EDL	00:56:43,519	00:56:46,335	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Report for Duty
EDL	00:56:46,847	00:56:51,711	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	TV and bearing arms when was first called confirmed
EDL	00:56:51,711	00:56:54,015	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	That's a right
EDL	00:56:54,015	00:57:00,415	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It's a mystery
EDL	00:57:00,415	00:57:01,439	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Right of the people
EDL	00:57:01,439	00:57:02,207	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Nicky Barnes
EDL	00:57:02,207	00:57:08,095	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Is it just the people in the state militias why wouldn't they say state militias have the right to keep arms
EDL	00:57:08,607	00:57:11,423	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Listen to Justice I believe that the phrase
EDL	00:57:11,423	00:57:12,447	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The people
EDL	00:57:12,447	00:57:13,727	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And the phrase the militia
EDL	00:57:14,239	00:57:16,031	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	We're really in sync with each other
EDL	00:57:16,543	00:57:18,079	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The Federalist farmer uses
EDL	00:57:18,079	00:57:20,127	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The phrase the people are the militia
EDL	00:57:22,687	00:57:27,039	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Cut against you if the militia included all the people that includes all the people
EDL	00:57:27,039	00:57:28,575	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Yes I do believe in inclusion
EDL	00:57:29,343	00:57:34,975	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	At this point everyone jumps in a bunch of just start interrupting each other
EDL	00:57:34,975	00:57:41,375	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Scrum and they're all trying to figure out okay so when Madison was afraid
EDL	00:57:41,375	00:57:42,399	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Not being friends like
EDL	00:57:42,399	00:57:45,471	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Who were the people he was talking about
EDL	00:57:45,983	00:57:52,383	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	What those words meant was the people just the militia or everyone all people what is the
EDL	00:57:52,383	00:57:54,687	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Relationship between the second part of the sentence
EDL	00:57:54,687	00:57:56,479	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The people part and the first part of the sentence
EDL	00:57:56,991	00:58:03,391	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The militia part Verdugo rokita
EDL	00:58:03,391	00:58:09,791	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Scottish Highlanders for some reason
EDL	00:58:09,791	00:58:12,863	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	They even start to diagram Madison sentence
EDL	00:58:12,863	00:58:14,399	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I think I see Discord

EDL	00:58:49,727	00:58:50,751	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Indeed
EDL	00:58:50,751	00:58:52,031	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	To assume that since the

EDL	00:58:58,687	00:59:00,223	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But by taking away the people
EDL	00:59:00,991	00:59:02,271	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Justice Scalia
EDL	00:59:02,271	00:59:03,295	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Of course was
EDL	00:59:03,295	00:59:06,111	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Very conservative Justice in Queens
EDL	00:59:06,111	00:59:07,391	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	This is Joan biskupic

EDL	00:59:15,327	00:59:19,167	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Young men were trained in firearms in high school
EDL	00:59:19,167	00:59:21,727	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	German Shepherd has played a vital role in.
EDL	00:59:21,727	00:59:23,263	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Even from the time he was

EDL	00:59:24,799	00:59:26,591	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	He said he used to carry his gun

EDL	00:59:34,527	00:59:35,807	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	You're being unrealistic
EDL	00:59:40,159	00:59:41,951	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The principal purpose here is the militia

EDL	00:59:57,055	00:59:59,359	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	This word of individual rights argument
EDL	00:59:59,359	01:00:02,687	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Speaks of the right of the people like David souter

EDL	01:00:04,735	01:00:06,271	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	What are the collected the militia
EDL	01:00:07,039	01:00:13,439	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	This goes on for well over an hour the justices who are grilling the lawyers arguing amongst themselves ever

EDL	01:00:17,535	01:00:18,559	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Until finally

EDL	01:00:28,799	01:00:30,079	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Let's talk about now
EDL	01:00:30,079	01:00:31,615	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Talk about gun violence
EDL	01:00:32,127	01:00:34,943	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Descendants was most definitely written about muskets
EDL	01:00:35,455	01:00:37,503	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	What about handguns and assault rifles
EDL	01:00:38,015	01:00:39,551	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	What is reasonable
EDL	01:00:40,063	01:00:40,831	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Now

EDL	01:02:21,439	01:02:23,487	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Stop by the way it was Justice Scalia
EDL	01:02:23,487	01:02:25,023	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Telling Alan gura
EDL	01:02:25,023	01:02:27,071	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	How to answer Justice Breyer's Quest
EDL	01:02:27,583	01:02:28,607	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The answer is yes
EDL	01:02:30,911	01:02:34,495	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And actually feels any standard of review that might be offered under Section
EDL	01:02:34,495	01:02:35,007	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Construction
EDL	01:02:38,591	01:02:41,663	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The oral arguments last 97 minutes
EDL	01:02:42,175	01:02:45,503	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Far longer than most other cases and going into the arguments
EDL	01:02:45,503	01:02:47,039	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Many Supreme Court Watchers
EDL	01:02:47,551	01:02:49,343	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Figured the case would be a close
EDL	01:02:49,343	01:02:50,623	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	5-4 decision
EDL	01:02:50,623	01:02:52,159	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And it could go either way
EDL	01:02:52,671	01:02:53,439	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And as with
EDL	01:02:53,951	01:02:55,999	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	All of these clothes cases
EDL	01:02:55,999	01:02:58,815	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Question was what would Anthony Kennedy the swing Justice
EDL	01:02:58,815	01:02:59,327	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Do
EDL	01:03:00,351	01:03:02,399	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	As in so many issues in America
EDL	01:03:03,167	01:03:05,215	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Comes down to what does Anthony Kennedy believe
EDL	01:03:07,263	01:03:11,871	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	So at the oral argument and I had the Good Fortune to be at the oral argument in the Heller case
EDL	01:03:12,639	01:03:14,687	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Everyone was looking to hear
EDL	01:03:14,687	01:03:16,479	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	What would he say about the Sacramento
EDL	01:03:16,479	01:03:18,527	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	His was really devout the counted
EDL	01:03:18,527	01:03:20,575	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And the very first comment he made
EDL	01:03:25,183	01:03:27,231	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Set learn to defend
EDL	01:03:27,231	01:03:30,303	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Himself and his family against hostile Indian tribes
EDL	01:03:30,303	01:03:31,327	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Outlaws
EDL	01:03:31,327	01:03:33,375	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Wolves bears and grizzly something like that
EDL	01:03:34,399	01:03:37,215	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	One of the first things he said was about bear
EDL	01:03:38,751	01:03:40,031	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Bear arms but
EDL	01:03:40,031	01:03:40,543	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Grizzly bear
EDL	01:03:42,079	01:03:43,871	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The point Kennedy was trying to make with clear
EDL	01:03:45,151	01:03:48,991	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Don't you think the framers had other reasons that they wanted people to have guns
EDL	01:03:49,503	01:03:51,039	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Other than just being in a militia
EDL	01:03:51,551	01:03:54,111	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	What about people being in their homes
EDL	01:03:54,111	01:03:55,647	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And is meeting to defend themselves
EDL	01:03:57,439	01:03:59,743	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And that's when I silently screamed at the
EDL	01:03:59,743	01:04:03,327	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The top of my lungs so nobody could hear me yes we win
EDL	01:04:04,095	01:04:04,863	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	...
EDL	01:04:05,375	01:04:05,887	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Something
EDL	01:04:19,967	01:04:26,367	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Just for your turn now to the historic Supreme Court decision handed down this morning
EDL	01:04:26,367	01:04:29,951	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	07 to 90 District of Columbia vs. Heller
EDL	01:04:31,743	01:04:37,375	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	We hold at the second amendment guarantees an individual right to have an alarm for self-defense in the hole
EDL	01:04:38,143	01:04:42,495	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And that the district's handgun ban as well as its requirement that firearms in the home
EDL	01:04:42,495	01:04:44,031	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Be rendered inoperative
EDL	01:04:44,031	01:04:44,799	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Violate
EDL	01:04:45,311	01:04:49,407	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It was a groundbreaking reading of the Second Amendment
EDL	01:04:52,735	01:04:54,271	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Scalia minimize
EDL	01:04:54,271	01:05:00,671	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Dacquoise referring to a well regulated militia and put the stress on the second Clause that refer to the right of
EDL	01:05:00,671	01:05:03,231	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Do the people the people
EDL	01:05:04,767	01:05:06,559	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	This was as good as it got for him
EDL	01:05:06,559	01:05:07,327	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	On the bench
EDL	01:05:07,327	01:05:08,095	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I think so
EDL	01:05:09,119	01:05:12,959	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Rip the militia Clause December 15th 1791
EDL	01:05:12,959	01:05:14,239	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The June 26
EDL	01:05:14,239	01:05:15,007	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	2008
EDL	01:05:15,519	01:05:17,311	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	A pretty good run if I'm being honest
EDL	01:05:18,847	01:05:21,663	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	For the first time in the history of these United States
EDL	01:05:22,175	01:05:24,223	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The courts definitively declared
EDL	01:05:24,223	01:05:27,295	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	That the second amendment gives every American
EDL	01:05:27,295	01:05:29,343	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The right to a gun for self-defense
EDL	01:05:29,343	01:05:34,975	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It was a it was a great day for freedom in America was a great day for the Constitution great day for citizens
EDL	01:05:35,743	01:05:38,303	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The great day for gun owners it was great day for
EDL	01:05:38,303	01:05:39,071	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Fearful people
EDL	01:05:40,863	01:05:41,375	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Of course
EDL	01:05:41,887	01:05:42,911	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Not everyone agreed
EDL	01:05:42,911	01:05:44,703	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I mean to me that's a travesty
EDL	01:05:46,239	01:05:47,263	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	This is Jack Rico
EDL	01:05:47,775	01:05:52,895	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Professor of history and political science at Stanford University for the court and
EDL	01:05:52,895	01:05:55,711	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The history is just
EDL	01:05:55,711	01:05:56,479	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	ROM
EDL	01:05:56,479	01:06:01,087	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The Second Amendment is not about individual right that we shouldn't even be talking
EDL	01:06:01,087	01:06:01,855	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	About history
EDL	01:06:01,855	01:06:07,743	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Because the nature of firearms has changed so radically for the 18th century to our own time and that ultimately
EDL	01:06:07,743	01:06:10,303	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And here you go Justice Stevens in his
EDL	01:06:10,303	01:06:13,119	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Descent
EDL	01:06:13,119	01:06:14,399	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Android political stick
EDL	01:06:14,399	01:06:15,423	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Feathers all politics
EDL	01:06:16,447	01:06:17,983	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	To be honest I mean I'd
EDL	01:06:17,983	01:06:20,543	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I don't really believe in constitutional law anymore
EDL	01:06:21,311	01:06:22,847	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I think a solution laws of fiction
EDL	01:06:23,871	01:06:25,663	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	You know what's become so highly politicized
EDL	01:06:26,431	01:06:27,711	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	In so many areas
EDL	01:06:28,479	01:06:30,015	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I think I socialize
EDL	01:06:30,015	01:06:30,783	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Is bunk
EDL	01:06:30,783	01:06:34,879	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Wow I just destroyed I'm not a lawyer so that I don't have any professional steak
EDL	01:06:34,879	01:06:36,671	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Interfering the Judiciary
EDL	01:06:39,231	01:06:39,999	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But
EDL	01:06:39,999	01:06:41,535	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	There's a very big
EDL	01:06:42,047	01:06:47,935	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But he did have a major caveat section of our opinion points out that like most rights the Second Amendment right
EDL	01:06:49,215	01:06:50,751	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	He said like all right
EDL	01:06:51,263	01:06:53,311	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It's not absolute
EDL	01:06:53,311	01:06:56,895	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	To keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever
EDL	01:06:56,895	01:06:58,175	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And for whatever purpose
EDL	01:06:58,175	01:07:00,991	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Which is very important to keep in mind
EDL	01:07:00,991	01:07:02,015	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Be taken to cast doubt
EDL	01:07:02,783	01:07:04,063	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Long-standing
EDL	01:07:04,575	01:07:05,599	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Possession of firearm
EDL	01:07:07,135	01:07:07,903	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	You
EDL	01:07:07,903	01:07:10,719	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms incense
EDL	01:07:10,719	01:07:11,231	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Places
EDL	01:07:13,023	01:07:15,839	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	This is another thing that we tend to forget
EDL	01:07:15,839	01:07:16,863	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The decision says
EDL	01:07:16,863	01:07:19,167	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Every individual has a right to bear arms
EDL	01:07:19,167	01:07:21,983	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The most interesting lie like the decision also says
EDL	01:07:21,983	01:07:22,751	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Of course
EDL	01:07:22,751	01:07:24,287	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	We need gun control
EDL	01:07:25,311	01:07:26,335	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	The word Heller
EDL	01:07:26,847	01:07:27,871	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Come to represent
EDL	01:07:29,919	01:07:30,943	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	2nd Amendment rights
EDL	01:07:30,943	01:07:34,015	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Against Hillary even though
EDL	01:07:34,015	01:07:35,295	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Being for Heller
EDL	01:07:35,295	01:07:36,831	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Is being for gun control
EDL	01:07:37,855	01:07:39,135	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Fusing yeah it is
EDL	01:07:39,647	01:07:41,695	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	I mean after all this time it's
EDL	01:07:41,695	01:07:42,463	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Still just
EDL	01:07:42,463	01:07:43,743	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Totally confusing
EDL	01:07:44,511	01:07:46,047	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	You have a right to a gun
EDL	01:07:46,047	01:07:47,583	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But the government has a right to regulate
EDL	01:07:48,351	01:07:50,399	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Decal gets his gun back in DC
EDL	01:07:50,911	01:07:54,239	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But PC still also has all sorts of gun regulation
EDL	01:07:55,775	01:07:58,335	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And you see the same pattern all over the country some states are lenient
EDL	01:07:58,847	01:07:59,871	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Summer super strict
EDL	01:08:00,383	01:08:03,199	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	And both approaches seem to comply with Heller
EDL	01:08:04,735	01:08:06,527	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	In a way the Heller Decision
EDL	01:08:06,527	01:08:11,135	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Is just like all those commas and Clauses that we started with and James Madison sentence
EDL	01:08:11,903	01:08:12,415	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	It's the
EDL	01:08:12,927	01:08:14,463	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Confusing declaration
EDL	01:08:14,975	01:08:17,535	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	That leaves the door wide open for interpretation
EDL	01:08:20,351	01:08:20,863	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Which
EDL	01:08:21,631	01:08:22,399	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Obviously suck
EDL	01:08:34,431	01:08:36,479	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	We could use a little more
EDL	01:08:36,479	01:08:37,759	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Clarity on
EDL	01:08:38,527	01:08:39,807	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	How to live with this
EDL	01:08:39,807	01:08:42,111	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Second Amendment right to bear arms
EDL	01:08:48,767	01:08:55,167	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Open it gives us an opportunity I think
EDL	01:08:55,167	01:09:01,567	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	Opportunity to get it right to fix it
EDL	01:09:01,567	01:09:07,711	| radiolab_podcast18thegunshowmp |	But now be pretty good time
