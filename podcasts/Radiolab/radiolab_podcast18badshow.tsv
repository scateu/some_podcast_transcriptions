EDL	00:01:26,016	00:01:29,088	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And now that we're sort of just on the other side of that
EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:34,720	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	We thought that maybe the as is return to Corner ourselves we should refresh
EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:37,024	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	But even that sort of way
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:42,912	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I mean it's just one of those things we've been bringing back shows that we think are just vibrating
EDL	00:01:42,912	00:01:49,312	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Still in the world so at a time when there are people all over our country and other people
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:51,616	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	All over country and thinking she's bad

EDL	00:01:58,016	00:02:03,392	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Decided that it's time to go back to something we did once upon a time when we were wondering
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:09,792	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	About good and bad we did a show called The Bad show start asking me questions like what makes a person inherently
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:11,328	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Good or bad is there a way to
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:17,472	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Explain why some people act the way they do and others
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:29,760	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The little bit of bad that is in all of us and he's really really bad that is in some of us

EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:47,424	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He's a psychology professor at the University of Texas at Austin
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:51,008	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And this particular story comes from a book that David wrote
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:52,288	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Can you just
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,312	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Just tell me

EDL	00:02:58,176	00:02:59,200	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	This is
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:00,736	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	One of the things that
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:03,552	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	This is one of the things that spark my interest
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:04,832	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	In the topic of murder
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:07,136	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The whole thing happened several years ago
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:11,744	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I had a very good friend another professor at the University and I used to socialize
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:16,352	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	With him and his wife and one evening they were throwing a party
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:22,496	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And invited me over and so I went to the party party was already in full swing when I got there
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:25,312	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I walked in and asked his wife
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:27,104	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Where this friend of mine was
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:29,152	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And she
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:31,968	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Got a disgusted look on her face and said that he was
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:33,248	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Up in the bedroom
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:36,576	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And so I went up to the bedroom
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:37,600	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	To find him and he was
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:39,392	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And in a rage
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:44,256	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	In a rage how like you walk into the room what would you find
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:47,840	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Well he started he started fuming that his wife head
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:48,608	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Had distemper
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:52,448	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And what did she do she expressed
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:54,752	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Disapproval about his
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:56,288	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Clothing choices
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:58,592	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	She made fun of a shirt or something
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:01,152	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	But did it publicly in front of her friends
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:04,480	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	So it's kind of a he felt publicly humiliated
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:09,600	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And while David sitting in the bedroom with this friend the guy looks up at him
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:10,624	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And he says
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:17,024	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I'm going to kill her how did he say it like quietly or like truth is
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:20,607	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Keith and I'm going to kill her
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:21,375	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	David
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:22,911	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Always known this guy to be
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:27,263	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Pretty mild-mannered but he is a
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:29,055	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	A large
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:30,847	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Very strong
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:37,247	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Man with a black belt in karate I knew what he was capable of
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:43,647	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	So I suggested that we go out for a walk and I basically spent the next half hour away
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:48,767	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Walking around with them trying to cool him off but eventually he did
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:49,535	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He just
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:50,303	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Calm down
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:53,887	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And you go back to the party then in like
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:54,911	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Continue
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,191	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Dinner partying
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:58,751	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	For a while yeah I did good too
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:00,287	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Yes and he did too
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:01,311	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And then
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:02,079	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He seemed
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:02,847	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Fine
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:04,895	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	When I said goodbye to him he seemed calm and
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:06,687	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I left and went home
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:07,967	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And it was
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:10,783	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Several hours later in the middle of the night that I got the call
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:18,463	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And it was his friend and he says, I come over and sleep on your couch
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:24,863	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I don't leave my house right now I'm going to kill her he was in this
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:31,263	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	State of Fury he said an in instead of
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:37,663	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Hitting his wife he smashed his fist into the bathroom mirror and
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:41,503	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Then realized that he had to leave the house or he was going to
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:46,111	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Do damage to her an event so he says that in your like

EDL	00:05:55,583	00:06:01,983	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Literally disappeared for 6 months and didn't tell anyone where she was because she was terrified that he
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:02,495	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He was going to kill her
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:07,871	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	This story made us wonder it is David's friend
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:09,151	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Easy unusual

EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:52,159	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	What happened to David that night with his friend
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:56,255	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I'm really curious about murder and Badness and all these things were thinking about
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:58,559	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	But it wasn't until a few years later that
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:06:59,583	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He weren't something that
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:01,887	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Really put what happened that night into contacts
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:07,519	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	At this point David moved on to a new University and he's teaching an introductory psychology
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:09,567	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And I devoted one
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:11,103	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Class session 2
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:11,871	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The topical
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:13,663	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Homicide in white people
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:14,943	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Kill and
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:16,223	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I designed a little
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:18,271	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Questionnaire
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:20,319	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Where I simply asked the students
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:22,367	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And I've have you ever thought about killing someone
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:24,159	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And they would Circle
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:25,183	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Yes or no
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:27,231	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Then he wants some space at the bottom
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:28,255	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	For them to elaborate
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:29,279	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	If they said yeah
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:33,887	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And you know the class ended and I went back to my office and I just
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:35,679	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Sat at my desk and started reading these
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:37,215	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And I was just
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:38,239	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Astonished
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:40,031	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Define page
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:41,311	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	After page
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:41,823	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Of yes
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:43,615	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And not just yes
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:45,663	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	But these very Vivid
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:46,687	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Descriptions
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:48,223	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	About who they would kill
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:49,503	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Where they do it
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:50,271	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	When
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:51,551	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The precise method
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:54,111	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	How many of them went into that kind of detail
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:56,159	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I would say
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:57,695	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	75 or 80%
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:58,463	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Wow
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:03,327	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	A little bit like horrified like oh my God my students are murderers
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:06,399	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Horrified as I was
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:07,679	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I was pretty stunned
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,703	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And so
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,471	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:14,591	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Expanded the sample where we asked about five thousand people all of the world
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:19,711	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Singapore jeru the UK that's in question have you ever thought about killing someone
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:22,527	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	91% of the men
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:24,575	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Said yes in 84
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:25,087	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Percent of the women
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:28,159	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Said said yes I've thought about killing
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:29,695	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Yes
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:30,975	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	If any
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:33,791	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	A sizable fraction actually acted on their homicidal
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:35,327	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Can I see the streets would be running
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:36,607	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Running red
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,143	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Yeah but that's the
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:41,727	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Actually seemed like
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:44,799	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	But here's one more than just fantasy
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:45,567	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	From
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:46,847	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	A woman
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:49,919	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Sure okay this is a 20 year old female
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:51,967	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	We asked who do you think about killing
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:54,271	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	She said my ex-boyfriend
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:57,855	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	We live together for a couple months
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:59,647	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He was very aggressive
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:03,231	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He started calling me a w**** and told me he didn't love me anymore
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:04,511	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I broke up with him
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:09,119	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Then a few months later he started calling me trying to get back together but I didn't want to
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:12,959	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He said that if I ever had a relationship with another man
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:14,495	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He was going to send videos
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:16,031	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Of us having sex
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:18,335	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	To all the people in my University
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:20,127	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The thing is
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:23,711	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	But I do have a new boyfriend but my ex boyfriend doesn't know it
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:24,479	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	That yet
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:26,015	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And I'm terrified
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:27,295	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	But he'll do what he says
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:30,111	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Then suddenly the thought occurred to me
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:32,671	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	That would my life would be much happier
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:33,951	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Without him in existence
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:36,255	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And then she said I actually did this
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:38,047	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I invited him for dinner
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:41,887	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And as he was in the kitchen looking stupid peeling the carrots
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:43,423	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Make salad
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:47,263	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I came up to him laughingly gently so that he wouldn't suspect anything
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:51,359	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I thought about grabbing a knife quickly and stabbing him in the chest
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:52,639	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Repeatedly until he was dead
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:54,943	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I actually did the first thing
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:57,247	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	But he saw my intentions and ran away
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:00,319	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I went to ask how close she came to killing
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:02,111	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	She estimated
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:02,879	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	60%
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:08,511	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I don't think I've ever had a fantasy that
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:11,327	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	That anatomically specific Ryewood
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:13,631	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	See the part of the other person that I was going to say
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:14,399	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Forever
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:15,935	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Planet like that well
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:17,727	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Have you ever been blackmailed away this one
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:21,823	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	No no one is ever sent about a s******* that I've ever
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:24,383	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	So you don't know it is a fair question to ask
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:26,943	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	What are the conditions under which you
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:28,223	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Premier any of us
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:28,735	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Baidu
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:32,831	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Thanks I think they have to be extremely extreme
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:35,391	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Well know how my lighter.
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:38,463	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	You know what the sex brings us to our first stop of the Arizona
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:41,791	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Just to set it up Robert I'm going to give you this piece of paper here
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:43,327	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	What is this
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:46,911	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Edward Paris read these words that use these words
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:48,703	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Nice day
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:49,727	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Fat

EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:51,519	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Sad
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:55,359	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Face what are the soft hair I don't know what this is
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:56,895	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I want you to commit them to Memory

EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:07,391	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Little electro-jazz finger clear-air

EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,695	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Already comes up
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:12,255	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	So I'm just going to go in
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:20,447	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	What what
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:24,287	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I'm not ready for this
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:26,335	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	To the best of your memory
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:29,663	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Which word is mashed with knife
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:44,255	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Okay I'm choosing
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:45,279	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Job
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:46,815	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Wrong
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:52,959	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Actriz de 285 volts
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:57,055	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	What did you just do
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:12:02,687	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Obviously no need to be alarmed that was not a real shock we were just in acting an old
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:07,295	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Great famous experiment that may have heard that was May 1962
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:13,695	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Done by this guy an experiment is being conducted in the elegant interaction laboratory at Yale University
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:17,535	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Stanley Milgram talking about the experiment film in case you've never heard of this
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:18,815	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Probably happen Katie heaven
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:25,727	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Create a bunch of subject or subjects of 40 males between the ages of 20 and 50 normal everyday dude
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:32,127	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Subjects ranging occupation from Corporation presidents to Good Humor man in plumbers near am through something like
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:36,479	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	But you and I just would have each subject sit down at a table
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:39,295	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Front of this really impressive looking machine
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:45,439	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Machine had lots of switches on it
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:51,327	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Any other room there was a guy who he called the learner who is supposed to have memorized some words
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:57,471	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Everytime that guy got a word wrong that you just did
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:13:03,871	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Volunteer was instructed to shock that guy with higher and higher voltage
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:06,175	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The volunteers couldn't see the guy he was shocking
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:08,479	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	They definitely run
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:14,111	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Yoakum staged the whole thing like it was some experiment about memory and punishment but of course it wasn't about that
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:22,303	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Continue play is that how far these people go how many times would they shock that salve
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:26,143	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Sap in the Next Room just because they were being told
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:31,007	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Guy yelling of course was an actor in the shocks weren't real but
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:36,127	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The questions in the air at the time were very real
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:39,199	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	This is the moment when human cruelty was on trial
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:41,247	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Quite literally
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:47,391	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	When I stand before you judges of Israel to appear
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:50,207	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And I knew I met you
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:52,255	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I do not stand alone
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:55,839	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	So Stanley Milgram actually begins these experiments
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:58,911	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The same year that I don't like man goes on trial
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:00,447	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	For Nazi war crimes
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:04,799	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	That's radio producer Ben Walker it'll be our guide for the segment and in the trial
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:06,847	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	When the prosecutor is essentially
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:09,151	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Ask him how you came to
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:10,431	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Commit genocide
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:13,503	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He would say over and over again
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:15,039	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	My personal affair
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:16,575	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I was just
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:17,599	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Following order
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:20,159	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I had to do what I was ordered
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:21,183	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	It's this defense
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:23,999	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	This is basically what Stanley Milgram
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:25,535	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Set out to test
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:29,887	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	285 volts in a lab at Yale University with a bunch of regular American
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:35,263	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Like is that something at Universal or just 10
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:40,127	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Eichmann think he figured maybe 1% of these men would keep flicking the switches
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:41,919	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Up to the highest voltage but
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:44,223	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	That's not what he found
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:48,319	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	65% were willing
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:54,975	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Shock their fellow citizens over and over again even passed when they were screaming and
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:02,399	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Even when they stop screaming when they were maybe dead
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:05,727	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	You won't answer me or nothing
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:08,031	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Please continue go on
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:10,079	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	They continue talking there
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:12,639	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Corpse
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:20,575	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	His experiment remains one of the most famous experiments of the 20th century
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:26,975	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	1962 Stanley Milgram shock the world with his study on obedience it is still trotted out to explain
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:33,375	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Everything from hazing to war crimes what is there in human nature to gang Behavior
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:39,775	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Allows an individual to act in you mainly genocide it's like a downloadable from the internet
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:42,591	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Instant defense doing wrong but
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:47,711	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	If you look at milgram's work Coast
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:49,247	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Like this guy did
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:53,599	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Alex Haslam professor of psychology at the University of Exeter
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:55,135	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	A different picture
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:57,695	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Well maybe that story is being told
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:16:04,095	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	A million and one times for the last 50 years we just got to get together now what you need to understand about
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:06,655	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Haslam is that he hates it when interviewers
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:09,471	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Only want to talk about the Baseline study
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:13,055	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The one that everybody knows the circle Baseline to 65% 1
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:14,591	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Want me to talk about
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:20,223	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Yeah so there's more actually he studied between 20 and 40
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:23,039	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Different variants of the same parody
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:26,111	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Stanley Milgram took electric shocks is very seriously
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:33,023	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He did this experiment a bunch of times and in a bunch of different ways
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:35,839	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Change where the Shocker in the shock ESAT
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:42,239	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Women participants she had an experimental he wasn't a scientist it was a member of the general public and everything
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:43,263	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Scenario produced
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:43,775	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	A different
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:44,799	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Results
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:46,591	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Really yeah
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:49,663	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Let me get me. I'm just in front of me I just got the
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,967	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Did they see from the middle console images
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:57,599	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I mean solganik the Baseline study is the one where 65% of the volunteers go all the way
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:58,111	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Highest dose
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:01,951	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Text but an experiment number 3
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:05,279	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	If they put the Shockey in the same room
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:11,679	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	What's the shocker to the Shocker can actually see the person that he's talking about 4
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:18,079	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	40% in an experiment number for when the teacher has to hold the Learners hand down on a plate and Order him to feel
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:22,175	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	It drops to about 30% wow
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:28,575	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Experiment 14 if the experiment was not a scientist but is an ordinary man not
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:30,623	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Wearing white coat constructs to
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:31,391	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	20%
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:37,023	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	How low can we go okay here's another one experiment 17
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:40,607	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	You and those two other participant both actor
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:47,007	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	If Lowe's to participants refused to go on like saying I don't want to kill a guy
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:53,407	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Under those circumstances got one experiment 15 experiments who's giving you
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:59,807	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Use instructions that he put two experimenters in the room and they start disagreeing with each other at least this one you got
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:01,855	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	0% going
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:06,975	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	0 in that condition you said zero
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:07,999	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Not a soul
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:09,535	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Exactly 0%
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:13,375	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Well alright I'm starting to feel a little bit better about my fellow man
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:14,399	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Hey hey hey
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:17,215	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Okay
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:17,727	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Where is he
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:19,519	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Mom in the closet
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:21,567	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Closet cuz this room is echoey
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:22,847	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And you know there's nothing like
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:24,639	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	A closet full of clothes to like how
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:25,407	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Bounce It Out
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:32,319	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	You see it's just in that one experiment that 65%
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:36,927	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	People are willing to go all the way but in all of these other scenarios they don't
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:40,767	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And even when they do say yes even when they go along with the experiment
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:42,047	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	As you can see in the film
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:42,559	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Woman
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:45,887	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	They struggle continue using the last witch on the board
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:47,935	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	No answer
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:49,727	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Please continue the next Warriors White
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:50,495	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	They have
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:52,287	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Debates with themselves
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:53,823	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Please
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:57,663	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Debates with the experimenter
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:19:01,759	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Sometimes an experiment requires that we continue
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:11,487	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Whether Lerner likes it or not we might what's interesting is that how all of these struggles all of them
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:15,839	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Please continue play out the same way it's the experimenter
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:18,911	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Frothing the Shockers along
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:21,983	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	450
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:24,031	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	For me it's all about the prods
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:26,847	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	This is what totally pulled me in
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:28,127	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Story
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:30,175	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Ron Stanley Milgram had
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:30,943	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	4 script
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:33,503	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Prods that he wrote out for his
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:34,271	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Experimenter
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:36,063	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	When the subject didn't want to continue
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:38,111	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Yep the first one was
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:39,135	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Please go on
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:39,647	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Continue play
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:40,927	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And if they
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:42,719	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Didn't go on if they resisted
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:45,791	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Experimented with breakout Prada number
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:52,191	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The experiment requires that you continue
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:58,591	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	ASAP. 195 old Innes they still were resisting or struggling they'd get Prada number three
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:00,639	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	It's absolutely essential that you continue
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:07,039	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Absolutely edible but you can't a little bit more direct
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:11,903	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The critical. For the critical. Is an absolute order 4th product is
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:13,695	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	You got no other choice
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:17,279	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	You have no other choice teacher
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:19,327	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	You must continue
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:22,143	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	That is definitely in order exactly
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:26,239	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	But everytime the experimenter pulled out the fourth Broad
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:30,079	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And this was confirmed when the experiment was redone in 2006
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:32,639	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Total disobedience
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:34,175	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Disobedience
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:37,247	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Anytime the experimenter said you must continue
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:38,783	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The Shocker would say
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:40,319	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Hell no I don't
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:41,855	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	You got no other choice.
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:44,927	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I have a choice I'm not going to go ahead with it
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:51,583	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Well I have to discontinue the experiment that
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:53,119	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I'm sorry
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:54,655	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Here's another one
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:56,959	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	We have no other choice you must have a choice
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:02,591	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	That is if you don't continue what we're going to have to discontinue the
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:07,199	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	You'll have to eat this cut it out after all he knows what he can stand
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:10,527	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	That's my opinion that's where I'm staying on it
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:12,831	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	How so
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:18,976	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The subject seemed willing to shock another human being but as soon as you say its in order they don't do it
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:22,560	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Now that's important is very important because
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:28,960	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	If you ask University undergraduates what does the Milgram study show they will invariably say something like they showed the people
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:29,728	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	EBay orders
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:34,336	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Well actually the one thing that the study really doesn't show is that people obey orders
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:40,224	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And it's a pretty big thing to Mississippi
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:42,784	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Do it if it doesn't show the people are
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:43,552	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Just
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:44,320	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Obeying orders
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:46,368	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Yeah and what does it show
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:48,416	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Okay I think it looks just like this
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:49,952	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I was going to instructions
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:50,720	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	We will begin with
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:54,048	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The participants of Avenue in the study
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:22:00,448	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Which pair of words are very Poolesville very credible hycite is scientist a scientist Institution
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:04,544	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Who is going to do this powerful piece of science
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:07,872	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Say sit down in the chair thinking wow
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:08,896	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	It's really important
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:11,200	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I'm about to help this quest for knowledge
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:12,736	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I really want to do
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:19,648	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	No snow in life lots of things that we do that worthwhile doing and not always easy
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:25,792	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And you find yourself in a situation where you've got to do something that's hot like shocking an innocent stranger over
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:28,352	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	If you think that's the right thing
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:32,960	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	If you think that song says worth pursuing you say okay I'll go along with this
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:36,800	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Seriously near shocking these people because they thought it was
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:37,824	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Worthwhile
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:40,384	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Bryn Athyn
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:44,480	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	This won't just blowing the bead and sorrow you tell me so yes sir no sir three bags full set
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:48,576	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Are engaged with a toss that trying to be good
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:49,344	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Participate
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:50,368	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Are you all right
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:51,392	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	But trying to
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:53,184	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Do the right thing
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:54,720	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	They're not doing something
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:55,488	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Because
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:56,256	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	They have to
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:59,072	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	But doing it because I think they ought to
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:02,656	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	All the difference in the world
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:04,192	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I want 220 volts
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:12,128	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Something I said I see a darker interpretation the original absolutely darker as they are doing it no question
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:18,528	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	They have the agency they think it's right on someone will they know it isn't
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:24,672	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Chilling comparison with choose a speech that him like I visited SS some SS leaders
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:31,584	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	About to come it's arranged for choices he's me so this is what you're going to do is cause you don't want to do this okay
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:35,936	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Cool nobody wants to be killing other people we realize this is hardware
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:42,336	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	What you doing is for the good of Germany in this is necessary in order to advance Noble
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:42,848	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Cause
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:46,688	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	So then anyway I'm almost done
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:47,712	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Give me two more minutes
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:50,272	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	2 more minutes so in the Milgram case
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:50,784	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Haha
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:53,600	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	With the idea that people will do bad if they think
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:54,368	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	It's good
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:57,952	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The good noble cause what's the noble cause in this case science
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:24:02,048	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	You can see this in the surveys that the men filled out
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:05,888	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	After the experiments were over exactly what was on my mind at the experiment
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:08,960	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	If the experiment had to be successful
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:10,240	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Had to be carried on
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:14,080	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The questionnaires they filled out are part of the Milgram archives at Yale
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:16,896	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Willing to help and worthwhile experiment
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:18,432	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And it's
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:24,064	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Kind of surprising a lot of them are really positive even though they've just been told
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:25,088	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	But they were
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:27,904	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Duke research in any field is a must
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:29,184	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Herculean this
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:34,048	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Do you think that more studies of the sword should be carried out definitely yes
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:39,424	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	We as as up on Lucas to the study we have this going to go to like
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:42,240	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	So vision is like what what course what they're doing is wrong
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:44,288	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	But if it looks I'm from another person
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:50,688	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Active there's a sense in which you could celebrate what they doing I mean I'm not suggesting but I'm just saying
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:55,808	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	These people are prepared to do something that's very painful to them until someone else
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:57,856	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Because they want to promote Sons
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:59,392	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	You know you can see that's a good thing
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:03,744	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I mean cuz it's like we started with this experiment that we all
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:05,280	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	See as
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:06,816	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Evidence of humans
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:07,584	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Latent
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:08,608	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Capacity for evil
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:12,448	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Yeah tell us a casino under some circumstances we don't do the bad thing weird
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:13,984	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Because
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:20,128	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Your other flip we don't have to be told exactly hate being told but we will do it on our own if we think it's good
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:23,200	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Yeah now you're saying actually these could read that
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:24,224	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	That very dark
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:26,528	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Fact as being actually evidence of something quite
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:33,696	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	What if you dress to happen if you just had some on your parents the Paradigm you could presumably making as make this out these of these are people who own kind
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:41,376	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Emmys the fact of course at the administering pain to a stranger that's what a horrifying about it but I met you
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:47,776	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Already will I have to administer shocks themselves or something good
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:53,152	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Then we say these are people already believe in something isn't this a good thing that we have people in our society
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:56,992	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Who are willing to make sacrifices full of great the greater good
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:02,624	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Tony and where do you come down do you leave this experiment in a light mood
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:03,392	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Or in a dark mood
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:10,560	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	We're close to some really fundamental truths about human nature
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:16,448	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Onion emojis by human nature as it affords infant potentials for loneliness in dog
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:22,848	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Lots and lots of lessons and that one is I think you know when you're enjoying to do something for the greater good maybe I'll do some
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:23,616	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Question
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:25,152	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	What is greater and what is good
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:29,760	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Now that right there slap some quotations around that
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:42,816	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I think stupid Walker whose podcast he has a podcast that's a good one it's cold

EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:32,384	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Although
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:33,408	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I don't know if that's the right word
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:35,712	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Cuz it said if
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:39,808	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Can you call someone you will then you're kind of done with them but there's been a fellow
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:44,160	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I've been thinking about him for better part of the year as you felt such a puzzle to me
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:45,440	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I can't
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:45,952	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Quite
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:48,512	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Please him though it's very fun to try
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:50,304	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And I heard about him
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:53,120	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	From science writer Sam Kean
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:56,192	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Fritz Haber so so so could you just like
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:59,008	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	When did he live and what did he look like in math
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:01,312	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He was
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:04,384	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Doing his his great science work right around the
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:09,248	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The twentieth century so right around 1900
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:11,552	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Very distinctive-looking man
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:12,576	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Bald on top
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:14,368	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Trim nice mustache
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:15,904	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Wore a little
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:17,440	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Business is that how you say it
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:25,120	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Pince-nez with one of those very tiny old-fashioned pair of glasses that would pinch on your nose
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:28,704	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And he was someone who had very big ambitions
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:31,264	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Just put that in context
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:38,432	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I'll bring a few other of our storytellers in Breslau Germany that's Fred Kaufman which is
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:41,504	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	A fairly small you know the smallest sort of town and
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:43,296	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	So does Clara
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:49,696	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	That's right Albers wife-beater later right Clara comes in the same town and they're both secularized Jews this
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:52,256	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The moment in German history says when Jews
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:58,400	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Had a decent amount of Freedom then this is the difference between Kaiser Wilhelm and of course Hitler's Germany
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:30:02,496	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Dan Charles historian his was the first generation when I Young
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:07,104	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Jewish boy could truly imagine that he could just be a regular part of that Society
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:08,640	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He could do anything
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:09,920	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And believed it

EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:19,904	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	It's working with chemicals about 1881 of the central issues facing Germany today
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:20,672	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Bedtime
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:21,440	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Germany
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:22,720	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Has a problem
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:23,744	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	A big problem
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:29,376	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	It has enough what they used to call them solar energy, energy from the Sun to grow crops to feed
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:31,680	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	About 30 million people
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:37,312	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	However that leaves behind 20 million Germans do you mean they're looking at 20 million people
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:38,336	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Going hungry
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:39,616	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	That's what we're heading towards
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:41,152	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I'm yet to remember it during the
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:43,968	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	During the Crimean War in the 1850s
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:44,992	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	York Stars
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:52,928	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	So around the turn of the century for German scientists like Hopper this was the d challenge he is he wants to feed he wants
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:54,208	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The feed Germany
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:30:56,000	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Next you this wasn't just a German thing
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:59,328	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	A lot of people are beginning to worry that with about a billion and a half
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:00,352	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	People on the planet
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:02,656	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The maybe we were maxing out
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:04,960	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The Earth couldn't support this many people
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:10,592	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And everyone we know the solution yeah we need a whole lot more of one simple Ella
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:16,736	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Nitrogen nitrogen nitrogen nitrogen they needed more nitrous nitrogen is an essential part of amino acids
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:18,272	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And proteins
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:24,672	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	We stick a seed like weed seed in the ground what are the reasons it grows is because it's sucking up all the night
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:28,512	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Nitrogen in the soil make it cell walls without nitrogen
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:30,560	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	You don't have life
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:38,496	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Now of course you could find some nitrogen out in the world natural deposits would be like seaweed or
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:44,640	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Cow manure or
EDL	00:31:44,640	00:31:51,040	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Poop valuable and actually two nations in South America went to war literally over bat
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:52,320	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	You can say people work
EDL	00:31:52,832	00:31:58,464	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Crazy by the way that's reporter lots of Nasser
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:32:03,840	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Everybody was desperate for sources new sources of nitrogen to make the problems even more annoying
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:08,192	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The most common source of nitrogen is in the air around us
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:11,776	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	It makes up
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:12,544	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	4
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:15,104	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Out of every five or so molecules
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:17,408	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	That we breathe so it's very a lot
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:19,712	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Yes 80% of the air
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:21,248	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Yes nitrogen atoms
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:23,552	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	So all the nitrogen you'd ever need
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:30,464	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	What's right there you can't like throw that are onto a plant they couldn't.
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:34,816	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Deploy it mean they couldn't capture that's right and I'm part of the problem here
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:38,912	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And although once again we're getting a little ahead of ourselves we'll be right back The Hobbit way I look
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:41,216	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Is that is that nitrogen is
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:42,752	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Trivalent
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:47,360	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Triphase prevalent in other words nitrogen
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:49,664	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Is really strong attachments
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:53,760	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	To itself what he means is that when nitrogen atoms are
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:55,296	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Is free floating in the air they will
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:56,576	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Cling to each other
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:58,368	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Distill nitrogen atoms will
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:33:04,768	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Beardslee hold together and it's almost impossible pry them apart his calculations show that it couldn't be done at least not with her
EDL	00:33:04,768	00:33:07,328	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Tremendous amount of energy
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:08,352	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Like
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:11,168	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Yeah yes but you know
EDL	00:33:11,168	00:33:11,936	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Being ambitious
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:13,216	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Harbor start stinking
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:15,008	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	In order to do this
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:16,288	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	We need to R
EDL	00:33:17,056	00:33:18,848	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Pressure this we need to put it under a lot of
EDL	00:33:18,848	00:33:19,616	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Pressure
EDL	00:33:19,616	00:33:22,688	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	So we start experimenting you figured out a way to take a lot of air
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:29,856	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	It's filled with these little nitrogen bonds cleaning to each other and pump it with big iron
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:36,256	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Under extreme extreme pressure at high temperature
EDL	00:33:36,256	00:33:42,656	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Get in there and number chemical reactions and
EDL	00:33:42,656	00:33:48,288	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	What happens is that your elbow in the months in nitrogen apartment cell
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:54,688	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And then forcing it to bond with a Hydra
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:33:56,224	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	In a new way
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:33:58,528	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	When hydrogen and nitrogen bond together
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:00,064	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Thing you get
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:01,856	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Is ammonia
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:02,624	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	A liquid
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:05,440	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Is captured the nitrogen
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:06,208	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Right out of the air
EDL	00:34:06,720	00:34:08,000	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	You literally get
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:08,512	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Adrift
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:10,048	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Drip
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:11,584	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Drip
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:13,120	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Of ammonia
EDL	00:34:17,984	00:34:19,520	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	It is it is
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:22,592	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Arguably the most significant
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:23,872	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Scientific breakthrough
EDL	00:34:24,384	00:34:24,896	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Of the ball
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:27,712	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Bread from the air was the phrase
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:30,784	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Does Hopper have figured out a way to take nitrogen
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:32,064	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	From the air
EDL	00:34:32,064	00:34:33,856	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Put it into the barren ground
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:35,648	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Grew wheat
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:37,440	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	This has allowed
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:38,208	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The world
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:40,000	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	To have 7 billion
EDL	00:34:41,536	00:34:43,584	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	This is what's driving the world towards
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:44,864	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	10
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:46,656	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	12 by 2050
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:52,800	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Now we're seeing about a hundred million
EDL	00:34:52,800	00:34:55,104	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Cons of synthetic fertilizer
EDL	00:34:55,104	00:34:57,664	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Produced industrial each year
EDL	00:34:57,664	00:35:00,224	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And that tonniges then moves into our
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:00,736	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Food source
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:03,552	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Our food source that moves into our bodies
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:05,856	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And the rough statistics are that
EDL	00:35:05,856	00:35:07,648	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Half of each of our bodies
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:09,952	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Contains nitrogen
EDL	00:35:09,952	00:35:10,976	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	From the haber process
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:13,024	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	No she really
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:21,984	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And so in 1918 fitzherbert gets a Nobel Prize
EDL	00:35:22,752	00:35:24,032	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	But this is my
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:25,056	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	An interesting guy
EDL	00:35:25,056	00:35:26,592	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Around the same time
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:27,616	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Officials in the US.
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:34,784	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Oconomowoc
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:38,368	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Alright just back up once
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:40,160	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	After hybrid nitrogen
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:41,696	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He was promoted
EDL	00:35:42,208	00:35:48,608	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	You know he takes over the leadership of this institute in Berlin and he starts hobnobbing with a whole different level of society
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:53,472	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	That stand Charles again mean it's a pretty heady thing for you know Jewish kid from Breslau
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:54,240	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	To be
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:55,264	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Hobnobbing with
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:35:56,032	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The emperor
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:35:58,080	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And cabinet ministers
EDL	00:35:58,592	00:35:59,360	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He's part of the club
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:01,664	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	A really really relished
EDL	00:36:02,176	00:36:05,248	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And not just cuz he was vain which everyone agrees he was but
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:07,040	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Because he loves his country
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:09,600	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Did you love the Fatherland and he loves Germany
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:16,768	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	So when World War 1 begins signs up immediately sends a letter volunteering for Duty singing
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:18,048	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Process that I used to make
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:18,560	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Food
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:20,864	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Well I can use that same process
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:23,936	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Explosives
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:30,080	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Because the thing that you put into the ground to grow more food is also the thing you can explode to make a bomb that's correct
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:31,360	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Cause
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:32,640	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	It takes such energy and
EDL	00:36:32,640	00:36:34,432	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Pressure to separate it
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:39,552	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Trivalent bond is so strong that when it comes back together
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:41,856	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	That energy is released
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:42,624	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	You could be used
EDL	00:36:43,392	00:36:43,904	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Life
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:47,744	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	In any case
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:52,608	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Back to World War one trench warfare it gets bogged down
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:54,400	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And harbor has an idea
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:56,704	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	It goes straight to the German High command
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:36:57,472	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Any any pictures
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:36:58,752	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I danced as well
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:02,848	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	We can drive those enemy soldiers out of trenches
EDL	00:37:02,848	00:37:03,360	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Gas
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:04,384	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Chlorine gas
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:06,944	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The front
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:08,480	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And when the when the wind is right
EDL	00:37:08,992	00:37:11,296	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Will just spraying the generals were not
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:13,856	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	All that conventin now they didn't like it
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:16,160	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	A lot of them are like this is not how you fight a war
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:17,184	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Play clean dirty
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:19,488	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Unsportsmanlike
EDL	00:37:19,488	00:37:20,512	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Organizes
EDL	00:37:20,512	00:37:22,816	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Soldiers he organizes whole gas
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:24,608	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Units in WW2 ask
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:27,424	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Text command of them partially travels to the
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:28,192	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Front
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:31,776	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And on April 22nd 1915 1915
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:34,592	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Hobart finds himself in a little town in Belgium called
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:38,432	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Why pressed Americans
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:44,832	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Whatever you call it Arenas on the Western Front
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:48,416	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Germans run one side the French the Canadians in the British on the other
EDL	00:37:48,416	00:37:50,976	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And they're behind the German lines is
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:56,096	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Rrr friend a frenemy
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:38:02,496	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He has a potbelly he has these spectacles is chomping on a Virginian cigar
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:08,640	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He was always smoking cigars and he's wearing the fur coat
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:13,760	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	But nobody had done what he was about to do on the scale that he
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:19,136	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	So basically at 6 p.m. on April 22nd
EDL	00:38:19,648	00:38:21,184	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	When the wind was just right here
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:22,976	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Hopper's gas troops
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:25,792	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Unscrew they open the valves
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:29,888	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	On almost 6000 tanks
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:31,680	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And painting
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:32,448	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	150
EDL	00:38:33,728	00:38:34,496	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Flooring
EDL	00:38:34,496	00:38:36,544	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	That's like an adult blue whale of
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:38,336	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Lori just trying to imagine that is that like a
EDL	00:38:38,848	00:38:42,944	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Green Cloud the cloud and then others describe it as just kind of
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:44,736	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	15 ft
EDL	00:38:44,736	00:38:48,576	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Wall and hugging the land and it just sort of approach
EDL	00:38:48,576	00:38:51,136	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And it's moving at about one meter per second
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:57,280	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	According to some accounts has it crept across no-man's-land
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:38:59,328	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And the grass was
EDL	00:38:59,328	00:39:02,656	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Turning to the color of metal Birds
EDL	00:39:02,656	00:39:04,192	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Fall from the air
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:10,592	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Within minutes gas reach the Allied side as soon as it did
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:16,992	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Soldiers began to convulse they were joking
EDL	00:39:16,992	00:39:23,392	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Hundreds of them were falling to the ground but what is a guest doing to them exactly I think what it's doing is it
EDL	00:39:23,392	00:39:29,792	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Breathe it in its irritate your lungs to the extent that they sort of filled up with fluid so quickly that you sort of drowning
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:36,192	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Phlegm yellow mucus
EDL	00:39:36,192	00:39:42,592	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Frothing out of their mouth those who could still breathe would turn blue
EDL	00:39:42,592	00:39:46,432	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	This is a description of hell
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:51,040	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Yeah but Harbor saw it as a wonderful success and wished
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:55,392	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Wish that the Germans and better prepared to exploit
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:39:57,440	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Because he felt like they really could have made
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:39:57,952	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Terrific
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:39:59,232	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Advance
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:00,000	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	If they had
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:00,768	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Had more confidence
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:02,560	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:04,096	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He is celebrated
EDL	00:40:04,864	00:40:06,400	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	You get promoted to the rank of
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:08,960	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Captain and he goes home for
EDL	00:40:08,960	00:40:09,984	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Today's a hero
EDL	00:40:10,752	00:40:11,520	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	But
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:12,544	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	When he gets there
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:13,824	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He has to contend with
EDL	00:40:13,824	00:40:14,592	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	With his wife
EDL	00:40:14,592	00:40:15,872	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Clara immerwahr
EDL	00:40:15,872	00:40:17,664	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Clara also from Breslau off
EDL	00:40:17,664	00:40:18,944	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Also from a Jewish Family
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:20,736	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And also a scientist
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:27,136	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Unusually so in those times she was actually a genius herself she was one of the first women
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:28,672	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	To earn a
EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:32,000	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	PhD in her country and shortly after his
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:33,024	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Return Clara
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:34,048	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Allegedly confronts him
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:35,328	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And says
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:37,120	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	You are morally bankrupt
EDL	00:40:38,400	00:40:42,496	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Could you but hey birb just kind of ignored her and
EDL	00:40:42,496	00:40:43,264	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	According to Legend
EDL	00:40:43,264	00:40:45,312	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He actually threw a dinner party
EDL	00:40:46,592	00:40:48,640	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	In celebration of the big sick
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:50,176	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Invited his friends over
EDL	00:40:50,176	00:40:55,552	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	We don't actually know if you threw a party but I consider that apocryphal Dan doesn't think so but what's clear
EDL	00:40:55,552	00:40:59,648	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Is it he said no reason to question what you done and that infuriated Clara
EDL	00:40:59,648	00:41:01,696	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Especially because she found out he was
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:04,512	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Leaving the next day to direct more gas attack
EDL	00:41:04,512	00:41:10,656	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And they probably had an argument that's historian Fritz turn to also happens to be for toddlers
EDL	00:41:10,656	00:41:11,680	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Got some they had a

EDL	00:41:24,992	00:41:27,296	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Pistol walks outside to the garden
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:27,808	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:31,648	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Pull the trigger
EDL	00:41:31,648	00:41:32,672	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Choose Yourself
EDL	00:41:32,672	00:41:33,184	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	In the chest

EDL	00:41:39,072	00:41:40,096	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	13 I think
EDL	00:41:40,608	00:41:41,632	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Anything directly
EDL	00:41:41,632	00:41:42,400	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Still alive
EDL	00:41:42,400	00:41:43,936	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	With a life about to run out of her
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:45,984	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Harbor
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:47,776	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	It's unknown what happened
EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:49,312	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	For the rest of the evening but it is
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:52,895	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	A well-documented fact that the very next morning on schedule he goes back
EDL	00:41:54,943	00:41:56,223	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Leaving a son
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:41:58,527	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Alone
EDL	00:41:59,295	00:41:59,807	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	With this
EDL	00:42:00,319	00:42:00,831	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Dead mother
EDL	00:42:04,671	00:42:05,183	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Cold
EDL	00:42:05,695	00:42:06,207	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Yeah
EDL	00:42:06,975	00:42:07,743	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Heartless
EDL	00:42:07,743	00:42:10,047	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	It was a terrible moment did he run away
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:13,631	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Was it Duty the sun eventually
EDL	00:42:14,399	00:42:15,679	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	African immigration to America
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:23,615	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Kill himself
EDL	00:42:30,271	00:42:36,671	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Seen around this point I just don't want to have anything to do with this guy this is a size want to take a shower
EDL	00:42:36,671	00:42:38,463	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Yahweh
EDL	00:42:38,463	00:42:39,231	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	YouTube
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:45,887	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	You on the other hand if you look at the Grand calculus people he's
EDL	00:42:45,887	00:42:49,471	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Helter fad versus people he's killed them he's got that billions of people
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:54,079	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I don't know that you could entirely call him back I might even till towards
EDL	00:42:54,079	00:42:54,591	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Saying
EDL	00:42:55,103	00:42:55,871	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He's a little good
EDL	00:42:56,639	00:43:00,991	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	To be honest you wouldn't though would you really would you really think that this guy's a good guy
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:03,039	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Honestly yeah just because
EDL	00:43:03,039	00:43:05,087	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The mathematical summing up
EDL	00:43:05,087	00:43:11,487	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	We're talking billions of people he's standing there on the front pushing the gas into the lungs other human
EDL	00:43:11,487	00:43:13,791	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Beings have smelly it's a war but still
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:16,095	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Then he goes in and celebrate
EDL	00:43:16,607	00:43:23,007	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And then walked away from his child and his wife dead in the garden and his tank more of that please
EDL	00:43:23,007	00:43:24,287	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Tasteful about
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:25,567	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Factory was too into it
EDL	00:43:26,079	00:43:30,175	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	But I do think on some level you have to divorce the man from his deeds and you got to ask
EDL	00:43:30,175	00:43:31,967	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Is the world better with him or without him
EDL	00:43:34,271	00:43:35,551	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I think you got to answer it with him
EDL	00:43:36,319	00:43:36,831	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Right
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:40,927	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Well
EDL	00:43:41,695	00:43:42,975	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Judy Cohen story
EDL	00:43:43,487	00:43:43,999	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Yeah
EDL	00:43:45,279	00:43:46,815	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The same what happened to this guy after world
EDL	00:43:47,583	00:43:52,191	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He actually was very humiliated that Germany had lost
EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:55,263	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And especially humiliated over the fact
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:59,359	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	That they had to pay enormous War reparations to other countries
EDL	00:44:00,127	00:44:03,967	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	So he decided he was going to invent a process to
EDL	00:44:03,967	00:44:05,503	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	To pay for these preparation
EDL	00:44:05,503	00:44:06,271	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	By himself
EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:10,879	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And what he decided to do is go into the ocean into seawater
EDL	00:44:11,647	00:44:13,439	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Which contains
EDL	00:44:13,951	00:44:19,583	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Very small levels of gold bites you know over the entire ocean there's a lot of
EDL	00:44:19,583	00:44:20,095	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Gold
EDL	00:44:20,607	00:44:21,631	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Dissolved into the
EDL	00:44:21,631	00:44:27,007	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	See he's been 5 years in a futile effort to distill gold from the ocean's Waters
EDL	00:44:27,007	00:44:28,287	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Sounds insane
EDL	00:44:28,287	00:44:29,311	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	On the other hand
EDL	00:44:29,311	00:44:35,455	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He wants to do it he was trying to repeat this masterstroke needless to say he fails it was actually a crushing blow
EDL	00:44:35,967	00:44:37,247	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Prayer for him and then
EDL	00:44:37,247	00:44:38,015	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Things really take
EDL	00:44:39,807	00:44:41,087	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	1933,
EDL	00:44:42,111	00:44:43,135	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And Hitler takes over
EDL	00:44:43,647	00:44:44,927	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And one of the first
EDL	00:44:44,927	00:44:45,695	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Ax
EDL	00:44:45,695	00:44:46,463	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	That
EDL	00:44:46,463	00:44:52,351	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The Nazis do is to basically issue an order that says there shall be no Jews in the civil
EDL	00:44:52,351	00:44:54,655	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Full service car was Jewish
EDL	00:44:54,655	00:44:56,447	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Because it served in World War
EDL	00:44:56,447	00:44:58,751	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He technically would be exempt
EDL	00:44:58,751	00:45:01,311	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	But 75% of the people who work for him at the Institute
EDL	00:45:02,079	00:45:04,639	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	They were Jewish and they would have to be dismissed
EDL	00:45:05,151	00:45:06,175	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	So
EDL	00:45:06,175	00:45:10,783	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He decides to take a stand and says this is intolerable I'm going to resign
EDL	00:45:10,783	00:45:14,111	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He says that he's not he's always been hiring people based on how smart they are
EDL	00:45:14,111	00:45:14,879	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And not
EDL	00:45:14,879	00:45:16,671	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Who their grandparents were
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:19,487	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	So he sends a letter to the Ministry of Education resigning
EDL	00:45:19,999	00:45:21,023	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Any leaves Germany
EDL	00:45:21,791	00:45:22,559	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Telling a friend
EDL	00:45:23,071	00:45:24,607	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He felt like he'd lost his homeland
EDL	00:45:25,119	00:45:25,887	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And then
EDL	00:45:25,887	00:45:26,655	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He starts this
EDL	00:45:27,167	00:45:28,191	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Period of roaming
EDL	00:45:28,959	00:45:31,007	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He eventually goes to England
EDL	00:45:31,007	00:45:34,079	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	But in a famous incident one of England's leading scientists
EDL	00:45:34,591	00:45:36,127	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Refuses to shake his hand
EDL	00:45:36,127	00:45:38,687	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And he is basically homeless
EDL	00:45:38,687	00:45:39,199	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	At this point
EDL	00:45:40,479	00:45:42,015	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	You know he's a man adrift
EDL	00:45:42,527	00:45:43,295	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Meanwhile
EDL	00:45:43,295	00:45:49,695	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	His health is failing in 1934 he takes a trip to Switzerland to a sanatorium that before
EDL	00:45:49,695	00:45:50,463	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	We can get there
EDL	00:45:50,463	00:45:51,231	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Heart fails
EDL	00:45:51,743	00:45:53,023	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And he dies
EDL	00:45:55,327	00:45:56,351	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Now there's a footnote
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:45:57,887	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Siri
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:45:59,167	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Strange
EDL	00:46:00,959	00:46:01,727	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	I got a little
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:06,591	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	My advice is my dorsal here stood up whenever the end
EDL	00:46:07,359	00:46:09,151	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Right so during World War I
EDL	00:46:10,175	00:46:12,991	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Hobart Institute had developed a formulation
EDL	00:46:13,503	00:46:15,039	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Of insect
EDL	00:46:15,039	00:46:16,575	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Killing gas called zyklon
EDL	00:46:17,343	00:46:18,623	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Zaycon
EDL	00:46:18,623	00:46:21,439	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Which was originally did the pesticide once again another night.
EDL	00:46:21,439	00:46:23,743	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Compound it was developed in his Institute
EDL	00:46:24,255	00:46:25,279	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He knew about it
EDL	00:46:25,279	00:46:29,887	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	In fact his chemist had given this particular pesticide is smells it was a warning
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:32,703	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	So the people didn't inadvertently breathe it in
EDL	00:46:32,703	00:46:36,031	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And get sick but after the Nazis takeover is after he died
EDL	00:46:36,031	00:46:36,799	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	They
EDL	00:46:36,799	00:46:39,871	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Reach back to the shelf and they find us as icons
EDL	00:46:41,407	00:46:46,015	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And they asked for to be reformulated to take out the warning smell
EDL	00:46:46,527	00:46:48,063	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And it becomes zyklon-b
EDL	00:46:48,831	00:46:49,855	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The Killing gas
EDL	00:46:49,855	00:46:50,879	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Of the concentration
EDL	00:46:55,999	00:46:59,839	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Did members in Highbridge family died in the concentration camps
EDL	00:46:59,839	00:47:03,423	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Members of his extended family dead certainly friends of his dick
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:04,191	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Does something
EDL	00:47:04,959	00:47:06,239	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Deeply deeply
EDL	00:47:07,775	00:47:08,799	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Wounding
EDL	00:47:08,799	00:47:09,311	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Dressing
EDL	00:47:09,823	00:47:10,335	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Upsetting
EDL	00:47:10,847	00:47:11,871	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	It's a thought
EDL	00:47:11,871	00:47:12,895	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Did you get anything to do
EDL	00:47:13,919	00:47:14,687	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	What's a plan B
EDL	00:47:15,199	00:47:15,967	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	But he did
EDL	00:47:17,247	00:47:17,759	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	The use of it
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:19,295	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	It never match
EDL	00:47:43,871	00:47:44,639	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	So
EDL	00:47:45,151	00:47:46,431	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	How do you feel about him now
EDL	00:47:46,943	00:47:47,711	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Because
EDL	00:47:47,711	00:47:49,759	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	And I can't help it feel bad.
EDL	00:47:50,783	00:47:53,087	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Despite the chlorine gas like he didn't intend for
EDL	00:47:53,087	00:47:53,855	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	For that.
EDL	00:47:53,855	00:47:55,135	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	He could have never imagined
EDL	00:47:55,135	00:47:56,159	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Battle
EDL	00:47:56,671	00:47:57,695	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	What is part of me
EDL	00:47:58,207	00:47:58,975	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Says you know
EDL	00:47:59,487	00:48:01,023	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Here's a guy who just wanted
EDL	00:48:01,023	00:48:03,327	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Do everything better than it ever been done
EDL	00:48:03,839	00:48:04,351	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Whether it was
EDL	00:48:04,863	00:48:05,887	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Feeding
EDL	00:48:05,887	00:48:06,911	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Killing more

EDL	00:52:59,775	00:53:00,799	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Is it
EDL	00:53:00,799	00:53:02,335	| radiolab_podcast18badshow |	Not to take down a fellow but
