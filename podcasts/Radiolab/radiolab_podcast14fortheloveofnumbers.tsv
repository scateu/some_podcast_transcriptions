EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:31,007	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	8
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:37,407	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Teen on October 18th 1988 number for because I've won

EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:45,855	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Because to me it recalls to mind
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:48,671	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	The Trinity know how are you feeling about all this
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:52,767	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Steph one thing that you pretty interesting to Alex as you'd expect if you were asked
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:54,047	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	The world to give you a favor
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:55,583	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	The number that be a huge difference
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:57,375	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	From one culture
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:14:00,447	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	The next 13 is an unlucky number you don't have a 13th
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:01,215	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Flooring America
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:06,335	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	In Korea they didn't have a fourth floor cuz it's unlucky for over there
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:07,615	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	But here's something
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:12,991	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	The entire planet all the continents and everyone in all the continents
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:15,295	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Came to kind of consensus around 1
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:18,367	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Yeah so tell me
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:19,903	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Alex

EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:27,583	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	I hope you got some good with a drum roll coming up movies
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:37,311	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	787 my favorite number is 7 number is number 7
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:38,847	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Much the same thing
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:40,127	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	It's like a pixel 3
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:47,039	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Acai places that nobody was a big win for 7:30 % ahead of 3
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:48,063	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Feel is the favorite number
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:49,087	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	But why is it the peep
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:49,855	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	People's favorite number
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:52,415	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	And when did that begin and I have one
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:54,975	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Oh great I love hearing reason holes in your head
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:57,279	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Years
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:58,303	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	2 + 21
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:14:59,583	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Narcissist
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:00,095	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Looking for
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:02,911	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Yai 607
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:03,423	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Seven Hills
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:05,983	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	There's no way that can
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:12,383	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Well then look up at the night sky and be a Mesopotamians you don't have a telescope what do you see the sun
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:14,175	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	On the moon at 5 Planet 7
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:15,711	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Turn all night looking at 7
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:18,015	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	That's not what you hear
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:22,623	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Number 7 just looks beautiful what you hear from people is about how big
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:23,135	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Beautiful
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:26,463	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	I like the way it looks when I write it was good-looking number
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:30,047	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Sounds beautiful sons perfect people came in
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:30,815	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Sound
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:34,143	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	I get on that train I think 7 comes out of your mouth real nice
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:36,703	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Set
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:38,751	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	I just don't feel like the number 7
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:40,799	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Belongs to me
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:41,823	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	May I guess
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:43,103	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	It even sounds good in Arabic
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:43,615	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Yeah
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:45,407	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Hebrew Sheva
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:46,431	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Really similar
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:51,295	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Sit this makes me feel a little
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:52,319	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Sad
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:55,647	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Not to get silly on you but
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:59,487	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	There's a certain pleasure that people are getting that I'm not getting
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:00,255	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Prime numbers
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:01,023	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Ever cuz
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:02,559	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	I feel like
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:04,607	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Like someone says 8 is curvy
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:06,655	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Artemis
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:07,167	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Feels
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:10,751	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	You're talking about the shape of the way that we draw them
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:12,031	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	The number 8 as a numeral
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:13,823	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	That has nothing to do with the number 8
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:18,431	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	It's the way I see you say 8 to me I see
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:24,831	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	I don't see eight apples I see that curd I see the two circles one on top of another resting Comfort makes me that makes me sad
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:28,927	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	That makes me feel like you're missing the reality of the number 8 which is
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:30,463	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	The date has intrinsic
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:32,255	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Property that's really dry speak
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:33,535	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	At 8
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:34,303	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	8 is a
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:35,327	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	I mean
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:38,655	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Like 10 okay 10 to me
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:41,215	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Is much more like when you go to the bowling alley
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:44,031	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	And the Ten Pins are lined up in that triangle pattern
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:48,127	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	You know what I'm talking about there's the one and the two than the 304
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:50,687	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	That is a gorgeous way to think about 10
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:54,271	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	10 is about this magnificent symmetry that can make a triangle
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:56,831	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	But seven is a disaster as a mathematical
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:57,343	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Object
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:58,879	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	I mean
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:01,183	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	It doesn't have nice symmetry
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:05,279	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	If I tried to put bowling pins down with 7 it's it's ugly however you arrange it
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:06,303	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Tumi
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:10,655	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	So it makes me feel left out that I can't have the same fun
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:12,191	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	That other people are having
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:18,847	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Okay but if you ask Alex why is 7 the world's favorite number
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:20,383	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	He says
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:23,455	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Because seven is arithmetic
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:24,223	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Glee unique
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:25,503	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Is the only digit
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:27,551	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	The first 10 numbers
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:29,855	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Can either be multiplied
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:31,647	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	O divided
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:32,159	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Within the group
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:37,535	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	So 1 2 3 4 5 we can double them and they stay under temp in the group
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:38,815	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	6
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:39,327	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	What's left
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:41,631	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	I have 6 8 and 10
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:42,143	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	As you can
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:43,423	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	And the ones laugh
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:45,215	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	7 + 9
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:47,007	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	And then you can divide by 3
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:48,799	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	So
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:49,567	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	7
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:50,335	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Is unique
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:54,687	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Do you think that there's enough arithmetic in everybody
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:58,271	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	I without having worked it out as painfully as you just did
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:17:59,039	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	People will
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:01,855	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Still fine there's something unusual about 7
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:02,623	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Mathematica
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:08,511	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Not about memories not about culture not about shave just about the method self
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:11,839	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	You can't separate the math world of those things the weight we
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:14,911	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Understand numbers is to do with a rhythmic
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:18,239	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	And it's the arithmetic is being absorbed by culture
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:21,311	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	The greatest example of that
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:23,103	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Is the predominant
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:23,871	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Ab7
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:24,895	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	As the most
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:27,967	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Special religious mystical number. There is
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:31,807	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	So you thinks it's not so much
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:38,719	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	That they culture has gotten in the math still around at the math actually was there first and then Dad got into the culture
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:43,327	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Alright you making me feel better
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:58,687	| radiolab_podcast14fortheloveofnumbers |	Would you like to thank somebody I would I like to thank Steve Stroh gas once again for joining us whenever we call her
