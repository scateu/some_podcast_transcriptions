EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:23,583	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	And that's the moment the government decided that

EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:59,296	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	He's thinking why did he take himself away from her
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:03,136	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	I writing that stupid newsletter
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:04,928	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	In a different way

EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:11,328	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Putting himself in his wife's shoes like that
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:13,888	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	It kind of took him out of his own misery
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:15,424	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	He could think about like
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:17,216	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Pizza Pit West
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:18,496	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	And then me
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:20,544	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Cuz I was wondering presumptuous
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:21,824	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	And outside with
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:23,104	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	It goes from self-pity
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:25,408	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	The pity for her
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:31,552	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	I think that's related to the books tell stories they actually famous for that that's like his magic crazy Talent
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:34,624	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Can you say more about that magic crazy Talent cuz like
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:35,392	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	When I was
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:38,464	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	I told elif batuman about Muhammad story
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:40,768	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Heard her reading Tolstoy passages for us
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:45,376	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	She's also a writer novelist yourself and totally obsessed with on a credit I like it alot
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:47,168	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	When I told her about Muhammad's experience
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:48,960	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	She had this idea
EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:52,288	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	About why that book in particular might have helped Muhammad
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:53,824	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Make this mental leap from
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:54,592	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Hating his wife
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:56,896	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Imagining everything through her eyes
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:27:03,296	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Customer gives a lot of weight to to all of the characters like even suggest like a newlywed young girl you spend a lot of time in her thoughts
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:06,112	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	And there's like a scene where she's trying to
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:08,928	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Eat a mushroom on a plate and it keeps slipping from under her for
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:12,256	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Time Juventus. Disobedient
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:14,816	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Slippery Mushroom in hair
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:15,584	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	4
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:16,608	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	I shaking delays
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:18,400	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Full retard
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:19,168	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Show lights
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:23,520	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	It's a book that takes the subjectivity of young women seriously
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:29,408	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	And not just young women everyone that servants and I'm the dog there's a hunting scene in this that's dumb
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:31,456	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Actually goes to the perspective of the dog
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:35,808	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	And and everything just seems so true you read that near like that's definitely what that dog was thinking
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:42,208	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	And so she says the experience of reading Tolstoy is the experience of being constantly confronted with how differently the
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:43,744	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	The same thing can look from us
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:50,144	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Slightly different perspective like he's just he never gets bored of showing that and in the book the characters themselves
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:56,544	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Judge each other and then are able to expand that and to see each other a little bit more generously that's what elephants do
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:57,312	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	That tell stories book
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:58,848	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Gave to Muhammad
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:00,640	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Tiffany's cat

EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:29,312	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Muhammad's wife
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:30,848	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	8 years after his arrest
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:33,920	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Somali political winds shifted and
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:36,224	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	The dictator was trying to appease his enemies
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:38,272	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Muhammad and the others were suddenly released
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:42,624	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	He discovered his region of Somalia was flattened by Civil War
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:44,672	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	But it also discovered something else
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:46,464	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	His wife is mine

EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:20,512	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Finally they figure out a way that they can reunite in a neighboring country
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:23,328	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	And though it's been almost
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:24,864	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	A decade since they seen each other
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:27,680	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	You recognized her immediately from a disc
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:29,984	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	And if they drew closer
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:32,032	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Is Van opens her arms to
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:33,312	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Give her husband a hug
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:34,848	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	And he reaches out
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:37,920	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	And all that he could do in that moment
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:39,712	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Is shake her hand
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:52,000	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Do I not feel as I felt even even prison I was feeling so much in love with her
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:53,024	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	And yet when we met
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:57,376	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	She was like a
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:30:00,448	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	You know something like that
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:01,728	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Well
EDL	00:30:01,728	00:30:02,496	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	I mean
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:03,264	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	I will
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:04,288	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Asking myself
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:05,824	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Why do you not
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:07,104	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Ice in love with her
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:12,992	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	This was a moment
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:14,784	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	That we found really
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:16,320	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Interesting and
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:21,184	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	As we were talking about it with Greg Studio
EDL	00:30:21,184	00:30:23,488	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Greg said it was really In This Moment
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:27,328	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	This. Of Dow is overcome by a momentary doubt
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:28,352	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Of the possibility
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:29,120	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Setting up
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:29,632	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	That new life
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:30,656	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Dreamed of on the way
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:32,960	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	That the book came back to Muhammad
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:33,472	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Again
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:39,104	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Except this time you didn't think of the main character and he thought of a different character in the book A guy by the name of
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:40,384	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	11
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:42,432	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	This is a character who is
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:45,248	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	I also love also has
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:46,784	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Like strong emotions
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:49,856	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	And like Muhammad in that one moment with his wife
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:51,904	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Levin spends the entire book
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:54,720	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	RAC by doubts
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:58,048	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	But everything and eternal dissatisfaction with yourself
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:31:00,864	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Man attempts to improve and failures
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:01,888	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	And then Eternal X
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:02,912	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Location of the heart
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:05,216	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	And standing there with his wife
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:07,520	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Is weirded out by his own lack of
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:08,032	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Feeling
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:10,336	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Muhammad had two thoughts like oh
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:12,640	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	I'm like leaven In This Moment
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:13,152	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	And
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:15,456	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	What happens to 11 at the end
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:22,112	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	And what's really cool about Levin's conclusively of the book is he finally just decides like I'm not going to worry about how weird my feeling
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:23,904	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	But she doesn't
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:26,976	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Actually come he doesn't make himself whole
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:30,304	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	As he wants to be he wants to the whole book he wants to be
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:38,240	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Fully in love with Kitty and not just with his heart but with his mind soul and want to be a good Christian and everything has
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:39,264	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	It sort of makes sense
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:42,592	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	But you know but he's just a complicated sort of
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:45,152	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Guy in and got many
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:47,200	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Different feeling for the end of the book it kind of feels like
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:48,736	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	You know
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:49,760	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	I'm going to stop
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:51,296	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Just
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:55,904	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Thinking obsessively about how awkward I am in this situation
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:31:56,928	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	And I'm just going to
EDL	00:31:56,928	00:31:58,464	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Dealer supposed to
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:32:00,000	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	I'm going to be the dad
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:01,536	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	I'm going to be the husband
EDL	00:32:01,536	00:32:03,328	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	And Muhammad thought to himself
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:05,376	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Like maybe I need to do that too because
EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:08,960	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Who knows where I'm at right now I was in a Cell for 8 years
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:09,984	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	In the prison
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:12,544	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	In a way you wouldn't be living
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:14,592	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	You're still
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:15,872	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Inside yourself you have no.
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:17,152	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	You have to open
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:18,688	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Minifigures Lego
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:19,968	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Opening back up
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:22,016	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	It's probably going to take some time
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:26,368	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	And some work we have to learn to love each other again
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:28,672	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	And daddy says
EDL	00:32:28,672	00:32:29,696	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	What they did
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:31,744	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Aeropostale had a lot to do with it
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:35,072	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	You think Tolstoy helps you fall in love again

EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:46,592	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	This man has
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:48,640	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Inexperience and she was living God real life
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:50,944	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Difficult for people to

EDL	00:32:53,248	00:32:55,296	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Is solitary confinement for so long
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:58,112	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	I was protopage got to leave it at that particular time
EDL	00:32:59,392	00:33:01,184	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	And you're saying that knowing
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:03,744	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	That you are hard to live with knowing it
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:05,792	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Yes made it easier for us to

EDL	00:33:46,496	00:33:47,264	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	Tapped Out
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:48,544	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	On a concrete wall

EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:05,952	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	After their release he was just too out of practice to return to medicine and after prison the doctor did try to read

EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:19,776	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	But he knew someone could use it somebody of journalist
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:26,176	| radiolab_podcast17annainsomalia |	And I took that book to him and I told him that the best thing about prison
