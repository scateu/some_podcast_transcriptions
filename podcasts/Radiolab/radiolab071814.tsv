EDL	00:00:24,576	00:00:25,600	| radiolab071814 |	Begin on a plane
EDL	00:00:26,112	00:00:29,440	| radiolab071814 |	Thank you Brooke which carried our newly married producer Tim Howard
EDL	00:00:29,952	00:00:30,720	| radiolab071814 |	To the Galapagos
EDL	00:00:31,488	00:00:34,048	| radiolab071814 |	So I took the plane from
EDL	00:00:34,048	00:00:40,448	| radiolab071814 |	Keto we just finished our honeymoon that morning me and Brooke
EDL	00:00:40,448	00:00:46,848	| radiolab071814 |	They make announcements the certain point the flight attendants
EDL	00:00:46,848	00:00:49,152	| radiolab071814 |	Open up all of the overhead bins and they walk up and down

EDL	00:00:56,064	00:01:02,464	| radiolab071814 |	Whatever bugs might have been stuck on the plane by this point I'm getting super excited
EDL	00:01:02,464	00:01:04,512	| radiolab071814 |	And I'm thinking about Darwin
EDL	00:01:04,512	00:01:06,304	| radiolab071814 |	And I start reading
EDL	00:01:06,304	00:01:09,888	| radiolab071814 |	Voyage of the beagle his book on this note that I bought
EDL	00:01:09,888	00:01:10,656	| radiolab071814 |	Trip

EDL	00:01:24,736	00:01:27,040	| radiolab071814 |	The plane window
EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:30,112	| radiolab071814 |	This totally wild like I'm nursing like
EDL	00:01:30,112	00:01:30,880	| radiolab071814 |	This
EDL	00:01:30,880	00:01:33,184	| radiolab071814 |	Storybook blue green
EDL	00:01:33,184	00:01:35,232	| radiolab071814 |	Iridescent aquamarine
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:36,256	| radiolab071814 |	I'm thinking
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:37,536	| radiolab071814 |	Wow
EDL	00:01:37,536	00:01:43,936	| radiolab071814 |	This is going to be like dropping into another world like nature in its purest form my version was
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:45,728	| radiolab071814 |	It is my dream of what I would like
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:47,520	| radiolab071814 |	Did you land on and it sort of like
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:48,288	| radiolab071814 |	Lowe's
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:49,312	| radiolab071814 |	Grassy knoll
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:52,128	| radiolab071814 |	An enormous turd comes by
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:55,456	| radiolab071814 |	The one that you could sit on the top of and it wouldn't notice that you were there
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:59,808	| radiolab071814 |	Just going to meet you at the airport just wondering cuz it's very similar to what I was
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:00,320	| radiolab071814 |	Picturing
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:06,208	| radiolab071814 |	But can we take a 40 minute bus ride to Puerto Vallarta
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:08,256	| radiolab071814 |	Webster Highway
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:11,840	| radiolab071814 |	Where are you are you are you are a Toyota
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:14,144	| radiolab071814 |	Which turned out to be kind of a big town
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:15,936	| radiolab071814 |	Tons of people live there
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:16,960	| radiolab071814 |	Fishing Village
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:20,032	| radiolab071814 |	Conn's no it's way bigger than a fishing Village
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:25,152	| radiolab071814 |	And just let me say that my first hours in Galapagos were totally different than I was expecting
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:30,784	| radiolab071814 |	Sort of the first thing that
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:33,856	| radiolab071814 |	Where the hell am I
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:34,624	| radiolab071814 |	I
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:40,000	| radiolab071814 |	I'm walking through the town's kind of weight starting to set
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:43,584	| radiolab071814 |	I'm actually walking down Charles Darwin Avenue
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:46,144	| radiolab071814 |	Just kind of getting the lay of the land
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:46,912	| radiolab071814 |	When
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:47,936	| radiolab071814 |	All of a sudden
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:57,664	| radiolab071814 |	This line of cars comes around the corner
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:02:59,712	| radiolab071814 |	Honking
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:02,016	| radiolab071814 |	Endless honking
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:09,184	| radiolab071814 |	And they're waving flag blue flag the first I didn't know what that was happening but turned out it was an election
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:13,792	| radiolab071814 |	And I was just really blown away that this
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:15,840	| radiolab071814 |	Continue
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:17,120	| radiolab071814 |	This procession
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:20,704	| radiolab071814 |	For like 15 minutes
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:27,104	| radiolab071814 |	And I remember asking one guy
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:28,896	| radiolab071814 |	Who's your candidate in there like
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:34,272	| radiolab071814 |	I didn't know where the guy was but turns out he was the incumbent
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:35,808	| radiolab071814 |	And I'm like
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:36,832	| radiolab071814 |	Is it going to win
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:40,160	| radiolab071814 |	In this guy he doesn't even say anything he just kind of points
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:40,928	| radiolab071814 |	Spypoint
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:42,208	| radiolab071814 |	The car is in front and behind
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:43,744	| radiolab071814 |	As if like dude
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:48,608	| radiolab071814 |	Seriously you see how many of us there are
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,656	| radiolab071814 |	But then it a certain point
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:52,192	| radiolab071814 |	I noticed that one guy
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:54,240	| radiolab071814 |	By himself standing on the sidewalk
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:57,568	| radiolab071814 |	Wearing a white shirt and jeans he's waving a flag
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:59,104	| radiolab071814 |	But his flag has a different color
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:03:59,616	| radiolab071814 |	Is why
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:03,200	| radiolab071814 |	And it's really loud but I go up to him
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:05,760	| radiolab071814 |	And I yell at him who's your candidate
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:07,296	| radiolab071814 |	He said
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:09,088	| radiolab071814 |	I am a candidate
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:10,112	| radiolab071814 |	I'm like what
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:12,672	| radiolab071814 |	Are you seriously
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:13,952	| radiolab071814 |	So his name is Leon need
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:15,488	| radiolab071814 |	Journey apparel
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:17,024	| radiolab071814 |	For Toyota Center
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:19,327	| radiolab071814 |	He is a naturalist guide
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:22,655	| radiolab071814 |	You actually end up meeting a lot of people employed that way in Galapagos
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:25,983	| radiolab071814 |	And he tells me so outsider
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:29,055	| radiolab071814 |	Political politically speaking he's an outsider
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:35,455	| radiolab071814 |	And of course I'm wondering why he's standing there by himself waving the flag at this entire parade of people who died
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:36,735	| radiolab071814 |	Don't support him at all
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:38,271	| radiolab071814 |	They tells me
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:43,135	| radiolab071814 |	CL memento
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:45,695	| radiolab071814 |	If a party in power now that the front runner
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:50,047	| radiolab071814 |	If they get elected
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:52,607	| radiolab071814 |	Can I see a dark and uncertain future
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:54,143	| radiolab071814 |	Grand Hotel
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:55,423	| radiolab071814 |	More big hotels
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:58,751	| radiolab071814 |	More of these enormous boats more
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:00,287	| radiolab071814 |	People
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:03,359	| radiolab071814 |	If things keep going this way
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:05,919	| radiolab071814 |	Who's going to stand up for nature
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:12,319	| radiolab071814 |	This is Radiolab and we are dedicating the entire hour to
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:14,111	| radiolab071814 |	This little set of islands and
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:14,879	| radiolab071814 |	To that question
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:15,903	| radiolab071814 |	As the world is
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:21,023	| radiolab071814 |	Filling up with more and more and more people is it inevitable that even the most sacred
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:23,327	| radiolab071814 |	Pristine places on the planet will eventually
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:24,863	| radiolab071814 |	Get swallowed up
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:26,911	| radiolab071814 |	How far are we willing to go
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:27,935	| radiolab071814 |	Return to play
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:29,471	| radiolab071814 |	To what it was
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:29,983	| radiolab071814 |	Before we got there
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,519	| radiolab071814 |	And more importantly
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,335	| radiolab071814 |	Can we
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:37,407	| radiolab071814 |	Okay so this is Linda
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:43,807	| radiolab071814 |	Linda Kao currently the science advisor for Galapagos Conservancy I began my working Galapagos
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:46,367	| radiolab071814 |	In 1981 who first came to study tortoise
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,391	| radiolab071814 |	Back then
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:49,951	| radiolab071814 |	Galapagos was really isil
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:55,583	| radiolab071814 |	Barely any cars super limited electricity all I remember is having a smile on my face
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:57,119	| radiolab071814 |	All the time
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:06:01,983	| radiolab071814 |	Because you know as a biologist going to Galapagos is like going to Mecca
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:08,127	| radiolab071814 |	She said you have islands with massive volcanoes
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:10,431	| radiolab071814 |	Tree ferns that grow
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:17,343	| radiolab071814 |	In a well above a human's height
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:19,391	| radiolab071814 |	Man grows back lava flows in
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:20,671	| radiolab071814 |	Pink flamingos
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:26,047	| radiolab071814 |	This is Matias Espinosa naturalist guide in the Galapagos like Linda
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:28,863	| radiolab071814 |	He says that when he first got to the Galapagos in the 80s
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:31,935	| radiolab071814 |	He couldn't believe that the place was real breasts taken
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:33,727	| radiolab071814 |	You visit an island called
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:35,007	| radiolab071814 |	Edina
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:36,543	| radiolab071814 |	First things ISO
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:39,103	| radiolab071814 |	Was lava fluid was moving
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:47,551	| radiolab071814 |	Is it what's what's going on you know no that's not like 1,000
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:49,855	| radiolab071814 |	See iguanas taking a sunbath
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:53,183	| radiolab071814 |	He said he would go on these Dives
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:58,303	| radiolab071814 |	Can you imagine schools of hammerhead sharks.
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:06:59,583	| radiolab071814 |	508 ended
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:01,375	| radiolab071814 |	Passing in front of you
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:02,911	| radiolab071814 |	Like tuna
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:05,215	| radiolab071814 |	Losartan
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:06,495	| radiolab071814 |	It shows you the power
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:08,031	| radiolab071814 |	Choose yours Revolution
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:10,591	| radiolab071814 |	There is revolutions very strong
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:13,663	| radiolab071814 |	Okay so
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:20,063	| radiolab071814 |	Quick contacts Galapagos Island cluster island off the coast of Ecuador in the Pacific 19
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:22,111	| radiolab071814 |	Bigger island bunch of smaller one
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:25,951	| radiolab071814 |	And this is a place of course where Darwin landed in 1835
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:27,487	| radiolab071814 |	And
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:29,279	| radiolab071814 |	As he went Island to Island
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:34,655	| radiolab071814 |	He started noticing that there were all these creatures that were really similar to each other
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:41,055	| radiolab071814 |	But also a little bit different the tortoises had different shells depending on the kind of Island
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:47,455	| radiolab071814 |	I lived on the finches look similar but their beaks were always a little bit different and it's got some thinking what if it isn't the
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:48,991	| radiolab071814 |	The way that everybody always says
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:55,903	| radiolab071814 |	What if God didn't create every single species in the beginning and leave them unchanged what if in life
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:59,999	| radiolab071814 |	Is purely change what if everything has been changing all the time
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:06,911	| radiolab071814 |	Darwin's bye weeks on Galapagos pushing to develop his theory of evolution and that's also why
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:10,751	| radiolab071814 |	When we think of evolution we think of the Galapagos in particular
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:15,359	| radiolab071814 |	We think of two iconic creatures
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:16,895	| radiolab071814 |	The tortoise
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:19,711	| radiolab071814 |	And the fence
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:25,599	| radiolab071814 |	Let me start by telling you about the tortoise
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:28,671	| radiolab071814 |	Bright is such a perfect day for
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:30,463	| radiolab071814 |	Tortoise hunting
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:33,535	| radiolab071814 |	You're not hunting but looking for
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:35,583	| radiolab071814 |	4th day I was there
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:41,983	| radiolab071814 |	I went to the island of floreana which Darwin visited and they're up in the highlands basically in the
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:44,287	| radiolab071814 |	The middle of this yard oh my God
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:48,383	| radiolab071814 |	33 massive tortoises
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:51,967	| radiolab071814 |	Does clustered together under a tree
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:55,295	| radiolab071814 |	Wow that is freaking amazing
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:09:01,183	| radiolab071814 |	Describe them what they look like is there such alien-looking creatures there like the size of
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:03,231	| radiolab071814 |	Json even know what they're massive
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:05,791	| radiolab071814 |	They look like they would crush you to death
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:07,839	| radiolab071814 |	How many years has it been here for
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:09,887	| radiolab071814 |	They can live for over 150 years
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:12,191	| radiolab071814 |	Is a tortoise trying to get over branch
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:22,943	| radiolab071814 |	Who is that that is a sound of a tortoise breathing
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:24,479	| radiolab071814 |	That's cool
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:30,879	| radiolab071814 |	So Linda when she first went to Galapagos to study these tortoises about 30 years ago
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:34,207	| radiolab071814 |	I did a trip where we backpacked around the Caldera
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:39,583	| radiolab071814 |	She took a trip to this island called Isabella hike up the side of a volcano and looked at all the tortoise country
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:42,143	| radiolab071814 |	And it was an impenetrable Forest
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:47,007	| radiolab071814 |	Basically tortoise heaven and what makes it so perf
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:48,031	| radiolab071814 |	Pek for tortoises
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:52,895	| radiolab071814 |	Is in the dry season in Galapagos
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:54,943	| radiolab071814 |	Comes onto the island
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:58,015	| radiolab071814 |	It rolls over this Forest
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:58,783	| radiolab071814 |	And it
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:00,575	| radiolab071814 |	Patches in the branches of the
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:05,439	| radiolab071814 |	The water that drips down from the top of the trees down to the ground
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:08,255	| radiolab071814 |	Creating what we called drip
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:08,767	| radiolab071814 |	Pools
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:11,071	| radiolab071814 |	Which provides
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:12,095	| radiolab071814 |	Tortoises with
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:16,703	| radiolab071814 |	Water during the dry season and they like to rest in water
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:19,775	| radiolab071814 |	And so they're under the trees you have these Pawn
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:21,823	| radiolab071814 |	With dozens of tortoise domes
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:22,847	| radiolab071814 |	Rising out of the water
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:26,687	| radiolab071814 |	So that was my first experience
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:30,527	| radiolab071814 |	It was a magical magical area and then
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:35,647	| radiolab071814 |	I actually didn't get back there for maybe fifteen years from when I was there the first time
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:38,207	| radiolab071814 |	And when I returned
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:39,999	| radiolab071814 |	That Forest
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:40,511	| radiolab071814 |	Was
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:42,047	| radiolab071814 |	100% gone
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:48,447	| radiolab071814 |	The drip pools were just dry
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:49,471	| radiolab071814 |	Dust bowls
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:53,311	| radiolab071814 |	There was no shade tortoises with with
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:55,359	| radiolab071814 |	Sitting out in the sun oil
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:58,175	| radiolab071814 |	Crowded around a couple of storks that was still there
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:11:04,575	| radiolab071814 |	This is Carl Campbell I went Valley conservation and I'm based here in the Galapagos Islands Charles actually the guide
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:05,599	| radiolab071814 |	You showed me those tortoise
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:06,879	| radiolab071814 |	Time it was just a
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:09,695	| radiolab071814 |	Yeah I was a Barren landscape
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:10,719	| radiolab071814 |	Baron Brown
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:13,535	| radiolab071814 |	What happened to the forest
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:14,815	| radiolab071814 |	Goats
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:15,583	| radiolab071814 |	Goats
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:18,655	| radiolab071814 |	That was definitely not what I thought
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:21,983	| radiolab071814 |	I thought you said people was kind of collaboration
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:24,287	| radiolab071814 |	So here's a story
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:29,919	| radiolab071814 |	Goats were originally sent abroad to the Galapagos probably Pirates and Wireless
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:31,967	| radiolab071814 |	Back in the 1500s
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:38,367	| radiolab071814 |	Tony sellers making these days long voyages across the Pacific and Galapagos was the the naijapal
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:39,903	| radiolab071814 |	On the whaling Road
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:41,183	| radiolab071814 |	Where
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:45,535	| radiolab071814 |	Yeah you come and get fresh water but you also come in and pick up tortoises
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:46,559	| radiolab071814 |	Land tortoises
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:52,959	| radiolab071814 |	And yet but to take away several hundred of them often and turn them upside down and I can laugh
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:54,495	| radiolab071814 |	Year-and-a-half
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:57,311	| radiolab071814 |	And all the s*** like lying there upside down
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:58,847	| radiolab071814 |	Liner upside down
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:05,247	| radiolab071814 |	In order to make space for the tortoises The Wailers and Pirates would often take goats that they brought with them
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:06,271	| radiolab071814 |	And throw them onto the island
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:09,855	| radiolab071814 |	That way when they're on their way back and sick of eating tortoises
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:11,647	| radiolab071814 |	They could grab those goats
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:15,231	| radiolab071814 |	So Wailers Buccaneers
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:17,023	| radiolab071814 |	Introduce goats to Galapagos
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:19,071	| radiolab071814 |	Put on islands like Isabella
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:21,119	| radiolab071814 |	Which is this Massive Attack
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:21,887	| radiolab071814 |	Size of Rhode Island
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:24,959	| radiolab071814 |	The goods were actually penned into just a little part of it
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:32,127	| radiolab071814 |	Because there was this black lava rock that ran across the island dreamly rough lava that's extremely
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:33,151	| radiolab071814 |	Play difficult to walk
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:34,431	| radiolab071814 |	12 miles of
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:36,479	| radiolab071814 |	So that had acted as a barrier
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:38,783	| radiolab071814 |	Basically with goats on one side tortoises on the other
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:43,647	| radiolab071814 |	But according to Linda sometime in the late 1970s
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:45,183	| radiolab071814 |	The goat Scott braids
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:48,767	| radiolab071814 |	We were probably talking just a few goats but
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:52,351	| radiolab071814 |	By the 1990s
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:58,495	| radiolab071814 |	Those few goats the population had exploded to about a hundred thousand votes
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:00,543	| radiolab071814 |	And
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:02,335	| radiolab071814 |	If you think of hundred thousand
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:04,895	| radiolab071814 |	Eating everything in their path
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:06,175	| radiolab071814 |	Every sort of plant
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:09,247	| radiolab071814 |	Even the bark off of trees they destroy the forest
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:14,111	| radiolab071814 |	So now they had a dilemma on the one hand
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:15,647	| radiolab071814 |	Tortoises needed help
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,415	| radiolab071814 |	On the other hand
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:18,463	| radiolab071814 |	You had all of these goats
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:23,839	| radiolab071814 |	I didn't choose to be on the island and it wasn't their fault and the goats that were out there were gorgeous
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:26,911	| radiolab071814 |	You know they had curled horns different colored
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:28,959	| radiolab071814 |	Just beautiful animal
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:31,263	| radiolab071814 |	And they been there for 500 years
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:33,823	| radiolab071814 |	Some people would concern you with
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:40,479	| radiolab071814 |	Goats have their own set of if you will write to be there those arguments came out frequently which car would respond
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:43,551	| radiolab071814 |	Yeah we going to let tortoises go extinct
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:44,831	| radiolab071814 |	Yeah this thousands of
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:46,367	| radiolab071814 |	Islands around the world that have goats on
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:49,695	| radiolab071814 |	These tortoises are only found here so way2go values lie
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:53,791	| radiolab071814 |	And so in 1994
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:59,423	| radiolab071814 |	What we called the tortoise Summit in England and that was where we started
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:01,727	| radiolab071814 |	The discussions about what are we going to do
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:03,775	| radiolab071814 |	Experts came from all over the world
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:05,823	| radiolab071814 |	Linda says we want to get rid of hiccups
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:09,663	| radiolab071814 |	And many of them thought we were nuts and then it was impossible
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:10,943	| radiolab071814 |	There's a hundred thousand of them
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:12,223	| radiolab071814 |	So many doubters
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:16,831	| radiolab071814 |	Carl says he even heard the idea why don't you put lines
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:23,231	| radiolab071814 |	Yeah they eat in Africa yo why don't you get Lions on that and those yeah really interesting ideas but
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:27,839	| radiolab071814 |	At some point they're going to get hungry and they're going to start eating all the other things that yeah you treasure
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:29,375	| radiolab071814 |	By the occasional terrorist
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:32,959	| radiolab071814 |	Mini case after endless
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:35,775	| radiolab071814 |	Planning meeting took 8 years
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:37,055	| radiolab071814 |	I think they come in
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:40,639	| radiolab071814 |	Project Isabella
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:49,087	| radiolab071814 |	To the helicopters we use that cool. Indy 500 small helicopter
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:55,487	| radiolab071814 |	Messengers one part single turbo on spotlights this is Frazier
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:15:01,887	| radiolab071814 |	2004 through 2006 almost every day during that time Fraser would fly over Isabela Island
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:08,287	| radiolab071814 |	Two guys with two Shooters are the sort of the helicopter
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:12,127	| radiolab071814 |	One guy that ran away to join his friends
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:18,527	| radiolab071814 |	Circle reloj
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:24,927	| radiolab071814 |	And then we start picking off the goats
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:31,327	| radiolab071814 |	One by one by one video where you see these packs
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:32,095	| radiolab071814 |	Goats
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:33,631	| radiolab071814 |	Running for their lives
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:36,703	| radiolab071814 |	And then dropping to the ground
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:41,311	| radiolab071814 |	The last goat or two might
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:47,199	| radiolab071814 |	Start of run into a area where it's impossible to reach
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:51,551	| radiolab071814 |	And what would those with funnel acacian as close as we could have run on top of the cab
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:55,647	| radiolab071814 |	Drop out one of the two shooters that was in the helicopter and he physically go into the cave
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:58,719	| radiolab071814 |	Shoe the guy chapped
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:15:59,999	| radiolab071814 |	Oh shoot them on sight
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:04,863	| radiolab071814 |	And then you go on and actually in under year through this aerial attack
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:08,191	| radiolab071814 |	The end of wiping out 90% of the goats on Isabella
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:15,103	| radiolab071814 |	But to give example the nature of his business that's Josh Tomlin he runs an NGO that was involved in Project
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:17,663	| radiolab071814 |	It's relatively easy
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:19,199	| radiolab071814 |	To remove 90% of
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:20,223	| radiolab071814 |	Agra population
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:26,623	| radiolab071814 |	Confirm an island but as it become rare and rare there harder and harder to detect to go to become quote
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:30,207	| radiolab071814 |	Educated learning that this sound
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:31,231	| radiolab071814 |	Mean
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:38,911	| radiolab071814 |	So the goat start hiding in the bushes they want Move To Learn to stand under tree holding their breath
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:42,495	| radiolab071814 |	And so you end up flying around in expensive helicopter
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:44,031	| radiolab071814 |	Not finding any good
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:46,335	| radiolab071814 |	Now the way we deal with that
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:49,663	| radiolab071814 |	Interesting when we use a technique called Judas goats
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:52,735	| radiolab071814 |	Yeah you disguise
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:59,647	| radiolab071814 |	Initially was Carl suggestion gregarious and like being in groups
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:01,439	| radiolab071814 |	And so
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:04,511	| radiolab071814 |	The technique that we would use was
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:11,679	| radiolab071814 |	You would fire helicopter to fly around 5 to go see kids
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:14,495	| radiolab071814 |	Then come back back to Basecamp offload then
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:16,031	| radiolab071814 |	And
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:17,311	| radiolab071814 |	He put a radio collar on
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:19,359	| radiolab071814 |	Any thrown back on the island
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:22,175	| radiolab071814 |	And then you wait
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:25,247	| radiolab071814 |	Instinctively that
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:25,759	| radiolab071814 |	Longo
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:27,295	| radiolab071814 |	We'll go and find out the gut
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,599	| radiolab071814 |	Week 2 weeks go by
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:34,719	| radiolab071814 |	Fire up the helicopter they get back over the island with his
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:35,487	| radiolab071814 |	Little device
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:38,047	| radiolab071814 |	It's a directional antenna
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:39,583	| radiolab071814 |	Start tracking the Judas goat
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:42,655	| radiolab071814 |	Till they spotted with some other goats and then
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:45,983	| radiolab071814 |	Everyone gets shot
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:47,007	| radiolab071814 |	Except the Judas go
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:50,847	| radiolab071814 |	Tell her to go find more friends
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:51,871	| radiolab071814 |	And then
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:53,663	| radiolab071814 |	Everyone gets shot
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:55,967	| radiolab071814 |	Except the Judas go
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:17:58,271	| radiolab071814 |	And then you do it again
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:02,367	| radiolab071814 |	Everyone gets shot except the Judas goat
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:03,391	| radiolab071814 |	And
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:05,951	| radiolab071814 |	You do that every two weeks for a year
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:13,887	| radiolab071814 |	That is how they go from 90% Go free to 91 to 92 to 93 to 94
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:17,727	| radiolab071814 |	It sounds like having a program on you over and over and over again
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:20,799	| radiolab071814 |	It gets worse as a good Judas go
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:21,823	| radiolab071814 |	Until
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:23,359	| radiolab071814 |	It gets pregnant
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:26,175	| radiolab071814 |	Cuz then it doesn't want to be social anymore
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:27,967	| radiolab071814 |	It goes off and
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:29,759	| radiolab071814 |	Has his kid and is very salty
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:32,831	| radiolab071814 |	Which is the last thing you want when you're trying to get goats off Island
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:36,927	| radiolab071814 |	So Carl kept mulling this problem what would it take to buy Saline MI
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:38,463	| radiolab071814 |	The the perfect guy
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:43,071	| radiolab071814 |	That ideal Judas goat if you will is it got that wood
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:45,119	| radiolab071814 |	Search for Andy search for
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:46,399	| radiolab071814 |	And it would never get pregnant
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:48,959	| radiolab071814 |	Soco Campbell figured I'd technique
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:55,359	| radiolab071814 |	Where we could sterilize them in the field got the goat start them in a matter of minutes
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:56,127	| radiolab071814 |	Smith's net
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:57,151	| radiolab071814 |	Did you do this
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:19:00,735	| radiolab071814 |	Yeah well I I stood next to call and watch him do it
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:03,039	| radiolab071814 |	And
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:04,319	| radiolab071814 |	Call take it one step further
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:06,111	| radiolab071814 |	Any actually
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:07,647	| radiolab071814 |	Gave these females
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:08,671	| radiolab071814 |	Hormone implants
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:14,815	| radiolab071814 |	That's basically put them in the heat for an extended duration normally female goat would be in heat for a couple days
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:16,607	| radiolab071814 |	These females are gopher
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:18,143	| radiolab071814 |	Bowling 290 days
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:21,727	| radiolab071814 |	And wherever they went they would lure the male goes out of their caves
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:23,263	| radiolab071814 |	So that you know
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:29,407	| radiolab071814 |	All in all over the course of the two-year program we had
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:35,807	| radiolab071814 |	Hundreds of Judas go without using those boots they were able to go from 94% Go free to 96
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:42,207	| radiolab071814 |	7th and 98th NYC when you have only Judas goats mating up with other Judas goats than you
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:44,767	| radiolab071814 |	And say the goats have been eliminated you done
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:48,863	| radiolab071814 |	Point they got to at least on Isabella in mid-2006
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:55,775	| radiolab071814 |	This kind of eradication program was Far Beyond
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:59,359	| radiolab071814 |	On anything that anyone had ever done anywhere in the world
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:08,319	| radiolab071814 |	Because it turns out they were just doing this on Isabela Island
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:13,439	| radiolab071814 |	Over the course of about 7 years they eliminate over 250000
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:22,655	| radiolab071814 |	So you you complete that with Isabella
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:23,679	| radiolab071814 |	And
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:24,959	| radiolab071814 |	Did it work
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:29,823	| radiolab071814 |	Yeah the results of this way absolutely impressive
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:35,967	| radiolab071814 |	Plants re-emerging at trees growing back I didn't really show. Of time and this allowed for those important drip pools
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:38,271	| radiolab071814 |	And tortoises
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:41,855	| radiolab071814 |	They basically got their home back
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:43,903	| radiolab071814 |	This is a real thing
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:48,255	| radiolab071814 |	Tortoise
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:49,279	| radiolab071814 |	Walking around
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:54,655	| radiolab071814 |	Increible
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:57,983	| radiolab071814 |	So they did it they got all the guts
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:59,007	| radiolab071814 |	Not all the goats
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:01,567	| radiolab071814 |	The Judas goats
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:03,103	| radiolab071814 |	They kept them around
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:06,175	| radiolab071814 |	That would have shot them first it's out of
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:08,479	| radiolab071814 |	Pay for them
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:10,527	| radiolab071814 |	They needed to goats because
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:11,039	| radiolab071814 |	Well
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:14,111	| radiolab071814 |	There was a problem
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:15,391	| radiolab071814 |	Of people
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:28,448	| radiolab071814 |	Because during the 90s these demonstrations started to happen
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:34,336	| radiolab071814 |	Demonstrations of outrage violent activity
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:35,360	| radiolab071814 |	Constant conflict
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:40,992	| radiolab071814 |	To explain
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:47,392	| radiolab071814 |	Villa peschke this is Agustin Lopez longtime fisherman and he told me that the 70s and 80s
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:51,744	| radiolab071814 |	All year round
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:56,864	| radiolab071814 |	No restrictions and the fisherman started making a killing fishing sea cucumber
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:21:58,912	| radiolab071814 |	Because if there was a huge the man
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:00,960	| radiolab071814 |	But then the national park comes in
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:02,496	| radiolab071814 |	Same group that doing the go to radication
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:09,408	| radiolab071814 |	They sell the fisherman there overfishing the sea cucumber they've got to limit their cats in the fishermen are like who are you to tell me
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:10,432	| radiolab071814 |	That I can't feed my family
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:18,112	| radiolab071814 |	So they lash out the March down Charles Darwin Avenue they would come down there
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:18,624	| radiolab071814 |	Street
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:25,280	| radiolab071814 |	Throwing rocks and sticks and everything in a Shepherd conservation Society
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:29,632	| radiolab071814 |	He was their counter for testing and he says that at one point they went after National Park built
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:36,032	| radiolab071814 |	And they were attacking the ranger stations with Molotov cocktails did Road they literally drove the Rangers out
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:42,432	| radiolab071814 |	National Park headquarters and took it over on Isabella they burn down a building kidnap some people including some of my
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:42,944	| radiolab071814 |	My crew
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:45,760	| radiolab071814 |	And they even killed dozens of tortoises
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:47,808	| radiolab071814 |	Slitting their throats
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:51,136	| radiolab071814 |	According to some accounts maven hung them
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:51,648	| radiolab071814 |	Trees
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:23:00,864	| radiolab071814 |	Not only that but according to Linda those goats couple islands where they've been eliminated Fishman to put them back
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:03,680	| radiolab071814 |	Really
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:04,192	| radiolab071814 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:06,752	| radiolab071814 |	Until what they decided to do is
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:09,568	| radiolab071814 |	Leave the Judas goat on various Islands
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:13,408	| radiolab071814 |	Where they can live out their sterilize days
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:15,456	| radiolab071814 |	Jumping on grass
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:18,016	| radiolab071814 |	Sharing War Stories
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:19,808	| radiolab071814 |	Until such time
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:25,440	| radiolab071814 |	As it might be needed again
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:33,120	| radiolab071814 |	It is the is the war between the greens and the
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:34,400	| radiolab071814 |	The fisherman and such
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:36,192	| radiolab071814 |	Still hot
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:37,216	| radiolab071814 |	Difficult
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:38,240	| radiolab071814 |	Still
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:40,032	| radiolab071814 |	Killing tortoise
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:42,848	| radiolab071814 |	They're not that the fisherman
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:45,152	| radiolab071814 |	They seem to have
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:45,664	| radiolab071814 |	Stop
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:49,760	| radiolab071814 |	You know taking over National Park and then killing tortoises did a y
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:54,112	| radiolab071814 |	It's a combination of reasons on the one hand
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:56,928	| radiolab071814 |	Fishermen have started to participate in the actual
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:24:00,768	| radiolab071814 |	Fisheries management more cuz it seems like they realize
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:02,816	| radiolab071814 |	If they're going to keep their livelihood they cancerous
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:03,584	| radiolab071814 |	Fish everything out
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:07,168	| radiolab071814 |	But then at the same time the tourism economy has been taking off
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:12,288	| radiolab071814 |	And so all of these fishermen they find that it's easier for them to actually survive
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:13,568	| radiolab071814 |	By using their boats
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:18,688	| radiolab071814 |	To take tourists around island island so they're all kind of converting over into the tourism economy
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:20,480	| radiolab071814 |	Going to take a short break
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:22,272	| radiolab071814 |	Radiolab will be back
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:23,808	| radiolab071814 |	Check with Bruce rittenour.
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:25,088	| radiolab071814 |	And this hour on Galapagos
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:26,880	| radiolab071814 |	Hi

EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:48,896	| radiolab071814 |	And this message
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:55,296	| radiolab071814 |	I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:57,088	| radiolab071814 |	And I'm here because I need your help
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:01,696	| radiolab071814 |	And I request
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:05,280	| radiolab071814 |	For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:09,120	| radiolab071814 |	Aunts and uncles teachers about what we're calling
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:10,912	| radiolab071814 |	Tiny moments of brilliance
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:15,520	| radiolab071814 |	Basically I want to hear about those times when I kids you know did something
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:18,592	| radiolab071814 |	It just means you bring back and say whoa
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:21,664	| radiolab071814 |	Maybe it was the moment that I
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:24,736	| radiolab071814 |	I kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:25,248	| radiolab071814 |	To you

EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:55,104	| radiolab071814 |	Called Pinta was a very special place this is James Gibbs
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:58,176	| radiolab071814 |	Professor of conservation biology at the State University of New York
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:27:03,552	| radiolab071814 |	It's a one of those islands it's not part of any tourist visitation site so there are no people there
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:04,576	| radiolab071814 |	And
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:07,136	| radiolab071814 |	When you set foot first on Penta you
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:09,184	| radiolab071814 |	Immediately sense

EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:18,144	| radiolab071814 |	Hubbard
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:24,032	| radiolab071814 |	Problem is on Pinna things were spinning out of control
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:27,104	| radiolab071814 |	Vegetation was growing wild
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:31,200	| radiolab071814 |	The forest was getting overgrown with the wrong kind of plan
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:36,320	| radiolab071814 |	And the whole ecosystem was just teetering out of balance
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:39,136	| radiolab071814 |	And one of the reasons for this
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:42,208	| radiolab071814 |	According to Linda coyote is that we had an island with no tortoise
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:46,304	| radiolab071814 |	Because tortoises are are sore like the lawn mower
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:47,584	| radiolab071814 |	You know they they
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:53,984	| radiolab071814 |	Plow down vegetation disperse seeds but for centuries they've been hunted by those Wailers and in about ninety
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:54,496	| radiolab071814 |	1806
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:56,288	| radiolab071814 |	The Pinta tortoise
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:56,800	| radiolab071814 |	Went
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:28:02,176	| radiolab071814 |	1906 yeah little over a hundred years ago they don't know the exact date
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:03,200	| radiolab071814 |	But then
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:06,528	| radiolab071814 |	One evening in March of 1972
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:19,840	| radiolab071814 |	Santa Cruz Island having dinner with some friends
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:22,912	| radiolab071814 |	Yeah I was recently on Pandora Island collecting snails
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:24,192	| radiolab071814 |	And I saw this
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:28,288	| radiolab071814 |	And I thought do you know what you have done
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:31,104	| radiolab071814 |	Livedo tortoises a hundred years
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:33,920	| radiolab071814 |	He International Park Rangers erase out to Pinta
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:36,224	| radiolab071814 |	And there it was
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:37,760	| radiolab071814 |	This beautiful told us
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:39,296	| radiolab071814 |	One male tortoise
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:41,088	| radiolab071814 |	Maybe 50 years old they weren't sure
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:43,904	| radiolab071814 |	They'd eventually named him
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:44,928	| radiolab071814 |	Lonesome George
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:49,280	| radiolab071814 |	But at the time the immediate question was other anymore because
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:51,328	| radiolab071814 |	If they can find a female for George
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:54,656	| radiolab071814 |	Then they could maybe the extinct
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:55,424	| radiolab071814 |	The species
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:59,008	| radiolab071814 |	Like poke around in the areas where we got the one
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:29:00,032	| radiolab071814 |	And I found
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:01,824	| radiolab071814 |	Michelle
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:02,592	| radiolab071814 |	All the female
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:03,360	| radiolab071814 |	Hey
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:04,128	| radiolab071814 |	Dead animal
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:08,224	| radiolab071814 |	What happened what how had that how had this female tortoise died
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:11,296	| radiolab071814 |	Someone chopped in half
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:14,368	| radiolab071814 |	No it was just
EDL	00:29:16,160	00:29:16,928	| radiolab071814 |	I felt
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:17,696	| radiolab071814 |	Violet
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:20,256	| radiolab071814 |	I want you to borrow someone's gun
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:22,304	| radiolab071814 |	I'm going to chill with us
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:27,168	| radiolab071814 |	Everyone hold out hopes for just finding more tortoises back and says it kept going back
EDL	00:29:27,168	00:29:30,240	| radiolab071814 |	Calming the island sniffing dogs
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:32,288	| radiolab071814 |	But in the end they're just George
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:34,336	| radiolab071814 |	Nothing shifted the focus on now what do we do
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:38,944	| radiolab071814 |	We then went to a wolf volcano
EDL	00:29:38,944	00:29:45,088	| radiolab071814 |	Island next door and collected two females through females that sort of looks like George but weren't quite the same species
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:49,184	| radiolab071814 |	To see if we could get him to breed
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:51,232	| radiolab071814 |	He never did was an intro
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:53,024	| radiolab071814 |	So they thought
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:55,328	| radiolab071814 |	Maybe he needs a pinto
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:30:03,008	| radiolab071814 |	So Cal course there are no female tortoises on Pinto but they thought you know maybe a zoo somewhere Private Collection has one cuz you really never know
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:07,360	| radiolab071814 |	So they called around offered huge cash rewards people sending dozens of tortoises
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:09,408	| radiolab071814 |	But Linda took one look at them and was like
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:10,688	| radiolab071814 |	No no
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:12,480	| radiolab071814 |	No intentes
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:15,808	| radiolab071814 |	So then I thought we've got to take matters
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:16,832	| radiolab071814 |	Indoor on hands
EDL	00:30:17,344	00:30:23,744	| radiolab071814 |	Basically what you do is you sit at the back of the tortoise and first you have to get to where they'll allow you
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:24,768	| radiolab071814 |	You to touch them
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:27,072	| radiolab071814 |	And eventually you start
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:34,496	| radiolab071814 |	You know fondling their their legs and Tails and red
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:36,288	| radiolab071814 |	Hoping to get them to ejaculate
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:40,640	| radiolab071814 |	Plate and petal volunteer working with me her name was favorite grigioni
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:43,712	| radiolab071814 |	She worked with him every other day or so for a few months
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:44,736	| radiolab071814 |	And was never
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:46,528	| radiolab071814 |	We were
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:48,064	| radiolab071814 |	Really starting to get
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:48,832	| radiolab071814 |	Kind of
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:52,672	| radiolab071814 |	Desperate about options in Jane says anyway it was a paradox
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:53,696	| radiolab071814 |	Because on the one hand
EDL	00:30:53,696	00:30:56,256	| radiolab071814 |	Awesome we have an actual living pinta island tortoise
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:30:58,048	| radiolab071814 |	But on the other hand
EDL	00:30:58,048	00:31:01,888	| radiolab071814 |	He might have actually been like the worst possible candidate for last
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:08,288	| radiolab071814 |	It was kind he seemed to really like to keep to himself he never really liked other tortoises much he didn't seem to like you
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:11,104	| radiolab071814 |	Humans and maybe that's why he survived he wasn't curious
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:12,384	| radiolab071814 |	Jane Says
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:18,528	| radiolab071814 |	A lot of tortoises footsteps they raise their heads they come out to see what's going on and then they get whacked
EDL	00:31:18,528	00:31:19,040	| radiolab071814 |	Yeah
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:26,720	| radiolab071814 |	In any case for about 40 years scientists tried everything humanly possible to get Lonesome George to mate with another tortoise today
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:28,256	| radiolab071814 |	Resurrect the species
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:30,816	| radiolab071814 |	And bring Pinta Island back to its original state
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:32,864	| radiolab071814 |	Nothing worth
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:36,960	| radiolab071814 |	Until
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:45,152	| radiolab071814 |	One day in July 2008 George turns to the two female tortoises that he had been ignoring
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:46,176	| radiolab071814 |	The year
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:52,576	| radiolab071814 |	And he said
EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:58,976	| radiolab071814 |	Inexplicably he just suddenly decides to mate with both of them they eat
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:32:05,376	| radiolab071814 |	Play eggs laid in his garage and the scientists are like George guitar hope so
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:10,752	| radiolab071814 |	Dramatically, but they ultimately were infertile
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:14,080	| radiolab071814 |	Mother
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:21,504	| radiolab071814 |	Mid eighties they were having a meeting about this that's conservation is Josh Tomlin against a bunch of herpetologists were out there
EDL	00:32:21,504	00:32:27,904	| radiolab071814 |	There and some Island conservationists and they're talking about what to do Pinta and they can't get Lonesome George
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:34,304	| radiolab071814 |	Reproduce with sugar hoping to do cuz it make a bill to paint the population and put it on Pinterest
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:38,912	| radiolab071814 |	10 so for sure I spoke with
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:39,936	| radiolab071814 |	Biology
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:40,960	| radiolab071814 |	Cornell University
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:45,824	| radiolab071814 |	Said that at this meeting there was one guy who just couldn't take it
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:49,152	| radiolab071814 |	Geese that they're getting more and more and more frustrated
EDL	00:32:49,920	00:32:52,480	| radiolab071814 |	Linda finally just blurted out
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:55,040	| radiolab071814 |	Tortoise
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:57,856	| radiolab071814 |	Quit wasting our time
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:02,720	| radiolab071814 |	Because it hissed you this
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:05,280	| radiolab071814 |	The single individual was holding up
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:08,608	| radiolab071814 |	Is huge conservation opportune intercourse the shock was
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:10,400	| radiolab071814 |	There was a wave went around the room when he said
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:15,008	| radiolab071814 |	I recall seeing service second wave as a Spanish translation
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:15,776	| radiolab071814 |	I passed
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:16,544	| radiolab071814 |	Around the room
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:21,664	| radiolab071814 |	Really what that guy was specifically saying was don't be precious the tortoise is a tortoise is a tortoise
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:23,712	| radiolab071814 |	Let's just take some tortoises
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:25,760	| radiolab071814 |	From a nearby Island I put them back on pint
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:30,112	| radiolab071814 |	But there's a much bigger question here
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:34,208	| radiolab071814 |	Which is basically like what is the right way
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:36,512	| radiolab071814 |	To protect nature now
EDL	00:33:36,512	00:33:37,536	| radiolab071814 |	People are
EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:38,304	| radiolab071814 |	Right now

EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:46,240	| radiolab071814 |	Josh says that they're basically two camps right now
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:49,824	| radiolab071814 |	On the one side you got this classic like what you might call edin
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:51,872	| radiolab071814 |	Conservation biology
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:55,456	| radiolab071814 |	Is foundation is this idea pristine wilderness
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:58,016	| radiolab071814 |	From the very beginning I think all of us
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:34:02,624	| radiolab071814 |	Other people but but you always have this idea of
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:04,160	| radiolab071814 |	Wanting to get it
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:04,672	| radiolab071814 |	Back
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:05,952	| radiolab071814 |	To some kind of
EDL	00:34:06,720	00:34:09,792	| radiolab071814 |	Human Condition real human being the operative word
EDL	00:34:09,792	00:34:12,608	| radiolab071814 |	And if you think about it we all have this we all have this
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:15,424	| radiolab071814 |	This picture of what we want to bring it all back 2
EDL	00:34:15,424	00:34:19,776	| radiolab071814 |	To you know what might be like group Des Plaines just
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:24,640	| radiolab071814 |	Covered with Buffalo or maybe the Serengeti desert
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:30,528	| radiolab071814 |	Lions and elephants are maybe 10,000 hammerhead sharks but whatever the scene is it just doesn't have any pee
EDL	00:34:30,528	00:34:34,112	| radiolab071814 |	What is carrying that idea those pictures your head even like
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:40,256	| radiolab071814 |	Useful anymore it's like so sad but it just seems so unrealistic
EDL	00:34:40,256	00:34:44,096	| radiolab071814 |	Right but I mean at the bigger picture you can make the argument of humans now effect
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:45,632	| radiolab071814 |	Every square meter
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:46,144	| radiolab071814 |	Of the Earth
EDL	00:34:46,656	00:34:49,472	| radiolab071814 |	There's no place no matter how remote would get
EDL	00:34:49,472	00:34:53,824	| radiolab071814 |	You can go to the North Pole it's been affected by human activity
EDL	00:34:53,824	00:34:54,592	| radiolab071814 |	You can go
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:56,128	| radiolab071814 |	I don't know the depth of the
EDL	00:34:56,128	00:34:57,408	| radiolab071814 |	Impenetrable
EDL	00:34:57,408	00:35:03,808	| radiolab071814 |	Jungle it's been affected by human activity that's how they dream is she's an environmental law professor at the Berkeley School of Law in
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:05,856	| radiolab071814 |	In California are radically remaking
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:07,136	| radiolab071814 |	The world
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:08,160	| radiolab071814 |	And the question is
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:10,208	| radiolab071814 |	What are responsibilities
EDL	00:35:10,208	00:35:12,256	| radiolab071814 |	Second school of thought
EDL	00:35:12,256	00:35:14,304	| radiolab071814 |	Which in its most extreme version
EDL	00:35:14,816	00:35:15,584	| radiolab071814 |	Go something like this
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:17,888	| radiolab071814 |	We're God we might as well get good at
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:21,472	| radiolab071814 |	And we're going to have to
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:23,776	| radiolab071814 |	Create the zika
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:26,592	| radiolab071814 |	Based on
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:27,872	| radiolab071814 |	Our best science
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:31,200	| radiolab071814 |	And you could argue we're going to have to get a whole lot better
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:35,040	| radiolab071814 |	At making some very very difficult decision
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:36,576	| radiolab071814 |	Climate change
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:38,112	| radiolab071814 |	Seems to me
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:39,904	| radiolab071814 |	That's a lot of
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:40,928	| radiolab071814 |	Species
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:41,440	| radiolab071814 |	AR
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:43,232	| radiolab071814 |	Pretty much
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:46,304	| radiolab071814 |	30% 40% 50
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:47,584	| radiolab071814 |	2% of the species
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:48,864	| radiolab071814 |	Now on the planet
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:50,912	| radiolab071814 |	Two decades Maybe
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:52,192	| radiolab071814 |	Disappearing
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:54,240	| radiolab071814 |	If this is what I think it's really tough Quest
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:55,520	| radiolab071814 |	Now
EDL	00:35:55,520	00:35:57,056	| radiolab071814 |	If we can see
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:35:58,848	| radiolab071814 |	That we can't
EDL	00:35:58,848	00:35:59,616	| radiolab071814 |	Any longer
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:00,640	| radiolab071814 |	Save all the
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:05,248	| radiolab071814 |	Then does that put us in the situation of having
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:06,016	| radiolab071814 |	To the side
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:06,528	| radiolab071814 |	Which one
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:07,552	| radiolab071814 |	Will save in which
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:09,344	| radiolab071814 |	Won't and do we have any base
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:14,720	| radiolab071814 |	So you saying that that that the
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:17,024	| radiolab071814 |	But let's go back to when it was good
EDL	00:36:17,024	00:36:18,048	| radiolab071814 |	Let's go back to a better time
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:19,840	| radiolab071814 |	That's just
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:21,632	| radiolab071814 |	Silly
EDL	00:36:22,144	00:36:23,168	| radiolab071814 |	I didn't say it was silly
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:25,216	| radiolab071814 |	Impossible
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:30,592	| radiolab071814 |	This might not be silly they might not be stupid idea
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:31,872	| radiolab071814 |	But we still might not be
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:32,384	| radiolab071814 |	Do them
EDL	00:36:33,920	00:36:35,712	| radiolab071814 |	Okay so here's a
EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:36,480	| radiolab071814 |	Applewood
EDL	00:36:37,760	00:36:38,272	| radiolab071814 |	Plaque
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:40,576	| radiolab071814 |	It says
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:44,160	| radiolab071814 |	Lonesome George is the last survivor of the dynasty of land tortoises
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:46,720	| radiolab071814 |	And in fact
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:51,328	| radiolab071814 |	In 2012 after Decades of trying to get him to
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:51,840	| radiolab071814 |	Debride
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:54,912	| radiolab071814 |	Lonesome George
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:55,424	| radiolab071814 |	Dies
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:57,472	| radiolab071814 |	Rip
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:36:59,776	| radiolab071814 |	24th of June 2012
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:02,848	| radiolab071814 |	And the Pinta tortoise went extinct
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:05,664	| radiolab071814 |	Sedam case-in-point I guess
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:06,688	| radiolab071814 |	No Going Back
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:08,224	| radiolab071814 |	Yeah I know that's what I thought
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:11,296	| radiolab071814 |	But then I spoke with this woman
EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:13,856	| radiolab071814 |	Hello just how did you hear me
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:15,904	| radiolab071814 |	Who kind of scrambled everything up for me
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:18,720	| radiolab071814 |	Can I get you to introduce yourself
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:19,488	| radiolab071814 |	Yes
EDL	00:37:19,488	00:37:21,536	| radiolab071814 |	My name is Giselle Acuna
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:23,328	| radiolab071814 |	I am a senior research scientist
EDL	00:37:23,328	00:37:26,912	| radiolab071814 |	Rul University come up with kind of a radical idea
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:28,192	| radiolab071814 |	I call it the Phoenix
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:34,592	| radiolab071814 |	Here's the backstory in the mid-90s we started in 94 to sell and some books from their Club
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:38,944	| radiolab071814 |	National Park they began taking a census of all the tortoises in the
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:45,344	| radiolab071814 |	I have a population of tortoises on all the islands are going to do this big population study so they went Island by Island took a little
EDL	00:37:45,344	00:37:46,624	| radiolab071814 |	A bit of blood from all these different tortoise
EDL	00:37:47,136	00:37:49,440	| radiolab071814 |	Is genetic analysis and apply
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:52,000	| radiolab071814 |	Found something they never expect
EDL	00:37:52,768	00:37:54,304	| radiolab071814 |	A group of tortoises
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:55,328	| radiolab071814 |	Not on Pinterest
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:37:56,608	| radiolab071814 |	That had
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:38:00,704	| radiolab071814 |	A lot of pain to DNA remember very clearly.
EDL	00:38:00,704	00:38:07,104	| radiolab071814 |	Somebody already exciting it's like yes look at this
EDL	00:38:07,104	00:38:08,384	| radiolab071814 |	I was on another
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:10,688	| radiolab071814 |	I was at a
EDL	00:38:11,200	00:38:15,296	| radiolab071814 |	We don't think it was natural to sell it thinks it might have been The Wailers
EDL	00:38:15,808	00:38:22,208	| radiolab071814 |	Neither The Wailers or the Pirates talked about in the 1780s
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:24,512	| radiolab071814 |	Whalers become along grab a bunch of tortoises
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:26,816	| radiolab071814 |	Put them on the ship and then they would hunt for whales
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:31,424	| radiolab071814 |	Sometimes when they were done in this
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:32,192	| radiolab071814 |	The sherpas
EDL	00:38:32,192	00:38:35,520	| radiolab071814 |	Filled with oil products
EDL	00:38:35,520	00:38:41,920	| radiolab071814 |	They throw a few extra tortoises overboard say a few from pizza maybe those
EDL	00:38:41,920	00:38:46,784	| radiolab071814 |	Tortoises swim with occurrence to that nearby Island set up a little expat community
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:49,600	| radiolab071814 |	Started breeding with the local
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:51,392	| radiolab071814 |	That's our working hypothesis
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:53,696	| radiolab071814 |	Which brings us to
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:54,976	| radiolab071814 |	Her idea
EDL	00:38:57,536	00:39:03,680	| radiolab071814 |	Do you know on average 50% of your genome comes from your mom and 50% from your dad but
EDL	00:39:03,680	00:39:04,448	| radiolab071814 |	It's an average
EDL	00:39:04,448	00:39:05,728	| radiolab071814 |	So just tell it.
EDL	00:39:05,728	00:39:11,104	| radiolab071814 |	Just by chance some of these tortoises are going to have a little bit more Pinta DNA from their Pinta ancestors
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:12,128	| radiolab071814 |	And others yes
EDL	00:39:13,152	00:39:14,176	| radiolab071814 |	Those tortoises
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:20,320	| radiolab071814 |	And read them together collect them for the Next Generation so you can give a push
EDL	00:39:20,320	00:39:26,464	| radiolab071814 |	Crosses she says if we keep doing that taking the babies with the most Pinta DNA breeding them together
EDL	00:39:27,744	00:39:33,888	| radiolab071814 |	Shirley in for Generations you can have 90% of the painter Gino restored
EDL	00:39:34,400	00:39:35,936	| radiolab071814 |	Yeah but that's
EDL	00:39:35,936	00:39:37,216	| radiolab071814 |	Four generations of
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:40,288	| radiolab071814 |	Which means at least a hundred years
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:40,800	| radiolab071814 |	But
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:47,968	| radiolab071814 |	In the meantime the vegetation on Pinta is growing out of control
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:51,040	| radiolab071814 |	So in 2009 they come up with
EDL	00:39:51,040	00:39:51,552	| radiolab071814 |	Stop Gap
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:56,928	| radiolab071814 |	You take 39 tortoises raised in captivity and they use them as placeholders
EDL	00:39:56,928	00:39:58,208	| radiolab071814 |	They sterilize them
EDL	00:39:58,720	00:39:59,744	| radiolab071814 |	In Pokemon Pinsir
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:03,072	| radiolab071814 |	Yeah but these are very
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:08,704	| radiolab071814 |	Purest Serta Vision Bugatti the lawn mowers
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:10,752	| radiolab071814 |	They're not exactly they put them on Pinterest
EDL	00:40:10,752	00:40:11,520	| radiolab071814 |	And they are just
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:16,128	| radiolab071814 |	Chomping away right now they're living out their lives really happily on Pinta
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:18,688	| radiolab071814 |	You know until the originals are ready
EDL	00:40:21,248	00:40:26,112	| radiolab071814 |	Now Linda says in the end you don't actually need to do the full aggressive for Generation breeding thing
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:28,416	| radiolab071814 |	You can just take the best Pinterest
EDL	00:40:28,416	00:40:29,696	| radiolab071814 |	Tortoises you fine
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:32,000	| radiolab071814 |	And put those on Pinto
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:32,768	| radiolab071814 |	And
EDL	00:40:32,768	00:40:34,048	| radiolab071814 |	You know over the next
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:35,840	| radiolab071814 |	200000 years
EDL	00:40:38,144	00:40:44,544	| radiolab071814 |	They will evolve into a pinta tortoise setup could be a bit different than the past Pinta tortoise because evolution of Mewtwo
EDL	00:40:44,544	00:40:45,312	| radiolab071814 |	Vacation and all that
EDL	00:40:45,824	00:40:47,104	| radiolab071814 |	Doesn't occur the same
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:51,200	| radiolab071814 |	But eventually
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:53,504	| radiolab071814 |	Nature's going to take over

EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:51,423	| radiolab071814 |	We were going to look at these incredible craters called Louis and Melo

EDL	00:43:58,079	00:44:01,407	| radiolab071814 |	Right here she points just the right of the path
EDL	00:44:01,407	00:44:02,175	| radiolab071814 |	Look at this
EDL	00:44:02,175	00:44:02,943	| radiolab071814 |	Species here
EDL	00:44:03,455	00:44:07,295	| radiolab071814 |	Small leafy green thing they call that young 10 in Spanish it is

EDL	00:44:27,775	00:44:29,567	| radiolab071814 |	Shouldn't be here and you have this one

EDL	00:44:30,591	00:44:31,359	| radiolab071814 |	Pointright next

EDL	00:44:43,135	00:44:46,975	| radiolab071814 |	But there it is in the Galapagos along this path
EDL	00:44:46,975	00:44:49,023	| radiolab071814 |	Just looking to the right and the left
EDL	00:44:49,023	00:44:49,791	| radiolab071814 |	And then
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:51,327	| radiolab071814 |	She just start counting the number of envy
EDL	00:44:51,839	00:44:56,191	| radiolab071814 |	Species at 1 to 3 as you can see here it's only right next
EDL	00:44:56,191	00:44:56,959	| radiolab071814 |	Set the trial
EDL	00:44:56,959	00:45:02,079	| radiolab071814 |	But not so much for then you'll see that they're only there for this border of about 5

EDL	00:45:04,127	00:45:06,175	| radiolab071814 |	Why are you happy because
EDL	00:45:06,175	00:45:07,455	| radiolab071814 |	Like I said what happens is it

EDL	00:45:08,735	00:45:11,807	| radiolab071814 |	They'll be back in their home country they'll be walking around in
EDL	00:45:11,807	00:45:15,903	| radiolab071814 |	Garden or park and it'll be filled with tiny seeds the seeds stick to
EDL	00:45:16,415	00:45:18,207	| radiolab071814 |	Tissues and suck sense
EDL	00:45:18,207	00:45:24,607	| radiolab071814 |	Trousers they wear the trousers on the plane and then they wear them when they come here and then people walk and then just
EDL	00:45:24,607	00:45:25,375	| radiolab071814 |	Distribute
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:27,423	| radiolab071814 |	Who dispersed the seeds along the trail
EDL	00:45:28,703	00:45:31,519	| radiolab071814 |	Panama City's plants are actually probably harmless
EDL	00:45:31,519	00:45:32,799	| radiolab071814 |	And you know like you said
EDL	00:45:32,799	00:45:34,079	| radiolab071814 |	Blockers National Park
EDL	00:45:34,079	00:45:37,919	| radiolab071814 |	They spend tons of money tons of time trying to keep invasive out
EDL	00:45:38,431	00:45:40,991	| radiolab071814 |	But fact is there's only so much you can do
EDL	00:45:40,991	00:45:42,783	| radiolab071814 |	And every once in awhile
EDL	00:45:42,783	00:45:43,807	| radiolab071814 |	One of these hitchhikers
EDL	00:45:44,319	00:45:45,599	| radiolab071814 |	Slips under the radar
EDL	00:45:46,367	00:45:47,135	| radiolab071814 |	And just reeks
EDL	00:45:47,135	00:45:47,903	| radiolab071814 |	Havoc
EDL	00:45:53,791	00:45:56,607	| radiolab071814 |	You just grabbed it just like that you just put your hands around
EDL	00:45:57,631	00:45:59,679	| radiolab071814 |	But that's the only possible the first day
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:04,031	| radiolab071814 |	So while we were in the highlands of Santa Cruz Frankie took me through the woods
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:10,431	| radiolab071814 |	To meet this guy named Arnold my name is Arnold from the University of Vienna and shortly after
EDL	00:46:10,431	00:46:11,199	| radiolab071814 |	We walked up
EDL	00:46:11,199	00:46:13,759	| radiolab071814 |	He reach out into this tree and he grabbed the
EDL	00:46:13,759	00:46:16,319	| radiolab071814 |	Tiny little baby Finch right off the branch
EDL	00:46:17,599	00:46:18,879	| radiolab071814 |	He's adorable he's there
EDL	00:46:19,391	00:46:21,951	| radiolab071814 |	Oh my God he said he he looks a little bit
EDL	00:46:21,951	00:46:28,351	| radiolab071814 |	Furry almost really tiny vulnerable Fletchling of a warbler Finch
EDL	00:46:28,351	00:46:29,375	| radiolab071814 |	The Darwin finches

EDL	00:46:34,751	00:46:35,519	| radiolab071814 |	Ensure
EDL	00:46:35,519	00:46:37,567	| radiolab071814 |	Darwin when he visited Galapagos
EDL	00:46:37,567	00:46:40,127	| radiolab071814 |	He collected a lot of specimens of finches
EDL	00:46:40,639	00:46:41,663	| radiolab071814 |	Took them back to England
EDL	00:46:42,431	00:46:44,479	| radiolab071814 |	And eventually he realized that
EDL	00:46:44,479	00:46:50,111	| radiolab071814 |	The beaks had all adapted they were all little bit different depending on which island to finches lived
EDL	00:46:50,111	00:46:50,879	| radiolab071814 |	With a B
EDL	00:46:50,879	00:46:53,439	| radiolab071814 |	A bit adapter to what whatever the food they were eating
EDL	00:46:53,439	00:46:54,463	| radiolab071814 |	1 Islands
EDL	00:46:54,463	00:46:58,559	| radiolab071814 |	Finches had literally like the beak would be shape sort of a long
EDL	00:46:58,559	00:47:01,887	| radiolab071814 |	And then the next Island it would look almost the same but much shorter
EDL	00:47:02,655	00:47:03,935	| radiolab071814 |	I just became one of the
EDL	00:47:04,447	00:47:06,751	| radiolab071814 |	One of the most important pieces of evidence that
EDL	00:47:06,751	00:47:08,031	| radiolab071814 |	You know when
EDL	00:47:08,031	00:47:14,175	| radiolab071814 |	Animals would move from one place to another they would begin to differentiate based on what
EDL	00:47:15,455	00:47:17,503	| radiolab071814 |	But speaking of beak
EDL	00:47:17,503	00:47:19,551	| radiolab071814 |	That Finch that Arnold was holding

EDL	00:49:22,943	00:49:23,455	| radiolab071814 |	And
EDL	00:49:23,967	00:49:30,367	| radiolab071814 |	What happens is that as soon as I start laying eggs
EDL	00:49:30,367	00:49:31,135	| radiolab071814 |	On the basis
EDL	00:49:31,135	00:49:31,903	| radiolab071814 |	Set the nest
EDL	00:49:31,903	00:49:33,183	| radiolab071814 |	Sort of underneath the finch a
EDL	00:49:33,695	00:49:34,975	| radiolab071814 |	Once the eggs hatch
EDL	00:49:37,535	00:49:38,559	| radiolab071814 |	The eggs hatch
EDL	00:49:38,559	00:49:40,351	| radiolab071814 |	Applies as well in the lobby
EDL	00:49:40,351	00:49:43,423	| radiolab071814 |	Wriggling little larvae will crawl out in the bottom of the nest

EDL	00:49:53,919	00:49:55,711	| radiolab071814 |	You know they're basically
EDL	00:49:55,711	00:49:57,759	| radiolab071814 |	Feed on the blood of that the baby bed
EDL	00:49:58,271	00:49:59,039	| radiolab071814 |	How did these

EDL	00:49:59,807	00:50:01,087	| radiolab071814 |	For my babies
EDL	00:50:01,087	00:50:04,927	| radiolab071814 |	No that's a that's a very specific trip today
EDL	00:50:04,927	00:50:06,463	| radiolab071814 |	Question
EDL	00:50:06,463	00:50:08,511	| radiolab071814 |	We're still trying to figure that out
EDL	00:50:08,511	00:50:12,095	| radiolab071814 |	I'm going to assume that it was carbon dioxide carbon dioxide
EDL	00:50:12,607	00:50:13,375	| radiolab071814 |	From the breathing
EDL	00:50:15,167	00:50:15,679	| radiolab071814 |	Yeah
EDL	00:50:18,239	00:50:22,335	| radiolab071814 |	Box of some of the birds that
EDL	00:50:22,335	00:50:24,383	| radiolab071814 |	Little bean sonus
EDL	00:50:24,383	00:50:25,151	| radiolab071814 |	Licentious
EDL	00:50:25,919	00:50:27,711	| radiolab071814 |	Oh God
EDL	00:50:27,711	00:50:28,991	| radiolab071814 |	It's annoying normal
EDL	00:50:29,759	00:50:30,527	| radiolab071814 |	PA.
EDL	00:50:30,527	00:50:31,039	| radiolab071814 |	Showed me
EDL	00:50:31,551	00:50:32,831	| radiolab071814 |	This tiny little dead Finch
EDL	00:50:37,183	00:50:40,511	| radiolab071814 |	Why there's a little hole into the brain of this little Finch
EDL	00:50:41,023	00:50:42,303	| radiolab071814 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:50:42,303	00:50:44,607	| radiolab071814 |	Waco and Ariel Espinoza
EDL	00:50:45,119	00:50:47,167	| radiolab071814 |	They ate the whole bag of this little Finch
EDL	00:50:48,447	00:50:49,727	| radiolab071814 |	How big a problem is it
EDL	00:50:50,495	00:50:56,895	| radiolab071814 |	Well I talked to one scientist Sonia kleindorfer I'm professor in animal behavior at Flinders University
EDL	00:50:56,895	00:51:00,479	| radiolab071814 |	Australian researchers recently did a survey of Finch nests
EDL	00:51:00,479	00:51:03,551	| radiolab071814 |	Four different species on two islands
EDL	00:51:03,551	00:51:06,623	| radiolab071814 |	And all research groups found about 95
EDL	00:51:06,623	00:51:07,903	| radiolab071814 |	Percent mortality in the nest
EDL	00:51:10,207	00:51:12,255	| radiolab071814 |	95% of the babies were dead
EDL	00:51:12,767	00:51:13,279	| radiolab071814 |	Yeah
EDL	00:51:14,047	00:51:19,423	| radiolab071814 |	And Arnold told me that this year small tree finches so far we have only two nest with fledglings
EDL	00:51:19,423	00:51:20,703	| radiolab071814 |	And all the others with it
EDL	00:51:21,727	00:51:22,239	| radiolab071814 |	Switzerland
EDL	00:51:24,031	00:51:28,127	| radiolab071814 |	But even worse so far we found following us on 13 Islands
EDL	00:51:28,639	00:51:29,663	| radiolab071814 |	The Flies spreading
EDL	00:51:30,175	00:51:31,199	| radiolab071814 |	Island to Island
EDL	00:51:31,199	00:51:35,039	| radiolab071814 |	Is there any primeskill obituary by like are these finches disappearing
EDL	00:51:35,039	00:51:36,063	| radiolab071814 |	Very fat
EDL	00:51:36,063	00:51:37,343	| radiolab071814 |	Very slowly
EDL	00:51:37,343	00:51:38,367	| radiolab071814 |	Depends on the species
EDL	00:51:38,367	00:51:39,135	| radiolab071814 |	We have at least
EDL	00:51:39,647	00:51:42,719	| radiolab071814 |	5 species that are known to be facing extinction
EDL	00:51:42,719	00:51:43,487	| radiolab071814 |	And another six
EDL	00:51:43,999	00:51:45,023	| radiolab071814 |	In serious decline
EDL	00:51:46,047	00:51:47,839	| radiolab071814 |	These five species
EDL	00:51:47,839	00:51:50,143	| radiolab071814 |	Does that mean that they
EDL	00:51:50,143	00:51:51,935	| radiolab071814 |	May go extinct in the next
EDL	00:51:51,935	00:51:53,727	| radiolab071814 |	5 years in the next
EDL	00:51:53,727	00:51:54,751	| radiolab071814 |	50 years
EDL	00:51:55,519	00:51:57,567	| radiolab071814 |	I hope Knoxville
EDL	00:51:58,335	00:52:01,407	| radiolab071814 |	You know we have the case of the mangrove Finch we have C
EDL	00:52:01,407	00:52:02,943	| radiolab071814 |	6280 individuals left
EDL	00:52:04,223	00:52:06,015	| radiolab071814 |	Wow it's a Race Against Time
EDL	00:52:09,855	00:52:10,623	| radiolab071814 |	So
EDL	00:52:10,623	00:52:11,647	| radiolab071814 |	For starters
EDL	00:52:11,647	00:52:18,047	| radiolab071814 |	They put up all these Travis took me aside to show me where the traps are hanging from a tree here
EDL	00:52:18,047	00:52:21,375	| radiolab071814 |	You see them actually Oliver Santa Cruz is bright yellow trapped
EDL	00:52:21,375	00:52:23,423	| radiolab071814 |	Una mosca
EDL	00:52:24,447	00:52:27,519	| radiolab071814 |	And this is to control the fly population
EDL	00:52:27,519	00:52:30,079	| radiolab071814 |	Millions of drops every few feet to do that business just
EDL	00:52:30,079	00:52:33,151	| radiolab071814 |	Grab a few flies take them back to the lab and study him
EDL	00:52:33,663	00:52:34,687	| radiolab071814 |	So they can learn how to fight him
EDL	00:52:35,711	00:52:39,551	| radiolab071814 |	Charlotte and beer. Fantasy is at the Flies use a fireman
EDL	00:52:39,551	00:52:40,063	| radiolab071814 |	To attract
EDL	00:52:40,831	00:52:42,367	| radiolab071814 |	Syria
EDL	00:52:42,367	00:52:44,159	| radiolab071814 |	Fantastical
EDL	00:52:44,159	00:52:45,951	| radiolab071814 |	Lovely if we could find something like that
EDL	00:52:45,951	00:52:47,743	| radiolab071814 |	Cuz if they could find that chemical
EDL	00:52:47,743	00:52:51,583	| radiolab071814 |	That love chemical that the Flies use to attract each other they could disrupt it
EDL	00:52:51,583	00:52:54,399	| radiolab071814 |	Confuse the Flies and screw up their mating
EDL	00:52:54,399	00:52:55,679	| radiolab071814 |	Another
EDL	00:52:55,679	00:52:56,959	| radiolab071814 |	Possibility is
EDL	00:52:56,959	00:52:58,239	| radiolab071814 |	Sternum inside
EDL	00:52:58,239	00:53:01,823	| radiolab071814 |	Sterilized male flies and introduce them back into the wild
EDL	00:53:01,823	00:53:03,103	| radiolab071814 |	Set the female
EDL	00:53:03,103	00:53:05,407	| radiolab071814 |	A mates with a stare-off lion obviously
EDL	00:53:05,919	00:53:12,319	| radiolab071814 |	Doesn't produce fertile eggs if they can't make babies a population will crash and in some cases you can
EDL	00:53:12,319	00:53:17,183	| radiolab071814 |	Successfully eradicated species this is very much like the mosquitoes
EDL	00:53:17,183	00:53:17,951	| radiolab071814 |	Apple podcast
EDL	00:53:17,951	00:53:22,559	| radiolab071814 |	Ray but here's the problem
EDL	00:53:22,559	00:53:28,191	| radiolab071814 |	It's a going to release their livemail 5 into the wild they have to be able to raise
EDL	00:53:28,191	00:53:30,751	| radiolab071814 |	Inclusive a million a billion

EDL	00:53:33,055	00:53:34,847	| radiolab071814 |	Guinness your idea
EDL	00:53:34,847	00:53:38,175	| radiolab071814 |	Trying like crazy showing me all of the alarms that
EDL	00:53:38,175	00:53:41,759	| radiolab071814 |	Hats today and he talks with me for baby flies it had just hatched
EDL	00:53:41,759	00:53:45,087	| radiolab071814 |	Chinese little cup
EDL	00:53:45,855	00:53:48,159	| radiolab071814 |	But she told me that these for flies
EDL	00:53:48,159	00:53:54,559	| radiolab071814 |	Will probably die because they always die right now we have
EDL	00:53:54,559	00:53:58,143	| radiolab071814 |	Huge problems trying to refine Wellness in captivity which is ironic
EDL	00:53:58,143	00:53:59,167	| radiolab071814 |	Given
EDL	00:53:59,167	00:54:01,983	| radiolab071814 |	You know how abundant disease in the wild
EDL	00:54:01,983	00:54:04,543	| radiolab071814 |	Philadelphia tourism video
EDL	00:54:04,543	00:54:05,823	| radiolab071814 |	When I was there
EDL	00:54:05,823	00:54:11,199	| radiolab071814 |	Piedad told me that so far they're only successfully raised three three. Flies
EDL	00:54:12,479	00:54:14,015	| radiolab071814 |	When you're singing in millions
EDL	00:54:14,015	00:54:14,527	| radiolab071814 |	Yeah
EDL	00:54:15,551	00:54:18,623	| radiolab071814 |	And meanwhile the finch populations are just getting decimated
EDL	00:54:19,135	00:54:20,415	| radiolab071814 |	Charlotte says it there
EDL	00:54:20,415	00:54:21,695	| radiolab071814 |	Trying to respond
EDL	00:54:21,695	00:54:23,999	| radiolab071814 |	Ornithologist have started to notice some new Behavior
EDL	00:54:25,279	00:54:26,815	| radiolab071814 |	Reference in setup
EDL	00:54:26,815	00:54:33,215	| radiolab071814 |	Taking the Lafayette to the nostrils of of the baby beds and what we're starting to see if they're beginning to consume them
EDL	00:54:33,215	00:54:34,239	| radiolab071814 |	You need to fly larvae
EDL	00:54:34,239	00:54:39,871	| radiolab071814 |	Yeah which 15 years ago they would never do
EDL	00:54:39,871	00:54:42,431	| radiolab071814 |	Tried feeding the finches some fly larvae
EDL	00:54:42,431	00:54:46,015	| radiolab071814 |	If ever there were a look of disgust on a finch face that was it
EDL	00:54:46,015	00:54:49,087	| radiolab071814 |	I think there's been a change there also seemed baby finches
EDL	00:54:49,599	00:54:51,647	| radiolab071814 |	Climbing up over each other
EDL	00:54:51,647	00:54:58,047	| radiolab071814 |	Just struggling to get away from the larvae on the bottom of the nest I mean they'll even start standing on the nest room just to avoid being
EDL	00:54:58,047	00:55:01,631	| radiolab071814 |	But when I asked Charlotte what she makes of all of these changes
EDL	00:55:02,399	00:55:03,167	| radiolab071814 |	She said
EDL	00:55:03,167	00:55:05,983	| radiolab071814 |	I think probably too little too late
EDL	00:55:12,895	00:55:15,199	| radiolab071814 |	But then someone told me something
EDL	00:55:15,199	00:55:19,807	| radiolab071814 |	Really surprising very unexpected discovery
EDL	00:55:19,807	00:55:21,087	| radiolab071814 |	Takes a couple steps to get there
EDL	00:55:21,087	00:55:25,695	| radiolab071814 |	Justice ended up back in 2000 she was on floreana island for the first time
EDL	00:55:25,695	00:55:28,255	| radiolab071814 |	I started studying Darwin's finches
EDL	00:55:28,255	00:55:29,279	| radiolab071814 |	In particular
EDL	00:55:29,279	00:55:30,815	| radiolab071814 |	Three tree Finch species
EDL	00:55:30,815	00:55:36,959	| radiolab071814 |	He's too small to medium in the large and we went out and we we set up our Miss Nets and we caught the birds and we measured
EDL	00:55:38,751	00:55:40,543	| radiolab071814 |	Even though these are our three different
EDL	00:55:40,543	00:55:41,311	| radiolab071814 |	Species
EDL	00:55:41,311	00:55:43,359	| radiolab071814 |	They're actually really hard to tell apart
EDL	00:55:43,359	00:55:43,871	| radiolab071814 |	Visually
EDL	00:55:44,383	00:55:47,455	| radiolab071814 |	So she would end up relying on their songs their mating call
EDL	00:55:47,967	00:55:53,343	| radiolab071814 |	Skip do you remember the song types could you whistle them for me yes it's very simple song
EDL	00:55:53,343	00:55:55,391	| radiolab071814 |	The small tree Finch goes something like
EDL	00:55:55,391	00:55:57,951	| radiolab071814 |	2 2 2 2 2 2 2
EDL	00:55:58,463	00:56:00,511	| radiolab071814 |	That's a small tree Finch
EDL	00:56:02,047	00:56:04,095	| radiolab071814 |	The medium tree finches just a bit
EDL	00:56:04,095	00:56:07,167	| radiolab071814 |	Slower for the meeting
EDL	00:56:08,959	00:56:09,471	| radiolab071814 |	For the Lord
EDL	00:56:12,799	00:56:13,567	| radiolab071814 |	Teeth
EDL	00:56:13,567	00:56:19,967	| radiolab071814 |	Wow it's like a soprano saxophone and Alto and tenor or something like that
EDL	00:56:19,967	00:56:26,367	| radiolab071814 |	So we we just meet us at the 4 somewhere and we would always quiz each other what's that what's that we all agreed because the calls are really
EDL	00:56:26,367	00:56:27,135	| radiolab071814 |	Distinct
EDL	00:56:27,135	00:56:28,415	| radiolab071814 |	Easy to tell apart but
EDL	00:56:28,415	00:56:34,559	| radiolab071814 |	The interesting thing was from year to year it got more difficult each time to go into the field
EDL	00:56:34,559	00:56:38,399	| radiolab071814 |	The song sounded like they were starting to blur together
EDL	00:56:44,031	00:56:49,663	| radiolab071814 |	Then when I showed up after a few years again I was truly even more perplexed
EDL	00:56:49,663	00:56:52,223	| radiolab071814 |	Should I gather why can't I tell these finches apart
EDL	00:56:52,223	00:56:58,623	| radiolab071814 |	It was very confusing am I losing my touch but that shouldn't really happened you should actually get better
EDL	00:56:58,623	00:57:03,487	| radiolab071814 |	With experience. Worse and that's where I thought all something's changed in the system
EDL	00:57:05,791	00:57:11,167	| radiolab071814 |	I'd like to think of it as a kind of Darwin Finch you know sluicing Adventure
EDL	00:57:11,167	00:57:13,983	| radiolab071814 |	So when your team rounded up some of the Birds attack
EDL	00:57:13,983	00:57:16,031	| radiolab071814 |	We collected genetic samples
EDL	00:57:16,031	00:57:22,175	| radiolab071814 |	Got some DNA brought all the stuff into the lab
EDL	00:57:24,223	00:57:26,015	| radiolab071814 |	Terrible realization
EDL	00:57:26,783	00:57:29,087	| radiolab071814 |	That the large tree Finch is now extinct
EDL	00:57:31,135	00:57:32,159	| radiolab071814 |	Totally gone from guilin
EDL	00:57:33,439	00:57:35,487	| radiolab071814 |	So you really only had two species
EDL	00:57:35,487	00:57:37,279	| radiolab071814 |	Small tree finches and the medium
EDL	00:57:38,047	00:57:40,607	| radiolab071814 |	And based on that genetic data
EDL	00:57:40,607	00:57:41,375	| radiolab071814 |	The
EDL	00:57:41,375	00:57:42,655	| radiolab071814 |	Small tree finches
EDL	00:57:43,167	00:57:49,567	| radiolab071814 |	Not doing great but compared to the medium tree finches they are because of me and proof inches were on
EDL	00:57:49,567	00:57:50,591	| radiolab071814 |	On the brink of Extinction
EDL	00:57:51,871	00:57:52,639	| radiolab071814 |	Like a large
EDL	00:57:53,919	00:57:55,455	| radiolab071814 |	But then she sees something
EDL	00:57:55,967	00:57:56,991	| radiolab071814 |	Amazing
EDL	00:57:58,527	00:58:00,319	| radiolab071814 |	She's a small group of birds
EDL	00:58:00,831	00:58:02,623	| radiolab071814 |	Who have mixed up jeans
EDL	00:58:02,623	00:58:03,647	| radiolab071814 |	Hybrid cluster
EDL	00:58:04,159	00:58:07,487	| radiolab071814 |	Some jeans from the small tree finches and some from The Medium tree
EDL	00:58:08,511	00:58:11,327	| radiolab071814 |	What is that mean what it means that these two
EDL	00:58:11,327	00:58:17,727	| radiolab071814 |	Different finches had started having babies together which should never actually happen because these are totally separate species
EDL	00:58:17,727	00:58:23,359	| radiolab071814 |	That's really the classical definition of a species is like a biological rule
EDL	00:58:23,359	00:58:25,407	| radiolab071814 |	About who you're not going to make a baby with
EDL	00:58:25,407	00:58:28,735	| radiolab071814 |	So they they choose not to breed even if I could
EDL	00:58:32,319	00:58:35,391	| radiolab071814 |	Troll that boundary I've got my thing over here
EDL	00:58:35,391	00:58:36,927	| radiolab071814 |	You got your thing over there
EDL	00:58:36,927	00:58:38,975	| radiolab071814 |	But then Along come the Flies
EDL	00:58:38,975	00:58:42,047	| radiolab071814 |	And all the sudden like over maybe 20 years
EDL	00:58:42,047	00:58:44,607	| radiolab071814 |	The medium tree finches they start to
EDL	00:58:45,119	00:58:48,703	| radiolab071814 |	Break their own biggest Rule and they start to mate
EDL	00:58:49,471	00:58:50,751	| radiolab071814 |	Outside of their own kind
EDL	00:58:52,031	00:58:53,823	| radiolab071814 |	Annie's hybrid finches are they doing
EDL	00:58:53,823	00:58:58,175	| radiolab071814 |	Better against flies well there's there's a couple Cruise it's a maybe
EDL	00:58:58,175	00:59:00,735	| radiolab071814 |	Yeah for example when you look in the neck
EDL	00:59:00,735	00:59:02,271	| radiolab071814 |	They seem to have
EDL	00:59:02,271	00:59:03,295	| radiolab071814 |	Pure parasite
EDL	00:59:03,295	00:59:07,647	| radiolab071814 |	And they seem to have more babies that survive 15%
EDL	00:59:07,647	00:59:13,279	| radiolab071814 |	Wow where is the numbers were very small for the medium tree Finch and smaller for the small tree Finch
EDL	00:59:13,279	00:59:15,839	| radiolab071814 |	Wow I daresay that sounds kind of hopeful
EDL	00:59:16,607	00:59:17,375	| radiolab071814 |	It does
EDL	00:59:17,375	00:59:18,655	| radiolab071814 |	Yeah no
EDL	00:59:18,655	00:59:20,703	| radiolab071814 |	The jury is still very much out on what will have
EDL	00:59:21,471	00:59:23,775	| radiolab071814 |	But if the hybrids do you have
EDL	00:59:23,775	00:59:25,567	| radiolab071814 |	Disadvantage and if they survive
EDL	00:59:26,079	00:59:27,871	| radiolab071814 |	We may be witnessing in hyperspeed
EDL	00:59:28,639	00:59:30,687	| radiolab071814 |	The creation of an entirely new
EDL	00:59:30,687	00:59:31,711	| radiolab071814 |	Species
EDL	00:59:32,223	00:59:33,247	| radiolab071814 |	Possibly be
EDL	00:59:33,759	00:59:35,807	| radiolab071814 |	One of the first vertebrates
EDL	00:59:35,807	00:59:39,135	| radiolab071814 |	Examples of speciation in real time
EDL	00:59:40,671	00:59:41,695	| radiolab071814 |	That we can observe
EDL	00:59:46,559	00:59:47,327	| radiolab071814 |	So
EDL	00:59:47,327	00:59:49,119	| radiolab071814 |	Talking to the story of these finches
EDL	00:59:50,911	00:59:52,703	| radiolab071814 |	Is the story of Galapagos
EDL	00:59:55,775	01:00:00,895	| radiolab071814 |	Same exact story The Darwin saw these processes that he described
EDL	01:00:01,919	01:00:03,199	| radiolab071814 |	They just never
EDL	01:00:03,199	01:00:03,967	| radiolab071814 |	Ever stop
EDL	01:00:05,503	01:00:06,271	| radiolab071814 |	It's this
EDL	01:00:07,039	01:00:07,551	| radiolab071814 |	Unpause
EDL	01:00:08,575	01:00:09,087	| radiolab071814 |	Ending
EDL	01:00:09,599	01:00:15,743	| radiolab071814 |	Struggle
EDL	01:01:02,847	01:01:07,967	| radiolab071814 |	Wellness my last night there
EDL	01:01:07,967	01:01:13,343	| radiolab071814 |	I went to meet up with that guy Leonidas was running for mayor I met him at this pizza place
EDL	01:01:13,343	01:01:19,231	| radiolab071814 |	Election that happened the night before and did he win no Bocelli the incumbent one
EDL	01:01:19,743	01:01:25,375	| radiolab071814 |	So we go outside
EDL	01:01:25,375	01:01:26,655	| radiolab071814 |	Turns out he speaks in English
EDL	01:01:26,655	01:01:31,263	| radiolab071814 |	So we can we do this interview in English and I'm I'm almost embarrassed that I wanted to
EDL	01:01:31,263	01:01:33,055	| radiolab071814 |	To talk to him because I think the food is
EDL	01:01:33,055	01:01:33,823	| radiolab071814 |	It's going to be
EDL	01:01:33,823	01:01:35,359	| radiolab071814 |	So down and out
EDL	01:01:35,871	01:01:39,455	| radiolab071814 |	Exactly the opposite he was so joyful
EDL	01:01:39,967	01:01:46,367	| radiolab071814 |	That's what I thought you're not sad and he's like friend this is a field
EDL	01:01:46,367	01:01:50,975	| radiolab071814 |	A for the other three of money behind them and you see their flags all over Santa Cruz
EDL	01:01:51,487	01:01:52,767	| radiolab071814 |	I just came in second
EDL	01:01:52,767	01:01:54,559	| radiolab071814 |	The guy who wins
EDL	01:01:54,559	01:02:00,959	| radiolab071814 |	He spent $500,000 I spent what two grand
EDL	01:02:00,959	01:02:01,727	| radiolab071814 |	Eating
EDL	01:02:01,727	01:02:04,799	| radiolab071814 |	Avenue a new future for the Galapagos Island
EDL	01:02:05,823	01:02:11,455	| radiolab071814 |	We are ascending we keep keep we have our dreams up
EDL	01:02:11,455	01:02:13,503	| radiolab071814 |	The Nature has a boys now
EDL	01:02:13,503	01:02:17,599	| radiolab071814 |	Brazilian has a voice
EDL	01:02:17,599	01:02:18,879	| radiolab071814 |	The penguin everywhere
EDL	01:02:18,879	01:02:25,023	| radiolab071814 |	So something is happening that exactly how we see this interview
EDL	01:02:43,199	01:02:49,599	| radiolab071814 |	Pretty certain hour before we close very special thanks to Matthew Judas kiltie
