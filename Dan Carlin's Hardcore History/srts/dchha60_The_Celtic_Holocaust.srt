1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,352
It's hardcore history

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:08,192
If I asked you to get a piece of paper

3
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:10,240
Something right

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,312
Onto

5
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:15,360
Make a numerical list

6
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:17,152
Of all the things

7
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,200
But you would be willing to

8
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:19,968
To die for

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,552
How long is

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,112
Amazon

11
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,440
This is kind of an egg

12
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,976
Exercise and you run into these the

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,512
I'm sure as soon as

14
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,280
Clarify your

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,072
Exercise

16
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,120
Another one I've heard is

17
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:40,192
Don't write your own obituary now

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,728
And you can see how that might

19
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,264
Help you get a sense of

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,544
Oh Jesus

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,824
To be Sunday and here's how

22
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,360
Brian from that now

23
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,640
Help you figure out

24
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,664
How you doing

25
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:54,528
The what would you be willing to die for question is a priority

26
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
Helps you solidify

27
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,344
Figure out what are the most

28
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,624
Things to me

29
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,952
And if you think about

30
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,328
Bliss like that I mean I think we probably all have pretty similar things at least it

31
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,888
The top of the list when we met wouldn't loved ones

32
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,680
Be on that list right near the top

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,472
I would be willing to die

34
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,496
For my wife and she

35
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:18,848
I have to believe

36
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:19,872
That's pretty common

37
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,152
In any era in his

38
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,456
And then

39
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,784
Likely something on that list near the top would be possession

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,320
Things of one kind or another

41
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,600
Land

42
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:30,624
Come to mind right

43
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,904
Off the top of my head

44
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,976
As far as been in my family for three generations I would give my life

45
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
Number of conflicts

46
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,352
That we're land ownership based

47
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,912
Since time immemorial is uncountable isn't it

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,192
Common

49
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:47,264
Other kinds of possession you might think of his like money

50
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,592
How long down on your list though does it

51
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,384
Go before you get two things

52
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,712
Better little harder to get your hands on

53
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,480
Tangibly

54
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,064
I mean we're something like freedom

55
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,976
It's funny because if you go and look

56
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,512
All throughout human history

57
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,328
Slogans like New Hampshire state motto

58
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,864
Which is Live Free or Die

59
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,168
You going when you look at my

60
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,448
Like revolutionary France

61
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,104
And all these other movements throughout history and some form of Give me liberty or give me death Live Free or Die is on the

62
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,408
List of people willing to give their own lives

63
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,992
Based on the idea than an unfree life isn't worth living

64
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:37,440
So willing to die for a concept for the concept that means everything when you talked about your day-to-day life and we should play

65
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,744
Point out that freedom is always meant different things to do

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
Different people

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560
And it's been different things in different

68
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,328
Eras

69
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,168
The two big definitions you run into is the obvious

70
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,192
1 freedom is

71
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,984
My right to personal

72
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,032
Control in autonomy and sovereignty

73
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,848
The other one that was a political sword

74
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
Freedom

75
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,896
That says as long

76
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:01,760
Has no outside people or power or state or entity is controlling

77
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,528
My Pitt

78
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,320
Then we're free we may live in

79
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,856
Dictatorship

80
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:06,880
That kind of thing

81
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
So Freedom involves

82
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,720
Freedom from outside control

83
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,304
Tell me change the

84
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,352
Parameters Varla

85
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,120
Question them

86
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,704
What If instead of giving your

87
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,032
And what you would be willing to die

88
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,336
The new list is

89
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,128
What would you be willing

90
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
Toulouse

91
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,176
Everything

92
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,016
And by everything I certainly mean your life

93
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:34,784
That's a given

94
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,600
The lines of all your loved ones one way or another either

95
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,880
Throughout right death

96
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:44,000
Having them sold into a life of slavery your little kids sold into a life of slavery

97
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,280
And all your possessions

98
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:49,120
Taking in all your stuff stolen in you community devastated in your culture

99
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,144
Mortally wound

100
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,448
That's pretty much everything isn't it

101
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
What's the worst that

102
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,384
Some of the greatest human tragedies

103
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,176
Open a personal

104
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,224
And on the society-wide love

105
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:04,992
Bible throughout history

106
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,040
5 happened

107
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,624
Some of the things on the list that you'd be willing to die

108
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
4

109
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,696
Become the cost of preserving

110
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,464
Other thing

111
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,119
And you see this all the

112
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,679
What time in the twentieth century look at how many people

113
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
In order to

114
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,751
Protect their societies freedom

115
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,799
Sent their own children off to die

116
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,103
So this is part of the human condition

117
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,711
Unless you've lived through

118
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,783
Near genocidal condition

119
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
Most of us

120
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:41,855
To deal

121
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,135
With the kind of

122
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
Threat

123
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,927
Fat people

124
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,975
Throughout history have had to deal with

125
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
To everything

126
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:54,399
That General Okoye New Hampshire state motto Live Free or Die

127
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,447
When the Revolutionary War

128
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,471
For example

129
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:01,055
He wrote that phrase decades after the war

130
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,127
And in total freedom and

131
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:04,895
Safety

132
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,455
Now I have no doubt he would have been willing

133
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,479
To give his life

134
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,527
In the service of what was

135
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,807
The brand new country

136
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,343
During the Revolutionary War

137
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,927
But you can also take some comfort in the idea

138
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,487
That he wasn't going to have to give much more than

139
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
I mean the

140
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,815
British were not going to come in today

141
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,631
Country and after they hanged him

142
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,959
Execute his teenage Sons

143
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:36,127
And rape his wife and his children and send them off to slavery burn down his house destroy his town and stamp out his

144
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
Church

145
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
They're not going to do that

146
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,295
It's a different kind

147
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
That's genocide

148
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,135
And people still deal with that

149
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,951
Even if I'm speaking right now somewhere in

150
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,351
Obviously genocides come in many different shades

151
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
Colors

152
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,399
Variations

153
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Answer comes

154
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
And take the

155
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,031
Jews and the Gypsies in the second

156
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,311
The world war during the holiday

157
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
Json example where

158
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
The people

159
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,967
We're being victimized had absolutely no choice and no

160
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,527
No one said to them

161
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,807
Either do this

162
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,575
Or

163
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
We're going to kill you all

164
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,671
Choice was never offer

165
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,231
Sometimes

166
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
It is

167
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,327
Choice a is

168
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,095
You do this

169
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,119
Choice be

170
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:29,887
Is we

171
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:35,519
We committed genocide Rainier genocide or an absolute crime against humanity by modern-day standards against

172
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,615
Paying for most of human history

173
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,919
That's the choice that cities have

174
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,711
When enemy armies

175
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,247
Show up outside their walls

176
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,575
Surrender before

177
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,135
The Siege weapons start being used

178
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,207
And you can maybe go free maybe carry some

179
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,791
Of your personal possessions with you maybe not but the deal is is that is

180
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,583
Soon as the siege starts

181
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
Most of these cases

182
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,423
They could do whatever they wanted to

183
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,471
Sometimes they might still like

184
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:10,079
Sometimes they might have a negotiation 3 weeks from now so we could you want stopping now we'll make a deal

185
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,895
But often times the deal

186
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
Was in pussy

187
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,711
Historic Hanson we says

188
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,527
That this isn't this the standard understanding

189
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,807
Throughout most of

190
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,367
Pre gunpowder history and even into gunpowder

191
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
Are history

192
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,415
That if

193
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:28,255
You don't surrender when called upon in the city Goes Under Siege

194
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,815
That you could have an absolute genocide

195
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,863
At least on a Citywide level afterward

196
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,167
And everyone will understand that

197
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
That's just how it goes

198
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,495
They were doing that

199
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
2

200
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,567
Civilizational equals

201
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,871
Much by the 18th century

202
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
Which of course.

203
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,247
The British would have considered the colonists who five minutes ago I've been

204
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,319
Subjects of the same King as the

205
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
British

206
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,487
But when you were dealing for example with Savages were barbarians

207
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071
Whistler terms

208
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
All bets were off

209
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,679
In the history of the laws of

210
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,703
Term for

211
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,471
Latin

212
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
Bellum romanum

213
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,847
Basically means war the way the ROM

214
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,151
Total War

215
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,711
Legal definition I got from one place in

216
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:24,063
Bellum romanum is all out War without restraint

217
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,903
As the Romans practiced it against groups they considered to be barbaric

218
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,279
And let's understand that the British crown

219
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,119
In 1775 we're dealing with Native Americans

220
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,191
Might have been very different situation all of a sudden

221
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,983
You can treat them the way

222
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,775
Rome treated Barbarian

223
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,407
Often times with what we would call today

224
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
Genocide

225
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,711
But

226
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,991
Often time

227
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:58,111
With choices unlike the Jews and the Gypsies in the second world war Holocaust

228
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,903
Often times the choice was

229
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,183
Surrender

230
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
And accept

231
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,231
Subjugation

232
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,255
Without Rebellion

233
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,791
And live

234
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,863
Or do any of those other things

235
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,423
And see everyone

236
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,727
Either killed or sold into slavery

237
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,055
What passes for a city in your culture destroyed

238
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,615
And maybe your culture itself

239
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,431
Taken apart piece by piece

240
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,503
There's something very strange Maybe

241
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
About me

242
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,599
But I see A Certain Romance

243
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,903
Doom sort of Rome

244
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:37,023
The same sort of thing you see with the Native Americans sometimes will you watch this story that is a calamity

245
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,559
And it times

246
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,143
Behavior of the human beings in it make a tear roll down your cheek

247
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,935
Touch something deep in your soul

248
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,727
Those were willing to say

249
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,007
Yes we know

250
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,543
But you'll kill all of us or

251
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,591
Destroy our civilization if we don't

252
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,639
Subjugate ourselves to you

253
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,175
But we're going to

254
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:57,503
Take the chance here and try to Live Free or Die

255
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,111
The only one that sees the obvious

256
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
Entertainment

257
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,207
The compelling nature

258
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,999
Green situation

259
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,279
A choice like that

260
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,351
Put human beings into because it's a Hollywood

261
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,375
Cliche isn't it

262
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,423
Storytelling

263
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,519
A recurring theme

264
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,567
I mean it would be very easy to tell this to

265
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
Story and turn it into Brave

266
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,175
I'll try very hard not to do that

267
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,015
But it's an old theme and it's easy to become

268
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
Soda

269
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
In Norwich

270
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,599
2x overtime

271
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,647
So numb

272
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
The other problem

273
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:43,327
These situations that were talking about the reality of them is actually so intense and so extreme

274
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:49,471
Any portrayal or discussion of them can't help but somehow minimize or trivialize or height

275
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,519
In a different way for entertainment.

276
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
But the people were actually going through

277
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,359
I always try to think of myself

278
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,687
Imagine if that list that we mentioned a minute ago

279
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,711
Genocide list

280
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,295
Imagine if only one of those things was going to happen to me

281
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,599
In my cushy life here

282
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:09,439
Where I'm in no danger or say having my culture wiped out

283
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,719
Can't even imagine what they

284
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
That would mean

285
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,815
Blue jeans illegal

286
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:23,519
No more iPhones and they start destroying the Christian religion I mean I'm not quite sure in the modern sense in the United States where I live

287
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,335
I mean you can't even get your mind.

288
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,151
Maybe in some weird

289
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,455
Emotionally voyeuristic

290
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
That's what

291
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
The kind of intriguing

292
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,063
As I've always said

293
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,391
You can't imagine dealing

294
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,159
With yourself

295
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:46,559
The story that I would like to use to highlight that has a very familiar ring

296
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,655
Because we've seen this movie historically speaking before

297
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
Over and over

298
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,447
Again

299
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,007
Broadly speaking

300
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,823
It's the story of a European power

301
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,359
Using it

302
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,687
Technological and civilizational advantages

303
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,223
To dominate

304
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,015
Take over

305
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,831
And colonize the land

306
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,111
Of a tribe

307
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,951
Less sophisticated politically speaking tribal people

308
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
Into

309
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,767
Destroy

310
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,583
Broad elements of their culture is part of doing so

311
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,423
Obviously over the last 500 or so years

312
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,239
We've seen this movie play out in the Americas

313
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,055
Would European colonization and Conquest

314
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,639
We saw play on an Africa to same thing

315
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,711
The difference here

316
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,527
Is it the people the tribal people

317
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:44,671
On the receiving end of European conquest and colonization are themselves European

318
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,511
And this didn't happen a couple hundred years ago

319
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,303
This happened more than 2000

320
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:57,727
And the reason I wanted to talk about this story as opposed to any of the others with similar themes

321
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,055
Because this is one of the times where you

322
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,079
Look at the

323
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
Odds

324
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,943
And you say there's a halfway decent chance here

325
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,527
Of the people on the receiving end

326
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,343
Of the European colonization

327
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
To fight back

328
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
And when

329
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:21,023
The Native Americans for example never had a chance never a chance ever

330
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:26,143
If for no other reason and there's a lot of other ones just a disease alone

331
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,423
If you're about to have it

332
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,727
A hemispheric civilizational

333
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,799
Conflict in a between the New World in the old world

334
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,335
You don't want to lose

335
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:40,991
Maybe I mean I saw an estimate that's at 98% I think that's got to be high but let's just say 85

336
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:45,343
5% of the entire population of the hemisphere to disease right off the bat

337
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,183
There are bunch of experts who

338
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:56,607
Try to explain what the situation must have been liking these tribes in the center of the Americas you know there were still Untouched by

339
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,375
What European

340
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
Contact

341
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,703
What the disease is managed to find them

342
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,007
And we're just like shell shocked

343
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,055
Traumatized

344
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:11,455
Remnants by the time Europeans got to the interior

345
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:16,575
Diseases like a magic imagine the Bubonic plague in Europe but worse from the Middle Ages

346
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:22,975
I see numbers that say that in the end say 1800 they were estimating what the

347
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,047
Tribal population of North America was

348
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:32,447
No not the North America that constituted the United States in that area back that because that was just a sliver compared to today

349
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,751
But the native population throughout

350
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,543
In from the Pacific to the Atlantic

351
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,079
And what's now the United States

352
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,663
Some estimates are as low as 600000 people

353
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,247
That's a pretty unfair fight right there isn't it

354
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,807
Not just that as we all know

355
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
That's not

356
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,879
600000 people

357
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:57,279
Smooshed into one state right next to the 13 colonies when the United States becomes a state right it's not like the US

358
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:01,887
Play Saturday with 600,000 native next door they're spread out in small groups

359
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,935
You know the width and breadth of the territory

360
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,727
Able to be picked off

361
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,311
Divided and conquered one by one over time which is what happened

362
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,663
I mean it still blows my mind to realize

363
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:18,527
How small the number of Native American warriors there are

364
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
Fighting

365
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:23,391
Against the encroachment of manifest destiny at any time

366
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:30,047
And how well they did based on how small they were would you know if you get 1500 North American Native American

367
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:30,815
Warriors

368
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,631
In one place at one time that's a sizable Force

369
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:41,311
The highest estimates I've ever seen for the largest Native American Force of Warriors Everest

370
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,871
Is between 4 and 5000 people

371
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,943
A Little Bighorn why do people think that's the biggest battle that's

372
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,503
The largest numbers I've ever seen or just under 5000

373
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
5000

374
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,111
When the Spanish

375
00:15:54,367 --> 00:16:00,511
Conquistadors found the Aztec empire the Aztecs could raise tens of thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of War

376
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
Warriors

377
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:07,167
Obviously there's a different state organizational system which plays into the store

378
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
Dory

379
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,727
At the same time it's also

380
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:13,823
First Contact basically in the disease had not had time to take hold

381
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,895
And then fast forward a couple hundred years

382
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,431
And all of a sudden you go from

383
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,991
Hundreds of thousands of Warriors Maybe

384
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,063
To 1500 being a sizable Force

385
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,391
And look how long it took the US to deal with that

386
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,695
And to be fair

387
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:33,535
It wasn't like United States had a hundred thousand people against 1500 native

388
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,839
The forces of the European

389
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,167
Powers fighting in the new world were very small also

390
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,447
Can 1500

391
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:47,103
And US forces fighting these Native American tribes half of which might be local militia that was not uncommon either

392
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:53,759
Even in the big Wars like the American Revolution the numbers are smaller than you would think I mean again

393
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,831
25000 would be a ton in America

394
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,183
So you wonder how the US

395
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,255
Or before then the British and French explorers would have fared

396
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:08,863
If they were exploring the interior say of North America and They Came Upon some

397
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:15,519
People that had not been impacted by the disease I mean what if the Aztec empire instead of being in the middle of Mexico

398
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:20,127
Was on the opposite side of the Mississippi to be running to buy the Europeans at some point

399
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,175
Or better yet

400
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,479
Let's make it an interesting combat

401
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,527
Let's put ancient Gaul

402
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,831
On the western side of the Mississippi

403
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:34,719
Is regardless what the Romans called an area about the size of Texas

404
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,255
In the ancient world

405
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,535
The comprised

406
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:43,423
Well most of Northwestern Europe modern-day France a lot of Belgium Western strip of Germany's of a Switzerland in

407
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,471
During one part of this.

408
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,007
Northern Italy

409
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,639
Estimate of the ancient population range from 3 to 7 million people

410
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,223
I'm a kind of armies that they could put in the field

411
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:01,855
Well let's just say I'd imagine they're pretty close to the kind of numbers that the Aztecs probably could put

412
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,623
The field

413
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,695
An army of forty or fifty thousand

414
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
Garlic

415
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
Peoples

416
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,815
5 or 10000 of which might be mounted

417
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,351
It's Not Unusual

418
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,679
Imagine imagine those armies

419
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:22,335
Better used to brushing aside $1,500 maybe on a really bad day 2508 is having two.

420
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,383
Chat with 40 or 50 thousand

421
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
Of them instead

422
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,479
No I have no doubt

423
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,039
Given the technological

424
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:37,695
Advantages and more importantly these State organizational advantages of a place like the early United States

425
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:42,047
Before than the British in the fight I have no doubt they would conquer this

426
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,863
Latter-Day version of gall at some point

427
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,167
But I wonder if they are

428
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,215
Concrete as quickly as Caesar did

429
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,519
In the real thing

430
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,567
2000 years before

431
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,639
And if they couldn't

432
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,175
What does that say

433
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,015
Rather than

434
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,807
Attributed to any

435
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,855
Failings or shortcomings

436
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,135
Of the

437
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,463
European or American forces in North America

438
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,255
Maybe it says how

439
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,559
Incredibly awesome Julius Caesar

440
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,911
Bellossom doesn't mean good

441
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:21,983
And

442
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,543
Up until relatively recently

443
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,335
What she did

444
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
Golf

445
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,663
Will celebrate

446
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,967
And in fact going back

447
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,783
100 or 200 years and they are aware

448
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:41,439
The great Powers especially the great powers of Europe are celebrating the idea of doing exactly what Julius Caesar

449
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:45,535
When the Romans were doing to the tribal peoples north of them in their own era

450
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,863
They tended to see Caesar as the good guy

451
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,191
Story I want to talk about today

452
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,519
Is narrated by Julius Caesar

453
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,871
It's a little like hearing the Star Wars saga

454
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,407
As Told by

455
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,687
Darth Vader

456
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,503
And it is designed

457
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,039
To have the audience

458
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,063
Cheer

459
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,391
When the Plucky little republics are crushed

460
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,695
And a hundred years ago

461
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,743
All people dead

462
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,351
The beginning to my recent translation

463
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,399
Caesar's War commentaries

464
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,447
From his commanding goal

465
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,311
The Carolyn Hammond translation

466
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:35,711
Feel the need at the beginning of the work to explain why yet another translation of Caesar's account

467
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,247
Of his

468
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,807
I had one professor in school in the 80s

469
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,831
Call today

470
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,111
Celtic Holocaust

471
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:48,511
Why a new translation is needed in Hammond points up because the views of the audience are different

472
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,791
Then they used to be she right

473
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,559
Quote

474
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:57,983
A new translation of the garlic War does call for some explanation not least because the number of version

475
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,263
Regions are already available

476
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:03,871
Yet each generation needs its own translation of any classic text

477
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:08,735
The culture and mores of the translator Zone time are bound to leave their mark

478
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:09,759
Besides

479
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,319
The subject matter of the garlic War

480
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,111
Is potentially distasteful

481
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,416
Even immoral for the modern reader

482
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:19,488
The drive to increase territorial Holdings

483
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,560
By civilian as well as military casualties

484
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:26,400
And the predominance of economic motives for organized aggression

485
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:31,008
All these belong to an accepted Norm of international activity in the ancient world

486
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
And hence

487
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,848
Need careful introduction explanation

488
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,152
As well as up-to-date translation

489
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
And quote

490
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,528
Of course what she's basically saying

491
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,856
Is it once upon a time this was written for an audience

492
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,416
Who was expected to cheer

493
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,952
What was going on

494
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,744
Nowadays

495
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,072
We look at things so differently and can't help but notice

496
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:59,168
But in the process of achieving these glorious an almost

497
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,240
Impossible military victories

498
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,288
Julius Caesar

499
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,568
Is killing

500
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,104
Reportedly

501
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,384
A million

502
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,176
Are the inhabitants of Gaul

503
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,016
Enslaving another million

504
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,088
As

505
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,368
Celtic expert

506
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,416
Archaeologist Barry cunliffe says

507
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:27,072
If you take the low numbers of the entire population of Gaul that means Caesar killed 1/3 of the population in slay

508
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,096
Find another third

509
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,192
Is that genocide

510
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,776
America's

511
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:39,360
The disease did most of the damage in terms of

512
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,640
The overall death rate

513
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,944
In Gaul

514
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,760
In the 50s BCE

515
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
Caesars

516
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,952
Even if I say that I can hear something in the back of my head

517
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,744
The screaming

518
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,560
Objections of the ancient Roman lawyers

519
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,096
From the grave

520
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,424
Of the way that I'm framing this whole thing

521
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
Comparing

522
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:11,360
Roman efforts against the Celtic peoples north of them to the Holocaust in the second world war would be in

523
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,408
An insult to Roman honor

524
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,968
Although there were some who complained about

525
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
Cato

526
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,088
None the less they would say that to suggest

527
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:26,208
That doing what Caesar did to the Gauls is the same as what

528
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:32,096
Happened to the Jews and the Gypsies in the Jehovah's Witnesses in the gay folks and all the other people persecuted

529
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,400
In the Holocaust Roman Catholic priests

530
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,704
Familystrokes

531
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,032
Those are like lamb

532
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,056
Innocent

533
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,848
Led to the slaughter

534
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,408
Caesar did

535
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,456
He did to a people that were like

536
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
Lion

537
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,760
Dangerously

538
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,600
Lions that had attacked before and might do so again

539
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,184
If you are forced

540
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,232
As a state or people or what have you

541
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,816
To commit genocide in order to protect yourself

542
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,400
That's one of a get-out-of-jail-free card

543
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,680
Any sort of

544
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:14,336
Jenna Seidel Court situation that mean in a judgment call would you say Willis and you know they had to do with anybody

545
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,104
He would have done it

546
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,432
The same time of course

547
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:23,040
What Caesar was suggesting and we'll get to that in a minute was that they needed a preemptive War

548
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:27,136
Because he Lions could attack at any time so it gets murky quickly

549
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,952
But there's no denying

550
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,000
These Celtic peoples

551
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:35,072
All over you are more dangerous

552
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,376
They are

553
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:43,776
Vikings a thousand years before there are Vikings and I don't mean in the in the pirate like sense I mean

554
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,592
In the European Barbarian stereotype sense

555
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:54,016
And the Vikings are like version 3.4 something because that the Celts are the Alpha version of the Europe

556
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,576
Northern European Barbarian type

557
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,392
They exhibit all the typical traits

558
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:07,328
They get crazy and battle supposedly in a fight with enormous amounts of like ferocity

559
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,424
The geographer strabo said that they are warm at

560
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,800
The ancient sources also point out that the Celts are Headhunters

561
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
Which is always a

562
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,104
Little bit unnerving

563
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,712
Ancient peoples are always more comfortable with head shopping than we are in the modern world

564
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:27,552
But in the more settled societies when it was done it was sort of

565
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:34,208
They didn't enjoy it they didn't Revel in it they didn't take pride in it it wasn't something you showed off to visitors

566
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:38,048
But in the Celtic world according to the ancient sources that were not Celtic

567
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:44,704
This was something that was done it only says he's visiting Celtic homes and they want to bring out the heads of slain

568
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:51,104
Enemies you know that they've kept in a chest you know soaked in cedar oil so everything stays nice and pristine and you can still recognize

569
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,872
Nice the features

570
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:59,552
And they have found by the way the archaeology has shown that there are these for example pillars

571
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,856
I think they find with little cubby holes

572
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:05,952
With skulls still in some of them by the way in little hangers to

573
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,768
Do a fix the skull to the back of these things I mean

574
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,424
This may be a religious thing but to the settled people cutting the heads off people keeping them in and adorning your temples and

575
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,960
What not with headset that's just freaky

576
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:24,384
And was even then by the waypost Adonia says he would get used to it after a while but never quite got comfortable

577
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,456
With people treating human heads the way some people treat

578
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:31,040
Yeah the antlers of the deer they shot last fall

579
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,624
Put up on the wall mounted with a name tag underneath

580
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
To talk to it

581
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,232
Always give that great story about that you killed this dude

582
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,304
I should also point out that

583
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,352
Besides the religious significance of the head

584
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:51,008
Caesar says that the the Gauls believed in the theory of reincarnation soda maybe you could call it was simple

585
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:57,408
A major philosophical group in Greece always believed that the Gauls kind of believe that when you die in this world

586
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:00,992
You just born into the other one then we done the other one you just born back into this one

587
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,528
A correctly

588
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:06,880
Caesar says that this is part of the reason why they're so Fearless in battle

589
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:11,744
Because instead of being worried about having your existence not doubting you just you know in Oblivion

590
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,536
You just going to be born in the next world

591
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,376
Just to avoid confusion by the way

592
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,168
Because it can be very confusing

593
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,216
The terms

594
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,008
Gaul and celt

595
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,104
Are used by the ancient sources in a way where it's impossible not to get everything

596
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:34,528
Archaeologist John Collins has a whole rundown of the various ways you can interpret this the most common ways we were going to do it

597
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:39,392
We're going to assume that when we say Celtic Women Celtic people across

598
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,952
The width and breadth of areas

599
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:47,840
That have Celtic language and culture if we say Galls we specifically mean the Celts in

600
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,656
Ancient Gaul modern-day France except

601
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,424
Tetra

602
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:56,544
They are like all these Northwestern European Barbarian types

603
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:03,200
White they are strong they are tall especially to all the people riding in the Mediterranean they always look taller

604
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:06,784
They might have only been like 6 feet if we could go back in a time machine

605
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:11,136
But if that's five or six inches taller than your average Mediterranean type

606
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,696
Still like fighting giants and battle isn't it

607
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,512
And that's what made fighting the Celtic peoples

608
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:20,608
You know scary to it's not just their enormous numbers according to the ancient authors

609
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,264
Listen if you were in a 21st century Army and I tell you listen we're going to go to battle going to fight another 21st century Army

610
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,104
An old by the way everyone in that Army is six inches taller than all of us

611
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,896
You might think to yourself

612
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,456
Dang it doesn't sound so good I don't like the sound of that

613
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,016
At the same time you don't you realize

614
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:44,672
7 foot tall people or whatever they are go down from bullets and she'll fire and bombs just like shorter people do

615
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,464
You're so it's not that big of a deal

616
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:53,376
But in the ancient world when you say you're going to fight an army people that is on average five inches taller and proportionately stronger doll

617
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,448
All the rest of us when you're doing that in a hand-to-hand sense

618
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,240
It can make a huge difference

619
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,080
The Celtic people were scary

620
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,896
When they had scared Rome before

621
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,664
And

622
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,016
All the modern historians point out that this was somehow a scar

623
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,320
Ran through the Roman psyche

624
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:17,696
So that even after the Celts really weren't that dangerous to the Romans anymore

625
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,000
They still felt the memory of

626
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,816
Lion attacks a long time ago

627
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,352
I never quite got over them

628
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:27,424
You know if you look at Roman history there are a couple of Famous Tate

629
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:33,568
One of them is 410 AD right the famous fall of Rome to the Germanic barbarians

630
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,616
Why do people like to make that.

631
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,432
Exclamation point at the end of the Western Roman Empire

632
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,272
Always debatable of course

633
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:48,928
But the reason it's such a big deal is basically wrong with being on a huge winning streak to Joe DiMaggio hitting streak

634
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,720
You know ancient

635
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:56,864
Runs in the sense that Rome hadn't been sacked by a foreign conqueror in almost a thousand years right

636
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,424
That's a pretty big deal in the ancient world

637
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,984
The last time though that they were stacked

638
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,288
It was these Celtic people that did it

639
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:08,128
Roman never forgot it and is a famous phrase that sort of

640
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:15,296
Sums up the whole. And I've always wondered if the ancient author writing when the Roman Empire was around take

641
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:19,136
Taking everybody's but didn't have a Sly reason for putting it in there

642
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,416
Pointing out that

643
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:25,536
And if the Cavs can say that back then we can live by those same rules the line was

644
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,072
5 victus

645
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,352
Or why we

646
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,168
The translation usually

647
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,448
Youjizz

648
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,984
Woe to the

649
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,080
Because that's what happened to the Romans famously

650
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:42,944
I had a Forever After remembered as an inauspicious day in Rome

651
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,736
July 18th

652
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,808
The first Celtic Army

653
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:51,648
That the Romans had ever encountered supposedly in their history

654
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,000
Bore down on the city itself and we're coming at speed

655
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,816
Jerome completely unprepared to meet them

656
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:05,728
Bunch of different ancient historians who written an account of what happened here

657
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:11,104
Livi is of course the most famous most romantic and goes into the most detail about

658
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,384
This

659
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,176
Interesting battle where

660
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:20,832
And I love ancient battles and then when you try to recreate what happened it's kind of impossible any people do their best but the physics

661
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,624
Which of the whole thing or just not understood

662
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,648
And

663
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:27,232
Ideas and Concepts go in and out of fashion as to what really happened

664
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,072
But there are elements

665
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,656
Humanity on an individual level

666
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,192
Things like

667
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,216
Beer

668
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,752
And intimidation

669
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,568
And very hard to quantify

670
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,616
Sides of a human beings that

671
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:48,480
A part of when you take those things collectively right what is fear do when you magnify it

672
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,808
Yuan to a whole group of people as opposed to one individual

673
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,440
This is the part of human history that make history hard to turn into any kind of hard science

674
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,488
How do you quantify things like that

675
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,328
How do you say that one side in a battle

676
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,608
What's more scared

677
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:07,424
Then another side in the battle and that's what made the diff

678
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,984
Or that one side was tougher

679
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,520
And that's what made the difference

680
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,544
Is clearly

681
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,616
The ancient writers and let's be honest historians writing

682
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,432
Even 1500 years ago had no problem saying this

683
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,992
But when you need evidence to prove it

684
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:26,368
There are certain parts of humanity infused into history that you just can't quantify

685
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:32,512
I mean the most logical way if you want to follow the sources anyway especially Livy

686
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,840
To view this battle that's about to happen when the Romans in the

687
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,144
Celtic armies first Clash

688
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,424
Supposedly

689
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,496
Is to say that the Romans were terrified

690
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:49,152
And then 2300 plus years later it actually seeps through

691
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,688
You know can you imagine

692
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:56,576
That you can walk up to one of them things they listen as a friend as you are it'll be it'll be recorded in people

693
00:32:56,832 --> 00:33:00,416
Thousands of years from now will know how scared you are of this alien people coming down

694
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,184
North

695
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:04,768
Aliens are keyword to see you add the fact that these are

696
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,560
Obviously big people

697
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:12,960
But the entire look and feel of them had an alien quality that just is scary and understand Barberry

698
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,496
Are always scary

699
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,056
To settled societies

700
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,360
Not just scary sometimes a little sexy

701
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,920
You can see styles that catch on

702
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,736
Like in Rome the start wearing those tight German pants

703
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:29,600
But the barbarians where there's a certain element to then that's a little Clint Eastwood at times

704
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,928
But you know I like to think that there's a barbarian scale

705
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,744
12101 being most barbaric

706
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,584
Can being one step away from being a Roman with a mustache you know

707
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,912
That's what depends on where you are

708
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:49,312
The really cool barbarians walking around Roman leather jackets you know they're there more like a nine or a 10 on the scale if they get

709
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:52,128
Drunk to get hurt somebody but otherwise they pretty well-behaved

710
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:56,224
You take one or two and put them in there and they're going to be like a bull in a china shop

711
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:00,320
And that in 390 or 387 BCE

712
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:05,184
Is what the Romans are facing on the opposite side of the battlefield and by the time they get there

713
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,584
According to Levy the battlefields already swarming with these people so you don't even have time to get your lines all straightened everything all figure

714
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,120
You're not in a Felix brace ourselves

715
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:19,776
You are essentially having an encounter bottle with it with a Celtic Army heading down toward Rome and it's about

716
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,056
7 miles away from the city

717
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,104
In all fairness

718
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,664
This is not the Roman Empire or even the

719
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:32,064
Romans of the Julius Caesar are that we normally think of those terrible badasses that are absolutely frightful

720
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,624
This is a militia Army

721
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,696
And at this battle it's also about half of it is just a

722
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,720
Citizen

723
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,000
Citizen DeSoto

724
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:44,608
Raising so you have your militia Farmers you do all your fighting for you anyway and then you have

725
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,400
Townsfolk and other people

726
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,496
But it's an emergency and it happened so quickly there was no time

727
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,032
They resist rmb hastily

728
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:56,896
Rome at this time is merely a city in Italy probably the predominant

729
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,176
But they just had a

730
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,968
A long conflict

731
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,016
With an arch enemy Etruscan City

732
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:05,344
That they had just recently defeated and it was only like

733
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:10,976
Are 10 miles from the city of Rome so you can see the small-scale they're operating on in this era

734
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,768
But this early Roman army of

735
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,048
Militia and

736
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,584
Soul of a citizen

737
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,632
Contingent as well

738
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:21,216
Meet this Army of huge tall

739
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,520
Extremely scary barbarians

740
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,336
And we are told it takes

741
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,872
Little time

742
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,152
Before they are

743
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:29,920
Are fleeing

744
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,712
An abject Terror

745
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:38,624
Libby seems to say pretty openly that he thinks the commander

746
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,184
Of the Romans at this battle was incompetent

747
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:42,976
He makes the

748
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,256
Celtic command around

749
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,792
To be pretty darn good

750
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,888
No one knows how many people died

751
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,728
The movie called The Battle of the Aaliyah

752
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,520
Where the battle of the Alea River

753
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,080
I know one knows how many people fought there either

754
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,128
There are all kinds of different estimate

755
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,944
The low ones

756
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,784
You're probably right though because in this time. I know it's hard to imagine this but

757
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,088
Rome is a true city-state

758
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,136
Probably only controls

759
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:14,720
It may be 30 miles around the city somewhere in that area

760
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:19,840
That means so this is a really small scale very early version of Ron they probably didn't have too many soldiers to defend them

761
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:23,680
The problem is is regardless of how many of those soldiers there were

762
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,496
They weren't there anymore after that battle

763
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,544
Between Rome is totally

764
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,568
Undefended

765
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,616
Panic sets in the city

766
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,944
People stream out of it in

767
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:35,968
The

768
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:40,832
Religious artifacts are evacuated in these terrible choices we are told or made

769
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:44,416
This reminds you of the list of what you would be prepared to die for

770
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,696
We are told by

771
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:49,792
Residence Inn the city where the fighting men are going to be separated

772
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:54,144
From the useless mouths including women and young people in old people

773
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,936
You know to be the one to defend the

774
00:36:56,192 --> 00:37:00,288
Center Citadel of the city I mean if it's the story of impending doom

775
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,872
My favorite piece

776
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,968
I'm living maybe in its entirety though is what happens when the

777
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,528
The Gaul the Celtic people the army

778
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:15,392
The first Army that the Romans supposedly had encountered of these alien northerner shows up

779
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,696
Outside the gates of Rome

780
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,232
And they're open

781
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,816
The city seems both deserted

782
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:23,840
And

783
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,400
Simply left unlocked and unguarded

784
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,192
Olivia

785
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,216
Paints

786
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
Picture

787
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,568
I was seeing that's like something out of The Twilight Zone

788
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:39,200
You have these may be superstitious natives like I said they're often portrayed very similarly to how you would see

789
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:42,272
And the Native Americans are African tribesman

790
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,088
Has somehow extremely superstitious had both

791
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:49,440
Savage and skittish and unpredictable and childlike and mean

792
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,232
It is interesting stereotype

793
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,072
But here's the story that Libby

794
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,608
Paints and it involves

795
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:03,008
The great old man of Rome from another time the ancient ones were still around with with longbow

796
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:06,080
Beards as he says after the fashion of their day

797
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,152
They're neither useless mouths

798
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:15,040
Nor able to fight in the Citadel so they decide Livy says that they're going to set an example by simply

799
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:17,600
Sacrificing their lives in the hopes

800
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,904
Did that somehow maybe help things with the

801
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,952
God's or what not he says they

802
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:26,304
These generals from the Past who celebrated triumphs a long time ago

803
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,912
Any senators in August people who are now the elders and Society put on

804
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:35,008
They're most elaborate and decorated Robes of higher office

805
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:39,104
Went to their homes in the parts section of Rome

806
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,200
And sat in their chairs of high office their Ivory chairs

807
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,736
And waited likes

808
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,784
Silent statues for deaf

809
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,552
Find them

810
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,368
There's hardly be described

811
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:54,976
The Celts coming into the city of Rome and it's like a ghost town with the gates open

812
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:59,840
And they don't know what to do and they freaked out a little bit and then an incident happen

813
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,608
It's wild

814
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:05,472
The touch is off the forest fire of garlic impetu ocity

815
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,568
This by the way from the Aubrey de selincourt translation

816
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,104
Here's what living rights quote

817
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,688
A night having passed without action

818
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:17,760
The gulls found their Lust For Fighting much abated

819
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:20,832
At no time had they met with any serious resistance

820
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,648
And it was no need now to take the City by assault

821
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,256
When therefore they entered on the following day it was coolly and calmly enough

822
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,560
The colline gate was open

823
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,864
And they made their Way to the Forum

824
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,936
Looking with curiosity at the temples and at the Citadel

825
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,752
The only place to give an impression of a city at War

826
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:43,616
They left a reasonably strong guard in case of attack from the Fortified Heights

827
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,920
And then dispersed in search of plunder

828
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,712
Finding the streets empty

829
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:53,088
Crowds of them broke into the first houses they came to others went farther afield

830
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:58,464
Presuming supposedly that buildings more remote from The Forum would offer richer prizes

831
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,792
But they're the very silence and Solitude made them uneasy

832
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,352
Separated as they were from their companions

833
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,912
And suggested the possibility of a trap

834
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,192
So they soon return

835
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,472
Keeping close together

836
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,264
To The Neighbourhood at The Forum

837
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,592
Here they found the humbler houses locked and barred

838
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,152
What dimensions of the nobility open

839
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,712
The former they were ready to break into

840
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:22,784
But it was a long time before they could bring themselves to enter the ladder

841
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,576
Something akin to all

842
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,600
Held them back

843
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,880
It what met their gaze

844
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,952
Those figures seated in the open courtyard

845
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,000
The robes and decorations

846
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,304
August Beyond Reckoning

847
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,424
The Majesty expressed in those grave calm eyes like the Majesty of God

848
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:42,496
They might have been statues in some holy place

849
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,520
And for a while

850
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,824
The garlic Warriors stood entranced

851
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,616
Then on an impulse

852
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:51,456
One of them touch the beard of a certain Marcus Poppy rhoeas

853
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:57,344
It was long as was the fashion of those days and the Roman struck him on the head with his Ivory staff

854
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,880
That was the beginning

855
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:01,696
The Barbarian flamed into Android kill him

856
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,000
And the others were butchered where they sat

857
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,304
From that moment no mercy was shown

858
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,888
Houses were ransacked in the empty shell set on fire

859
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,424
And quote

860
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:19,360
Whether or not that happen that's a pretty cool and interesting scene and a romantic and Superwoman Patriot like Livy

861
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,152
He probably saw it that way too

862
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:24,736
None the less who knows what source is he was working from

863
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,808
As The Story Goes On basically

864
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:34,464
The Gauls sack Rome set fire to a bunch of it and start this seat cuz they can't take the Fortified Citadel

865
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,232
In the middle

866
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,792
Data sources differ

867
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,328
What happens next book

868
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,376
The famous story is

869
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:48,032
That They seized develops them both sides want to call the sea job they come to an agreement a thousand pounds of gold

870
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,080
Right at the Romans will pay a thousand pounds of gold

871
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,616
The Gauls will leave

872
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:55,967
And then as they're weighing the gold out one of the Romans famously complains

873
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,015
That the weights have been doctored with

874
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,295
And the Gauls are

875
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,599
Falsifying the weights to their advantage

876
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,135
And the King

877
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,415
Of this tribe

878
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:10,559
Walks up to the scale takes his big heavy sword throws it on the Gulf side of the scale

879
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,583
And says

880
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,375
Woe to the

881
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,143
Squished

882
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,191
Meaning

883
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,495
What are you going to do if the weights

884
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,543
Are loaded in our favor

885
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,567
You lost

886
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,591
Pay up

887
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,687
I was reading a fantastic book

888
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:30,015
On early Rome called war and Society in early Rome

889
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,807
By Jeremy Armstrong

890
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:37,695
Floatin idea that a lot of others are floated to the idea that basically

891
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,231
It's this

892
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:42,559
Conquering and sacking of the city of Rome

893
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,887
Thousand Years almost before the next time that they will do it

894
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,959
That will create the Rome we all know

895
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:53,311
What's up line from The Batman series where the Joker said to him you made me

896
00:42:54,079 --> 00:43:00,223
It's the same thing we said with this woe to the vanquished line that Livvy throws and right it's almost like the Romans hundreds of years later

897
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,503
You're saying hey you set the rules

898
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:05,599
So we're playing by the world of the vanquished this isn't genocide what we're doing in

899
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:09,695
Celtic land when Julius Caesar conquered all these tribes this is

900
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:14,559
Playing by the rules that you set up when you first conquered ice you made me

901
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,631
Armstrong points out

902
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:24,287
But the actual sacking of Rome may not have been too terrible because the archaeological evidence doesn't seem to sir

903
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,055
Support some

904
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,127
You know terrible carthaginian solution type

905
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,919
Burning to the ground already

906
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,687
Anything

907
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,759
Before the Romans that probably wasn't

908
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:34,527
The problem

909
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,343
Probably a lot more

910
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,903
What a lot of beat writer to write about the Romans

911
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,927
It's quite a bit pointed

912
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,951
How did they have this

913
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:48,095
Inability to accept defeat and humiliation and where has most people probably would

914
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:51,423
Write something off and move along with their lives the Romans

915
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:54,239
Faster and focus on things and remember

916
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,031
Old slides in wounds

917
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:02,943
And the psychological seeds for that if not planted may have been heavily watered

918
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:05,759
As a result of Roman experience after losing

919
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:09,855
Just supposedly this first Celtic army they ever fought at the Battle of the Aaliyah

920
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,903
And then seeing their City sacked by them

921
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,719
By the way I should point out because I think it's

922
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,487
Cool

923
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:18,815
That the old idea that this is a try

924
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:25,471
Celtic people that has shown up the sacrum is challenged by a lot of historians and there's people on both sides who said

925
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:29,823
Just at the evidence shows that this may have been a group of hired mercenary

926
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,639
It has been hired by

927
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:35,199
A ruler on the modern-day

928
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,503
Island of Sicily to fight with him

929
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:44,159
And that Rome was just on the way and what the heck will second pick up a couple extra bucks to eat on the way in a while we're doing it

930
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:48,511
So this idea that what we have here is a try maybe wrong and

931
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:52,863
It's kind of important because when seizures conquering Gaul hundreds of years later

932
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,191
Don't be talking about yeah that's right over there those are the ones that

933
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,727
Affect our country

934
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:00,031
340 years ago

935
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,871
Does rhombus have long memories

936
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:07,711
Unfortunately not just for the Celts before every

937
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:13,855
And it's worth pointing out that you know in 390 win this battle happens to the Celtic peoples of Europe are very powerful

938
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,647
And they're all over the place

939
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,207
And who they are is a great question

940
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:24,863
Once upon a time when it was easy to classify these things in ways that sounded easy to understand but now seem totally ridiculous

941
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,399
They were a race

942
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:31,263
Celts were a race like Anglo-Saxons were a race writing all these

943
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:33,823
You divide the world into the different racial group

944
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,895
These are the yellow people in these are the black people in these other white pill

945
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,711
I mean a hundred years ago you open up history book and that's how they do it

946
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:47,391
As the complexities mounted and that whole way of looking at things went out of fashion 50 years ago 40 years ago the counter and

947
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,159
Ethnic group

948
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:48,927
RPP

949
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,231
That's how I grew up reading

950
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,767
Kelly Michael Grant who

951
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:58,655
Like everyone else would have insinuated most of the time that these Celtic people were probably all related by blood

952
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:02,239
Those people that sacked Rome in 390 BCE

953
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:05,055
Are the ancestors of the people in Ireland

954
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:07,871
500 years later or today

955
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,175
Nowadays

956
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:13,759
That's a pretty tough argument to make given the way it scene

957
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:18,879
Amongst most of the experts and I don't mean to speak for them because they're and then just Celtic studies stuff is

958
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:25,535
Fascinatingly debatable and the passion with which the experts go out of this fun to watch from the sidelines

959
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:28,863
But it means you have to be really careful and there are a lot of people out

960
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:33,215
You are very passionate about their view of who a caliph is

961
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,751
And who is not a celt

962
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:36,799
I love the way

963
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:39,359
Barry cunliffe we mentioned earlier

964
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:42,175
I push it because it gets me out of all kinds of trouble to say it

965
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:45,759
The way he said it he said account is a person who believes

966
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,807
Him or herself to be Celtic

967
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:52,927
I thought of a t-shirt that I should Market I'm going to make it green of course

968
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,463
And I'm going to say

969
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,255
Celtic

970
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,559
It's not a nationality it's a way of life

971
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:03,679
But the point is the same the modern view of a lot of the experts on this and then there were

972
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:07,007
Archaeologist linguist historian everything all kind of look at this in

973
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:07,775
Different

974
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,079
Is that what we're looking at here is a culture

975
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:12,895
Shared culture and similar language Maybe

976
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,943
Like blue jeans

977
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,503
You don't rock and roll and beer drinking I mean

978
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,295
It's something that spread

979
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:22,111
Sullivan prehistory to a bunch of different peoples

980
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,135
The

981
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:27,999
Foundation of which might have been in place since the last ice age if you think about it

982
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:31,071
And then overtime succeeding waves

983
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:37,471
A people and immigrants an in-memory and all that adds layers of spice to the original but when they do DNA test today

984
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:43,871
It's hard to not find lots of people who have been there since lots of DNA strands that have been there for a very long time much earlier

985
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:48,991
Did the Celtic era in history in fact maybe you could look at the entire Celtic.

986
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,039
In ancient history in Europe

987
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,319
As a fashion

988
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,879
Era right it's the era of bell bottoms

989
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:58,719
Cineeurope I mean this is an era where a certain culture dominated

990
00:47:59,231 --> 00:47:59,999
If you go

991
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,559
3000 years before it's not there

992
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:05,119
And after Caesar is mortally wounded

993
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:10,495
Truthfully even if Caesar is the one you could say mortally wounds

994
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,775
The Celtic culture

995
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,847
The Romans have been like Kryptonite

996
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:17,663
To this culture for a couple hundred years before Caesar

997
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,223
If you look at a map of where

998
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:26,623
Celtic culture predominates at the time that story happened we just told you the sack of Rome in 390 BCE and

999
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:29,183
Where it is after Caesar does what Caesar does

1000
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,207
It's

1001
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,743
Some kind of

1002
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,791
Terrible ethnic cleansing

1003
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:37,887
The Celtic culture stretch all the way from Portugal on one side

1004
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:41,471
Well I was going to say to the to the Balkans but truthfully there was a

1005
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:46,847
Treiber a group of tribes that that went all the way into modern-day turkey they were called the Galatians

1006
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,895
They're famous because

1007
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:51,711
A couple hundred years after they settle down and go for me

1008
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:55,039
Warner E2 on The Dan Carlin tribal scale

1009
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:59,903
They're up to a nine or a 10 in St Paul will be writing his famous letter to the Galatians

1010
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:08,351
They have found Celtic cultural remains up as far north as like Poland all around the Hungarian Plains

1011
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:14,751
Southern Germany modern Austria all the way into Northern Italy which is a real Celtic country for a while

1012
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,543
And of course all of modern day

1013
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:20,383
France and whether or not the British Isles and Ireland should fall into this

1014
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,663
Anybody's guess

1015
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,967
Why do people argue

1016
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,527
And let's remember before you send me an angry letter

1017
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:29,855
Account is a person who believes him or herself to be Celtic right

1018
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,135
My get-out-of-jail-free card

1019
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,951
I love the way

1020
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:38,303
Diodorus though diodorus siculus describe the Celts

1021
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,327
And by the way

1022
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,143
Most of these accounts come from the same guy supposed

1023
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,423
The eyewitness account

1024
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:50,079
I'm a person who is an expert in many different subjects one of the great figures of the ancient world whose writings have not come down to us

1025
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,615
A guy named posidonius

1026
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:58,783
But we don't have his exact work what we have is whatever he wrote down and put into the local libraries everybody else

1027
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,343
So we have his eyewitness accounts

1028
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,927
As Told through a bunch of other different people for example

1029
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:07,231
Diodorus siculus who says

1030
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:13,119
Of these Celtic people describing an ancient culture something National Geographic today would certainly be

1031
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:16,447
Cataloging all the time

1032
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:18,751
National Geographic Explorer of his day

1033
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,031
And through

1034
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:24,895
Diodorus siculus we here supposedly was posted in you saw when he visited Celts

1035
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,943
Diodorus rights quote

1036
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,015
The Gauls are tall of body

1037
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:32,575
With Rippling muscles and why does skin

1038
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:36,159
And their hair is blond and not only naturally so

1039
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:39,487
But they also make it there practice by artificial means

1040
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:42,815
To increase the distinguishing color which nature is giving it

1041
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:45,887
For they are always washing their hair in lime water

1042
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:50,751
And they pull it back from the forehead to the top of the head and back to the nape of the neck

1043
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:53,823
With the result that their appearance is like that of satyrs

1044
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:54,847
And pans

1045
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,919
Since the treatment of their hair makes it so heavy and coarse

1046
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,711
But it differs in no respect

1047
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,247
From the main of horses

1048
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,831
Some of them shave their beard but others let it grow a little

1049
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,623
And the noble shave their cheeks

1050
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:09,439
But they let the mustache grow until it covers the mouth

1051
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:10,719
And quote

1052
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:14,047
If you haven't looked at the wonderful art

1053
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:19,679
Pergamene art that includes this figure called the dying Gaul go take a look at it cuz it's beautiful

1054
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:26,335
But it describes sort of maybe a stereotype but maybe not the classic look of these people the Warriors and

1055
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,639
Anyway it's just described by diodorus

1056
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,431
They look like

1057
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:37,343
Punk rockers first of all with the haircut and you have to imagine the bleach blond hair that he just described there cuz that's what

1058
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,927
Put the lime water would have done with bleached it like bleach blonde hair and if you've ever had

1059
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:46,047
Like I have before the bleach blonde hair gets all horse mating like after a while

1060
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:52,703
So this figure in the artist sitting there with like wounds in its side and remember it's statue stone color so you have no color

1061
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:57,823
But you can see the blood dripping down and he's holding his wounds in the broken he gets a broken sword by his side

1062
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:01,151
He's also got a mustache though that's not very Punk of the time

1063
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:04,479
But the punk hair cut the mustache and the build is interesting because

1064
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:08,063
You know what's the difference between the modern weightlifting muscles today

1065
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:11,647
And the life natural muscles but he's muscular

1066
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:17,023
But also sort of sinewy and long and there was actually the ancient sources say that

1067
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,071
At least in the. We're talking about

1068
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,375
The a lot of these Celtic tribes had rules

1069
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:23,935
And they would fine Warriors if your belly

1070
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:28,799
Drooped over your belt line so they were required soda to be in shape supposedly

1071
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,151
This guy is heroic Lee new does it's called

1072
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:40,063
And it's hard to figure out cuz the Romans like portraying barbarians is heroically new but they sometimes by portraying themselves

1073
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:40,831
Ugly nude

1074
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,647
It's hard to figure out what to Convention and what's real

1075
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:47,231
And this may have had religious overtones or other things

1076
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,767
Going on nonetheless

1077
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:51,583
Some historical evidence to back up the hero within you.

1078
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,351
Concept

1079
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:55,423
But there are multiple incidents that

1080
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,191
Talk about

1081
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,983
Celtic warriors especially

1082
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:01,823
Select the groups of Celtic Warrior stripping off all their clothes

1083
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,895
And fighting absolutely nude except for a gold

1084
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:07,455
Torque around the neck which is just like a giant

1085
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:13,599
Armleder anklet or something I guess you would describe it so he's got no clothes on he's got the punk haircut he's got the mustache

1086
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,903
He looks about 6ft 5

1087
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,719
About 200 pounds of raw muscle and you know

1088
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:19,743
Naked

1089
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:20,767
With the talk around it

1090
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,583
I'm sorry visually it's

1091
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:29,727
Striking and Cool Whip and if not naked then you get those wonderful Celtic Fashions right supposedly the stripe

1092
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,263
Clothing the check

1093
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,031
Clothing

1094
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:34,847
We would call today the Plaid clothing

1095
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:38,175
They are wonderfully colorful

1096
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:42,783
Interesting cool people add to that the women she got the Celtic women

1097
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:45,855
Once again we get absolutely shafted by the fact that

1098
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:52,255
These Celts did not leave a historical written record that we could get their views on things and historian

1099
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,535
Scrappin

1100
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,583
Try to find any little piece that might

1101
00:53:55,839 --> 00:54:00,703
Help us to understand their personality better in their own words as opposed to hearing from people

1102
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:04,287
Often despise them certainly belittled them

1103
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:08,895
But I mean they thought for example in the Mediterranean the Celtic women were beautiful

1104
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,967
But I guess you could say maybe the way the

1105
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:15,039
You describe them today or their attitudes were that they were also

1106
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,319
Uppity

1107
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:21,951
And somewhat ferocious a memory I think sometimes in the descriptions it reminds me of the old stereotype

1108
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,743
And it's an old one now.

1109
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:30,143
Housewife in the henpecked husband in the housewife was kind of Burley and had a rolling pin in her hand would smack the husband upside the head

1110
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:30,911
Sometimes with it

1111
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:34,495
Among some of the people out there that

1112
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:39,103
Are sort of that that people that think of the Countess of a new age kind of thing there there's a

1113
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,967
A view out there that women were equal to men in these societies and Barry cunliffe among others

1114
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:45,503
Said that they miss

1115
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,271
Perception

1116
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,063
Because they're only

1117
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:53,439
More free than women in the Mediterranean are for example Greek and Roman women by comparison

1118
00:54:54,719 --> 00:55:00,863
So maybe a bit uppity by Greek and Roman standards but that's kind of points out the husband still has the power of life

1119
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,143
Death overs wife

1120
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,959
The law in most of these places allows the wife

1121
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:08,031
To be tortured to find out how husband died so

1122
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:11,615
Not exactly equal rights but maybe a bit uppity by

1123
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,407
Mediterranean standards

1124
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,431
I will say

1125
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:15,711
That the

1126
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:21,599
Ancient sources talk about these women is every bit as tall and strong and athletic at the men

1127
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:27,999
They talked about a society where there's more sexual freedom and these women have more freedom to be what the Greeks and the Romans were

1128
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,535
Consider to be promiscuous

1129
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,631
Certainly there are

1130
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,399
Famous

1131
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,423
Celtic women

1132
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:39,775
Warrior is maybe the most famous ever the warrior Queen Boudicca from the

1133
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,311
British tribes

1134
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:42,591
Remember

1135
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:46,943
These stories may not be true but they're playing to an audience

1136
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,479
And their stereo

1137
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:52,831
So if I told you the story about a particular Celtic Woman

1138
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:55,391
And you heard it and you said something like yep

1139
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,951
That sounds like what these Celtic Women are like

1140
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:58,719
Be careful

1141
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,999
Don't marry a celt

1142
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:01,791
When are you going

1143
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,071
A stereotype

1144
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,351
How much is

1145
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,887
That is true but that's the image

1146
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,423
And by the way

1147
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,959
You think of a fiery

1148
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:14,847
Irish redhead today in the stereotypes of mean when I grew up this is Maureen O'Hara in The Quiet Man

1149
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:17,919
Just give her a bow and arrow in an Axial Wraith Maybe

1150
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,943
Rolling pin

1151
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,479
And stay out of her way

1152
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,295
She could probably kick the hell out of you

1153
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:26,111
One of my favorite stories about

1154
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:26,879
Celtic women

1155
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,927
Is the one about

1156
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,743
Giumarra orquia Mars probe

1157
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:33,279
We closer to the right way to pronounce

1158
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,095
She was a

1159
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:40,703
Noblewoman not a queen or anything but a noblewoman of adulation try

1160
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:45,055
And when her try was conquered by the Romans she became a prisoner

1161
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:48,127
And here's the way diadoras tells the story

1162
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,967
I'm kiamara and her husband or tigon

1163
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:53,247
End

1164
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:59,647
Well mean the end message is clear right first of all the audience would listen to this and go yep that sounds like a Celtic woman to me

1165
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:00,927
The second one is

1166
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:03,487
They are not to be trifled with obviously

1167
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:05,791
Diodorus rights

1168
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,631
Just by the way the CH oldfather translation

1169
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,167
Quote

1170
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,983
Geomara the wife of or tigon

1171
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,799
Was captured along with the other galatian women

1172
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:19,103
When the Romans undergone a s Manlius

1173
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,151
Concord the Asiatic Galatians

1174
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:25,503
The century in responsible for her took advantage of his soldierly power

1175
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:26,527
And raped her

1176
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:30,623
This man was an ignorant Beast who loved both pleasure and money

1177
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:31,903
But in the end

1178
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,439
His love of money 1 hour

1179
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:38,303
With a large Ransom having been agreed upon he led her to a certain River

1180
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,607
Across from Agents of her own people

1181
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:43,935
The Galatians crossed over and gave him the money

1182
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,471
But after they did so

1183
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:48,799
Kiomara signal them to strike down the Centurion

1184
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,847
As he was making a friendly farewell

1185
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,639
One of our countrymen aubade

1186
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,919
And cut off his head

1187
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:57,503
She took the head wrapped it in her cloak and went home

1188
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:01,599
When she returned to her husband she threw the head down at his feet

1189
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,391
What kind of Dawn was amazed

1190
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,159
NSAID

1191
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,183
My wife

1192
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:07,231
It is important to deal honorably

1193
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:08,767
Yes she said

1194
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:13,119
But it is more important that only one man who has slept with me should remain alive

1195
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:14,911
And quote

1196
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:17,727
Dang

1197
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,543
Does Celtic Woman are fierce

1198
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:29,503
The sack of Rome by the Celtic peoples IS300 more than 300 years before the time.

1199
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:31,295
The best stories about today

1200
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:33,087
Take place in a lot has changed

1201
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:38,975
Many of the Celtic groups in other parts of Europe have been

1202
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:41,791
Pacified might be the way Caesar

1203
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,559
Would put it

1204
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,631
Brought under Roman control

1205
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,423
Their ability to

1206
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:49,983
Break out and cause destruction

1207
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:56,383
The nearby communities curtailed because if you look at the history of the Celts right after that battle of the Aaliyah we're Romans

1208
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:59,967
That's sort of their debut on the historical stage

1209
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:02,271
Like the way HG Wells

1210
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,551
But if he says

1211
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,319
The

1212
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:07,647
Northern people came down into the light of History

1213
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:09,439
For the first time with the Celts

1214
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,743
Peter berresford Ellis

1215
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:17,887
But this raises the Celts were the first European people north of the Alps to merge into recorded history

1216
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,935
Okay but that emergency

1217
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,471
Comes at the head of armies

1218
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:26,335
And those armies broke into various parts of Europe and cause wide-scale problems

1219
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,359
4 century

1220
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:33,247
275 they went down there smashed into Greece and cause all kinds of problems

1221
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:38,879
The Romans with fight them over and over and over again in various places

1222
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,927
Winning most losing some

1223
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:44,511
There would be a big battle

1224
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:50,399
The crushed Celtic power in a whole region called The Battle of telamon into 25 BCE

1225
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:54,495
And that one the famous account say that the problem for the Celts was

1226
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,519
They got trapped

1227
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:58,335
Between two Roman armies coming from different directions

1228
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:01,919
And the highlight of the battle if you like these sorts of things

1229
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:05,503
Is the Celtic Army supposedly if you believe the ancient sources

1230
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:07,295
Turning back to back

1231
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,575
So they could face

1232
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:11,135
Both armies attacking them at the same time

1233
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,671
Ferociously falling

1234
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:14,207
Basically you know almost

1235
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:14,975
Wiped out

1236
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:23,167
Then when Hannibal and his carthaginians happened in all these great Wars for survival you're the ancient version of World War II

1237
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,703
Breaks out

1238
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:28,543
Those of course being the world-famous Punic Wars of which there were

1239
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,311
For 3

1240
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,663
The Celtic peoples for the most part but not exclusively

1241
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:39,039
Bitter anywhere near by side with Hannibal and look at it there's a good way to get back at those Romans

1242
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:43,647
Which just makes them seem more dangerous treacherous and unreliable to the Romans

1243
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:50,815
After Hannibal's invasion of Italy is beating back you get a hundred years of Roman conflict with v

1244
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:51,839
Various Celtic

1245
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:52,607
Peoples

1246
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:57,215
Play the lead role but not necessarily the only one

1247
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:58,239
In

1248
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:01,311
Eliminating galatian freedom

1249
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:04,383
In Asia Minor in that area in the Balkans also

1250
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:08,991
Although the Galatians had made a lot of enemies and the

1251
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,527
Romans had plenty of help

1252
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,831
Most famously from one of the key

1253
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:13,599
Kings

1254
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:15,903
Fighting the Galatians where he invited

1255
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:18,975
The entire galatian leadership supposedly

1256
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:23,839
The story invites the galatian leadership to dinner and then Massacre is the mall while they're eating

1257
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,119
That's a good way

1258
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:26,399
2

1259
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:29,215
Devastate the command-and-control of your enemies

1260
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:34,847
The Celtic peoples of Northern Italy are defeated and absorbed by the Romans

1261
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:40,223
And that area will become so Roman so quickly they'll start calling that toga wearing Gaul

1262
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,551
The Romans will

1263
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:45,599
Before it's basically that's how they would

1264
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,623
The Conqueror

1265
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,927
A nice chunk of the south of France

1266
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,975
From the Celtic peoples there

1267
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:59,167
Because it controls Access Road access to Spain and they have to get to Spain now because after the Second Punic War

1268
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,447
There left there

1269
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:01,471
With a lot of

1270
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:02,239
Really

1271
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:04,799
Ferocious tribes of several different cultures

1272
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,615
Summer Celtic but some aren't

1273
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,663
Summer supposedly a mix

1274
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,711
What do you get when you cross a

1275
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:13,247
Belt with an Iberia

1276
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:14,527
Canterbury

1277
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,599
Raquel to Burien

1278
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:18,879
None the less

1279
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:25,535
The Romans will get involved in a war there that one might compare to a 200 year-long Vietnam

1280
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,303
War

1281
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:28,607
Gorillas fighting

1282
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,143
Atrocities

1283
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:31,935
Wholesale massacres

1284
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:36,543
And the disillusionment to summon roamed this ongoing

1285
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:40,895
Commitment that they had signed up for that was just raining there

1286
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:48,575
In about the year 1:15 BCE which is about 15 years before Julius Caesar

1287
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,343
Just birth

1288
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,391
Some tribe

1289
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,671
Appear

1290
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:55,743
From the north seemingly out of nowhere

1291
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:01,375
Their Origins are not understood even today

1292
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,399
By the way

1293
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:05,215
But their numbers are reportedly

1294
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:06,751
Outrageously large

1295
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:09,055
Once again we

1296
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,079
Filter out

1297
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:16,991
All of the exaggerations that have happened at the time and cents and still come to what we must suspect is a lot

1298
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,527
Larger than normal numbers

1299
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,551
It's one of the main thing

1300
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:20,575
Pointed out

1301
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:21,855
Continually

1302
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,671
Arguments persist

1303
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:26,207
On whether or not these people

1304
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,231
People should be called

1305
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:27,999
Dramatic

1306
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:29,535
Celtic

1307
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:31,583
Or a mix of the two because

1308
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,119
A lot of time

1309
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:33,887
Where

1310
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,167
Different

1311
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:38,495
Early European cultures come together there's like a

1312
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:40,031
A cultural SG

1313
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,567
Between them where they mix

1314
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:43,359
We already talked about Celtic Marion's art

1315
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,383
Bereans

1316
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,687
Caldo German

1317
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,223
Counter Thracians

1318
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,551
Barry, just one of those people

1319
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,343
Trying to point out two things about

1320
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,391
I'm talking about Celtic people one

1321
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:59,999
They're different all over the place Celtic peoples existing in what's now

1322
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:05,119
You know the modern-day area around the Adriatic or not necessarily going to be very much like the ones

1323
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:07,423
Your modern-day Portugal

1324
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,727
They're all kind of Celtic with

1325
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,007
Variations

1326
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:15,871
And also the time is elapsed in this idea that barbarians or so-called barbarians

1327
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,407
Are stuck in neutral

1328
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:19,199
Troll in terms of civilizational

1329
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:19,967
Or

1330
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:22,527
Political organizational

1331
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:23,807
Development

1332
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:30,207
Is wrong to they're all in different spots on the scale and all evolving and changing at different speeds

1333
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:34,303
Some of it based on how close you are to more sophisticated civilization

1334
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,119
In this case

1335
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,655
These people that

1336
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,423
They come down about

1337
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:42,751
At 1:15 BCE are always sort of portrayed

1338
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:46,847
As a 1 on The Dan Carlin tribal scale

1339
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:49,663
In the most Barbarian of the Barbarian

1340
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,967
Types and there's hundreds of thousands of them

1341
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:57,855
Not if you think about this as a national security problem with the Romans is interesting because even today

1342
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:00,671
If you could somehow sneak

1343
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:04,511
Let's just play with two hundred thousand as a round number

1344
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:07,327
200000 hostile people

1345
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:12,447
Right on the border of the United States so that when we wake up one morning there they are

1346
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:15,775
Were there there in a very short period of time

1347
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:18,079
That would still be a major crisis

1348
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:18,847
Today

1349
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,919
If that's how many people were talking about

1350
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:23,711
In this earlier era

1351
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:25,759
I don't know how they fed them

1352
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:30,879
But you can certainly see how you would have a situation on your hand with the first thing you thought of

1353
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,671
Where do these people come from

1354
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:35,231
The second thing you thought it was what are we going to do about them

1355
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:41,631
And the third thing you thought of his how do we prevent this from happening again if we don't know what to the north of us right with

1356
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:45,215
If we conquered everything next to us. We had a buffer zone

1357
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:51,615
And then these people from the north that we didn't even know about coming and smash right through our buffer zone and threaten Rome itself

1358
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:59,039
Between years 115 and about 100 BCE

1359
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:00,831
Teutons

1360
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,879
Gymboree

1361
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,415
And related tribes is there

1362
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,183
Are called

1363
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:11,327
Destroyed Roman army after Roman army I think the final grand total of something like for Roman armies

1364
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,911
They scare the heck out of everybody

1365
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:19,519
They March around seemingly going where they want to go and

1366
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:25,919
Doing what they want to do rating here in there into Roman territory out of Roman Territory go to Spain for a couple of years head on back to it

1367
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:26,687
Italy

1368
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:29,759
Finally in desperation Romans

1369
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:33,343
I put this guy in command we just finished mopping up

1370
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:39,743
Guerrilla warfare problems in what's now North Africa famous person in the entire Roman story named Gaius Marius

1371
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:40,767
Gaius Maro

1372
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:44,607
Andreas by the way

1373
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,655
Is the uncle by marriage

1374
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,935
Age of Julius Caesar

1375
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:54,335
He's a major player in the final stages of the death throes of the Roman Republic

1376
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:56,639
The begin to accelerate and pick up speed

1377
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:58,431
With his appearance on the scene

1378
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:03,807
One of the things that Mario's famously does before he fights the

1379
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,879
People that have already destroyed for Roman armies

1380
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:08,671
Is change the Roman army

1381
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:11,999
One of the benchmarks in Roman military history

1382
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,535
Something called the mauryan reform

1383
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:17,887
Now to be fair I've seen some writings out there and some thinking that

1384
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:21,727
How the guy gets way too much credit for this for what he did because of what he did

1385
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,519
These people would say

1386
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:27,359
Was simply codify informally institutional

1387
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,407
Is practices the Romans have been doing

1388
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,455
On an ad-hoc basis

1389
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:33,759
Improvisation Lee four-decade

1390
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:39,391
Feeling neither they came up anyway they could and that Marius was basically

1391
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:41,183
We're doing good

1392
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:43,487
To fill those needs let's just make that how we do it

1393
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:47,327
Turn the last I'd say most people still give

1394
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,351
Gaius Marius

1395
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,375
The 10 of credit for

1396
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:55,007
Taking the Roman the late Roman Republican Army and let's be honest and call it what it is

1397
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:58,335
Turning it into the Roman the first Roman Imperial

1398
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,663
Because it has Imperial Prov

1399
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:07,807
And trying to deal with Imperial problems with the Republican Army has been killing it now for some time

1400
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,575
Pan

1401
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,623
Damaging Society 2 in

1402
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,903
Spin off Waze

1403
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:15,743
Mary's opens up to Legions to everybody

1404
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:17,279
It's no longer based on

1405
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,815
How much land you own

1406
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:20,863
Farm your wealth anything like that

1407
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,143
And

1408
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,679
These people don't go home

1409
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:24,703
Denver fashion

1410
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,983
It's a permanent

1411
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:31,615
Now what this does is completely changed the institutional memory of

1412
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:34,175
The force is something most people don't think about

1413
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:36,479
But I mean the thing you lose the most

1414
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:37,759
When you send

1415
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:42,623
The citizen Army back home cuz the war's over is so much of what you learned

1416
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:48,767
And the cohesion that you gain from training together and how much math is your kid forget over the school summer

1417
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:50,559
Write the magnified that

1418
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:52,351
* 1000 I mean

1419
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,119
Bye

1420
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:55,423
Keeping an army together all the time

1421
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,727
Building experience as units

1422
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:01,311
Drilling continually and not stopping

1423
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:06,943
You are building capability and institutional memory so that 5 years from now

1424
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,479
Your cohort

1425
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:10,271
Is it going to be that much better

1426
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:14,623
These Roman armies are a huge leap forward

1427
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:16,159
In terms of effect

1428
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:19,743
Gymnast what they could do on the field and how much they outclassed

1429
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,023
The competition

1430
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,631
He then took this New Model Army

1431
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:26,655
Out and

1432
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,447
Proceeded to butcher

1433
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:30,751
The course of a couple years

1434
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,543
Both those tribes

1435
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,359
And their subsidiary friends that they brought with them

1436
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:43,295
The Butchery is supposed to be intense after all if you have these massive numbers are people which made these people so

1437
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:47,135
Particularly dangerous to begin with what happens to all of them

1438
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,415
If you don't kill them

1439
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:51,231
Bellum romanum right

1440
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,279
War the way the Romans did it

1441
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:56,607
Against people they consider to be Barbarian

1442
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:59,423
I read one story and said

1443
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:06,079
Some of the survivors of one of these battles were more than a hundred thousand were supposed to have been left dead on the battlefield

1444
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:12,479
They ran to a nearby Celtic tribal sanctuary and the Romans pursued him and told the kills to turn them over in the Celts turn demo

1445
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:14,015
Over they butchered him on the spot

1446
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:17,087
After one of these battles supposedly

1447
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:23,487
The peace terms for some of the people that were left over where the 300 of their married wives had to be sold to the Romans

1448
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:25,535
Slavery in the famous story

1449
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,303
The wiser

1450
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:29,119
Reportedly strangled each other to avoid that

1451
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:29,887
That fate

1452
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:35,519
Now at the time the chi is Marius is destroying these dramatic work

1453
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,567
Celtic or Celtic or Germanic

1454
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,591
Tribespeople

1455
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,895
Caesar's being born

1456
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:43,199
That's the time frame

1457
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:45,759
So there by the time Caesar is an adult

1458
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:47,295
Mature man

1459
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,599
Trying to argue about

1460
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:55,999
You know what you do about this problem we have with barbarians north of us he's able as are many other generals and politicians

1461
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:58,815
Directions to make use of this deep-seated fear

1462
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:05,471
Did the Romans have about a potential Invasion from the north one that goes all the way back to the sack of Rome in 390

1463
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,799
Here's the way history Nick

1464
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,567
Fields

1465
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:11,103
Explained

1466
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:13,151
What the memory of the

1467
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:15,711
Cambrian the two-tone Invasion degeneration

1468
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,479
4

1469
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:17,247
Mint

1470
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:19,039
To somebody trying to exploit

1471
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:19,807
Fears

1472
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,855
In the Rome of the 50

1473
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,903
He's BCE he writes quote

1474
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:27,743
The vivid memory of the near-disaster remain however

1475
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:34,399
And served as a frightening reminder to Rome that a new Northern Barbarian threat could suddenly emerge

1476
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,167
Anytime

1477
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:38,495
Barbarian migrations were the stuff of Roman nightmare

1478
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:42,079
And Caesar made good use of it by playing up the

1479
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:45,407
Quote and quote Germanic Menace in his writing

1480
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:46,943
More to the point

1481
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:47,711
He writes

1482
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:54,111
He also had the wit to revive fears of the Gauls that dated from the sack of Rome in 390 BC

1483
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:54,879
Eazy-E

1484
01:11:55,135 --> 01:12:01,279
And advertise them as a race without civilization who are not above Burning Alive their prisoners of

1485
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:02,047
War

1486
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,583
And quote

1487
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:05,887
So in effect

1488
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,167
The

1489
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,471
Near disaster against these

1490
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:13,311
Tribes peoples that were sprung on the Romans unexpectedly

1491
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,895
Was to deepen widen and reopen

1492
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:19,199
A scar that maybe you could

1493
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,223
Say it been

1494
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:22,527
A piece of the Roman

1495
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:26,367
Psychological reality since at least 390 BC

1496
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,391
And

1497
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,159
You know as

1498
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:30,463
Early Roman writers kind of said

1499
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:33,023
There's a belief that wrong sort of

1500
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:35,583
Conquered an Empire

1501
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:36,863
In self-defense

1502
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:41,471
I think it was Olivia where we going through that version of that line out there Conquering the world and self

1503
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:42,239
Defense

1504
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:48,895
What is other historians put it on a red one that he got a great lie he pointed out that look at Rome is looking for secure borders and security

1505
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:53,503
And the problem is is that everytime they conquer a new unstable region

1506
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:56,831
And pacify it thinking that okay now we're safe over there

1507
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:58,623
They inadvertently create

1508
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,903
A new frontier

1509
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:02,719
Whatever the kingdom they just conquered

1510
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:08,351
And whatever their neighbor was is now Roman neighbor and it's another unstable Frontier so they keep getting sucked

1511
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:10,143
Farther away from the center

1512
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:12,959
As they continually try to make sure that they're safe

1513
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:15,263
Not sure I buy that

1514
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:19,615
There's a whole lot of wealth and money and all kinds of other things involved here

1515
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:23,455
That explain things at least as well as the idea that we're just trying to

1516
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,223
U-Save

1517
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:27,807
If I were a super Roman Patriot like Livy

1518
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:33,439
Maybe that's how I would defend the conquest of the world myself we just trying to be safe anybody do it

1519
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:36,767
Patricia Lee the biggest threat to Rome

1520
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:40,607
In the fifties when Caesar is a mature man

1521
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,911
Playing his role in the

1522
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:44,703
Decline and fall of the Roman Republic

1523
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:49,823
The biggest danger to Rome is no outside force its inside

1524
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:55,967
It's tearing itself apart and reaching the boiling point in a story that is well-known

1525
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:59,551
Impacts this story only obliquely

1526
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:06,207
But if you believe Caesar and by the way there's some confirmation from Cicero and some other places

1527
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:10,559
Rooms. The only place reaching the political boiling point

1528
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,863
Instability looming

1529
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:16,703
Apparently Galls in terrible shape that way as well

1530
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:21,055
It's 63 62 or 61

1531
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,079
BCE

1532
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:29,503
A member of one of the more powerful influential garlic tribes a try which by the way is a friend of the Roman people

1533
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:32,831
Diplomatic designations of a kind of like a light

1534
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:38,975
Shows up to inform the Roman senate about something that's been going on deeply in

1535
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:40,767
The heartland of his territory

1536
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:46,399
Because the Romans don't know we know they know what's going on in nearby call but sometimes you get to the

1537
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:51,519
Barbarian Heartland and they find out when people tell them and that's what this guy is there to do

1538
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:53,823
His name is the biggest

1539
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:56,383
Then he is we are to

1540
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:58,431
About to

1541
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:03,039
Closest thing I'm ever going to find in a historical situation

1542
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:06,111
2 King Arthurs

1543
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:07,135
Merlin

1544
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,439
We are told

1545
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:11,231
The Deepika shoes

1546
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:12,767
Is a druid

1547
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:15,071
And the Heat

1548
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,863
Can see the future

1549
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:20,191
Now wiggle side note here

1550
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:22,239
The Druids are

1551
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,543
One of the wonderfully famous

1552
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:28,639
Very compelling sides of the whole Celtic

1553
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:29,407
Culture

1554
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:32,479
It's connected to the religious side

1555
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:35,807
They have been called all sorts of things

1556
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:38,111
Generally thought of to be the priest

1557
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:40,159
The Celtic religion but

1558
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:42,463
So many other titles and

1559
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:49,119
Positions are mentioned on the good side the admirable side the Civilized side you'll hear them called teachers

1560
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,703
Supposedly you were not allowed

1561
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:57,567
Write down Druid acknowledged and so it was twenty years of study for

1562
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:59,615
At the light to become a druid

1563
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,663
They're a little

1564
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:04,479
Leica philosophers to in the Merrifield

1565
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:06,015
Cicero

1566
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:11,903
I think he calls him a philosopher philosophy there was something is often attributed to the Missus Celtic philosophy

1567
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:14,975
They are also called judges

1568
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:19,071
And if for example if you have a murder trial or something going on you'll take it to a druid for

1569
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:20,095
Adjudication

1570
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:23,167
Most of the modern archaeologists

1571
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:29,055
And people like that that I've read seem to think it's a pretty good bet that The Druids are sort of the intellectual

1572
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:30,335
Will class of golf

1573
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:31,359
If you will

1574
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:34,431
Study things like astronomy

1575
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:36,735
Herblore

1576
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,015
They make

1577
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:39,551
BV oral

1578
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:42,367
Traditionalist in historians of their people

1579
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:46,719
Acronym called natural scientist before

1580
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:50,559
And the magic that they're supposed to use if it if indeed magic it is

1581
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:51,583
Is soda

1582
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:52,863
Nature magic

1583
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:53,631
If you will

1584
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,935
They're like Gandalf

1585
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:59,007
Or Dumbledore but it's all nature

1586
01:16:59,263 --> 01:16:59,775
Magic

1587
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:04,639
Caesar and Cicero on the people who do mention Druids

1588
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:06,943
Seem to have quite a lot of respect for them

1589
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:07,711
There is a

1590
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:10,015
Course also the more lurid

1591
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,831
Side of it where it's more

1592
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:17,951
I can to chamonix Medicine Man and maybe even witchdoctors when you get to that stage

1593
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:25,887
They are supposedly the kind of people that if not conducting it or supposed to be there for legal reasons

1594
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:32,543
The human sacrifices that the Celts are supposed to participate in or at least once did unclear

1595
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:36,383
Whether or not by Caesars time they still do much about all those Caesars the one

1596
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:38,943
Dimensions the Wicker man himself

1597
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,223
You've heard of that

1598
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:41,759
When haven't you the one where they build

1599
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:45,343
The giant Hollow see-through wicker figure

1600
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:48,671
Imagine something like 20ft 30ft tall

1601
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:52,511
Wicker but with holes in it so you could see inside the Nae fill it with people

1602
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:57,375
Caesar says they prefer criminals and convicts but they're not picky if they run out of those

1603
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,679
And then maybe throw in some other live animals

1604
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:02,495
Hey and other combustibles unlike the whole thing on fire

1605
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:06,847
And supposedly The Druids have to be around to witness that

1606
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:10,687
Another thing you'll hear blamed on The Druids or the class right below them

1607
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:14,783
Is of a certain form of divination where you stab somebody

1608
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:17,343
And then you look at the convulsions as they're dying

1609
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:19,391
That explains what's going on

1610
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:22,463
The funny thing about the ancient world

1611
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:28,351
Is that the Romans can sit there and scoff at these Barbarian superstitions and all that kind of stuff

1612
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:31,935
Leslie so-called Superior culture looking down on the

1613
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:34,239
Childlike superstitious natives

1614
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:38,335
But then at the same time make sure to point out that listen if you ever need

1615
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:41,151
A flock of birds analyzed for what

1616
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:46,783
The movements of the flock of birds means and then how that foretells the future the Celts are the best in the business.

1617
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:48,319
Another word showing

1618
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:52,415
Yeah that one person Superstition is another person's magic and vice versa

1619
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:54,207
I remember

1620
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:59,327
Getting a great piece of advice from one of my professors ones and how to see the ancient world differently

1621
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:03,167
Cuz we were talking about something he said what about the impact of magic

1622
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:09,311
And it was long pauses my brain trying to figure out the proper answer to that I said well there's no such thing as magic

1623
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,103
He says I know that

1624
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,383
And you know that

1625
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:16,479
But the people in the story didn't know that and they believed otherwise

1626
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:19,807
And because they believe these things to be real and true

1627
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:22,879
It impacts reality cuz they act upon those beliefs

1628
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:31,071
Play give me a call at the Tinkerbell effect or something but the idea was similar to because you believe in this as reality ubass

1629
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:33,887
Your moves and how you behave on that

1630
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,935
And if that changes real history

1631
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:40,287
Nonetheless this guy dipika shifts

1632
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:46,431
Was there to explain to the Romans that a terrible battle have occurred in the deep dark Barbarian country

1633
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:52,831
There must have been thousands upon thousands of these battles throughout history don't you think these ones that happened

1634
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:58,207
You were great Deeds were performed an amazing things occur but they happened in the Deep darkness of

1635
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:02,559
Prehistory somewhere between tribal people you don't know anything about him unless somehow

1636
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:03,583
They come to light

1637
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:07,679
So there's this battle that you can look up now that exist that's real

1638
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:09,727
Call the Battle of megiddo Borgata

1639
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:16,384
But you know about it because this guy this Druid showed up to explain to the Romans that his people lost that battle

1640
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:23,040
It was against one of their traditional Celtic enemies and again we think of Native American tribes were there were just tribes

1641
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:25,344
That were long-standing enemies of

1642
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,112
Each other

1643
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:26,880
Right

1644
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,416
Long-standing

1645
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:29,696
Crow

1646
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:30,976
And Lakota

1647
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,000
Perfect example

1648
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:38,400
Apache and Comanche when you didn't matter what you did they would Ally with an outside power to go against them rather than

1649
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:41,216
Reunite with their historic enemies in this case

1650
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:45,568
It may have been a war that was over trade rights

1651
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:49,664
I could charge tolls on this area of a river and it's something really been all like that

1652
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:51,712
But in this battle the Celtic tribe

1653
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,480
Fighting

1654
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:55,296
The Druid who showed up and Rome's people

1655
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:56,832
Brought in outside help

1656
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:59,392
They had solicited

1657
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:01,952
The assistants on some German

1658
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:04,512
Certainly some of these tribes

1659
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:06,560
Did Caesar called German

1660
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:11,424
Let's be honest the Roman ethnographers are little bit sloppy and sometimes they just have their all

1661
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:14,240
Raquel Studio look the same those barbarians

1662
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:16,288
This is the story

1663
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,056
Right there

1664
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:21,664
Germans and they come in and they tipped the scales in favor of this other tribe

1665
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:27,296
Leading to divock ashes tribe getting decimated on the battlefield and if you believe him

1666
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:29,088
The nobility Massacre

1667
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:30,624
Do you lose basically

1668
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,160
Your entire aristocratic

1669
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:33,952
Class in the stroke

1670
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:35,232
Of a sort

1671
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,024
Or a bunch of swords

1672
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:43,424
Destroying basically is pleading for help from his allies the Romans and pointing out

1673
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:47,264
The entire area is destabilize because these Germans who came in to help

1674
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,544
Discounted tribe

1675
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:52,640
Decided that they don't want to leave they like it and go they're going to stay and

1676
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:53,664
That's

1677
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,456
Causing a domino effect

1678
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:59,040
As they become the neighbors of all the Celtic people around them

1679
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:00,832
All of a sudden

1680
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,672
Call seems extremely d-stabilized & Decker

1681
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:10,048
Proved to be a very dangerous situation in Rome it could also prove to be extremely profitable

1682
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:11,840
And a potential opportunity

1683
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:12,864
In fact

1684
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:16,192
There's a way of looking at the story in a lot of people do

1685
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:19,264
That this is Julius Caesar's account

1686
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,312
And what's going on in golf

1687
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:25,664
And making it seem like a destabilize national security threat

1688
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:28,480
Is something that works out in his favor

1689
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:32,320
If he's trying to build a case for why he should go in

1690
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,600
Fictional

1691
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:40,768
And as far as theories about Wyatt broken in the first place why are they having all this

1692
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,840
Destabilization will Caesar has a theory

1693
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:45,632
And even though it's impossible to

1694
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:46,400
Approve

1695
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:52,800
It's one of those lenses that you can look at this whole thing through this rather interesting but it brings up other question

1696
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,104
I'd like to point out

1697
01:22:55,872 --> 01:23:01,248
The only reason I'm qualified to discuss this is because I don't have a reputation as a historian to protect

1698
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,528
Every now and then

1699
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:05,856
Mopping historian works out in my favor doesn't it

1700
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,392
In this case

1701
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:09,184
It allows me to examine

1702
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:14,560
Things that used to be valid theories once upon a time until they required things like

1703
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:16,608
You know supporting evidence for

1704
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:20,448
For valladares Once Upon a Time in Costa Rica to listen to Caesar said this happened

1705
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:21,472
And without

1706
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:25,056
Something that makes me think he's a liar I'm going to believe him if you do that

1707
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:28,384
Here's how you can explain the instability in Gaul

1708
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,152
Remember

1709
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:32,736
This guy has a vested interest in convincing you

1710
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:35,040
Gall needs his help

1711
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:41,440
But the way the story is told by Caesar and other earlier historians

1712
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:43,488
Is that the reason

1713
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:49,888
The Celts are having some problems in that that whole area of Gaul most of which is still outside of Roman control the time

1714
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:50,656
Having problems

1715
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:53,472
Is because slowly but surely

1716
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:56,032
Due to the infusion of

1717
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:59,872
In a Roman and Greek and Mediterranean luxuries and culture and whatever

1718
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:03,456
These cats are getting for lack of a better word

1719
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:04,480
Saw

1720
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,064
Cesar by the way

1721
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:09,856
2 wine

1722
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:10,880
More than once

1723
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:11,648
Does the

1724
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,208
Leading softening agent involved

1725
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:21,376
And actually says that some tribes prohibit the importation of Italian wine for just that reason that

1726
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:22,912
Is known to take the edge off

1727
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,008
The Celts were saddled with the same

1728
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,848
Reputation as drunkards that you often see

1729
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:34,432
Associated with other tribal peoples Native Americans for example affect the liver

1730
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:35,200
For that stereotype

1731
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:35,968
My forever

1732
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,320
Our friend diodorus siculus said this about them

1733
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:44,416
This by the way these CH oldfather translation of the work

1734
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:45,696
Quote

1735
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:48,768
The Gauls are crazy for wine

1736
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:53,376
And consume unwatered amazing amount imported by merchants

1737
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:57,728
Their unrestrained consumption often leads them to fall into a drunken stupor

1738
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:59,776
We're sinking Tim a roast depression

1739
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:02,080
Therefore many italian merchants

1740
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:05,408
Seagal is the land of opportunity for quick riches

1741
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:08,224
These Traders bring the wine by boat on the river

1742
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:10,272
And by wagon through the plane

1743
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:12,576
Immature and they make an amazing profit

1744
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:16,416
Were they receive a slave in return for each jar of wine they deliver

1745
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:18,464
And quote

1746
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:21,280
When I was growing up

1747
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:24,608
There was a widespread belief among Native American

1748
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:25,888
Group themselves

1749
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,216
That the importation of alcohol had done damage

1750
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:31,008
2D traditional culture

1751
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,824
It would not be surprising at all if that happened

1752
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,616
Among the Gauls as well

1753
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:38,432
In the case of wine

1754
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:39,712
Specifically

1755
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:42,272
It designed to take the edge off

1756
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:47,136
People drinking for that reason here's the problem what if that edge

1757
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:49,952
Is required to survive in a world

1758
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:51,488
That is

1759
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:55,328
Basically dog-eat-dog in geopolitical terms

1760
01:25:56,864 --> 01:26:00,448
If Only the strongest survive is what if you have your people

1761
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:04,544
Being impacted by your proximity to a

1762
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:07,616
Luxury field culture nearby

1763
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:12,992
Who is weakening you in a way they will eventually cause you to lose everything

1764
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:14,272
To somebody

1765
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:18,368
What if you're taking the edge off

1766
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:21,696
And the Ferocious tribe next to Yuan

1767
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:26,560
In this case those tribes were called by the Romans that you get Hermione

1768
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:33,728
Often translated to German today but whether or not they're related to modern-day Germans is just as contentious

1769
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:37,824
Discussion is whether or not cancer related to modern-day peoples in the regions where

1770
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:39,360
They used to be

1771
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:43,968
These Germans are portrayed

1772
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:45,248
As

1773
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:47,040
Like hyenas

1774
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:52,160
Ready to pounce on any weak animal in the geopolitical heard

1775
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:54,208
Portrayed as rough

1776
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:57,280
They're nasty

1777
01:26:57,792 --> 01:27:00,608
And they're interfering in the Celtic World in a way

1778
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:07,008
That threatens if you believe Caesars account and of course his War commentaries are told from the point-of-view of Darth Vader

1779
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:08,800
And this is his

1780
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:11,872
Excuse for getting involved in this whole thing

1781
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:18,528
Is that these Germans are destabilizing the whole region and this is what this Druid comes to Rome to say and he's asking for

1782
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:20,320
For helping in a couple of years

1783
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:22,112
Caesar comes to help

1784
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,184
And you want to have that

1785
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:29,024
Star Wars music start playing the ominous kind because

1786
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:33,632
Caesar's going to stop the Warfare in the region

1787
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:39,008
But he's going to do it anyway that you could easily make a case should be called the celt

1788
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:39,776
How to call the cops

1789
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:47,456
Now the idea of any society getting soft is impossible to quantify

1790
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:49,760
Falls into that category we discussed earlier but

1791
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:50,784
What is human qualities

1792
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:54,624
Historians have to steer clear of because you can't make any sort of case if no data

1793
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,928
100 years ago

1794
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:03,584
The wonderful professorial military historian hands dalebrook had no problem laying it out you in a way

1795
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,608
But he treated this

1796
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:05,888
In scientific

1797
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,936
You couldn't say this today

1798
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:09,216
But it sets up this

1799
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,544
They're fun idea I want to throw out the RISD foolish

1800
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,312
History

1801
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:16,640
A hundred years ago actually back in 1908

1802
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:17,920
Brook Road

1803
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:18,944
About this

1804
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:19,712
Questionable

1805
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:24,064
Civilization versus barbarism in terms of the military Pros

1806
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,344
Kanji said quote

1807
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:27,392
When modern peoples

1808
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:30,208
It means the people in his era 1908

1809
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,768
Come into conflict with barbarians

1810
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:37,120
The outcome is determined from the start by the differences in weapons technology

1811
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:40,448
In Antiquity this relationship was not so simple

1812
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:42,496
Here we may wonder he writes

1813
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:47,360
In what Manner the Roman military system was really Superior to that of the Barbarian

1814
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:48,640
Visa ve

1815
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:50,176
Civilized people

1816
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:56,576
Barbarians have the advantage of having at their disposal the warlike power of unbridled animal instinct

1817
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:58,368
A basic toughness

1818
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:01,696
Civilization refines the human being he writes

1819
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:03,488
Making him more sensitive

1820
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:06,560
And in doing so it decreases his military worth

1821
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:08,864
Not only his bodily strength

1822
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,656
But also his physical courage

1823
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:15,264
These natural shortcomings must be offset in some artificial way

1824
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:17,312
Scharnhorst he writes

1825
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:21,408
What's perhaps the first one to state that the main service of the standing army

1826
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:23,968
Consisted of making civilized people

1827
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:28,064
Through discipline capable of holding their own against the less civilized

1828
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:34,720
If a given group of Romans normally living as Citizens are peasants had been put up against a group of barbaria

1829
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:36,000
Games of the same number

1830
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:41,888
The former would have undoubtedly have been defeated in fact they probably would have taken flight without fighting

1831
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:45,984
It was only the formation of the close-knit Tactical body of the cohort

1832
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,032
Equalize the situation

1833
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,312
And quote

1834
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:52,640
It's an old idea

1835
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:54,432
Brightest civilization

1836
01:29:54,688 --> 01:30:00,832
Allows you to compensate for what you lose when you give up that whole Warrior Society

1837
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:05,184
I remember the military trade-off

1838
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,488
For losing this Barbarian Edge

1839
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:09,024
It's supposed to be

1840
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:10,816
You have the ability to control

1841
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:12,864
Troops with officers in

1842
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:14,656
Instill drill

1843
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:18,240
An organization in the logistical ability to concentrate

1844
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:22,080
In a food and supplies and keep armies in the field all those wonderful benefits

1845
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:24,384
But what if you get hit

1846
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:31,808
You know when you've lost the Barbarian Edge part but you haven't quite gained the benefits of civilization yet what if you get hit when your

1847
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:32,832
Korean translation

1848
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,624
At the vulnerable

1849
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:35,904
Point between

1850
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:42,560
The two kinds of approaches I mean for example have you ever heard what A BMC is when your ship is being to to the Sea

1851
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:46,656
It means a ship is getting hit broadside with the wave

1852
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:49,472
That's a really dangerous thing that happy you want to have your

1853
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:52,032
Your nose pointed or your Stern pointed

1854
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:54,592
But you don't want to be sideways on the big waves

1855
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:56,640
But if you have to turn around

1856
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:57,664
In the sea

1857
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:03,040
Didn't we that danger point one for a second your side onto the waves I wonder if one could make a case

1858
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:04,576
And some of these

1859
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:06,368
Celtic tribes in Gaul

1860
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:07,392
Heaven

1861
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:11,488
Contacted by the Romans enough to be semi civilized

1862
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,560
Which doll their Barbarian Edge against

1863
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:16,864
They're less civilized Neighbors

1864
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,680
Without yet providing the benefits

1865
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:20,960
30 more

1866
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:24,800
Centralized urbanized State like systems have

1867
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:27,872
The Celts got caught in a BMC

1868
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:31,968
And to be fair this is not

1869
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:32,736
My ID

1870
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:39,136
Yeah my idea to knock off of the very one seizures proposing here to he's talking about the beam CID

1871
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:40,928
In different terms

1872
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:46,304
The problem is is if you're trying to defend this from a historical Viewpoint how do you do it

1873
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:52,704
And there's no doubt at all that historians are a thousand percent right when they say the teacher classic

1874
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:56,800
Recurring themes in ancient literature that the audience expected

1875
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:58,080
Absolutely correct

1876
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:02,432
But does that mean that you can automatically rule out all of them

1877
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:07,552
Is what Caesar says here so implausible and if so does Caesar know it

1878
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,624
Is he deliberately trying to lie to us

1879
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:15,488
Or is he just misconstruing things because of his own biases from his own era

1880
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:21,120
Can any case The BMC idea may not be quite originally mine

1881
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:22,144
I'm just

1882
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:25,984
Academically safe enough cuz I don't have any credentials at all

1883
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:28,032
To be able to suggest that maybe

1884
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:29,312
There's more to it

1885
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:30,848
Pain is often

1886
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:33,152
Acknowledge these days

1887
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:36,992
Caesar in his War commentaries

1888
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:38,784
Explains several times

1889
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:41,344
That certain tribes used to be

1890
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,160
More feared and more tough and now weren't

1891
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:45,696
In other words implying that they

1892
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:49,536
Movement on the softness vs. toughness scale

1893
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:54,912
What he doesn't really tell us because maybe it's

1894
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:55,936
Common knowledge

1895
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:57,472
Is how advanced

1896
01:32:57,728 --> 01:33:02,848
Some of these garlic tribes were including the one that this Druid if it gets just came from

1897
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:04,640
This is the way history naydra

1898
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:05,408
Goldsworthy's

1899
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:06,944
Explain sort of the system

1900
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:13,600
In Gaul which is hard to describe because it has so many different tribes and all these tribes are in different states of

1901
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:14,624
Development in fact

1902
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:18,976
The most advanced of the maybe shouldn't be called tribes at all

1903
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:21,024
But is gold worthy explains

1904
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:27,424
What do you call him States or tribes neither one of those words is a good translation for the Latin that sees

1905
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:29,728
Pictures of a gold

1906
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:31,776
Tuition after explains

1907
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:32,800
Is Gaul

1908
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:34,080
Is essentially organized

1909
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:36,384
In tribe divided into Clans but

1910
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,920
Call someone who states quote

1911
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:41,760
The basic political unit was the Klan

1912
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:44,320
And several of these usually made up a try

1913
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:45,600
I give the Latin word

1914
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:49,952
By the way and then he said that neither English word is entirely appropriate

1915
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:55,328
And some Scholars would prefer state to tribe but no one has really come up with anything better

1916
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:56,608
Ethan says quote

1917
01:33:56,864 --> 01:34:02,240
The importance of the tribe seems to have increased markedly in the century before Caesars arrival in golf

1918
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:06,080
And some Scholars would like to see them is comparatively recent inventions

1919
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:07,616
More probably

1920
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:14,016
The changing political and economic climate in Gaul had simply given new importance to loose ties of

1921
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:15,552
The kinship and ritual

1922
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:17,088
They were very long established

1923
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,880
Even so he writes

1924
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:23,744
The degree of unity between the clans of One Tribe very considerably

1925
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:26,560
And there were a number of cases during the gallic wars

1926
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:29,376
We need to visual Clans acted independently

1927
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:34,496
Kings appear in some tribes and perhaps also with the clan level but not in others

1928
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:36,544
And the majority meaning of majority

1929
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:37,568
Groups

1930
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:40,384
Seem to have been governed by councils or Senate

1931
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:44,736
With day-to-day running of Affairs being placed in the hands of elected magistrates

1932
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:48,064
Rome's oldest Ally the Eataly

1933
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:48,832
Just wear this

1934
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:50,112
Drew it was from

1935
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:53,184
Add a supreme magistrate called the vertebrate

1936
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,232
Who held office for a single year

1937
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:58,304
No man could be elected twice to this post

1938
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:01,888
Nor can any member of his family hold the office during his lifetime

1939
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:05,728
Thus preventing any individual or group from monopolizing power

1940
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:10,336
The similarity of this ideal to the Roman Republic system is striking

1941
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:11,616
And in many ways

1942
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:15,456
The tribes of Gaul resemble the city-states of the Mediterranean world

1943
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:18,272
So perhaps in an earlier stage of development

1944
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:19,552
Ndk

1945
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:23,136
That's a really

1946
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:25,952
Good concise way to explain that situation

1947
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:29,536
And there are books written about seizures book

1948
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:33,376
And more on this in a second cuz that's what we're going to follow and get into

1949
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:40,032
That describes his rationale for arguing about why we have to have this conflict against the Gauls now

1950
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:43,360
White have to be pre-emptive as opposed to waiting until they all attack us

1951
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:47,200
And he says it's because Caesar is making the argument

1952
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:50,528
Did some of these tribes are becoming more like us

1953
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:54,880
And we have to get them before they do cuz they're going to leave then combine

1954
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:55,904
You know the

1955
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:57,440
Warlike

1956
01:35:58,208 --> 01:36:01,024
Irrationality that they have now in their spirit

1957
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:02,560
With greater capability

1958
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:04,608
Which by the way is a

1959
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:08,704
Reason that some historians give for why the Germanic peoples

1960
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:13,568
You know fast forward to the fall of Rome will eventually be able to defeat the Roman Legions

1961
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:16,640
But they will learn enough fighting the Romans over time

1962
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:19,200
And develop enough of a state like system

1963
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:20,992
That they could truly be dangerous

1964
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:27,136
Andrew M riggsby in his book Caesar in Gaul and Rome war in words

1965
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:30,208
Points out that Caesar's argument in his book

1966
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:34,048
Is it we have to get the Gauls now before they do precisely that

1967
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:37,120
He says that in Caesars work

1968
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:39,168
And as part of the propaganda

1969
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:43,776
The people he called Gauls and people he called German serve different purposes

1970
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:46,080
Rigby rights quote

1971
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:51,200
In the same way the two Northern groups are dangerous for complementary reason

1972
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:54,528
In the case of the German the problem is their fluidity

1973
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:56,832
The people who do not recognize boundaries

1974
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:58,624
Social Geographic

1975
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:02,976
Cannot be trusted to stay in their own territory and to not make war on the Romans

1976
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:04,256
With the Gauls

1977
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:06,304
The problem is not randomness

1978
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,120
But I'm more specific tendency to wage war

1979
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,912
They are prone to fighting

1980
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:12,960
Both individually and collectively

1981
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:16,544
Their temerity makes them unable to check violent impulses

1982
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:19,104
Even when that would be the prudent course of action

1983
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:23,456
Whatever the source of danger the Romans will respond preemptively

1984
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:25,760
As chapter 6 discusses he writes

1985
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:29,344
This is an important source of justification for military actions

1986
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:34,464
Furthermore the semi civilized Galls provide a special kind of threat

1987
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:38,048
Their similarity to the Romans grows over the course of the war

1988
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:41,632
If they are not conquered now the threat will only increase

1989
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:44,448
Answer the preemptive strike is required now

1990
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:47,264
The characterization of both peoples he writes

1991
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,056
Legitimizes their Conquest

1992
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:51,360
The specific nature of the Gauls

1993
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:53,664
Make them particularly attractive candidates

1994
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:54,944
And quote

1995
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:59,296
Why would Caesar want to conquer them

1996
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:00,576
Oh yes

1997
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:04,160
That gets us to some of the problems that motivate

1998
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:09,024
This story to push it along the add the booster Rockets to the whole thing because

1999
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:11,072
I mean let's be honest

2000
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:14,400
What's the likelihood that is Rome becomes more powerful

2001
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:17,472
It doesn't absorb these tribal areas to their North

2002
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:23,360
That's like saying that you could expect somehow via treaties in good faith and everything else

2003
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:29,504
The 13 u.s. colonies to just stayed over where they were on the Eastern Seaboard and never Advanced into the

2004
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,296
Native territory

2005
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:33,344
That's a what if

2006
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,368
But you can hardly

2007
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:35,136
Even

2008
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:37,952
Plausibly play with right and what's the likelihood

2009
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:39,232
What's the likelihood

2010
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:41,024
The Romans don't absorb

2011
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:43,840
These tribes to the north and Conquer that territory

2012
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:46,400
Because the money that is available

2013
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:50,240
Inland and let's not forget this cuz it's huge

2014
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:51,264
Slaves

2015
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:53,056
Is so tempting

2016
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:56,128
And Caesars need is so great at this time

2017
01:38:56,896 --> 01:39:00,992
That is impossible to imagine that that giant pot of gold but is Gaul

2018
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:04,832
Wouldn't be taken by somebody in the attitude that these Romans had in it

2019
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:07,136
Part of something we discussed in another program

2020
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:10,464
This insane and yet wonderfully

2021
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,768
Merit-based system

2022
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:18,912
Will you call your way to the top like it's a mafia crime family and Only the Strong Survive

2023
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:21,984
Head created by this time in Roman history

2024
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:25,312
A three-headed monster that's what the Romans called it

2025
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:30,688
We know what is the first triumvirate today and essentially what it is is a conspiracy

2026
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:33,248
One of the great conspiracies in all world history

2027
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:37,856
It is Caesar and the other two most powerful men in Rome and their

2028
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:39,904
Allies essentially

2029
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:41,952
Against the rest of the Roman governor

2030
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:48,864
And they are so powerful and they control so many people and one of these guys in this 3-headed Monsters the richest man in Rome

2031
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:51,424
He sprayed money everywhere and that makes a huge difference that

2032
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:55,520
By this time. As long as these three men Caesar

2033
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:58,336
Pompey and Crassus agree on something it's going to happen

2034
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:01,408
All three men want something

2035
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:04,480
So all three men support each man getting what they want

2036
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:07,040
What Caesar wants is a chance

2037
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:08,320
To conquer something

2038
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,624
He is the least

2039
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:13,696
Grand this time. Of those three people

2040
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:18,816
He doesn't have a whole lot of military conquest to his record or his name yet

2041
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:24,960
And he owes so much money that one point we're told he's not even allowed to leave Rome the creditors basically grab him

2042
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:31,360
Either you're paying up or you're not going anywhere and Crassus one of the members of the three-headed monster the rich guy comes in and

2043
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:34,176
Pays off the debt so seizure can go and do what he needs to do

2044
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:36,480
We just find a way to get the money

2045
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:37,760
To pay off the debts

2046
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:39,808
And also

2047
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:42,112
To spread it around in Rome

2048
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:48,512
To make more friends because these politicians and that's what Caesar is there deadly politicians their politician generals

2049
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:54,656
But spreading money around Rome throwing games and all kinds of other things is how you get your name out there and it's a

2050
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:55,424
Large

2051
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:57,728
Part of the reason why seizures in such great dad

2052
01:40:58,496 --> 01:41:01,568
And there's two ways of looking at the garlic situation at the time

2053
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:04,128
One is to say

2054
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:10,528
There's all that land and all those lays there for the taking the gall seem vulnerable and the Germans are coming in

2055
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:11,296
Doing it

2056
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:14,624
And the attitude being a somebody going to get that it's going to be us

2057
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:16,160
The other way of looking at it

2058
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:20,256
Is it this whole idea of a German thread is part of a manufactured

2059
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:21,536
Plot

2060
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:26,912
A reason that provide Caesar with an excuse to go in there

2061
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:27,936
And scoop up

2062
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:29,472
All that wealth

2063
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:30,240
Himself

2064
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:35,104
And to do so right for the glory in defense of Rome

2065
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:36,896
This brings us

2066
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:38,944
To the actual War

2067
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:41,760
Terry's because we're going to have to rely on these

2068
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:43,040
And yet

2069
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:48,928
I'm not sure you could find if you had to be stuck with one main source I'm not sure you could find a better one

2070
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:53,024
It is one of the great works of literature of all time

2071
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:55,072
In military history

2072
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:56,864
There's very few things like

2073
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,680
As historian Michael Grant

2074
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:00,448
Setopati

2075
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:05,312
It was the best account of warfare that it ever been written by a Roma

2076
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:09,408
And it retain the Supremacy at least another for centuries

2077
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:10,688
And quote

2078
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:12,480
He also wrote

2079
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:19,136
Did because of seizures I mean Caesar was one of the great writers of all time and so much of the Earth is other

2080
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:20,928
Qualities are overshadowed by

2081
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:22,976
Is military reputation

2082
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:27,072
But the concise surprised that he used and everything

2083
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:29,888
Made his work a staple of

2084
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,960
In a first-year Latin course is all throughout the

2085
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:37,568
Western Civilization the world and everybody knew Caesars work Once Upon a Time

2086
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:40,384
Michael Grant also said quote

2087
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:44,736
Caesar's formidable intellect and Lucid concise Latin

2088
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:48,576
Transform these ostensibly modest Works into masterpiece

2089
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:52,928
Is unique inside knowledge carries extraordinary Authority

2090
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:54,464
And quote

2091
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:58,304
It's very rare

2092
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:02,144
To have essentially the war dispatches

2093
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:06,240
Of one of the great commanders of all time I mean you have nothing like this from Alexander the Great

2094
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:09,824
For example or most of the other people in where's Jenkins cons

2095
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:15,712
One of the ones that you can have fun reading today for example

2096
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:20,832
Is if you go read the second world war series as penned by Winston Churchill

2097
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:27,232
You get a similar sort of field because instead of having somebody tell you the story they're basically telling you the story from within the story

2098
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:29,792
There's a lot of I said and then he said to me and then

2099
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:34,656
I mean it's a completely different way to view history you know it's completely biased mean Churchill even said

2100
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:38,240
I know history shall treat me kindly cuz I should be writing that history

2101
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:40,288
Well that's what Caesar doing to

2102
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:47,712
And one of the parts that will screw you up the most if you never read it before is he refers to himself 99% of the time

2103
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:48,736
I'm in the third person

2104
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:50,272
Caesar Caesar did that

2105
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:52,576
It's a little strange but

2106
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:55,648
If you understand and read several books

2107
01:43:55,904 --> 01:44:02,048
Just on that book and it's fascinating the way they tear it apart and and look at all the angles cuz Caesars playing three-dimensional chess

2108
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,328
Would this work

2109
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:07,936
He's writing it for a contemporary audience and for the future

2110
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:15,360
The little intricacies that you would have to actually not just speak Latin but archaic Latin and have a really good idea

2111
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:16,128
Contact

2112
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:18,176
These experts will point out that

2113
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:24,832
Just based on the way Caesars using the Latin language she may have been writing it may have been political purpose

2114
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:27,392
Because instead of writing Maybe

2115
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:30,720
For the aristocracy of Rome in the power Brokers in the Senate

2116
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:35,840
Caesar was a popular he was one of these people that made his political name supposedly appealing

2117
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:39,680
To the needs of the people as opposed to the wealthy people in Rome

2118
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:44,288
So he may have written this maybe not even to be read maybe read aloud

2119
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:45,824
To the crowds in Rome

2120
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:52,224
In a language that was straightforward that they would understand and pulling themes and ways of approaching the story

2121
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:53,248
For example

2122
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:55,808
Praising the average Roman soldier quite a bit

2123
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:58,624
And something to Curry favor with the crowd

2124
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:01,952
This is a political document

2125
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:04,768
It's a document of personal aggrandizement

2126
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:07,072
It is a piece of propaganda

2127
01:45:07,328 --> 01:45:09,376
And it is also the best source

2128
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:10,912
Of military

2129
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:13,472
Conduct that you were going to get to the Byzantine

2130
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:16,544
Maybe the best source you're going to get in the entire ancient world

2131
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:19,104
For a man as Michael Brandt says

2132
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:22,176
Whose authority is absolutely unmatched

2133
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:26,528
Who would you rather if you could only have one account

2134
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,320
Would you rather have it from

2135
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:30,368
An unbiased Observer would be nice

2136
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:32,672
But when Caesar tells you

2137
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:36,512
About the intricacies of this war he's telling it to you

2138
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:39,072
United the man who decided on things

2139
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:43,424
She's bias as hell but he's an absolutely

2140
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:47,520
Unbelievable source to be able to hear from the first person sent

2141
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:55,456
Caesar gets the command he wants from the three-headed monster he was looking at a place called Daisha over near the Adriatic

2142
01:45:55,712 --> 01:46:00,576
Because maybe a placed it to involve himself at the good place where I can conquer some people make some names and

2143
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:02,112
Secure Rome's borders

2144
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:06,464
But trouble Brews over in Gaul instead

2145
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:08,256
And it flared up

2146
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:13,888
In an indirect way if you believe the source is because of this new German situation

2147
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:15,424
A tribe

2148
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:21,824
That was located her territory number to call and try to get some of these places were really Proto States or States let's understand

2149
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,896
Krabs is a bad word but that's goldsworthy says we're kind of stuck with it

2150
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:26,944
But this tribe

2151
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:32,064
Located in what's now modern-day Switzerland Caesar says decided they were going to move

2152
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,648
Enlightening neighbors of the Germans and they fell

2153
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:36,928
Too constrained

2154
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:42,304
In this land Hand by mountains and not in the territory they were going to move and they were going to move in a way

2155
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:44,096
Where they were going to cross

2156
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:46,400
Roman territory this Southern

2157
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:48,960
France area that the Romans had to take

2158
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:49,728
Had to take

2159
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:52,032
Take a course to protect this road to Spain

2160
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:53,824
They called it the prophet

2161
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:55,104
Providence

2162
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:56,640
Today I think I'll

2163
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:58,176
Cesar just always called

2164
01:46:58,432 --> 01:46:58,944
The province

2165
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:02,272
And this group of Gauls from modern-day Switzerland

2166
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:07,136
Numbering the ancient sources said nxcess of 350 thousand people

2167
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:10,976
In a migration you know men women children the whole thing

2168
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:13,280
Bring your possessions bring your towns

2169
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:15,328
3 years in the makings and leave

2170
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:19,168
350 plus thousand people going to cross Roman territory

2171
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:22,496
And Caesar in the room is basically saying no they're not

2172
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:26,592
Now this is where seizures narrative begins

2173
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:28,640
Before he starts explaining another Golic

2174
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:33,248
Where's the first thing he does is for a paragraph or two he lays out the land for your average Roman

2175
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,040
Consumer of his media

2176
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:35,808
We would say

2177
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:36,576
Today

2178
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:39,648
Because one Caesar gets away from the clothes parts

2179
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:41,440
Right toga wearing Gaul

2180
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:43,744
The next short hair golf

2181
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:50,400
Once you head-on into long hair go you are continually moving into less and less well-known territory the farther

2182
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:51,168
Hugo

2183
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:53,728
Caesar becomes a bit ly

2184
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:54,496
Like a

2185
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:55,776
Lewis and Clark

2186
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:57,568
Expedition at some point

2187
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:01,920
In this endeavor a very heavily armed one it must be said

2188
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:05,248
Arizona has to lay out initially the lay of the land for the

2189
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:07,296
People in Romney talks about 3

2190
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:08,832
Big cultural groups

2191
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:11,136
That inhabit this whole area

2192
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:17,024
And the differences between them in one of the more famous passages in all ancient literature

2193
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,096
Napoleon all the greats read that

2194
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:21,120
Caesar in the

2195
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:25,728
Doesn't matter which translation you use its it suitably awe inspiring in my opinion

2196
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:27,008
In all of them

2197
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:30,848
I use a Carolyn Hammond translation for this but

2198
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:34,432
And here he is laying out the land for you and by the way

2199
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:36,480
Notice how he's also kind of

2200
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:37,760
Beginning the

2201
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:40,832
Transition idea the softening ideas

2202
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:42,880
Roman luxury softening

2203
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:46,208
And by the way I'm going to say Bell gay

2204
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:48,000
Guy some people

2205
01:48:48,256 --> 01:48:49,024
What's a LG

2206
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:56,192
There's an old saying that there's a right way and a wrong way to mispronounce Latin so hopefully we're mispronouncing it the right way in this Pro

2207
01:48:56,704 --> 01:48:57,472
Most of the time

2208
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:00,288
Cesar Chavez

2209
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:01,824
That's amazing

2210
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:02,848
The Caesar right

2211
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:04,128
Caesar's writings

2212
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:05,664
It's crazy.

2213
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:07,456
Seizure rights

2214
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:08,224
Quote

2215
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:11,552
The whole of Gaul is divided into three parts

2216
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:13,600
One of which the belgae inhabit

2217
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:18,464
The aquitani another and the third a people who in their own language are called

2218
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:20,000
Helps button hours

2219
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:20,768
Galls

2220
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:23,328
They all different among themselves in respect

2221
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:24,352
2 language

2222
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:25,888
Way of life and laws

2223
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:32,544
The river garron divides the gulls from the aquitani and the Marne and Seine River is separate them

2224
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:33,312
From the belgae

2225
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:36,384
Of these three the belgae are the bravest

2226
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:40,736
Were they are farthest away from the civilization and culture of the prophet

2227
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:42,016
Meaning of Roman

2228
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:48,672
Merchants rarely travel to them or import such Goods as make men's courage week

2229
01:49:48,928 --> 01:49:49,696
And womanish

2230
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:51,488
They live moreover

2231
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:53,536
In close proximity to the German

2232
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:55,840
Who inhabit the land across the Rhine

2233
01:49:56,096 --> 01:49:58,144
And they are continually at war with them

2234
01:49:58,656 --> 01:50:02,752
For this reason the hell VT also exceed the other Galls in bravery

2235
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:06,080
Because they are embroiled in almost daily battles with the germ

2236
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:09,152
Either when they are awarding them off from their own Frontiers

2237
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:12,224
Or when they themselves take the fight into enemy territory

2238
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:13,760
And quote

2239
01:50:14,784 --> 01:50:18,624
Historian Andrew M riggsby goes to Great Lengths to point out the

2240
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:23,232
Cesar is actually establishing his own boundaries for his own purposes here

2241
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:27,840
And that these may not have been boundary that were recognized in other

2242
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:34,496
Places necessarily and Caesar is creating boundaries so that he can come to Natural extensions of them and stop

2243
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:38,336
I mean it's all very interesting but the point is is that a procedure says with a grain of salt

2244
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:39,872
As always

2245
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:44,480
But he's basically telling you the lay of the land in Gaul and then right after he does

2246
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:46,784
He starts talking about a conspiracy

2247
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:48,832
The conspiracy

2248
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:52,160
That will legitimize actions in

2249
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:56,000
Galbi on stopping the migration of his tribe

2250
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:59,328
But according to Caesar it's behind the migration of the helvetians

2251
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:02,912
East 350 thousand people or more that Caesar says

2252
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:06,240
Burned their 400 villages

2253
01:51:06,496 --> 01:51:09,568
And 12 towns maybe some of which Maven Proto cities

2254
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:12,128
Before setting off so that they would know

2255
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:13,920
The we're not going home right

2256
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:15,968
Same ol thing on the captain of the ship

2257
01:51:16,224 --> 01:51:20,832
In the Shipwreck burn the ships so you don't think of going home or going to burn these Villages and then we no going back

2258
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:22,112
And

2259
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:27,488
But Napoleon referred to this part of Caesars being simply in comprehensible

2260
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:28,512
Hans delbrook

2261
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:30,816
Golf that there could be all these

2262
01:51:31,328 --> 01:51:33,120
Tribal peoples on the March like this

2263
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:36,960
Walking with the logistical disaster will be

2264
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:42,848
But a couple of modern-day is doing some interesting way of looking at it kind of comparing it to the way you would have compared

2265
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:45,152
People who showed up for the Woodstock

2266
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:47,712
Rock concert in the 60s right

2267
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:54,368
Small groups of people so they're migrating at a time caring most of what they needed on their back or with a single wagon and having them

2268
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:56,928
Migration take a longer period of time

2269
01:51:57,184 --> 01:51:58,976
So instead of having like one Army

2270
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:00,512
Moving around you have

2271
01:52:01,024 --> 01:52:05,632
Groups of people migrating in and the way Caesar tells the story it sounds more like

2272
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:13,056
Now these are it should be pointed out probably heavily armed migrants so let's not make

2273
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:16,128
A bunch of lions out to be little lambs

2274
01:52:16,384 --> 01:52:16,896
Right

2275
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:18,944
But Caesar claims

2276
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:21,248
Did the migration is all part of a plan

2277
01:52:22,272 --> 01:52:26,368
And the leader of this tribe of helvetians is trying to become a king

2278
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:29,184
But the tribe doesn't have Kings anymore

2279
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:30,464
They have

2280
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:31,744
Magistrate

2281
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,024
An elected official

2282
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:33,792
And

2283
01:52:34,048 --> 01:52:39,168
Some sort of aristocratic oligarchic Senate of A Sort and

2284
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:45,824
The punishment for trying to turn the society back to a kingship is to be burned alive Caesars

2285
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:50,176
Now I should point out that this information is delivered to us

2286
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:52,992
By Caesar on like the very beginning

2287
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:53,760
Of his

2288
01:52:54,272 --> 01:52:54,784
Commentary

2289
01:52:55,296 --> 01:52:57,088
Right after he lays out the way that

2290
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,648
Gaul is divided into different groups

2291
01:52:59,904 --> 01:53:01,696
He then explains this story

2292
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:04,000
The story involves three garlic

2293
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:04,768
Nobleman

2294
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:07,584
Powerful guys in three different powerful God

2295
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:08,352
What tribes

2296
01:53:09,376 --> 01:53:12,448
Ethan describes a scenario that a couple of historians

2297
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:16,288
You don't point out and it's obvious and ironic and there's some code of psychologic

2298
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:18,848
Nothing maybe going on the seizure but he describes

2299
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:22,432
A three-headed garlic first Triumph

2300
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:24,224
If you will in other words

2301
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:27,808
He's explaining that these garlic noblemen are working together

2302
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:31,136
To help each other get what they want in terms of more power

2303
01:53:31,648 --> 01:53:33,440
Situation seizures involves hitting

2304
01:53:33,696 --> 01:53:36,512
Back in room with those two other guys that make up the

2305
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:38,048
The first triumvirate right

2306
01:53:38,304 --> 01:53:39,840
He's a lot more critical

2307
01:53:40,352 --> 01:53:42,656
Of their triumvirate the use of his own

2308
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:45,984
He makes it out to be Sinister AC

2309
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:47,776
Just at these three garlic nobleman

2310
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:49,568
Plotting to take over all of Gaul

2311
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:52,384
Which you know again if we're looking at it from the point of view

2312
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,664
The Gauls

2313
01:53:54,432 --> 01:53:56,992
Isn't that what you'd want them to be doing

2314
01:53:58,016 --> 01:54:04,160
And by the way it is already been done by other garlic tribes in other areas that the wrong is that already taken over in Spain by the waves

2315
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:04,928
Common

2316
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:06,464
Is a national hero

2317
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:07,232
Portugal

2318
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:08,256
2

2319
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:10,560
Consolidated tribes

2320
01:54:10,816 --> 01:54:14,912
And the locals and fought the Romans for a long time happened in packaging galatia to happen.

2321
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:16,192
The Balkans to

2322
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:17,472
So it's sort of standard

2323
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:25,152
Panigale point of view these three guys might have been national heroes like Winston Churchill type thing the Romans are coming the Russians are coming

2324
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:29,248
We have to combine at the national security question but Caesar plays it ought to be a raw grab

2325
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:30,528
Power by the three guys

2326
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:35,392
And one of them is the helvetian ruler in the reason he's moving his people is much more Sinister than just

2327
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:37,696
They need more territories part of the plot

2328
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,536
The Roman diplomacy

2329
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:43,584
Was at RhymeZone people find out

2330
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:44,864
The involved in this plot

2331
01:54:45,376 --> 01:54:47,168
Information about have a big trial

2332
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:51,008
Are they going to bring this guy and he shows up with like ten thousand of his best friends

2333
01:54:51,264 --> 01:54:53,056
Annie's retainers and whatnot to the

2334
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:55,104
Court in the court basically have to gulp

2335
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:56,640
And let him go

2336
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:58,176
And then Caesar says

2337
01:54:58,432 --> 01:55:03,040
The Civil Wars about to start then mysteriously the dude dies his name was Argueta Rex

2338
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:05,600
But the tribe still going to move

2339
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:07,136
Because it was in the plan

2340
01:55:07,648 --> 01:55:10,976
And sold that starts this chain of events that will eventually lead to

2341
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:14,048
Celtic culture in with Now France being mortally wounded

2342
01:55:14,816 --> 01:55:17,888
So what's the cause of all this if you're in a war crimes trial

2343
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:23,264
How did this happen a cleansing or whatever come to beat will it all starts with

2344
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:26,592
The rationale here's how Caesar lays it out in my

2345
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,664
Sa handford translation quote

2346
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:34,016
The foremost men among the helvetia and rank and wealth

2347
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:35,040
What's organic

2348
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:39,136
In the consulship of Marcus Masala and Marcus piso

2349
01:55:39,392 --> 01:55:44,256
He was induced by the hope of obtaining royal power to organize a conspiracy of noblemen

2350
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:47,328
And persuaded his countrymen to emigrate and math

2351
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:50,144
Telling them that they were the best fighters in golf

2352
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:52,448
I could very easily conquer the whole country

2353
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:53,472
And quote

2354
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:56,032
Ethan explains

2355
01:55:57,056 --> 01:55:58,080
This organic soda

2356
01:55:58,592 --> 01:55:59,104
Leeds

2357
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:02,944
The entire movement to get it together to burn the homes eventually

2358
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:09,344
And migraines and then as part of the process of negotiating with nearby tribes you know that they would have to pass through

2359
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:12,160
Restart make it a couple of important friends each other tribes

2360
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:15,232
They decide to work together

2361
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:17,536
Procedure says quote

2362
01:56:18,048 --> 01:56:20,864
Or get Eric's convinced them these other two

2363
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:21,632
Aristocrats

2364
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:28,032
That these schemes were quite easy of achievement by telling them that he intended to usurp the sovereignty of

2365
01:56:28,288 --> 01:56:28,800
Arizona State

2366
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:31,616
What you said was beyond question the most powerful in golf

2367
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:34,432
And then he would use his wealth in military strength

2368
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:36,992
To secure them the possession of their Thrones

2369
01:56:37,504 --> 01:56:39,040
Is arguments proved effective

2370
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:42,368
The freemen sworn oath of mutual loyalty

2371
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:45,184
Hoping that once they had made themselves Kings

2372
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:50,560
The great power of the warlike people they ruled when they able them to get control of all of Gaul

2373
01:56:50,816 --> 01:56:51,584
And quote

2374
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:57,472
If you're looking at this from a pro garlic perspective though

2375
01:56:57,984 --> 01:57:04,128
That might be a good idea Cesar portrays it as otherwise but remember in this story it's Darth Vader's account

2376
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:05,664
And we get to have

2377
01:57:08,224 --> 01:57:09,504
Celtic X Burberry Conley

2378
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:11,552
Offers

2379
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:13,088
An idea or way to look

2380
01:57:13,344 --> 01:57:13,856
Redis where

2381
01:57:14,624 --> 01:57:15,904
The people of

2382
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:17,952
Gulf War

2383
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:20,000
Unusually threatened during this

2384
01:57:20,256 --> 01:57:21,280
Time. Maybe in

2385
01:57:21,536 --> 01:57:22,304
Crisis

2386
01:57:23,328 --> 01:57:24,352
In which case t

2387
01:57:24,864 --> 01:57:28,192
Migration of the helvetians might have been much more like a

2388
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:31,520
Cherokee Trail of Tears

2389
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:32,800
If you want to compare it

2390
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:36,128
Did something from the Native American terminology

2391
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:39,200
He says that Caesars oft-quoted

2392
01:57:39,456 --> 01:57:40,992
Rationalization

2393
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:46,368
The gall would have to be taken over by the Romans if it were not to become Germanic

2394
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:51,744
He says quote may have been an unbiased interpretation of the evidence he had before him

2395
01:57:52,256 --> 01:57:52,768
And quote

2396
01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:55,072
Cunliffe also points out

2397
01:57:55,584 --> 01:57:56,096
That events

2398
01:57:56,352 --> 01:57:58,656
Quite a distance from here could be having effect

2399
01:57:58,912 --> 01:57:59,680
Ripple effect

2400
01:58:00,192 --> 01:58:06,080
For example he talks about the dacian which are a barbarian people that may or may not be dramatic also

2401
01:58:06,336 --> 01:58:12,480
Having a huge offensive against another Celtic people in the Hungarian plain which has a domino effect

2402
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:16,320
An accordion effect that in a Caesar ends up being with the end result of

2403
01:58:16,832 --> 01:58:21,440
You know how these helvetian start to move cuz tribes to the east of the helvetians are being displaced

2404
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:28,352
So the Celtic peoples of Europe and Galls specifically are threatened from multiple

2405
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:29,376
Directions

2406
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:30,656
I'm different people

2407
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:36,032
Let's try the helvetians would have been on like the bleeding edge

2408
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:42,176
Of what maybe was starting to look like the sick man of Europe for this time.

2409
01:58:42,688 --> 01:58:43,968
And they were having

2410
01:58:44,224 --> 01:58:47,552
Pieces of their territory beating off from every direction

2411
01:58:47,808 --> 01:58:52,416
The Germans from the East that dacian from the southeast and now the Romans from the south

2412
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:56,768
Darn right you be talkin about consolidating your power

2413
01:58:57,024 --> 01:58:58,560
Try to resist this if you could

2414
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:00,608
Caesars

2415
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:01,632
Great

2416
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:03,424
Period in his history

2417
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:05,728
Begins when he confronts

2418
01:59:06,496 --> 01:59:07,008
This

2419
01:59:07,264 --> 01:59:09,568
350000

2420
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:10,592
Person

2421
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:12,384
Column of humanity

2422
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:15,200
If you believe either the numbers the way

2423
01:59:15,456 --> 01:59:17,504
They showed up but rum and doors

2424
01:59:18,272 --> 01:59:19,296
Over River

2425
01:59:20,832 --> 01:59:21,600
With a bridge

2426
01:59:21,856 --> 01:59:23,392
That Caesar had just destroyed

2427
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:25,440
Basically

2428
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:28,000
This group of people.

2429
01:59:28,256 --> 01:59:33,632
Front end of this tribe is reached Caesar and now they're going to have to ask him for permission to come into the

2430
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:34,400
Providence

2431
01:59:34,656 --> 01:59:36,448
Caesar's going to say let me think about it

2432
01:59:37,984 --> 01:59:40,032
Go over their camp out while I think about it

2433
01:59:40,544 --> 01:59:42,080
Meanwhile while they're doing that he's

2434
01:59:42,336 --> 01:59:44,896
Organizing the raising of armies far away

2435
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:49,504
He's got the troops within building a giant 16 mile or something long

2436
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:51,552
Fortification

2437
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:57,440
Winegard Towers at regular intervals No Doubt with some Roman bolt throwers in them

2438
01:59:58,208 --> 02:00:00,768
And when the tribe comes back for their answer

2439
02:00:01,024 --> 02:00:05,376
You know after they've been how are they eating you know that me and you could have lots of people dying on this

2440
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:09,472
Little Bataan Death March from the Swiss Alps to where Caesar was

2441
02:00:09,728 --> 02:00:15,104
And they say okay can we cross now and Caesar now with this giant fortification behind them in more troops with them since now

2442
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:17,920
I'm just curious

2443
02:00:18,944 --> 02:00:20,736
If you are in this garlic

2444
02:00:21,504 --> 02:00:22,272
Massive PP

2445
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:27,136
And you've been camping out eating at maybe with little of your food is left

2446
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:32,000
And you're waiting for a Roman decision and more people are showing up as

2447
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:34,816
Trailmaster humidity keeps arriving

2448
02:00:35,328 --> 02:00:41,472
And you're waiting in your waiting and the Romans are building these fortifications and you show feasible can we please cross now and then they say no

2449
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:42,496
What do you do

2450
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:46,848
Caesar says that small groups of

2451
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:47,872
People

2452
02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:54,016
In the night in the daytime try to cross over themselves over the river to get on the other side it doesn't sound like a big

2453
02:00:54,528 --> 02:01:00,672
Armed mass of humanity sounds like a bunch of people desperately in like small family groups in the butt not trying to cross over and

2454
02:01:00,928 --> 02:01:03,232
Overwhelm the defenses or sneak by

2455
02:01:03,488 --> 02:01:06,560
On any given point in the Romans concentrate missile fire they say

2456
02:01:06,816 --> 02:01:09,376
And you kill all these people in the water and drive them back

2457
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:12,704
You're so historian Adrian goldsworthy describe

2458
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:13,984
The situation he says quote

2459
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:17,824
When the hell VCI returned for seizures decision

2460
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:19,616
He bluntly informed them

2461
02:01:19,872 --> 02:01:21,408
That is procedure now

2462
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:27,296
According to the custom and precedent of the Roman people he could not permit anyone to Journey Through The Province

2463
02:01:27,808 --> 02:01:30,624
And that he would stop them if they tried to force their way through

2464
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:31,648
Goldsworthy

2465
02:01:32,928 --> 02:01:36,256
The new fortifications were there to demonstrate that he meant what he said

2466
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:41,376
However it was difficult for such a great mass of people suddenly to change direction and purpose

2467
02:01:41,888 --> 02:01:45,216
The period of waiting by the river had also probably been very frustrating

2468
02:01:45,728 --> 02:01:48,288
And many of the LBC I were determined to keep going

2469
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:50,848
Especially after the years of preparation

2470
02:01:51,104 --> 02:01:52,896
And a willing destruction of their old home

2471
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:55,456
Small group began to cross the road

2472
02:01:55,968 --> 02:01:57,248
Either using the Fords

2473
02:01:57,504 --> 02:02:00,832
We're rigging up rafts to carry themselves or animals in vehicle

2474
02:02:01,344 --> 02:02:03,648
It is possible that these were deliberate Pro

2475
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:06,976
Sent by The Chieftains to test the strength of seizures defenses

2476
02:02:07,488 --> 02:02:13,632
The more likely they reflected the loose Central Authority and individual Independence it seem to be characteristic

2477
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:15,168
Give many of the tribes of Gaul

2478
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:18,752
They were certainly not full-fledged assault on the lines of fortifications

2479
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:24,896
Most of the crossing took place under the cover of Darkness but a few parties were bold enough to risk the attempt in daylight

2480
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:26,176
None succeeded

2481
02:02:26,432 --> 02:02:32,576
Procedures men were able to concentrate and meet each group intern overwhelming many of them with missiles as they struggled across

2482
02:02:33,344 --> 02:02:33,856
And quote

2483
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:41,792
It seems to be that goldsworthy to maybe leaving open the possibility that this is more of a humanitarian situation

2484
02:02:42,304 --> 02:02:43,584
Interior light on

2485
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:46,144
Eventually

2486
02:02:46,656 --> 02:02:47,168
The

2487
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:53,824
Celtic tribe will move away they have a plan B which they tried to avoid because it's a much tougher route and they have to get there

2488
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:55,616
A bunch of different of the tribe

2489
02:02:56,128 --> 02:02:57,408
I think start heading away

2490
02:02:58,432 --> 02:02:59,456
And Caesar decides

2491
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:02,016
Maybe he can't let them

2492
02:03:02,272 --> 02:03:03,040
Migrate

2493
02:03:03,552 --> 02:03:08,416
To the other location that they want to do even if they don't have the pastor Roman territory could be a problem anyway

2494
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:10,208
And he says that

2495
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:15,840
One of these conspirators one of the garlic triumvirate the three-headed garlic monster

2496
02:03:16,096 --> 02:03:17,120
He's working with

2497
02:03:17,632 --> 02:03:23,776
The helvetians to negotiate and you know Passover all these differences between these tribes right smoothing it out maybe

2498
02:03:24,032 --> 02:03:25,056
So they can work together more

2499
02:03:25,312 --> 02:03:26,336
They organized

2500
02:03:26,592 --> 02:03:32,736
Situation with the helvetians promise we won't do anything we will be very nice and we cross your territory we won't do anything bad and then they go through

2501
02:03:32,992 --> 02:03:37,088
The territory of these tribes that are allies of Rome and then they start breaking stuff

2502
02:03:37,856 --> 02:03:38,880
SD land stop

2503
02:03:39,392 --> 02:03:45,536
And devastating the territory and so these garlic tribes that are Allied to Rome say the Caesar or so Caesar says

2504
02:03:46,048 --> 02:03:46,816
Alpa

2505
02:03:47,584 --> 02:03:51,680
How can you let this happen to your allies right when you have an army right here

2506
02:03:51,936 --> 02:03:54,240
And Caesar says I can't let that happen to my allies

2507
02:03:54,496 --> 02:03:57,312
She justifies in the book that way then he goes after the helvetians

2508
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:02,688
Caesar will go raise some more armies real quickly

2509
02:04:03,456 --> 02:04:04,992
You catch up to the helvetians

2510
02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:06,016
Is there migrating a

2511
02:04:06,272 --> 02:04:06,784
Across another try

2512
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:07,808
Tribes territory

2513
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:09,088
Caesar will come up

2514
02:04:09,344 --> 02:04:14,720
Upon the tribe while they're in the process of crossing a river he's a 3/4 of the driving already crossed

2515
02:04:14,976 --> 02:04:16,256
Pizzas in 220 days

2516
02:04:16,512 --> 02:04:17,280
Shows you how long

2517
02:04:17,792 --> 02:04:22,656
This massive Humanities taking to move whatever the real numbers were talking about here might be

2518
02:04:23,168 --> 02:04:23,936
Procedures must be

2519
02:04:25,472 --> 02:04:28,032
But it's a lot of people one way or the other and they're hard to feed

2520
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:29,056
And Caesar

2521
02:04:29,312 --> 02:04:30,592
Comes upon he says

2522
02:04:31,104 --> 02:04:37,248
This tribe wear 3/4 of the tribe CrossFit 1/4 was still on the other side waiting that was the side Caesar was on to Zoe

2523
02:04:37,504 --> 02:04:38,016
Attack them

2524
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:41,088
Killed a bunch

2525
02:04:42,112 --> 02:04:43,392
This is women children

2526
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:44,416
Wagons

2527
02:04:44,672 --> 02:04:45,440
Warriors

2528
02:04:45,696 --> 02:04:47,232
A bunch of them ran into the forest

2529
02:04:47,744 --> 02:04:48,512
And now

2530
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:50,816
The tribe comes to seizure and basically says you know

2531
02:04:51,072 --> 02:04:52,096
What do you want from us

2532
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:53,888
Caesar says

2533
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:58,240
This that and the other thing reparations and oh yeah bunch of hostages now this

2534
02:04:58,752 --> 02:04:59,776
Is a moment we should

2535
02:05:00,288 --> 02:05:02,592
Just discussed this for a second cuz it's wild also

2536
02:05:02,848 --> 02:05:03,872
This practice

2537
02:05:04,128 --> 02:05:05,664
Of hostages for good behavior

2538
02:05:07,456 --> 02:05:08,736
This is very common in

2539
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:10,528
World but I always

2540
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:12,832
I think to myself what if this happened today

2541
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:19,232
What if that's how we ensure good behavior today what if when we were having problems with Saddam Hussein and you have your first golf

2542
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:24,096
Ford at the end of it he stays in power but in order to stop fighting you demand a couple of his sons

2543
02:05:24,608 --> 02:05:25,888
As hostages

2544
02:05:26,912 --> 02:05:29,728
Would be an interesting way to handle modern diplomacy

2545
02:05:30,752 --> 02:05:36,896
But that's what Caesar said he wants from this tribe and I want hostages and they're always going to be like the Sons and Daughters of the nobility so the people he's negotiating

2546
02:05:37,152 --> 02:05:39,200
Give the sons and daughters and they say

2547
02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:40,224
Hey hey hey

2548
02:05:41,248 --> 02:05:44,320
Don't get cocky just cuz you beat us in the situation where we were

2549
02:05:44,576 --> 02:05:50,720
In refugees over River we're basically still undefeated heck we beat you a couple Generations ago

2550
02:05:51,232 --> 02:05:53,792
Practice of taking hostages not giving

2551
02:05:54,048 --> 02:05:55,072
And so

2552
02:05:55,328 --> 02:05:56,352
The meeting broke up

2553
02:05:57,376 --> 02:06:00,704
Attributions would not provide hostages go back along

2554
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:04,800
Their merry way continuing their migration the Romans go back to Taylor

2555
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:10,944
Caesar now is looking for a way to strike at them because they haven't accepted his terms

2556
02:06:11,968 --> 02:06:13,760
Before he can manage to do it though

2557
02:06:14,272 --> 02:06:16,064
It begins to have severe Supply prop

2558
02:06:16,832 --> 02:06:17,856
More on that in a minute

2559
02:06:19,136 --> 02:06:20,672
Forces him he says

2560
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:22,464
To break off the pursuit

2561
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:27,840
And going in opposite direction towards a friendly Garlic City where he can get supplies

2562
02:06:28,096 --> 02:06:31,424
And Caesar says when they change course away from the migrants

2563
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:33,984
The migrants turn around and come after them

2564
02:06:36,544 --> 02:06:38,080
Little Caesars stopped he puts

2565
02:06:38,336 --> 02:06:39,360
His entire force

2566
02:06:39,872 --> 02:06:42,432
On a hill where it's covering the Hillwood legionaries

2567
02:06:42,688 --> 02:06:44,992
Reason the traditional three line formation

2568
02:06:46,272 --> 02:06:47,552
He's preparing for the battle

2569
02:06:47,808 --> 02:06:53,952
Caesar says in a very grandiose move for the folks back home but one that has real world dividends

2570
02:06:54,208 --> 02:06:54,720
Sleep aid

2571
02:06:54,976 --> 02:06:57,792
Caesar will get off his horse and send it to the rear and take his

2572
02:06:58,048 --> 02:06:59,840
Replacing the front line with the soldiers

2573
02:07:00,864 --> 02:07:01,632
Sharing their faith

2574
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:03,936
Encouraging them

2575
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:06,752
And remember this

2576
02:07:07,008 --> 02:07:10,336
Stage in his career Caesars not the great General that we know

2577
02:07:10,848 --> 02:07:14,176
Was Julius Caesar you seen a lot of fighting but this is really his first

2578
02:07:14,432 --> 02:07:15,456
True command

2579
02:07:16,224 --> 02:07:19,296
And this is where he's making his name and part of making his name

2580
02:07:19,808 --> 02:07:21,344
He's showing that he's something special

2581
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:24,160
Napoleon did a bunch of things like this and so did Alexander

2582
02:07:24,416 --> 02:07:25,696
Typical General move

2583
02:07:27,488 --> 02:07:31,072
But it can work wonders over the Long Haul seizures earning the trust of his army

2584
02:07:32,352 --> 02:07:34,912
He says that these gawlik troops these ferocious

2585
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:37,216
Soldiers come

2586
02:07:37,472 --> 02:07:41,568
Charging uphill at the Romans so you already sent disaster right

2587
02:07:41,824 --> 02:07:42,592
It's not a good move

2588
02:07:43,872 --> 02:07:46,944
But the gulls are not known for tactical brilliance

2589
02:07:47,456 --> 02:07:48,736
In fact it almost seems like

2590
02:07:49,248 --> 02:07:50,528
Inevitable trade-off

2591
02:07:50,784 --> 02:07:53,088
In the price you pay for being these

2592
02:07:53,344 --> 02:07:57,696
Out-of-control impetuous Warriors that lose your mind in battle lost

2593
02:07:58,464 --> 02:07:59,488
Is that your

2594
02:07:59,744 --> 02:08:00,768
Inevitably

2595
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:03,584
Less tactically cohesive and less

2596
02:08:04,096 --> 02:08:05,120
Concerned about

2597
02:08:05,376 --> 02:08:11,008
Things like making sure you save enough energy to be able to fight for a while they traditional book

2598
02:08:11,264 --> 02:08:14,080
Play book the opposition handbook on fighting Gauls says

2599
02:08:14,592 --> 02:08:17,152
That the initial charge of these people is

2600
02:08:19,712 --> 02:08:20,224
While

2601
02:08:20,992 --> 02:08:22,272
And hard to hold

2602
02:08:22,784 --> 02:08:27,648
But if you can stay strong and hold the initial charge they begin to get tired

2603
02:08:28,416 --> 02:08:30,208
And then they begin to get disheartened

2604
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:35,072
And that impetuosity phase and then the lack of the armor that they normally have

2605
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:40,960
The fact that they've totally lost cohesion after all this stuff against to tell if you can sit through

2606
02:08:41,216 --> 02:08:42,752
And whether the initial storm

2607
02:08:43,264 --> 02:08:44,544
You tend to be okay

2608
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:48,384
Charging up here with a bunch of Roman throwing heavy joblon downhill

2609
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:49,664
Not a good start

2610
02:08:50,176 --> 02:08:51,200
Caesar says that the

2611
02:08:51,456 --> 02:08:52,480
Roman Pila God

2612
02:08:52,736 --> 02:08:55,040
Stuck in the shields of the Gauls

2613
02:08:55,296 --> 02:08:56,576
Little narrow weaknecht

2614
02:08:57,088 --> 02:08:58,368
Deliberately designed

2615
02:08:58,624 --> 02:09:00,672
Tube and so then all of a sudden it's

2616
02:09:00,928 --> 02:09:06,560
Dragging down the shields of these Gaul Caesar says they shake their arms for a long time then throw their shield down

2617
02:09:06,816 --> 02:09:08,096
You take the people already not

2618
02:09:08,608 --> 02:09:14,496
Heavily armored and take away the Shields and then the Romans charge down at them with swords and it begins to be

2619
02:09:15,008 --> 02:09:19,360
You know a typical Roman battle against Gauls where they're going to get chopped up pretty good

2620
02:09:20,384 --> 02:09:23,200
He says you never see their back they don't run

2621
02:09:23,456 --> 02:09:24,736
But they conduct a

2622
02:09:24,992 --> 02:09:30,880
Fighting withdrawal up to a nearby Hill and when the Romans pursue them they're hitting the flanked by two other tribes that were nearby

2623
02:09:32,928 --> 02:09:33,696
We should point out

2624
02:09:33,952 --> 02:09:38,304
Caesar has every interest to exaggerate how dangerous this enemy is

2625
02:09:38,816 --> 02:09:41,376
And how difficult the conditions he faced were because

2626
02:09:41,888 --> 02:09:43,936
Obviously if he prevails and wins

2627
02:09:44,192 --> 02:09:47,520
Well it's that much greater of a victory to cite to the folks back home

2628
02:09:48,032 --> 02:09:48,544
Nonetheless

2629
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:55,200
When seizures hit in the flank he says the people that he was pursuing charges him from the front again so he's surrounded

2630
02:09:55,456 --> 02:09:57,504
His flight is he that this is a Greek army

2631
02:09:57,760 --> 02:09:58,784
Instead of a Roman army

2632
02:09:59,296 --> 02:10:00,576
It's done for this point

2633
02:10:01,088 --> 02:10:03,904
Because the Romans could do with the Romans could do

2634
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:07,232
Tactical flexibility that was pretty much

2635
02:10:07,488 --> 02:10:09,024
Unique in the ancient world

2636
02:10:09,536 --> 02:10:13,632
Caesar's able to take one of the three lines of the Roman army the one that's not yet fighting

2637
02:10:14,144 --> 02:10:14,656
And

2638
02:10:15,424 --> 02:10:18,752
Shift it's facing so it's now facing the enemy

2639
02:10:19,008 --> 02:10:21,824
Benefits of Romans in the flank now they're facing Romans from the front

2640
02:10:23,872 --> 02:10:25,408
Turn a hard-fought battle now

2641
02:10:25,664 --> 02:10:27,712
Caesars troop get the upper hand

2642
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:28,480
The

2643
02:10:28,736 --> 02:10:30,784
Warriors will retreat

2644
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:32,832
To a wagon Fortress 2

2645
02:10:33,088 --> 02:10:34,368
Taking all the Wagons at there

2646
02:10:34,624 --> 02:10:36,928
Migrating with and they put them in a giant Circle

2647
02:10:37,184 --> 02:10:40,768
And it's offended by all the noncombatants and whatnot end

2648
02:10:41,024 --> 02:10:42,816
The Romans attack it

2649
02:10:43,072 --> 02:10:44,864
That's was The Last Stand of the battle

2650
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:47,168
And by the time

2651
02:10:47,424 --> 02:10:48,704
The whole thing is over

2652
02:10:49,728 --> 02:10:51,520
May have killed 200000

2653
02:10:52,032 --> 02:10:52,544
These people

2654
02:10:53,312 --> 02:10:53,824
Ayhan

2655
02:10:55,872 --> 02:10:57,152
If you believe those numbers

2656
02:10:59,968 --> 02:11:01,504
Historian Michael Sage

2657
02:11:02,016 --> 02:11:03,552
Says this about the numbers quote

2658
02:11:05,344 --> 02:11:09,696
In the aftermath of the battle Caesar claims that tablets were found in the helvetian camp

2659
02:11:09,952 --> 02:11:11,488
Written in Greek characters

2660
02:11:11,744 --> 02:11:17,376
Containing lists of men of military age women boys in the elderly who joined into migration

2661
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:18,912
They were also

2662
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:21,984
Council the other tribe to accompany the helvetians

2663
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:25,568
For a grand total of 368000 people

2664
02:11:25,824 --> 02:11:28,896
Of whom 92000 were capable of bearing arms

2665
02:11:29,408 --> 02:11:30,944
Seizure then record the census

2666
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:32,992
Taken when the Gauls returned home

2667
02:11:33,504 --> 02:11:35,296
Which totaled 110000

2668
02:11:35,552 --> 02:11:41,696
It is difficult to assess the accuracy of these figures and this is the only case in the garlic War we're Caesar worth

2669
02:11:41,952 --> 02:11:42,720
First of such list

2670
02:11:43,232 --> 02:11:46,048
The Gauls did write Celtic in Greek letters

2671
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:49,888
Numerous inscriptions in Celtic written in Greek characters have been preserved

2672
02:11:50,912 --> 02:11:56,800
The figure of 92,000 Warriors is plausible that the total of 368,000 is accepted

2673
02:11:57,056 --> 02:12:02,432
In premodern populations about 1/4 of the population consisted of males of military age

2674
02:12:02,688 --> 02:12:06,784
The total number for all those migrating is also in the realm of possibility

2675
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:12,672
110000 survivors representing 1/3 of those who set out is more of a problem

2676
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:15,488
The loss of more than two-thirds as possible

2677
02:12:15,744 --> 02:12:17,536
But he must have had a number of causes

2678
02:12:17,792 --> 02:12:21,632
The migration from beginning to end probably consumed about three months

2679
02:12:21,888 --> 02:12:24,448
With the final battle in late May early June

2680
02:12:24,704 --> 02:12:29,312
Many especially the sick and the infirm may have perished along the way

2681
02:12:29,568 --> 02:12:32,128
And other simply settled along the route of migration

2682
02:12:32,384 --> 02:12:35,712
Once the battle casualties are included which Caesar does not give

2683
02:12:35,968 --> 02:12:38,016
The figure four losses still seems too high

2684
02:12:38,528 --> 02:12:41,600
There's no other evidence and at least it's in the realm of possibility

2685
02:12:42,112 --> 02:12:42,624
And quote

2686
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:46,720
How do I say just broke I enjoyed immensely on this

2687
02:12:48,256 --> 02:12:49,536
Buddy's point is well taken

2688
02:12:50,048 --> 02:12:52,352
We don't know how many people really were there

2689
02:12:52,608 --> 02:12:54,656
And you don't know how many people really came back

2690
02:12:55,936 --> 02:13:02,080
And it might have been more of a Trail of Tears type situation of Bataan Death March as we said type situation

2691
02:13:02,592 --> 02:13:06,688
Where a lot of people died along the way rather than have Caesar stuff out their lives

2692
02:13:09,504 --> 02:13:10,784
But you can be sure

2693
02:13:11,296 --> 02:13:15,392
It sent the helvetians were one of the great tribes of Gaul that we're talking about a lot of people

2694
02:13:15,648 --> 02:13:17,952
You're not just talking about combatants at all

2695
02:13:18,464 --> 02:13:22,048
The end stages of this battle with Caesar had the Roman legionaries assaulting

2696
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:23,072
The wagon

2697
02:13:24,096 --> 02:13:25,120
Brought up into a great

2698
02:13:25,376 --> 02:13:28,960
Notification with all of the stuff that these people owned in the middle of them

2699
02:13:29,472 --> 02:13:32,800
The Gauls and the Germans on a bunch of occasions

2700
02:13:33,056 --> 02:13:38,432
We're said by ancient sources to have the women staying back by the wagons yelling encouragement to their men

2701
02:13:38,688 --> 02:13:39,712
Deriding the

2702
02:13:39,968 --> 02:13:41,248
Behavior cowards

2703
02:13:41,504 --> 02:13:46,624
Providing first aid and Medicine help to those who staggered back from the battle line wounded

2704
02:13:47,136 --> 02:13:48,160
So when the Romans

2705
02:13:48,672 --> 02:13:49,696
Unidrive back

2706
02:13:50,208 --> 02:13:51,232
Defleaing

2707
02:13:51,488 --> 02:13:57,632
Routers after they just decimated their formations and those people run back to the wagon pursued by the Roman army

2708
02:13:57,888 --> 02:13:59,936
The Roman army does when they get to the wagons

2709
02:14:00,704 --> 02:14:01,472
They kill everybody

2710
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:03,264
When you try to

2711
02:14:05,312 --> 02:14:09,664
One of the main things that actually protects lives on the battlefield like this

2712
02:14:10,176 --> 02:14:11,968
Is the prospect of Stelling

2713
02:14:12,224 --> 02:14:14,016
The people that you can capture

2714
02:14:14,784 --> 02:14:20,928
The one thing a person on a battlefield facing the battle lost of other people has in their favor and then they the only thing they can work

2715
02:14:21,184 --> 02:14:23,744
Guess I'm I'm worth more alive than dead

2716
02:14:25,024 --> 02:14:29,888
And there's no doubt that lots of slaves were sold after this battle and you can hear your mind a cash register

2717
02:14:30,656 --> 02:14:36,800
In a ding every time one of those people Soul because one of the reasons seizures there if you recall as he has a horrible death.

2718
02:14:37,056 --> 02:14:37,568
Home

2719
02:14:38,336 --> 02:14:43,200
One of the ways for a great Roman to pay off these debts as with a successful profitable campaign

2720
02:14:43,712 --> 02:14:46,784
And one of the main things you profit off of is the people you sell after

2721
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:47,552
Words

2722
02:14:48,064 --> 02:14:48,832
Nonetheless

2723
02:14:49,088 --> 02:14:51,136
The reason seizure came

2724
02:14:51,392 --> 02:14:53,184
To this entire area to begin with

2725
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:54,464
I just been dealt with

2726
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:00,352
After the battle the helvetians essentially what's left of them come to Caesar and say you know we're in your power

2727
02:15:00,608 --> 02:15:02,144
Will do whatever you want to send them home

2728
02:15:02,912 --> 02:15:07,008
Send them back to where they came from and he feeds them on the way the Rangers are food and everything

2729
02:15:08,288 --> 02:15:09,824
Little Caesar I'll take care of you but

2730
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:14,432
The end result is you lose hundreds of thousands of people to return things to the status quo

2731
02:15:15,712 --> 02:15:18,016
So why doesn't Caesar go home now

2732
02:15:19,296 --> 02:15:21,856
Wow he's noticed something he says in his works

2733
02:15:22,368 --> 02:15:26,208
It's been brewing for a while he's been doing some investigations and he's uncovered a bunch of

2734
02:15:27,232 --> 02:15:29,536
Well stuff that the people in room should know about

2735
02:15:29,792 --> 02:15:32,096
Stuff that you can Overlook for example

2736
02:15:32,352 --> 02:15:34,912
He was already noticing the weird stuff was happening

2737
02:15:35,168 --> 02:15:39,264
With the garlic troop the friendly golly troops he was using his army

2738
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:41,312
The Romans for example don't produce cavalry

2739
02:15:41,568 --> 02:15:43,360
Anymore they produced legionaries

2740
02:15:43,616 --> 02:15:44,640
Heavy Infantry

2741
02:15:44,896 --> 02:15:46,944
Men armed with a heavy throwing javelin

2742
02:15:47,456 --> 02:15:49,248
Devastatingly nasty sword

2743
02:15:50,272 --> 02:15:52,064
The Cavalry is raised from

2744
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:55,648
In a local Friendly peoples in this case a lot of Celtic peoples

2745
02:15:55,904 --> 02:15:57,952
Which tribes allied to Rome but there

2746
02:15:58,464 --> 02:16:00,000
Doing things on the battlefield it make

2747
02:16:00,256 --> 02:16:02,048
Caesar suspicious that maybe

2748
02:16:02,304 --> 02:16:03,072
Just maybe

2749
02:16:03,584 --> 02:16:09,728
They're not altogether loyal I mean one famous thing that Caesar talks about thousands of these garlic Cavalry and they go up again

2750
02:16:09,984 --> 02:16:13,056
Get the few hundred of the enemies and then all of a sudden flee in Terror

2751
02:16:15,104 --> 02:16:17,152
Very suspicious thing and started doing some inquiry

2752
02:16:18,944 --> 02:16:22,016
Then while he's pursuing the helvetian

2753
02:16:22,272 --> 02:16:23,808
Column the helvetian columns

2754
02:16:24,064 --> 02:16:27,648
Begin moving away from rivers and stop procedure can get supplies

2755
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:34,304
Shouldn't matter because all these friendly tribe that a seizure and have to come up here and save us from these people that are stealing and destroy

2756
02:16:34,560 --> 02:16:37,888
Boiling our land they were supposed to provide the food but the food not coming

2757
02:16:38,144 --> 02:16:44,032
He said he keep getting these excuses I should have been here all we're still raising it. It's on the way why you didn't get it I mean that kind of stuff

2758
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:50,176
So he starts investigating that to calling some of these Nobles into his office and saying where the hell the food what's going on here

2759
02:16:52,224 --> 02:16:55,552
And all comes to a head after this battle with the helvetians because he says

2760
02:16:56,064 --> 02:16:58,112
It all the other with a few exceptions

2761
02:16:58,368 --> 02:16:59,136
Big garlic

2762
02:16:59,392 --> 02:17:00,416
Leaders come

2763
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:06,560
His location to congratulate him on his victory and all these kinds of stuff and then they say they can can we see you in the back room privately

2764
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:13,984
They called him into the back room privately in the instantly all fall to their feet Vita beseeching HIM Tears in their eyes and they give him he's

2765
02:17:15,264 --> 02:17:16,544
This sob story

2766
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:21,152
About please please please you have to save us from this German King who's taking over golf

2767
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:28,064
We told you about this guy right he was the guy who was brought in when these two tribes of Gaul that were historic enemies were looking

2768
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:28,832
Looking for an ad

2769
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:31,648
That's the one tribe. Let's invite these

2770
02:17:31,904 --> 02:17:35,744
Germans over and they'll give us the edge we will win the battle which they did and they

2771
02:17:36,256 --> 02:17:41,632
You destroyed the nobility of the other side but then the Germans didn't leave as we said

2772
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:43,680
In fact according to this

2773
02:17:44,448 --> 02:17:50,592
Group of people that comes to Caesar he's taking all their children hostages and anytime they move the wrong way he tortures them it does bad

2774
02:17:50,848 --> 02:17:51,360
Things to him

2775
02:17:51,872 --> 02:17:56,736
Caesar's never speaking to a Roman audience and basically saying can you believe what this German King is doing

2776
02:17:56,992 --> 02:18:00,832
Judy's poor girls who are allies and Friends of the Roman people

2777
02:18:01,088 --> 02:18:03,648
Caesar stand for that of course he can't stand for that

2778
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:06,208
What's more

2779
02:18:06,976 --> 02:18:09,792
These cats have been telling Caesar stories

2780
02:18:10,048 --> 02:18:16,192
That they've got people in their own tribes were just loyal rug you know the tribes are enemies of Rome are just loyal but these are

2781
02:18:16,448 --> 02:18:21,056
People in tribes that are nominally friends wrong they have huge numbers of fifth columnist

2782
02:18:21,312 --> 02:18:23,616
They want to work for the garlic cause instead

2783
02:18:24,128 --> 02:18:29,248
Now again seizures portraying this as Sinister and bad to Roman audience

2784
02:18:30,016 --> 02:18:33,856
It's hard not to see these troublemakers that Caesar talks about those

2785
02:18:34,112 --> 02:18:36,416
Anything other than Golic Patriots

2786
02:18:37,184 --> 02:18:43,328
If you're looking at it from their point of view I mean the people that are here beseeching Cesar for help these are like the quislings aren't they

2787
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:45,888
The traitors of the garlic cause but

2788
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:48,192
Just like the Native American tribes

2789
02:18:48,704 --> 02:18:50,496
Just like the tribes in Africa

2790
02:18:51,008 --> 02:18:52,288
These people have

2791
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:56,128
Historic enemies amongst their own kind

2792
02:18:56,896 --> 02:18:58,176
With disputes

2793
02:18:58,432 --> 02:19:01,248
Memories of Tit for Tat

2794
02:19:02,016 --> 02:19:05,344
Revenge cycle killings that go back forever and

2795
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:07,904
These were able to be exploited

2796
02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:12,512
In Africa and the New World by European powers in Gaul by the Romans

2797
02:19:12,768 --> 02:19:18,656
Exquisitely I mean it is the Romans who invented the phrase that we use today to divide and conquer

2798
02:19:19,936 --> 02:19:25,312
That's what they're doing in Gaul and seizures using some tribes against the other than these tribal leaders are telling him

2799
02:19:25,568 --> 02:19:26,848
We just want you to know

2800
02:19:27,104 --> 02:19:30,688
We have large factions in our own tribe that are working against you

2801
02:19:30,944 --> 02:19:33,248
They're the ones that kept the food from coming to you

2802
02:19:33,504 --> 02:19:39,648
They were the ones leading your Cavalry when the thousands of your Cavalry turn in flood and Tara from a few hundred of the

2803
02:19:39,904 --> 02:19:40,928
The enemy in other words

2804
02:19:41,184 --> 02:19:42,720
Caesar's got them all around him

2805
02:19:44,256 --> 02:19:46,816
And this becomes an excuse to stay

2806
02:19:47,584 --> 02:19:52,448
What's more when Caesar says this German King is a pressing all these people

2807
02:19:52,704 --> 02:19:53,984
He basically says

2808
02:19:54,240 --> 02:20:00,128
So the Gauls want us to stay I have to stay to defend them and the enemy has just shift

2809
02:20:00,896 --> 02:20:02,432
Some garlic people

2810
02:20:02,688 --> 02:20:04,992
To a new people now let's understand

2811
02:20:05,504 --> 02:20:10,368
Whether or not these new people really were new people is open for debate

2812
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:15,232
Cesar makes them a new people in his writing because it serves the purposes of his right

2813
02:20:15,488 --> 02:20:16,768
It's an outside power

2814
02:20:17,024 --> 02:20:18,304
Caesar's going to use it

2815
02:20:18,816 --> 02:20:21,376
To defend now these people that are closer to home

2816
02:20:21,632 --> 02:20:24,960
These people he's just killed a hundred thousand or more people of

2817
02:20:25,472 --> 02:20:27,264
He's now the savior of the Gauls

2818
02:20:27,776 --> 02:20:28,800
And he stay

2819
02:20:31,616 --> 02:20:34,176
Now I should point out that there's no consensus at all

2820
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:36,224
Over Caesars

2821
02:20:36,736 --> 02:20:37,504
Decision making

2822
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:38,272
At this point

2823
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:40,320
Everyone seems to agree that it

2824
02:20:40,576 --> 02:20:43,392
At some point Caesar decides he's going to take all of garlow

2825
02:20:44,416 --> 02:20:48,000
And most seem to think that that was not his initial plan once he

2826
02:20:48,512 --> 02:20:52,096
Originally set out to change the course of the helvetian migration

2827
02:20:52,864 --> 02:20:58,752
But there's a lot of disagreement over at what point Caesar crystallized this idea that the heck with it I'm taking it off

2828
02:21:01,568 --> 02:21:02,592
Many historians Arts

2829
02:21:03,104 --> 02:21:03,872
Spoken about this

2830
02:21:04,896 --> 02:21:05,664
Andrew Rigsby

2831
02:21:06,944 --> 02:21:09,760
This tendency and seizures writing sometimes

2832
02:21:10,272 --> 02:21:12,320
To give a hint of the idea

2833
02:21:12,832 --> 02:21:15,904
Bengall is maybe kind of doomed anyway

2834
02:21:16,928 --> 02:21:18,976
And that it's like a vulnerable

2835
02:21:19,488 --> 02:21:21,024
Animal in the geopolitical

2836
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:24,352
Will Hurd and somebody's going to get the Germans

2837
02:21:26,144 --> 02:21:27,680
It's the Germans that form this

2838
02:21:27,936 --> 02:21:31,520
New CounterPoint in the story when they appear on the scene because

2839
02:21:32,032 --> 02:21:34,592
Up until now Cesar hasn't really had an antagon

2840
02:21:35,872 --> 02:21:38,176
When you're stopping in migration of a tribal people

2841
02:21:38,432 --> 02:21:39,712
Who's the bad guy in that

2842
02:21:39,968 --> 02:21:42,272
Right even though Caesar had some bad guys involved

2843
02:21:42,784 --> 02:21:44,832
Conspiracy initially by the time he's involved their dad

2844
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:47,648
She never having any sort of a one-to-one

2845
02:21:47,904 --> 02:21:50,208
Darth Vader versus another Sith Lord

2846
02:21:50,464 --> 02:21:51,232
Confrontation

2847
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:54,560
And of course he's also got that

2848
02:21:54,816 --> 02:21:56,864
Conspiracy the shadowy thing going on

2849
02:21:57,120 --> 02:21:57,632
Nowhere

2850
02:21:57,888 --> 02:21:59,936
It's almost like a guerrilla War now he can't

2851
02:22:00,192 --> 02:22:00,704
Trust

2852
02:22:01,472 --> 02:22:03,264
Are the Celtic people who are his friends

2853
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:05,824
Your friends are your enemies are they all look the same

2854
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:10,432
But again not a single opponent for Caesar to really measure himself with

2855
02:22:10,688 --> 02:22:13,504
Until he comes face-to-face with this German King

2856
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:15,808
Ariovistus

2857
02:22:16,576 --> 02:22:17,600
King of the swing

2858
02:22:19,904 --> 02:22:21,440
Now let's step back a minute

2859
02:22:21,696 --> 02:22:23,744
For the sake of those were huge Julius Caesar

2860
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,048
Your fans because how can we ignore

2861
02:22:26,560 --> 02:22:28,864
How quickly everything here has happened that's a Hallmark

2862
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:33,472
The moving with speed and determination focusing on

2863
02:22:34,240 --> 02:22:37,312
In the core issues in the most decisive points in my naughty mean

2864
02:22:37,824 --> 02:22:40,640
This is all happening in the year 58 BCE

2865
02:22:41,664 --> 02:22:47,808
The dealing with the helvetian migration is during the same year and let's remember they hardly ever campaign in the winter

2866
02:22:48,064 --> 02:22:49,088
But this is really like

2867
02:22:49,344 --> 02:22:51,904
8 maybe 9 month campaigning season

2868
02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:55,232
And right after he deals with the helvetians and has those

2869
02:22:55,744 --> 02:22:56,768
What was a huge bat

2870
02:22:58,048 --> 02:23:04,192
You know you know marches to another part of this area where the German King isn't begins to deal

2871
02:23:04,448 --> 02:23:04,960
With him

2872
02:23:05,472 --> 02:23:09,824
In Caesars narrative this guy is sort of the root cause of everything hear me why

2873
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:15,200
Is Cesar even having to do all of this in Gaul will because the Germans destabilize the whole situation

2874
02:23:16,224 --> 02:23:17,248
Came in there with their

2875
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:22,880
120000 Warriors or whatever began settling in Gaul and has set the whole place in motion

2876
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:27,744
So when Caesar confronts REO Vista is he

2877
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,560
Confronting the root of the problem if Caesar were a less

2878
02:23:31,072 --> 02:23:32,864
Ambitious man this could be

2879
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:35,680
The end of his story this could be the culmination

2880
02:23:35,936 --> 02:23:41,312
He goes to the root of the problem and solves it comes home celebrate the triumphant lives happily ever after

2881
02:23:42,592 --> 02:23:43,872
I do have to remind myself.

2882
02:23:44,128 --> 02:23:50,016
How this has a feel of Caesar kind of being at the end of the Earth we said earlier that he's like a

2883
02:23:50,272 --> 02:23:52,832
Heavily armed version of the Lewis and Clark expedition

2884
02:23:53,600 --> 02:23:57,696
He feels the need in the narrative to tell the people back at home you know what these

2885
02:23:57,952 --> 02:23:59,744
Germans he calls them are like

2886
02:24:00,512 --> 02:24:01,536
What are their customs

2887
02:24:01,792 --> 02:24:03,584
God's do they believe in what they look

2888
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:04,608
Like how they fight

2889
02:24:06,400 --> 02:24:12,544
Supposedly the Romans had dealt with these people militarily before right at the time Caesars born remember the Cambrian the two tones in

2890
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:15,360
Invaders from the north unexpectedly a national security crisis

2891
02:24:16,384 --> 02:24:19,968
If you forgotten Cesar will remind you over and over again

2892
02:24:20,224 --> 02:24:21,248
In his commentaries

2893
02:24:22,016 --> 02:24:24,832
The great way to justify going out to the Germans to remind you

2894
02:24:25,088 --> 02:24:26,880
But every now and then they come after us

2895
02:24:28,928 --> 02:24:30,976
But other than that not a lot to go on

2896
02:24:31,232 --> 02:24:33,280
I'm so Cesar explains to the folks back home

2897
02:24:33,792 --> 02:24:36,864
You know that these Germans are essentially like the Gauls on steroids

2898
02:24:37,888 --> 02:24:40,448
The Gauls art all the Germans are that much taller

2899
02:24:41,216 --> 02:24:43,776
The Gauls are blondes the Germans are blonder

2900
02:24:44,032 --> 02:24:47,616
If the Gauls fight in a war mad Berserker crazy Frenzy

2901
02:24:47,872 --> 02:24:50,688
The Germans do that more often and their friends he's deeper than

2902
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:53,760
Caesar kind of says

2903
02:24:54,272 --> 02:24:56,576
The compared to the Gauls the Germans are primitive

2904
02:24:57,600 --> 02:25:02,720
Shuffle using a tribal scale on the Gauls are moving up to like threes and fours and fives the Germans are one

2905
02:25:03,488 --> 02:25:07,328
Just you know Caesar would have you believe just graduated from caveman's.

2906
02:25:08,096 --> 02:25:10,144
He said they don't even really practice agriculture

2907
02:25:11,168 --> 02:25:13,472
None of the modern histories or

2908
02:25:13,984 --> 02:25:16,032
Going to stop by archaeologists that I've read

2909
02:25:16,288 --> 02:25:17,312
None of them believe that

2910
02:25:17,568 --> 02:25:18,848
They all think the Germans practiced

2911
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:20,384
There you go

2912
02:25:22,944 --> 02:25:28,832
Caesar says that the Gauls used to be able to stand up to the Germans in battle but they can't anymore

2913
02:25:30,112 --> 02:25:33,696
Essentially saying that they're gun-shy that they lost so many battles that they

2914
02:25:33,952 --> 02:25:34,464
Lost

2915
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:40,352
The psychological Edge if you will and it becomes another one of those unquantifiable things doesn't it that affects human history

2916
02:25:40,864 --> 02:25:43,168
And we talked about intimidation on a personal level

2917
02:25:43,936 --> 02:25:46,752
But you know what happens when you get a group of skittish

2918
02:25:47,264 --> 02:25:50,336
Scared unpredictable human beings together and then try to

2919
02:25:50,592 --> 02:25:52,128
Quantify the impact

2920
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:58,784
Of the mass amount of psychological intimidation I mean if you've lost three battle to the Germans already and you're

2921
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:00,576
You're lining up to fight your fourth

2922
02:26:00,832 --> 02:26:05,952
How much does the history of how you done against them recently play into your ability to stand up to them now

2923
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:09,024
Of course if the

2924
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:10,816
Celtic people can't stand

2925
02:26:11,328 --> 02:26:15,168
Did the Germans anymore in a dog-eat-dog world what does that mean

2926
02:26:15,424 --> 02:26:18,752
Are the long-term ability of gall to remain

2927
02:26:19,008 --> 02:26:20,288
Free and independent

2928
02:26:21,312 --> 02:26:25,920
So you looking at this from the Roman Viewpoint you can kind of see how they might come to the conclusion

2929
02:26:26,176 --> 02:26:29,248
We're going to have all these German people right next to us and Gall soon

2930
02:26:31,296 --> 02:26:34,368
So Caesar goes and begins a conversation with this German leader

2931
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:37,952
Were you essentially tell the German leader look at all the stuff has to stop

2932
02:26:39,744 --> 02:26:41,280
He said he begins of Correspondence

2933
02:26:41,536 --> 02:26:42,048
Send a message

2934
02:26:42,304 --> 02:26:42,816
Umi says

2935
02:26:43,072 --> 02:26:47,424
Can we please meet halfway between our two locations because give important matters to discuss

2936
02:26:48,192 --> 02:26:49,472
This is all in Caesar commenter

2937
02:26:49,984 --> 02:26:50,496
By the way

2938
02:26:51,264 --> 02:26:53,824
He says that the German king of replied

2939
02:26:54,336 --> 02:26:57,664
Essentially if I have something to say to you

2940
02:26:57,920 --> 02:26:58,688
I come to you

2941
02:26:59,456 --> 02:27:01,248
If you have something to say to me you come to me

2942
02:27:02,784 --> 02:27:06,368
And then begins with a line of discussion that's hard to understand

2943
02:27:06,624 --> 02:27:08,416
And if you're looking at this from Caesars point of view

2944
02:27:08,928 --> 02:27:12,000
Because the German leader begins to question Caesar

2945
02:27:12,768 --> 02:27:13,280
About

2946
02:27:13,792 --> 02:27:15,072
Maybe you could say

2947
02:27:15,328 --> 02:27:16,352
The legality

2948
02:27:16,608 --> 02:27:19,168
As they would understand it in the ancient world

2949
02:27:19,936 --> 02:27:21,216
All these things he's doing

2950
02:27:21,984 --> 02:27:22,496
And sites

2951
02:27:22,752 --> 02:27:26,336
Legal arguments that you couldn't use now I mean you have to be

2952
02:27:26,592 --> 02:27:30,176
A Nazi to use arguments like right of Conquest today

2953
02:27:30,432 --> 02:27:34,272
But that was something that was actually sometimes part of the rules back then

2954
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:38,368
And this German leader will cleverly say over and over again

2955
02:27:38,624 --> 02:27:40,672
We're not doing anything you don't

2956
02:27:40,928 --> 02:27:41,440
Baidu

2957
02:27:42,464 --> 02:27:44,000
Answer why are you interfering

2958
02:27:45,536 --> 02:27:49,888
The arguments that ariovistus makes through the pain of Caesar

2959
02:27:50,400 --> 02:27:56,544
Are just as compelling as the ones that the helvetians kind of made when they were trying to ask the Romans can we please come through your Terror

2960
02:27:56,800 --> 02:27:58,848
It's a humanitarian crisis Maybe

2961
02:27:59,872 --> 02:28:01,152
Modern readership

2962
02:28:01,408 --> 02:28:04,224
As a whole different feel for it maybe then Caesars Aldean

2963
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:04,992
Kentwood

2964
02:28:05,504 --> 02:28:09,344
Because I have this just looks to the modern reader may be to be making some really good points

2965
02:28:11,648 --> 02:28:12,928
When Caesar tells him

2966
02:28:13,184 --> 02:28:19,328
In the next letter which is much more direct you will do this you will do that we're going to have problems because you're going to release the hostage

2967
02:28:19,584 --> 02:28:25,216
Did you ever realize you can stop attacking our allies you going to stop bringing more Germans from Over the Rhine River

2968
02:28:26,496 --> 02:28:27,776
Andario Vistas

2969
02:28:28,032 --> 02:28:32,128
Straight up answers him Caesar basically says with Defiance but here's the problem

2970
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:35,200
The only information you have about this is from Caesar

2971
02:28:35,712 --> 02:28:40,832
And one cent he's the best person in the world to give it to you cuz he met this guy face-to-face and talk to him

2972
02:28:41,856 --> 02:28:44,416
On the other hand he's the worst person in the world to tell this to you because

2973
02:28:44,672 --> 02:28:47,488
Nobody has more of a vested interest in slanting and his way

2974
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:48,768
Caesarstone

2975
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:50,560
The message that came back

2976
02:28:50,816 --> 02:28:56,960
From this Barbarian again but not sounding very much like a barbarian maybe Barbarian lawyers helping him out with the legalese

2977
02:28:57,216 --> 02:28:58,496
He says to Caesar

2978
02:28:59,264 --> 02:29:03,104
This is from the essay Hanford edition of Caesar quote

2979
02:29:05,152 --> 02:29:11,296
In reply all Rio Vista said that he went to recognize custom of War for Victor's to rule the vanquished

2980
02:29:11,552 --> 02:29:12,576
In any way they please

2981
02:29:12,832 --> 02:29:18,976
And that the Romans acted on this principle by governing their conquered subjects not according to the dictates of any third

2982
02:29:19,232 --> 02:29:21,024
Party what is their own discretion

2983
02:29:21,536 --> 02:29:24,352
Since you did not dictate to them how they would exercise their rights

2984
02:29:24,864 --> 02:29:27,680
You're not to be interfered with any exercise of his

2985
02:29:28,192 --> 02:29:29,472
He was because the Eid we

2986
02:29:29,984 --> 02:29:36,128
The tribe that's a lie to roam it's because the Eid we had tried the fortune of war and where the

2987
02:29:36,384 --> 02:29:38,944
The losers in the fight that they had to pay him tribute

2988
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:43,808
And Caesar was doing him a serious wrong in coming to golf and causing a loss of Revenue

2989
02:29:44,320 --> 02:29:50,464
He would not return the hostages to the eat weed but would refrain from making any wanton attack upon them or

2990
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:51,744
Other allies if

2991
02:29:52,256 --> 02:29:56,864
They kept their agreement and pay the tributes regularly every year if they did not

2992
02:29:57,120 --> 02:30:02,240
The title of Brothers of the Roman people would not save them from the consequences

2993
02:30:02,752 --> 02:30:03,776
I am not impressed

2994
02:30:04,032 --> 02:30:10,176
He concluded by Caesars threat to punish my in quotes oppression of these people

2995
02:30:10,432 --> 02:30:13,760
No one has ever fought me without bringing destruction upon himself

2996
02:30:14,272 --> 02:30:15,808
Let him attack whenever he pleases

2997
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:18,880
He will discover with German Valerie's capable of

2998
02:30:19,392 --> 02:30:20,928
We have never known defeat

2999
02:30:21,184 --> 02:30:26,048
We've had superb training in arms and for 14 years we have never shelter beneath the roof

3000
02:30:27,072 --> 02:30:27,584
And quote

3001
02:30:29,888 --> 02:30:32,448
It's easier than mine that's basically the equivalent of saying it's on

3002
02:30:33,472 --> 02:30:37,056
He starts to send his army toward the German he says the German starts

3003
02:30:37,312 --> 02:30:42,688
Send his army towards Caesar there's this strategic town that ends up between the two armies

3004
02:30:42,944 --> 02:30:44,224
Lil Ceaser going to basically

3005
02:30:44,736 --> 02:30:45,760
Going day and night Jim

3006
02:30:46,016 --> 02:30:48,320
Pushing his men to get their first get there first

3007
02:30:49,600 --> 02:30:50,112
Like all great

3008
02:30:50,624 --> 02:30:51,136
Generals

3009
02:30:51,392 --> 02:30:52,928
Understands the value of speed

3010
02:30:53,440 --> 02:30:56,256
They locked themselves in the Celtic calendar prepared to defend it

3011
02:30:56,512 --> 02:31:02,656
And all looks pretty good for Caesar except that the people that have taken over this town his soldiers start talking to the local goat

3012
02:31:02,912 --> 02:31:03,424
Tallest people

3013
02:31:03,936 --> 02:31:05,472
And those people start telling

3014
02:31:05,728 --> 02:31:07,520
Caesars troops about these German

3015
02:31:08,032 --> 02:31:11,872
And what they're like and how they can't even look them in the face

3016
02:31:12,128 --> 02:31:12,640
Without

3017
02:31:12,896 --> 02:31:13,920
And running away

3018
02:31:15,456 --> 02:31:16,992
Can seizures cause all of their gossip

3019
02:31:17,504 --> 02:31:18,784
Makes his army scared

3020
02:31:19,552 --> 02:31:24,160
And the rumors of what the Germans are like freaking out and he specifically singles out you have to love this

3021
02:31:24,416 --> 02:31:26,464
The folks back home in Rome probably did too

3022
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:28,256
Those young men on the make

3023
02:31:28,512 --> 02:31:29,536
Son of the Suns

3024
02:31:29,792 --> 02:31:31,584
Of the richest senators and whatnot

3025
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:37,984
Cool military experience on a resume before they start their running for Roman officer nothing too scary Wonder

3026
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:43,104
Maybe just a nice person with seizure look good on the resume

3027
02:31:43,360 --> 02:31:45,408
And all will be well Caesar says that when they're

3028
02:31:45,664 --> 02:31:47,456
Looking at facing these ferocious

3029
02:31:47,968 --> 02:31:48,736
Scary

3030
02:31:48,992 --> 02:31:55,136
Unknown beasts from the edge of the world that the garlic people who normally scare the Romans a little have said

3031
02:31:55,392 --> 02:31:56,160
Acecare Ross

3032
02:31:56,928 --> 02:32:00,000
Caesar says these young men on the make all of a sudden they're finding

3033
02:32:00,256 --> 02:32:02,816
Good reasons why there urgently needed back in Rome

3034
02:32:04,352 --> 02:32:05,120
He says the

3035
02:32:05,376 --> 02:32:11,008
Beer spread to the rest of the ranks in people start drawing up their wheels and he says they're breaking into

3036
02:32:11,264 --> 02:32:11,776
Tears

3037
02:32:12,032 --> 02:32:18,176
You know it's at strange times and they're the moaning their fate and all this kind of stuff which of course look Beyond it now Caesars

3038
02:32:18,432 --> 02:32:23,552
Built up his enemy so that when he conquered them he'll be that much greater he's also creating a need in the Army for him

3039
02:32:24,064 --> 02:32:27,392
Cuz he's going to go in there and with a combination of shaming people

3040
02:32:27,648 --> 02:32:29,440
But also logical arguments

3041
02:32:29,696 --> 02:32:31,744
I throw in a little bit of

3042
02:32:32,512 --> 02:32:34,048
Theater and you know you can

3043
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:39,168
Caesar says anyway with the Army into shape and let's be honest we seen this with other great generals also

3044
02:32:39,936 --> 02:32:41,216
Soften the quality

3045
02:32:41,472 --> 02:32:43,008
The people associate with great generals

3046
02:32:43,264 --> 02:32:46,080
Write the ability to turn around the morale of your troops and rally them

3047
02:32:48,384 --> 02:32:51,200
Caesar says then as soon as the German approaches

3048
02:32:51,456 --> 02:32:57,600
That the king of the Germans already Vista says okay now that I'm here we can have this discussion you wanted to have and Caesar has this wonderful moment where they meet

3049
02:32:58,112 --> 02:33:00,672
Unlike a hill in the middle of a giant

3050
02:33:00,928 --> 02:33:07,072
In a flat area and they weren't allowed to bring their Army's close to each other so their armies are like in the distance and only 10

3051
02:33:07,328 --> 02:33:12,448
Guys on Horseback or supposed to accompany each leader and were told they have the conversation in garlic

3052
02:33:13,472 --> 02:33:13,984
So

3053
02:33:14,240 --> 02:33:18,080
This German King supposedly speaks Golic and Caesar probably had a good friend

3054
02:33:18,336 --> 02:33:19,104
Translate forum

3055
02:33:19,360 --> 02:33:21,664
Caesars has basically the same thing it said in the note

3056
02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:25,760
To the German ruler and the German ruler says something similar to what you said before back

3057
02:33:26,272 --> 02:33:28,064
In a questioning Caesars right to do this

3058
02:33:28,320 --> 02:33:30,368
Pointing out that we all live by the same rules

3059
02:33:30,624 --> 02:33:33,696
You conquer your people and you decide what happens to him afterwards that

3060
02:33:33,952 --> 02:33:34,976
Where we live by

3061
02:33:36,768 --> 02:33:40,608
And then he says and it's a wonderful line when he questioned seizures motor

3062
02:33:42,144 --> 02:33:43,680
And he says I think all this

3063
02:33:44,448 --> 02:33:46,752
Is just so much pretense

3064
02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:49,824
Or you coming here to crush me

3065
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:55,200
And then he says unless you take your army out of this country right now

3066
02:33:55,456 --> 02:33:56,992
You know he's going to finish these

3067
02:33:57,504 --> 02:34:02,624
And then he tells him but if you do leave right now I'll be happy to be your muscle man hearing

3068
02:34:03,136 --> 02:34:09,280
Germany and in Gaul in anytime you need a favor you wanted to have to lift a finger and I'll do it for you so it's a little bit of a carrot-and-stick soda

3069
02:34:09,536 --> 02:34:12,608
Once again if you were a neutral arbitrator

3070
02:34:12,864 --> 02:34:15,424
You might say something like hey that's not a bad deal

3071
02:34:17,472 --> 02:34:18,496
So let's stop for a minute

3072
02:34:19,776 --> 02:34:25,920
That you're really dying at this point in the story for an outsider's Viewpoint anyone else besides Caesar here cuz he's really

3073
02:34:26,176 --> 02:34:29,248
At this point why is he putting these sorts of

3074
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:34,880
You know accusatory good arguments into the mouth of one of his characters that he wants

3075
02:34:35,136 --> 02:34:37,184
You two want him to conquer

3076
02:34:38,464 --> 02:34:41,536
You mentioned earlier there were a couple of Roman writer that came after Caesar

3077
02:34:41,792 --> 02:34:47,680
I see Tony is his one and that's not very long after Caesar about a century-and-a-half for two centuries afterwards is a guy named Cassius Dio

3078
02:34:48,960 --> 02:34:50,752
Ideal has a much more

3079
02:34:51,008 --> 02:34:51,776
Gritty

3080
02:34:52,288 --> 02:34:56,384
View of Caesar in his motivations and essentially is one of those guys that falls in the camper

3081
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:57,664
Cc's are doing this

3082
02:34:58,176 --> 02:34:59,712
The most basic reasons you can think of

3083
02:35:00,480 --> 02:35:03,296
He's involved in this Monumental Gamble

3084
02:35:03,808 --> 02:35:09,952
In the politics of Rome where his involvement in this region risking his life and devoting his entire exist

3085
02:35:11,488 --> 02:35:13,280
To this cause and gall

3086
02:35:13,536 --> 02:35:17,120
Is only because of what benefits he can glean from it

3087
02:35:17,376 --> 02:35:18,656
In the politics of Rome

3088
02:35:20,192 --> 02:35:24,032
And he desperately in need of things like money and Conquest

3089
02:35:24,288 --> 02:35:24,800
And

3090
02:35:25,312 --> 02:35:27,360
Honors and he's got to keep

3091
02:35:27,872 --> 02:35:28,384
This

3092
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:31,968
Military command going because the the moment that his

3093
02:35:32,224 --> 02:35:33,760
Term in office is over

3094
02:35:34,016 --> 02:35:38,368
He's prosecutable by his enemies in their licking their chops back in room waiting to get to him

3095
02:35:39,904 --> 02:35:40,928
At the same time

3096
02:35:41,440 --> 02:35:41,952
You know

3097
02:35:42,208 --> 02:35:48,352
At least at this point in history he has to assume that this is not a permanent command so he's on a bit of a Time Clock of Caesar real

3098
02:35:48,608 --> 02:35:53,728
Really wants to do these great things he's going to end up doing in golf he's got a limited amount of time to do it

3099
02:35:53,984 --> 02:35:58,848
And Cassius Dio as one of the people that says that everything Caesars doing here is the equivalent of

3100
02:35:59,360 --> 02:36:01,152
Poking the Germans with a stick

3101
02:36:02,176 --> 02:36:05,248
Trying to get them all roused up so you have an excuse

3102
02:36:05,504 --> 02:36:06,784
To go in there and kill a bunch of

3103
02:36:09,088 --> 02:36:11,136
Deal by-the-way confuses us

3104
02:36:11,392 --> 02:36:12,160
Entirely

3105
02:36:12,672 --> 02:36:16,256
By saying that all Rio Vista sitting the king of the Germans he's a can of account

3106
02:36:18,304 --> 02:36:19,840
That means one of two things either

3107
02:36:20,608 --> 02:36:24,960
Cassius Dio is a lazy Roman ethnographer and there were plenty

3108
02:36:25,728 --> 02:36:27,520
And doesn't really draw a distinction

3109
02:36:28,032 --> 02:36:29,568
But if he's accurate

3110
02:36:30,080 --> 02:36:33,920
Then you have to say well why did Caesar call him in German what's the point

3111
02:36:34,176 --> 02:36:38,272
A Caesar doing that what does he gain by creating this new group of people

3112
02:36:38,528 --> 02:36:41,088
It may have been a generic name

3113
02:36:41,344 --> 02:36:45,440
Once Upon a Time only apply to One Tribe in modern-day germ

3114
02:36:47,232 --> 02:36:48,512
This from my Herbert

3115
02:36:48,768 --> 02:36:50,816
Baldwin Foster Edition by the way

3116
02:36:51,584 --> 02:36:52,352
I should point out the

3117
02:36:52,608 --> 02:36:53,120
Videos

3118
02:36:53,376 --> 02:36:55,168
Pronouns and use of pronouns simatai

3119
02:36:55,424 --> 02:36:56,448
I'm confusing. I'm going to

3120
02:36:56,704 --> 02:36:59,008
Insert the name of the person he's talking about

3121
02:36:59,776 --> 02:37:00,544
Pronounce Odin makes

3122
02:37:00,800 --> 02:37:01,312
ScoreSense

3123

Deal rights

3124
02:37:04,896 --> 02:37:06,944
No ariovistus was the ruler of those

3125
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:07,712
Celts

3126
02:37:07,968 --> 02:37:11,040
Is Dominion has been ratified by actions of the Romans

3127
02:37:11,296 --> 02:37:14,880
Any been registered among their friends and allies by Caesar himself

3128
02:37:15,136 --> 02:37:15,904
In his console

3129
02:37:16,672 --> 02:37:21,024
In comparison however with the glory to be derived from the war

3130
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:25,632
In the power which That Glory would bring the Roman general Caesar

3131
02:37:25,888 --> 02:37:27,680
He did none of those considerations

3132
02:37:27,936 --> 02:37:32,800
Except as insofar as he wished to get some excuse for the coral from the Barbarian

3133
02:37:33,056 --> 02:37:36,128
So that should not be thought that there was any grievance against him

3134
02:37:36,384 --> 02:37:37,664
Caesar at the start

3135
02:37:38,176 --> 02:37:40,224
Therefore he sent for REO Vista

3136
02:37:40,736 --> 02:37:43,296
Pretending that he wanted to hold some conversation with

3137
02:37:44,064 --> 02:37:46,624
Ariovistus instead of obeying replied

3138
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:48,928
And this is close to Caesars on description

3139
02:37:50,464 --> 02:37:54,048
Is Caesar wishes to tell me anything let him come himself to me

3140
02:37:54,304 --> 02:38:00,448
I am not in any way inferior to him and a man who has need of anyone must always go to that person

3141
02:38:01,472 --> 02:38:06,336
That's if Caesar showed anger on the grounds that REO Vista said insulted all the Rome

3142
02:38:06,848 --> 02:38:11,200
MCS are immediately demanded of REO Vistas the hostages of the allies

3143
02:38:11,456 --> 02:38:14,528
And forbade him either to set foot on their land

3144
02:38:14,784 --> 02:38:17,856
What are bring against the many auxiliary force from home

3145
02:38:18,368 --> 02:38:23,744
This seizure did not do with the idea of scaring him but because he hoped to make him Furious

3146
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:25,024
And by that means

3147
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:27,840
To gain a great and fitting pretext for the war

3148
02:38:28,096 --> 02:38:29,888
What was expected took place

3149
02:38:30,144 --> 02:38:35,008
The Barbarian and rage that the injunctions made a long and outrageous reply

3150
02:38:35,264 --> 02:38:37,312
So that caesar no longer bandied words

3151
02:38:38,592 --> 02:38:39,104
And quote

3152
02:38:40,896 --> 02:38:42,688
That's a completely different view isn't it

3153
02:38:44,736 --> 02:38:45,760
Cassius Dio also

3154
02:38:46,016 --> 02:38:47,040
So gives a very different

3155
02:38:48,320 --> 02:38:53,184
I'm Caesar rallying his terrified Romans in the gallic town we just discuss

3156
02:38:53,952 --> 02:38:56,000
Rather than being one of the few

3157
02:38:56,256 --> 02:38:57,536
Non terrifying

3158
02:38:57,792 --> 02:39:01,632
People who can then spread his lack of fear to his entire Army

3159
02:39:02,144 --> 02:39:03,680
Deal basically has

3160
02:39:04,704 --> 02:39:10,848
The troops looking at what they're up against and thinking maybe that they shouldn't even be up against their not so mad at the

3161
02:39:11,104 --> 02:39:14,944
Germans they're mad at the guy who put them in a situation where they should be fighting the germ

3162
02:39:16,992 --> 02:39:19,296
According to do they are very aware

3163
02:39:19,808 --> 02:39:25,952
Of what role they play in this whole thing of the ponds and seizures game to further seizures career

3164
02:39:28,512 --> 02:39:31,584
And they also seem to realize politically speaking

3165
02:39:32,352 --> 02:39:35,680
That this is outside the boundaries Maybe

3166
02:39:36,192 --> 02:39:40,544
I'm with the Romans themselves would consider a legal military venture

3167
02:39:41,056 --> 02:39:42,336
Cassius Dio size

3168
02:39:42,848 --> 02:39:44,384
It when these Romans are scared

3169
02:39:45,152 --> 02:39:45,920
And I call it

3170
02:39:46,176 --> 02:39:46,688
Town

3171
02:39:46,944 --> 02:39:49,504
It's scared cuz they keep hearing about the Germans and the Germans are

3172
02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:51,808
Becoming he says it leaves them deeply did Jack

3173
02:39:52,320 --> 02:39:53,344
And then he says quote

3174
02:39:54,112 --> 02:39:56,416
Alarmed by the statue of their enemies

3175
02:39:56,672 --> 02:40:00,256
By their numbers their boldness and consequent ready threats

3176
02:40:00,512 --> 02:40:03,584
They were in such a mood is to feel that they were going to contend

3177
02:40:03,840 --> 02:40:07,680
Not against man but against uncanny and Ferocious Beast

3178
02:40:08,448 --> 02:40:10,752
And the talk was that they were undertaking a war

3179
02:40:11,008 --> 02:40:12,288
Which was none of their business

3180
02:40:12,544 --> 02:40:13,824
I did not mean to create

3181
02:40:14,336 --> 02:40:17,152
Merely on account of Caesar's personal ambition

3182
02:40:17,408 --> 02:40:21,760
And they threatened also to leave him in the Lurch if he should not change his course

3183
02:40:22,272 --> 02:40:22,784
And quote

3184
02:40:24,320 --> 02:40:26,624
That's not a bunch of scared soldiers who get

3185
02:40:27,136 --> 02:40:28,160
Their Fear

3186
02:40:28,672 --> 02:40:32,256
Rallied out of them by a charismatic leader this is a bunch of

3187
02:40:32,512 --> 02:40:34,304
Troops who fully realize

3188
02:40:34,560 --> 02:40:38,144
What's going on here are angry at their leader for putting them

3189
02:40:38,400 --> 02:40:40,192
In this position and are threatening

3190
02:40:40,448 --> 02:40:42,496
Mutiny if he doesn't change

3191
02:40:42,752 --> 02:40:44,288
The course he's on I mean

3192
02:40:44,544 --> 02:40:46,592
That's a very different story right there isn't it

3193
02:40:48,384 --> 02:40:50,688
I'm not sure it really matters though in terms of

3194
02:40:50,944 --> 02:40:52,480
How it reflects on Caesars room

3195
02:40:52,736 --> 02:40:54,528
Reputation because either way

3196
02:40:55,552 --> 02:40:56,832
It really says something about the

3197
02:40:57,088 --> 02:40:57,856
The guy that he was able to

3198
02:40:58,112 --> 02:40:58,624
Rally those

3199
02:40:58,880 --> 02:40:59,392
Troops

3200
02:41:00,160 --> 02:41:04,256
And put them in a position in a state of mind where they could face this German lead

3201
02:41:04,512 --> 02:41:05,792
Either a king

3202
02:41:06,560 --> 02:41:07,584
Maybe ariovistus

3203
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:08,864
Person elected Worley

3204
02:41:09,888 --> 02:41:10,400
Confederation

3205
02:41:10,656 --> 02:41:11,424
It's argue

3206
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:12,192
YouTube out

3207
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:18,592
But that's a guy ariovistus who has the entirely central part in in fact you could say most of Gaul

3208
02:41:18,848 --> 02:41:19,872
Howard by his

3209
02:41:20,128 --> 02:41:21,408
Power and authority

3210
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:22,944
Procedure turns these

3211
02:41:23,712 --> 02:41:27,040
Either mutinous or petrified with fear or some combination of the

3212
02:41:27,296 --> 02:41:28,064
2 troops

3213
02:41:28,576 --> 02:41:30,368
And get them out in the field against this guy

3214
02:41:32,416 --> 02:41:38,560
Now the way the battleships up supposedly is it starts with a bunch of maneuvering this is the very unsexy

3215
02:41:38,816 --> 02:41:39,328
Decide

3216
02:41:40,096 --> 02:41:41,120
A military history

3217
02:41:42,144 --> 02:41:42,656
People like yours

3218
02:41:42,912 --> 02:41:43,424
Truly like

3219
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:45,216
Cut right to the chase we like our nice

3220
02:41:45,728 --> 02:41:47,264
In a well-organized and set up

3221
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:48,800
Filled bottles in a nice

3222
02:41:49,056 --> 02:41:52,128
Level Valley where you've had a lot of time for both sides

3223
02:41:52,384 --> 02:41:53,152
The setup and then you have

3224
02:41:53,408 --> 02:41:54,432
You are super big encounter

3225
02:41:55,968 --> 02:41:56,736
But truthfully

3226
02:41:57,248 --> 02:42:00,832
In Real History of one of the generals had done his job or her job

3227
02:42:01,344 --> 02:42:05,696
You should have the other side beaten by the time you get to that point

3228
02:42:06,208 --> 02:42:12,352
And it's sometimes the big maneuvering on the Strategic level that does that but sometimes it's just a little shading here

3229
02:42:12,864 --> 02:42:15,168
And the slight Advantage there and they all light up

3230
02:42:17,216 --> 02:42:18,240
Generals throughout history

3231
02:42:18,496 --> 02:42:20,032
Almost neurotic

3232
02:42:20,288 --> 02:42:22,080
Think about figuring out the little elements

3233
02:42:22,336 --> 02:42:23,616
How to gain advantage

3234
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:29,504
And there are quite a few different periods in history where because of the military

3235
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:31,296
Technology in the limitations

3236
02:42:31,808 --> 02:42:37,952
If both sides didn't actively want to fight a battle sometimes it didn't happen if one side wanted to avoid it

3237
02:42:38,208 --> 02:42:39,744
Often times it was easy to do

3238
02:42:40,512 --> 02:42:42,048
The seventeenth and eighteenth century

3239
02:42:42,304 --> 02:42:42,816
Probably

3240
02:42:43,072 --> 02:42:45,888
Like the high-water mark of that a few hundred years ago where

3241
02:42:46,144 --> 02:42:47,424
Because of the way things were

3242
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:49,984
Enough once I didn't want to fight a battle that almost never have

3243
02:42:50,752 --> 02:42:53,824
Sonus. Caesar and the German Commander

3244
02:42:54,080 --> 02:42:57,152
Are both sort of jockeying for position and maneuvering

3245
02:42:58,176 --> 02:42:59,712
And one of the things about the Romans

3246
02:42:59,968 --> 02:43:00,736
That makes them so

3247
02:43:00,992 --> 02:43:05,600
Again another unsexy side of military history but the Roman soldiers are about 1/2

3248
02:43:06,112 --> 02:43:07,136
Devastating

3249
02:43:07,392 --> 02:43:07,904
Soldier

3250
02:43:08,416 --> 02:43:10,208
And about half construction worker

3251
02:43:11,232 --> 02:43:13,024
And these people could set up

3252
02:43:13,280 --> 02:43:14,560
Fortifications

3253
02:43:15,328 --> 02:43:16,352
In real time

3254
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:18,912
In a way that actually effective

3255
02:43:19,168 --> 02:43:19,936
The battles

3256
02:43:20,192 --> 02:43:24,544
Situation of the maneuvering actually takes

3257
02:43:25,056 --> 02:43:26,592
The form of both sides

3258
02:43:27,360 --> 02:43:30,944
Trying to March around the other encamp on their lines of supply

3259
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:31,712
Cut them off

3260
02:43:32,992 --> 02:43:39,136
When the Germans did it they would take wagons and what not supposedly with them and sort of put them in a circle like

3261
02:43:39,648 --> 02:43:41,184
Pioneers in the old west used

3262
02:43:41,440 --> 02:43:44,000
Of course they have a lot more wagons were talking about a lot

3263
02:43:44,512 --> 02:43:45,024
Your structures

3264
02:43:45,280 --> 02:43:48,864
But when the Romans would build a calf even a small sub cap

3265
02:43:49,376 --> 02:43:51,424
They would build it like an Old Fort

3266
02:43:51,936 --> 02:43:53,216
In the old American West

3267
02:43:53,472 --> 02:43:54,752
You know we were talking about what

3268
02:43:55,008 --> 02:43:55,520
Timber

3269
02:43:56,032 --> 02:43:57,056
Garden Tower

3270
02:43:57,568 --> 02:43:59,872
And maybe even artillery in the guard

3271
02:44:00,128 --> 02:44:01,920
Towers in the Romans were so good at this

3272
02:44:02,432 --> 02:44:05,504
And often did it every night when they were out in the field

3273
02:44:05,760 --> 02:44:11,904
They had this down to a science and everybody knew exactly where to go and how to do and what are we going to look out the layout was always the same

3274
02:44:12,160 --> 02:44:13,440
So when the Romans

3275
02:44:13,696 --> 02:44:15,488
Camped on your line of supply

3276
02:44:15,744 --> 02:44:20,608
You wake up the next morning and there would be a fort there where there was Open Country the day before

3277
02:44:22,144 --> 02:44:22,912
So then

3278
02:44:23,168 --> 02:44:27,008
After the initial maneuverings once the Romans have this sport in too good of a position

3279
02:44:27,264 --> 02:44:33,408
The Germans are launching attacks against the fort and those are beating off and there's a bunch of this kind of preliminary but still pretty

3280
02:44:33,664 --> 02:44:35,200
Large-scale skirmishing

3281
02:44:35,712 --> 02:44:41,856
Before Caesar maybe some historians think is beginning to have Supply problems himself that a lot more

3282
02:44:42,112 --> 02:44:43,648
Are the natives around him here

3283
02:44:43,904 --> 02:44:48,256
And he seems to be in danger and needing to fight a battle or get out

3284
02:44:49,536 --> 02:44:50,816
So he says he

3285
02:44:51,328 --> 02:44:54,656
Straws the Army up in battle formation and marches it out toward the germ

3286
02:44:54,912 --> 02:44:56,192
On several occasions by

3287
02:44:57,472 --> 02:44:58,752
By this time.

3288
02:44:59,008 --> 02:45:01,312
The Roman battle formation by the way

3289
02:45:01,568 --> 02:45:04,896
Is 3 big lines deep usually

3290
02:45:05,152 --> 02:45:07,200
Caesar says that's the way he lines up and just so you know

3291
02:45:07,456 --> 02:45:08,992
That means a different thing from Rent

3292
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:11,808
Ranks of the number of troops that are lined up

3293
02:45:12,064 --> 02:45:13,856
You the one behind the other

3294
02:45:14,112 --> 02:45:18,976
And often times each of these lines is between Genesis not just for Romans for anyone

3295
02:45:19,488 --> 02:45:21,280
For to like 16 ranks.

3296
02:45:21,536 --> 02:45:25,120
Pike formation maybe 12 or 16 rank the Romans more 4 to 8

3297
02:45:25,632 --> 02:45:31,008
But then you'll be a dead zone if maybe 50 yards 30 yards a hundred yards

3298
02:45:31,264 --> 02:45:33,312
And it'll be another line of men lined up in

3299
02:45:33,824 --> 02:45:37,152
This would be the Roman second-line and then the Romans would often have a third line

3300
02:45:38,176 --> 02:45:42,784
This seems like common sense when you think about it today but in the ancient world this is very unusual

3301
02:45:43,296 --> 02:45:44,576
The Romans have reserved

3302
02:45:45,344 --> 02:45:48,160
And time and again it will save them in these battles because

3303
02:45:48,672 --> 02:45:54,816
They will find out if something's going wrong someplace and guess what we have about 20 to 25% of our total Force

3304
02:45:55,072 --> 02:45:56,864
Just sitting back there

3305
02:45:57,120 --> 02:46:00,192
Throw them into the troubled area and time and again it saves them

3306
02:46:01,984 --> 02:46:03,775
In this battle Caesar is

3307
02:46:04,031 --> 02:46:08,895
Very cut-and-dry remember this is not a true history he's writing this is supposed to be sort of

3308
02:46:09,151 --> 02:46:10,431
In the format of

3309
02:46:10,687 --> 02:46:12,479
You know dispatches from the front

3310
02:46:12,991 --> 02:46:14,527
And sometimes she'll talk about

3311
02:46:15,039 --> 02:46:20,927
You know what's going on in the battle at length but you would think with a really important one like this one he go into great detail and he doesn't

3312
02:46:22,207 --> 02:46:23,487
He basically says

3313
02:46:23,743 --> 02:46:25,791
When the real Clash of arms comes

3314
02:46:26,559 --> 02:46:31,167
This bottle was supposed to have been fought most historians thinking what's now Alsace but no one's sure

3315
02:46:31,679 --> 02:46:34,495
Probably on the West Bank of the Rhine somewhere

3316
02:46:35,519 --> 02:46:39,103
The Romans probably had in the neighborhood of thirty thousand men

3317
02:46:39,359 --> 02:46:40,639
The Germans who knows

3318
02:46:41,663 --> 02:46:42,431
Usually Sefa

3319
02:46:42,687 --> 02:46:46,271
I'm 50 200,000 although you get the occasional outlier

3320
02:46:46,783 --> 02:46:49,343
I love hamster Brooke as you now and he's usually a great

3321
02:46:49,855 --> 02:46:55,231
Neutral arbitrator unless there's Germans involved in which case he's got his Homer glasses on

3322
02:46:55,487 --> 02:46:56,511
He doesn't see things

3323
02:46:56,767 --> 02:46:59,327
As unbiased he thinks the Romans

3324
02:46:59,839 --> 02:47:01,119
Outnumbered the Germans

3325
02:47:01,375 --> 02:47:04,191
He's unusual so we'll set him aside there and just assume the Romans

3326
02:47:04,447 --> 02:47:07,519
We're probably somewhat outnumbered perhaps 2 to 1

3327
02:47:07,775 --> 02:47:09,311
In the worst case scenario

3328
02:47:10,847 --> 02:47:15,967
Caesar says that the battle takes place so quickly there's no time for the usual exchange of missiles

3329
02:47:16,223 --> 02:47:19,295
The Romans love to throw those heavy jollands they do a lot of damage

3330
02:47:19,807 --> 02:47:24,671
When you throw them in all at once hundreds of thousands of men throwing these heavy javelins all at once

3331
02:47:25,183 --> 02:47:30,815
But the Germans and the Romans end up charging each other too quickly for that and it gets right to a sword slog right away

3332
02:47:31,839 --> 02:47:33,887
Caesar says that the flank he's on

3333
02:47:34,143 --> 02:47:37,983
Begins to push the German flag opposite them back

3334
02:47:38,751 --> 02:47:44,127
But that the other Roman flanked on the far side of the battlefield is being overwhelmed by the German numbers

3335
02:47:44,639 --> 02:47:45,663
He then says

3336
02:47:45,919 --> 02:47:49,503
That a Roman officer that he names by name

3337
02:47:49,759 --> 02:47:55,903
Because he's on Horseback can see the problem from a distance of realize oh somebody better order the third law

3338
02:47:56,159 --> 02:48:00,767
It's not doing anything right now in to fix the situation and he does so when he saved the Bible

3339
02:48:03,071 --> 02:48:05,375
Cedar by the way name this person as

3340
02:48:06,143 --> 02:48:11,263
The son of the richest guy in Rome Crassus who if you recall is one of the

3341
02:48:11,519 --> 02:48:14,591
Members of the first triumvirate along with Caesar

3342
02:48:15,103 --> 02:48:17,151
And Tom P so you see in a way

3343
02:48:17,663 --> 02:48:19,711
Caesar still doesn't forget

3344
02:48:20,223 --> 02:48:23,807
You know where his bread is buttered and how to play the wonderful game of

3345
02:48:24,063 --> 02:48:26,879
Politics and you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours

3346
02:48:27,391 --> 02:48:33,535
Caesar was allegedly not able to leave Rome at one point because his creditors wouldn't let him out of the city

3347
02:48:34,047 --> 02:48:36,351
Until crashes pay the bill

3348
02:48:36,607 --> 02:48:41,727
Well now all of a sudden here in this battle where Caesar doesn't go into depth about much of anything

3349
02:48:41,983 --> 02:48:44,799
He goes out of his way to mention a single individual

3350
02:48:45,055 --> 02:48:48,383
The son of the guy who paid the debts for him and oh by the way

3351
02:48:48,639 --> 02:48:52,479
He's basically saying without that guy you know we lost that battle against the German

3352
02:48:52,735 --> 02:48:54,271
That's a little bit of a

3353
02:48:54,783 --> 02:48:56,319
Honor to the family isn't it

3354
02:48:57,087 --> 02:48:59,903
So maybe paying back a favor or maybe

3355
02:49:00,671 --> 02:49:06,303
Putting crashes in debt for a future one nonetheless Caesars never far from playing the game

3356
02:49:07,327 --> 02:49:10,143
In this case the game is deadly as you might imagine

3357
02:49:11,167 --> 02:49:13,727
These Germans once again or supposed to have come

3358
02:49:14,239 --> 02:49:20,383
With the wagons in the families and the women on the wagons you know where the disheveled hair screaming at the

3359
02:49:20,639 --> 02:49:22,943
The Men Please Don't Let Us fall into slavery

3360
02:49:23,455 --> 02:49:28,063
The problem with having all these women and wagons on the battlefield is obviously that at some point

3361
02:49:28,575 --> 02:49:31,135
The battle moves from where it started

3362
02:49:31,903 --> 02:49:32,671
To the wagon

3363
02:49:32,927 --> 02:49:35,487
And the people in the wagons and once again we have

3364
02:49:35,743 --> 02:49:36,511
A bottle where

3365
02:49:37,279 --> 02:49:41,887
It's implied more than laid out for you but that the Romans kill a lot of civilians including

3366
02:49:42,399 --> 02:49:47,263
I'm some of the relatives of Arya Vistas who somehow gets away but we don't hear any more from him

3367
02:49:48,287 --> 02:49:49,311
The Germans will run

3368
02:49:49,567 --> 02:49:51,871
Miles to the Rhine Caesar size

3369
02:49:52,127 --> 02:49:58,271
There will be more Germans that are just about to come over and help as soon as they hear about the big defeat of aurea Vista turn around and go home

3370
02:50:00,063 --> 02:50:06,207
What's Caesars doing here from a macro perspective though if you think about it isn't there were a bunch of powers

3371
02:50:06,975 --> 02:50:13,119
That were the power Brokers in this region before Caesar intervened and that would have been last year so think about how quickly every

3372
02:50:13,375 --> 02:50:13,887
Things happening

3373
02:50:14,143 --> 02:50:15,167
Caesar has

3374
02:50:15,423 --> 02:50:19,007
Essentially neutered one of them the helvetian one of most powerful tribes

3375
02:50:19,263 --> 02:50:23,103
Of the count is now a shadow of what it was just months before

3376
02:50:23,359 --> 02:50:24,639
Cousin what teacher did do it

3377
02:50:24,895 --> 02:50:25,663
And now this

3378
02:50:26,943 --> 02:50:27,967
Player from out

3379
02:50:28,223 --> 02:50:29,759
Side the Stratego

3380
02:50:30,015 --> 02:50:30,783
Or risk

3381
02:50:31,039 --> 02:50:35,647
Mat board who come in and intervened and garlic politics is smashed in

3382
02:50:35,903 --> 02:50:39,231
Packing back over the Rhine this thing that Caesar portrays is a border

3383
02:50:41,791 --> 02:50:43,071
What's crazy to think about

3384
02:50:43,327 --> 02:50:45,887
Is that all of this has happened in the year 58 BCE

3385
02:50:47,423 --> 02:50:52,799
Because when you think about the ancient world you think about a world that in many cases moves much more slowly than the modern

3386
02:50:53,823 --> 02:50:55,871
And yet Caesar has a blitzkrieg

3387
02:50:56,127 --> 02:50:56,639
Going on

3388
02:50:56,895 --> 02:50:57,407
Mingle

3389
02:50:58,943 --> 02:51:01,759
He says and some historians will date three battle some

3390
02:51:02,015 --> 02:51:04,319
Some will day two battles depending on whether you consider that

3391
02:51:04,575 --> 02:51:06,367
For slaughtering the helvetians

3392
02:51:06,623 --> 02:51:10,719
When 1/4 of their number were caught on on the far side of the river to be a bottle or not

3393
02:51:11,231 --> 02:51:12,511
But nonetheless in that one

3394
02:51:12,767 --> 02:51:16,607
Really six to eight months because they don't campaign most of the time in the winter

3395
02:51:16,863 --> 02:51:18,911
Caesar. All this damage and changed

3396
02:51:19,167 --> 02:51:19,679
The

3397
02:51:19,935 --> 02:51:21,727
The power structure of this reading

3398
02:51:21,983 --> 02:51:28,127
If he thought it was destabilize before he got involved in that was the excuse for getting involved he's totally destabilize

3399
02:51:28,383 --> 02:51:28,895
Now

3400
02:51:30,431 --> 02:51:31,199
But winter is coming

3401
02:51:31,455 --> 02:51:32,735
So what is Cesar do

3402
02:51:33,247 --> 02:51:38,623
Well he puts his army and winter quarters and he goes back to the area just north of Rome to keep an eye on Roman pal

3403
02:51:38,879 --> 02:51:40,415
What you think about his next move

3404
02:51:40,927 --> 02:51:41,695
Here's the thing

3405
02:51:43,231 --> 02:51:46,303
You could make a case if you wanted to and some have

3406
02:51:46,815 --> 02:51:49,375
Did everything Caesar just accomplished was done

3407
02:51:49,631 --> 02:51:52,447
You know in a crisis situation in Hot Pursuit

3408
02:51:53,727 --> 02:51:59,871
Whether it was the migration of the helvetians which is you know as we said earlier it's like if you woke up this morning and found 200,000 people

3409
02:52:00,383 --> 02:52:01,663
You on your border just

3410
02:52:01,919 --> 02:52:08,063
Unexpectedly be some sort of a crisis so that's the way Caesar portrays it so if you give him the benefit of the doubt you say will you know he had to react you couldn't go

3411
02:52:08,319 --> 02:52:10,623
Ask for votes and Authority

3412
02:52:10,879 --> 02:52:11,903
What part of what you do is that

3413
02:52:12,415 --> 02:52:13,951
Head of the problems you go in there and you

3414
02:52:14,207 --> 02:52:20,351
You roll with the punches so Caesar had to do that and then the Germans and their involvement I mean that was also the same thing mean they were

3415
02:52:20,607 --> 02:52:22,143
Coming over the Border was getting worse you had

3416
02:52:22,399 --> 02:52:23,679
He was a critical situation

3417
02:52:24,959 --> 02:52:26,239
But now you're taking the winter off

3418
02:52:26,495 --> 02:52:29,055
We go from a hot blood situation to Cold Blood

3419
02:52:29,567 --> 02:52:31,615
Will you can think about what you want to do now

3420
02:52:33,151 --> 02:52:34,431
I love the way Tom Holland

3421
02:52:34,687 --> 02:52:35,455
As an author he's great

3422
02:52:35,711 --> 02:52:37,247
Building a sense of suspense in

3423
02:52:37,759 --> 02:52:39,551
And he portrays the Gauls

3424
02:52:39,807 --> 02:52:40,319
At this point

3425
02:52:40,575 --> 02:52:42,111
In his book Rubicon

3426
02:52:42,623 --> 02:52:45,183
A sort of waking up together to the fact

3427
02:52:45,695 --> 02:52:49,791
That they're in the process of being conquered it's a strange thing but it's happening so quickly

3428
02:52:50,303 --> 02:52:52,351
And because the garlic tribes are

3429
02:52:52,863 --> 02:52:54,655
In a separate from each other

3430
02:52:55,167 --> 02:53:01,311
If they conquered the tribe next to you does that mean you're being conquered will not necessarily and you might

3431
02:53:01,567 --> 02:53:02,591
Might not be too panicked

3432
02:53:02,847 --> 02:53:08,735
But if enough of the big tribe near you are being conquered and if you happen to know just a little of the history

3433
02:53:08,991 --> 02:53:12,063
A Roman Behavior another Celtic areas

3434
02:53:12,319 --> 02:53:16,671
Spain for example or Northern Italy or what's now southern France

3435
02:53:17,183 --> 02:53:19,231
You understand that these Romans have a track record

3436
02:53:19,999 --> 02:53:23,839
They come in they defeat the Celtic people they begin to settle

3437
02:53:24,095 --> 02:53:30,239
And in a generation or to the Celtic people become short-haired Galls in a couple of generations after that they become toga wearing Gaul

3438
02:53:31,775 --> 02:53:32,799
And Tom Holland

3439
02:53:33,055 --> 02:53:34,591
Present this case where

3440
02:53:34,847 --> 02:53:40,223
Once Caesar puts his troops in Winter quarters in the middle of God

3441
02:53:40,735 --> 02:53:42,527
It sends a signal to everyone

3442
02:53:42,783 --> 02:53:43,295
I hate waiting

3443
02:53:44,319 --> 02:53:45,599
Easier to stay

3444
02:53:46,367 --> 02:53:51,231
And if we're going to prevent a complete takeover as has happened to other Celtic peoples

3445
02:53:52,511 --> 02:53:55,071
It's time to get serious about defending this place Tom Holland right

3446
02:53:55,327 --> 02:53:55,839
Quote

3447
02:53:57,375 --> 02:54:00,191
That winter of 5857 BC

3448
02:54:00,447 --> 02:54:03,775
Rather than withdrawing his Legions back into his province

3449
02:54:04,031 --> 02:54:07,359
Caesar left them billeted 100 miles north of the frontier

3450
02:54:07,615 --> 02:54:10,943
Jeep in the territory of a supposedly independent tribe

3451
02:54:11,455 --> 02:54:15,295
Once again and it legal measure was justified by the proconsul

3452
02:54:15,551 --> 02:54:17,087
As an active forward defense

3453
02:54:17,599 --> 02:54:20,927
This was an argument that may have satisfied public opinion back in Rome

3454
02:54:21,439 --> 02:54:25,279
What did nothing to ease a mounting sense of outrage and Gall itself

3455
02:54:25,535 --> 02:54:30,399
The full implications of seizures new policy we're by now starting to hit home

3456
02:54:30,655 --> 02:54:35,263
What precisely would satisfy the Romans desire for a defensible frontier

3457
02:54:35,775 --> 02:54:37,311
If the Rhine to the east

3458
02:54:37,567 --> 02:54:39,359
Then why not the channel to the north

3459
02:54:39,615 --> 02:54:41,407
What are you laughing Coast to the West

3460
02:54:42,175 --> 02:54:44,479
Across Frozen forest and field

3461
02:54:44,735 --> 02:54:46,015
From Village to Village

3462
02:54:46,527 --> 02:54:50,623
From Chieftains Hall to Chieftains Hall the same rumor was born

3463
02:54:51,135 --> 02:54:54,207
The Romans were aiming to pacify all Gaul

3464
02:54:54,719 --> 02:54:55,743
That importation Ma

3465
02:54:56,511 --> 02:55:00,607
As Warriors burnished their glittering Jewel Rod Shields

3466
02:55:00,863 --> 02:55:03,935
And stripling's eager to prove themselves ready for battle

3467
02:55:04,191 --> 02:55:07,519
Forwarded I cheated streams with full armor on their backs

3468
02:55:08,031 --> 02:55:11,103
So rival tribe sought to patch up their differences

3469
02:55:11,615 --> 02:55:13,919
Free golf prepared itself for war

3470
02:55:14,687 --> 02:55:15,199
And quote

3471
02:55:17,247 --> 02:55:17,759
I think

3472
02:55:18,015 --> 02:55:20,063
A sure sign of the way

3473
02:55:20,319 --> 02:55:22,367
Caesar was thinking during this time.

3474
02:55:23,135 --> 02:55:24,415
Is his excuse

3475
02:55:24,671 --> 02:55:27,999
For going back into Gaul and continuing to fight

3476
02:55:28,255 --> 02:55:29,791
Even though these things

3477
02:55:30,303 --> 02:55:33,887
Are these crisis moments that had forced him to respond or done with

3478
02:55:34,911 --> 02:55:39,263
He says the very Act of these people deciding to work together

3479
02:55:39,519 --> 02:55:40,799
Against him

3480
02:55:41,311 --> 02:55:42,847
Justified him

3481
02:55:43,103 --> 02:55:44,383
Going after them

3482
02:55:46,175 --> 02:55:48,479
This is for my Carolyn Hammond translation

3483
02:55:48,735 --> 02:55:54,879
When Caesar refers to Caesar he's talking to himself in the third person and when he talks about the belgae

3484
02:55:55,135 --> 02:55:56,415
He's talking about this

3485
02:55:56,671 --> 02:55:58,975
Kind of Celtic people as he describes it

3486
02:55:59,231 --> 02:56:03,071
To the north of the area he's been campaigning the people that actually make up

3487
02:56:03,583 --> 02:56:04,607
What was

3488
02:56:04,863 --> 02:56:08,703
The population of modern-day Belgium part of the Netherlands

3489
02:56:08,959 --> 02:56:15,103
The part of Germany and part of Northeastern France much larger area than modern-day Belgium in some of the Mets

3490
02:56:15,359 --> 02:56:18,431
It migrated across the channel to Southeastern Britain to

3491
02:56:19,199 --> 02:56:22,015
But it's these tribes of belgae that are

3492
02:56:22,527 --> 02:56:24,575
Uniting against Caesar so he

3493
02:56:24,831 --> 02:56:27,903
Point out that well obviously it's a conspiracy

3494
02:56:29,439 --> 02:56:30,975
Payment translation says quote

3495
02:56:31,743 --> 02:56:33,023
As we mentioned above

3496
02:56:33,279 --> 02:56:34,815
Caesar was in near Galt

3497
02:56:35,071 --> 02:56:36,607
Where he heard a host of rumors

3498
02:56:36,863 --> 02:56:38,911
Confirmed by a letter from Lady Ennis

3499
02:56:39,423 --> 02:56:44,287
Did all the belgae who make up 1/3 of Gaul as we said before we're hatching a plot

3500
02:56:44,543 --> 02:56:47,103
Against the Roman people and exchanging hostages

3501
02:56:47,615 --> 02:56:49,663
The reason for this plot or as follows

3502
02:56:50,175 --> 02:56:50,687
First

3503
02:56:50,943 --> 02:56:55,295
They were afraid that our army would March against them now that all the rest of God have been subdued

3504
02:56:55,807 --> 02:56:58,879
Secondly they were being stirred up by a number of the god

3505
02:56:59,391 --> 02:57:03,743
Some of whom have been unwilling for the Germans to have any further involvement in Gaul

3506
02:57:04,255 --> 02:57:09,375
Equally reluctant for the army of the Roman people to overwinter and become established there

3507
02:57:09,887 --> 02:57:12,703
Others were of a volatile and unstable disposition

3508
02:57:12,959 --> 02:57:15,519
The sort of man who Delight in changes of rules

3509
02:57:16,031 --> 02:57:18,847
Yet another group inside of the belgae to conspire

3510
02:57:19,103 --> 02:57:25,247
Because it was common in golfer men who possess some degree of power and the means to hire support to cease re

3511
02:57:25,503 --> 02:57:26,015
Regal power

3512
02:57:26,271 --> 02:57:29,087
Something which would be more difficult to achieve under our rule

3513
02:57:29,855 --> 02:57:30,367
And quote

3514
02:57:32,159 --> 02:57:34,719
Now forget this is a neutral arbitrator here

3515
02:57:35,231 --> 02:57:41,375
Once again Caesar is essentially in dating these people for doing exactly what they should be doing if you think about this logically

3516
02:57:41,887 --> 02:57:43,423
Because Caesars just smashed

3517
02:57:44,191 --> 02:57:45,983
One of the most powerful tribes

3518
02:57:46,239 --> 02:57:52,383
He's got the support of another he just kicked the dreaded Germans out if you believe

3519
02:57:52,639 --> 02:57:53,919
These really were Germans

3520
02:57:54,687 --> 02:57:55,967
And he's taken the

3521
02:57:56,479 --> 02:58:02,623
Surrender and submission of a bunch of other Golic tribes who are cowed now by what is a comp

3522
02:58:03,647 --> 02:58:07,487
And these people to the north all these tribes that Caesar says are

3523
02:58:07,743 --> 02:58:10,559
He kind of implies that they're part Celtic and part German

3524
02:58:11,327 --> 02:58:13,887
But this is free golf at this point

3525
02:58:14,655 --> 02:58:15,679
These are the tribes

3526
02:58:15,935 --> 02:58:21,823
That have the ability to raise a lot of troops and still fight Caesar and Caesar says and it's not hard to believe

3527
02:58:22,079 --> 02:58:26,943
The Beast fifth columnist from friendly tribes in tribes that have already submitted

3528
02:58:27,199 --> 02:58:32,831
Are you secretly whispering in the ear of the belgae to in other words there is an anti Roman

3529
02:58:33,087 --> 02:58:38,719
Insurgency in Gaul and seizures talking about here and once again the simple fact that it exists

3530
02:58:39,999 --> 02:58:42,559
Legitimizes his involvement in the region to stop it

3531
02:58:44,351 --> 02:58:45,375
Allegedly

3532
02:58:45,631 --> 02:58:47,423
This tribal Confederation in the North

3533
02:58:48,703 --> 02:58:52,799
Belgae tribes will be able to put together almost 300,000 War

3534
02:58:53,823 --> 02:58:56,895
Not women children old people and all that but Warrior

3535
02:58:58,687 --> 02:58:59,967
Once again you can't help but

3536
02:59:00,223 --> 02:59:03,807
Contrast that with what the Native Americans are trying to resist

3537
02:59:04,575 --> 02:59:07,903
You know expansion in North America with your 1500 or

3538
02:59:08,159 --> 02:59:09,695
Maybe mm on a relief

3539
02:59:09,951 --> 02:59:13,279
Good day Warriors and here Caesars trying to figure out how to tackle

3540
02:59:13,535 --> 02:59:14,815
With no guns

3541
02:59:15,327 --> 02:59:17,375
Right with no Cannon nothing like that

3542
02:59:17,631 --> 02:59:19,935
300000 native peoples

3543
02:59:20,959 --> 02:59:23,263
Even if that number is high what if it's 200000

3544
02:59:25,567 --> 02:59:29,407
One of my favorite stories which kind of in my mind shows how

3545
02:59:29,919 --> 02:59:36,063
You know you can do things in different ways to accomplish the same goals when you think of the really bureaucratic ancient States when you think of it

3546
02:59:36,319 --> 02:59:39,391
Egypt or China or in the Siri or Rome even

3547
02:59:39,903 --> 02:59:46,047
And you think okay when they needed an army how did they mustard how do they put it together how did they raise that you think of a really bureaucratic affair

3548
02:59:46,559 --> 02:59:47,583
The only thing missing

3549
02:59:47,839 --> 02:59:51,423
Are the iPads for these people MLB paper records of you all kinds of

3550
02:59:51,679 --> 02:59:56,287
Stop at the Modern in organizational situation where you raise armies or hide tribes do it

3551
02:59:57,311 --> 02:59:59,359
Especially tried to had lots of people while

3552
02:59:59,615 --> 03:00:01,919
There's an ancient source that says that the Celtic method

3553
03:00:02,431 --> 03:00:05,759
For this was a variation if you will on the idea

3554
03:00:06,271 --> 03:00:08,319
The last one in is a rotten egg

3555
03:00:09,343 --> 03:00:10,623
It's last one

3556
03:00:10,879 --> 03:00:14,463
Who arrives to the monster gets tortured to death in front of the army

3557
03:00:15,743 --> 03:00:17,535
Isn't that wickedly

3558
03:00:17,791 --> 03:00:21,375
Efficient and yet in a decentralized sort of Tribal Way

3559
03:00:21,631 --> 03:00:22,655
We're not going to get to

3560
03:00:23,167 --> 03:00:28,799
We're not going to get too specific about this but the last guy who shows up to the muster we kill him

3561
03:00:29,055 --> 03:00:32,127
Bystolic torture in front of the whole Army see you soon

3562
03:00:32,895 --> 03:00:34,943
I love that I hope that's true just cuz that's

3563
03:00:35,711 --> 03:00:37,247
That's wonderfully color

3564
03:00:37,503 --> 03:00:38,015
Purple

3565
03:00:38,783 --> 03:00:44,927
And yet the problems these tribes have is that they need all these people to resist Roman encroachment but the large

3566
03:00:45,183 --> 03:00:47,487
These so-called Barbarian armies get

3567
03:00:47,999 --> 03:00:49,535
The harder they are to feed

3568
03:00:50,815 --> 03:00:54,911
Just imagine if the 300 thousand will play with a nice smaller number 200000

3569
03:00:55,679 --> 03:00:56,447
Well that's

3570
03:00:56,959 --> 03:00:58,495
What 2/3

3571
03:00:58,751 --> 03:01:00,543
Modern football stadiums

3572
03:01:01,311 --> 03:01:04,639
How long can you feed that with Barbarian Logistics

3573
03:01:05,663 --> 03:01:11,551
Pastel Brooklyn oh I'd love to focus he's so materialistic and down-to-earth and scoffs at every

3574
03:01:11,807 --> 03:01:14,879
He points out that this is where the unsexy advantage of the

3575
03:01:15,135 --> 03:01:18,207
Are the so-called civilized bureaucratic States really is

3576
03:01:18,719 --> 03:01:21,791
The ability to feed people in the field so that they're there to fight

3577
03:01:22,815 --> 03:01:26,399
Doesn't matter how many people your opponent has if they're starving and I could be that good

3578
03:01:26,655 --> 03:01:29,215
Dorothy Army have to break up cuz they can't find food

3579
03:01:29,471 --> 03:01:32,287
We are not really an army of three hundred thousand people then

3580
03:01:32,543 --> 03:01:33,055
Are you

3581
03:01:33,567 --> 03:01:35,103
You're a bunch of smaller armies

3582
03:01:35,359 --> 03:01:39,711
Spread out over a wider area trying to find enough stuff to keep your troops from starving to death

3583
03:01:40,223 --> 03:01:42,271
And that means the enemy can defeat you

3584
03:01:42,527 --> 03:01:44,319
Bit by bit we just what Caesar does

3585
03:01:45,855 --> 03:01:48,159
Caesar will also have his garlic allies

3586
03:01:48,671 --> 03:01:49,183
Attack

3587
03:01:49,439 --> 03:01:51,487
Individual tribes that are part of this

3588
03:01:51,743 --> 03:01:55,327
Belgae Confederation and keep them busy while he concentrates another one

3589
03:01:57,119 --> 03:02:03,263
Once again Caesar says that these people are particularly ferocious and once again he blames it on the fact that they're not

3590
03:02:03,519 --> 03:02:07,871
Corrupted by Roman luxury that they're a long way from Rome which keeps him somewhat insulated

3591
03:02:09,151 --> 03:02:11,455
A train archaeological works that do say that the

3592
03:02:11,711 --> 03:02:15,295
Farther north you go from Rome the smaller the town's get

3593
03:02:15,807 --> 03:02:17,855
The less urbanized sort of

3594
03:02:18,111 --> 03:02:19,135
Core you have

3595
03:02:19,391 --> 03:02:23,999
The more the government's begin to resemble governments that have gone out of fashion

3596
03:02:24,255 --> 03:02:26,047
The parts of Gaul closer to Rome like

3597
03:02:26,303 --> 03:02:27,839
Aristocracies and kings

3598
03:02:28,863 --> 03:02:30,143
So maybe there's some truth to it

3599
03:02:31,935 --> 03:02:33,215
Hard to explain

3600
03:02:33,471 --> 03:02:36,287
Why these belgae people

3601
03:02:36,543 --> 03:02:40,127
We're so much tougher than the surrounding Galls if indeed they were

3602
03:02:40,639 --> 03:02:42,175
They don't seem to have been more numerous

3603
03:02:42,687 --> 03:02:43,711
Or better LED

3604
03:02:43,967 --> 03:02:45,759
They don't have better equipment

3605
03:02:46,015 --> 03:02:48,319
Or training they don't have more money

3606
03:02:48,575 --> 03:02:52,159
I mean none of none of the things where you might be able to say well there's a legitimate reason

3607
03:02:52,415 --> 03:02:52,927
Why these people

3608
03:02:53,439 --> 03:02:55,231
Lord it over the garlic Neighbors

3609
03:02:57,023 --> 03:02:59,839
Caesar says it's basically cuz they're tougher and more ferocious

3610
03:03:00,351 --> 03:03:01,375
I don't accept that

3611
03:03:01,631 --> 03:03:03,167
Because that's a stereotypical

3612
03:03:03,679 --> 03:03:04,703
Rhetorical

3613
03:03:04,959 --> 03:03:06,239
Trope it is

3614
03:03:07,007 --> 03:03:07,775
How do you explain it

3615
03:03:10,335 --> 03:03:11,103
A friend of mine

3616
03:03:12,127 --> 03:03:13,663
That was a military history major I went to

3617
03:03:13,919 --> 03:03:14,431
College with

3618
03:03:15,711 --> 03:03:17,503
He had the best answer I've ever heard to this

3619
03:03:17,759 --> 03:03:18,783
His answer was

3620
03:03:19,039 --> 03:03:20,319
He just wasn't buying any of

3621
03:03:21,599 --> 03:03:22,879
You wouldn't believe in any of the

3622
03:03:23,135 --> 03:03:23,647
List of Caesar

3623
03:03:23,903 --> 03:03:24,927
You said in his mind

3624
03:03:25,439 --> 03:03:25,951
Any

3625
03:03:26,207 --> 03:03:28,255
Question about how tough this tribe

3626
03:03:28,511 --> 03:03:33,119
Waze vs. hot tub tribe was his all stuff Caesar throws in there to make Caesar look better

3627
03:03:34,911 --> 03:03:38,239
Because you can never know about that kind of stuff so he's going to use

3628
03:03:38,495 --> 03:03:39,263
The only

3629
03:03:39,519 --> 03:03:45,663
In a fact that you have out there on the table to form a most likely scenario he said the one fact on the table here this

3630
03:03:45,919 --> 03:03:46,943
Clear from everything

3631
03:03:47,455 --> 03:03:49,247
And it screams through the sources

3632
03:03:49,759 --> 03:03:53,343
Is it this Roman army was in comparably better

3633
03:03:53,855 --> 03:03:55,391
And the photos that they face

3634
03:03:57,695 --> 03:03:59,999
It's not a very good story though if you talk about how

3635
03:04:00,767 --> 03:04:06,911
Are you pitted the Roman army maybe the best of the Roman armies arguably the best of the Roman armies that was ever

3636
03:04:07,167 --> 03:04:07,679
Fielded

3637
03:04:08,447 --> 03:04:09,215
If you say that

3638
03:04:09,471 --> 03:04:15,615
Yes our army came it cut through the barbarians like butter it was no competition a child could come into the

3639
03:04:15,871 --> 03:04:18,687
The Romans and destroyed the barbarians that's another very good

3640
03:04:18,943 --> 03:04:21,759
Way to frame yourself promotional piece

3641
03:04:22,271 --> 03:04:23,551
But you're sending back to Rome is

3642
03:04:25,343 --> 03:04:26,879
My friend just doesn't buy any of

3643
03:04:27,903 --> 03:04:29,695
In his mind the only thing you know for sure

3644
03:04:30,207 --> 03:04:32,767
Is it these battles sound like Slaughters

3645
03:04:33,535 --> 03:04:36,095
And even though Caesar usually tries to throw in it

3646
03:04:36,351 --> 03:04:38,911
Near run Mama Jesse was touch-and-go for a while but then we cry

3647
03:04:39,935 --> 03:04:40,703
It doesn't really seem

3648
03:04:41,471 --> 03:04:43,775
And the Roman advantages are hard for

3649
03:04:44,031 --> 03:04:46,591
Most modern people certainly for me

3650
03:04:47,103 --> 03:04:50,175
To really understand because there's something about the way were raised in the

3651
03:04:50,431 --> 03:04:52,223
The technological era that we live in

3652
03:04:52,991 --> 03:04:54,783
It whenever you talk about vast

3653
03:04:55,039 --> 03:04:59,135
Differences between military capabilities we assume it's got to be mostly Technologic

3654
03:04:59,391 --> 03:05:00,671
Not easy for us

3655
03:05:01,951 --> 03:05:02,719
If you say

3656
03:05:02,975 --> 03:05:05,791
One side in this battle had machine guns in the other head bows and arrows

3657
03:05:06,047 --> 03:05:07,839
Are modern brain goes oh well that's a sloth

3658
03:05:08,607 --> 03:05:11,935
Write the technological differences going to equal a certain outcome

3659
03:05:12,959 --> 03:05:13,983
But if you tell us

3660
03:05:14,495 --> 03:05:15,519
The two armies

3661
03:05:15,775 --> 03:05:17,823
In a 2000 years ago

3662
03:05:18,079 --> 03:05:21,407
We're really different in terms of what they could do to each other and how

3663
03:05:21,663 --> 03:05:27,807
You're nasty they were but they're very similar in terms of actual weapons technology it's hard for us to

3664
03:05:28,063 --> 03:05:28,575
Stand

3665
03:05:28,831 --> 03:05:31,647
What it is that makes up the difference is that could account for that

3666
03:05:32,927 --> 03:05:37,791
And of course all the experts you really understand and there are few experts on real Ancient Warfare

3667
03:05:38,047 --> 03:05:40,863
But they'll tell you this is what drill and discipline.

3668
03:05:41,375 --> 03:05:44,703
This is what equipping basically most of your troops

3669
03:05:45,215 --> 03:05:47,263
With armor and metal helmets does

3670
03:05:48,031 --> 03:05:50,847
And we used an example once of Imagine two NFL teams

3671
03:05:51,103 --> 03:05:55,199
Deciding to have a football game at 1 teams not allowed any pads or helmets or anything

3672
03:05:55,967 --> 03:05:56,735
And now imagine that

3673
03:05:57,247 --> 03:05:59,295
Both sides are actually playing with edged weapons and

3674
03:05:59,551 --> 03:06:00,063
And it's a lot more

3675
03:06:00,319 --> 03:06:03,135
Nasty even then pro football you could see where that might

3676
03:06:03,391 --> 03:06:04,415
Be a big advantage

3677
03:06:04,671 --> 03:06:06,207
Also you threw that in

3678
03:06:06,463 --> 03:06:09,535
With the drill with I mean if there's a lot that goes into it

3679
03:06:11,583 --> 03:06:15,167
But it's not as I said a very good story if you say the Romans came

3680
03:06:15,423 --> 03:06:17,727
And destroyed the Barbarian did it with no trouble at all

3681
03:06:19,519 --> 03:06:21,567
And in my friend's mind that's why you need to keep

3682
03:06:21,823 --> 03:06:23,615
Pumping up this next tribe it's easier than

3683
03:06:23,871 --> 03:06:26,431
And you thought that was bad this one's even worse because

3684
03:06:26,687 --> 03:06:31,295
It begins to get a little monotonous Caesars not losing any of these battles and he's not even coming close

3685
03:06:31,807 --> 03:06:33,343
Really until

3686
03:06:34,111 --> 03:06:36,415
You end up with one of these tribes doing

3687
03:06:37,183 --> 03:06:41,023
What common sense would dictate a certain point you should do

3688
03:06:41,535 --> 03:06:42,303
Which is

3689
03:06:42,559 --> 03:06:46,399
Is Caesar's got this in comparably fantastic Army

3690
03:06:47,167 --> 03:06:49,215
And if it's eating you alive

3691
03:06:49,471 --> 03:06:51,007
On the battlefield stop facing it

3692
03:06:52,287 --> 03:06:53,311
You don't have to

3693
03:06:53,567 --> 03:06:54,591
Right it's not prescribed

3694
03:06:54,847 --> 03:06:59,967
And it's hard for certain culture sometimes because when you get to these Warrior cultures that have a heroic

3695
03:07:00,479 --> 03:07:02,015
Certified personal ethos

3696
03:07:02,271 --> 03:07:02,783
Where

3697
03:07:03,295 --> 03:07:09,439
How you doing battle and bravery and conspicuous bravery right out in front of other people in Fair fights and Duels and

3698
03:07:09,695 --> 03:07:11,231
All that is part of your makeup

3699
03:07:11,487 --> 03:07:12,255
To talk about

3700
03:07:12,511 --> 03:07:15,839
Subterfuge and ambushing and stuff like that

3701
03:07:16,351 --> 03:07:18,655
Well it doesn't always match so well

3702
03:07:18,911 --> 03:07:23,263
With the Inner Warrior Spirit but believe me necessity is the mother of invention

3703
03:07:24,031 --> 03:07:26,847
And when Caesar goes to take on the various tribes

3704
03:07:27,359 --> 03:07:30,175
Of the belgae the Bell guy by the way is another way to pronounce it

3705
03:07:30,687 --> 03:07:36,831
The first thing that happens is they get these large numbers of people together which they can't feed so Caesar apparently way

3706
03:07:37,087 --> 03:07:37,855
Wait them out

3707
03:07:38,879 --> 03:07:45,023
They'll be some skirmishing a little bit of this a little bit of that but it looks like Caesar's plan is to just sit there and absorb all the food he can

3708
03:07:45,279 --> 03:07:51,423
Resume logistical Services while he watches the enemy around him supposedly in the 300,000

3709
03:07:51,679 --> 03:07:53,471
Numerical range

3710
03:07:53,983 --> 03:07:54,751
Begin to Star

3711
03:07:56,287 --> 03:07:58,079
Of course I have to hold hands down bruker

3712
03:07:58,335 --> 03:07:59,359
Cuz he's the logistical guy

3713
03:08:00,639 --> 03:08:01,151
Delbrook

3714
03:08:01,407 --> 03:08:07,551
Explain Caesar's into Northern Gaul where the belgia corbel get people live in says

3715
03:08:09,087 --> 03:08:10,111
The belgae

3716
03:08:10,367 --> 03:08:11,391
Also Bell guy

3717
03:08:11,647 --> 03:08:13,695
Had a premonition of their impending Danger

3718
03:08:14,207 --> 03:08:19,839
United their forces and when Caesar cross their borders moved out against him with a large Allied Army

3719
03:08:20,351 --> 03:08:23,935
That civilization has means of warfare that are lacking to Barbary

3720
03:08:24,703 --> 03:08:28,031
The belgae were no doubt capable of assembling a large army

3721
03:08:28,287 --> 03:08:30,079
But not a holding it together and feeding it

3722
03:08:30,591 --> 03:08:33,919
Just as the cimbri and teutones those barbarians from

3723
03:08:34,175 --> 03:08:35,455
Caesar's birth.

3724
03:08:35,711 --> 03:08:40,575
Had to split up on their campaign into Italy and were defeated individually by Marius

3725
03:08:40,831 --> 03:08:46,975
Caesar instead of moving immediately into a decisive battle against an army of the same size as he is her perhaps cancer

3726
03:08:47,231 --> 03:08:47,999
Suitably larger

3727
03:08:48,255 --> 03:08:50,815
Found the means of splitting up the Allied Army

3728
03:08:51,327 --> 03:08:53,887
So that he could then deal with only individual try

3729
03:08:54,655 --> 03:08:55,679
In the meantime

3730
03:08:55,935 --> 03:08:56,703
Deborah Crites

3731
03:08:57,215 --> 03:08:59,263
Caesar head organized two new Legions

3732
03:08:59,519 --> 03:09:01,055
Somebody now had a total of 8

3733
03:09:01,567 --> 03:09:05,663
Which is auxiliary troops of numidians cretans bow lyrics and garlic cavalry

3734
03:09:05,919 --> 03:09:08,991
His army may have well numbered 50000 to combatants

3735
03:09:09,247 --> 03:09:12,063
And a grand total of 80 thousand to a hundred thousand Souls

3736
03:09:12,575 --> 03:09:16,159
In order to feed such a mess in one place for a rather long time

3737
03:09:16,415 --> 03:09:19,231
One must have a very strong and reliable organization

3738
03:09:19,487 --> 03:09:22,303
Transport suppliers in finance system

3739
03:09:22,559 --> 03:09:23,839
The Romans had such means

3740
03:09:24,095 --> 03:09:25,375
Where's the belgae did not

3741
03:09:26,655 --> 03:09:27,935
Can any points out that

3742
03:09:29,215 --> 03:09:31,775
Wicked ability of the Romans to sort of make

3743
03:09:32,287 --> 03:09:36,127
Stationary field fortifications of Battlefield weapon

3744
03:09:36,895 --> 03:09:38,175
Deerbrook says quote

3745
03:09:38,431 --> 03:09:41,247
But Caesar had still other means at his disposal

3746
03:09:41,503 --> 03:09:44,319
He set up a camp on the North Bank of the Seine

3747
03:09:44,575 --> 03:09:45,343
River

3748
03:09:45,599 --> 03:09:47,647
And his army was so well equipped with tools

3749
03:09:48,159 --> 03:09:51,743
And it's Soldier so well disciplined and so well-trained in their techniques

3750
03:09:51,999 --> 03:09:55,839
It was in the shortest possible time an impregnable Fortress stood there

3751
03:09:56,607 --> 03:09:57,119
And quote

3752
03:09:59,423 --> 03:10:00,447
To give you an idea of size

3753
03:10:00,703 --> 03:10:04,287
Is in size vary depending on how large the Roman Forest that needed

3754
03:10:04,543 --> 03:10:05,311
To be in the camp

3755
03:10:05,567 --> 03:10:06,335
Happened to me but

3756
03:10:06,847 --> 03:10:09,663
Some of these camps could be well over a hundred acres in size

3757
03:10:11,199 --> 03:10:16,319
And they always had a ditch and I always had a rampart in the Roman soldiers carry sharpened Stakes when they marched

3758
03:10:16,575 --> 03:10:19,903
Savannah at night they could stick those steaks into the Earth and Rampart so became a

3759
03:10:20,415 --> 03:10:21,695
Pincushion around the camp

3760
03:10:22,975 --> 03:10:28,351
Guard towers walls and everyday the camp stayed in the same spot and didn't move it became

3761
03:10:28,607 --> 03:10:31,935
More sophisticated deeper more defensible more finished

3762
03:10:34,751 --> 03:10:40,895
That you were there long enough Roman 10 switch were laid out on a prescribed Roman Road grid system which included a main

3763
03:10:41,151 --> 03:10:42,175
Main Street inside

3764
03:10:42,431 --> 03:10:47,039
This little Roman town is what it amounted to these tents would turn into cabins at that

3765
03:10:47,295 --> 03:10:48,319
Camper there long enough

3766
03:10:49,343 --> 03:10:50,623
There be artillery

3767
03:10:51,135 --> 03:10:52,927
And they could put it up so fast

3768
03:10:53,183 --> 03:10:57,535
Knows every said earlier I believe the Roman soldiers about half soldier in about half construction worker

3769
03:10:58,303 --> 03:11:00,095
And a construction worker side

3770
03:11:00,607 --> 03:11:02,655
Was more important than you might think

3771
03:11:03,423 --> 03:11:05,215
You fans the Romans know already though it's

3772
03:11:05,471 --> 03:11:09,055
Something that they brought to the table which was unusual there were other armies that could create

3773
03:11:10,335 --> 03:11:12,383
Some more obsessive about creating camps to

3774
03:11:12,639 --> 03:11:15,199
Protect themselves for example when on campaign

3775
03:11:15,711 --> 03:11:20,319
But the Romans almost use their construction ability in an offensive way it's fabulous

3776
03:11:21,087 --> 03:11:23,391
Unless of course you're a call a component in which case

3777
03:11:23,903 --> 03:11:24,671
You know how

3778
03:11:25,183 --> 03:11:30,815
Disheartening is it to think UK we got a nice relatively open Battlefield here we're going to fight these Roman tomorrow

3779
03:11:31,071 --> 03:11:33,375
And then wake up in the morning to find fortifications on

3780
03:11:35,935 --> 03:11:36,703
Add artillery

3781
03:11:40,031 --> 03:11:42,079
And I should point out when we say artillery we have

3782
03:11:42,335 --> 03:11:43,615
Beastly mean Roman and Greek style

3783
03:11:44,127 --> 03:11:45,919
Artillery nothing gunpowder e

3784
03:11:46,687 --> 03:11:47,967
In this case a lot of it was

3785
03:11:48,223 --> 03:11:49,247
What's called torsion

3786
03:11:49,759 --> 03:11:52,831
Vices and I've seen these things and I still don't understand the prince of

3787
03:11:53,343 --> 03:11:55,903
But it involves Twisted sinews and

3788
03:11:56,415 --> 03:11:58,463
Stores that buy lot of energy and when it's released

3789
03:11:58,719 --> 03:11:59,743
You can fling

3790
03:12:00,255 --> 03:12:02,559
Stones or projectiles at

3791
03:12:02,815 --> 03:12:04,351
Look like big heavy arrows were

3792
03:12:04,863 --> 03:12:05,375
Beers

3793
03:12:05,887 --> 03:12:06,655
From these weapons

3794
03:12:06,911 --> 03:12:12,543
And by the way these weapons come in all shapes and sizes and the Very largest of them are rather enormous

3795
03:12:14,079 --> 03:12:15,871
But in this case most of the ones were talking about

3796
03:12:16,127 --> 03:12:16,895
Lighter weapons

3797
03:12:17,407 --> 03:12:19,455
Caesar specifically in one of my translations

3798
03:12:19,711 --> 03:12:20,735
Refers to one of the

3799
03:12:21,247 --> 03:12:24,063
Artillery pieces involved is a 1 pounder

3800
03:12:24,319 --> 03:12:28,671
And had to go look that up a one-pounder means the stone itself that this weapon

3801
03:12:29,183 --> 03:12:29,951
Flung

3802
03:12:30,207 --> 03:12:31,487
Weighed 1 lb

3803
03:12:31,999 --> 03:12:34,303
But I read another source that talked about the fear

3804
03:12:34,815 --> 03:12:35,583
That these

3805
03:12:35,839 --> 03:12:39,679
Stones flying through the air at high speed in the sound they made

3806
03:12:39,935 --> 03:12:43,007
The fear that that generated sometimes if you were on the receiving end of those

3807
03:12:45,055 --> 03:12:47,359
Maybe this is how you outclassing opponent

3808
03:12:48,127 --> 03:12:49,663
When your weapon systems are not

3809
03:12:49,919 --> 03:12:51,711
All that dissimilar I mean

3810
03:12:51,967 --> 03:12:58,111
They're both use an edged weapons that are metal they both got Spears they both either use human sinew power for

3811
03:12:58,623 --> 03:13:01,951
Your Tactical Battlefield stop at the Roman artillery is pretty awesome

3812
03:13:03,487 --> 03:13:08,607
I'm having the logistical and organizational capability to build a fortress overnight

3813
03:13:09,375 --> 03:13:11,167
That's pretty important and effective to

3814
03:13:12,959 --> 03:13:16,799
Add to that what we've been talking about the ability to feed your Army on campaign

3815
03:13:17,055 --> 03:13:20,895
And easily explained how Caesar's campaign against these

3816
03:13:21,151 --> 03:13:23,711
Tribes of belgae actually workout

3817
03:13:24,223 --> 03:13:28,831
Every said he may be facing 300,000 of these Warrior is up in the north here near the

3818
03:13:29,087 --> 03:13:30,879
English Channel but how do you feed

3819
03:13:31,391 --> 03:13:34,719
A barbarian Army that large the answer is apparently you don't

3820
03:13:35,487 --> 03:13:38,815
Caesar says the tribes come together and have a meeting and say

3821
03:13:39,071 --> 03:13:43,167
We got to go home everybody's got to go back to their own home we know we can feed ourselves

3822
03:13:43,423 --> 03:13:45,983
Timolol go back to our own homes and when we get there

3823
03:13:46,239 --> 03:13:50,079
If Caesar attacks any of us everybody will come to the aid of the attacked right

3824
03:13:50,591 --> 03:13:54,687
Historians are divided as to whether or not that is a realistic defense strategy

3825
03:13:54,943 --> 03:13:55,711
Samsung compact

3826
03:13:56,223 --> 03:13:57,759
Or whether it is a cop out

3827
03:13:58,271 --> 03:13:59,807
Sham to cover up

3828
03:14:00,319 --> 03:14:04,415
A every man for himself or every try for himself so tough attitude

3829
03:14:05,439 --> 03:14:08,511
Panache curious handstyle Brook falls into the latter category

3830
03:14:09,791 --> 03:14:12,095
He's tribe decide to break up and go home

3831
03:14:12,351 --> 03:14:15,167
Well let's pretend it is three hundred thousand people

3832
03:14:15,423 --> 03:14:18,751
When they decide to go home and they've been facing Caesar

3833
03:14:19,263 --> 03:14:25,407
How did they even go about this meat is it like then we compare things to Woodstock the Woodstock Rock concert earlier what how

3834
03:14:25,663 --> 03:14:26,943
Happens when Woodstock breaks up

3835
03:14:27,711 --> 03:14:28,223
Woodlots

3836
03:14:28,479 --> 03:14:32,831
The people in large masses just so to go streaming in the opposite direction

3837
03:14:33,599 --> 03:14:37,695
So what do you do if your Caesar in your opportunity while you attack don't you

3838
03:14:38,463 --> 03:14:40,767
He sent his Cavalry running through

3839
03:14:41,023 --> 03:14:44,095
These crowds of people spearing them shooting them

3840
03:14:44,351 --> 03:14:45,631
Just running them that killed

3841
03:14:45,887 --> 03:14:46,655
Untold number

3842
03:14:48,191 --> 03:14:48,959
And all of these

3843
03:14:49,215 --> 03:14:50,495
Belgic tribes

3844
03:14:50,751 --> 03:14:56,895
Ran back to wherever their tribal Homeland was they seem to have decided that they were going to hold up most of the time in these

3845
03:14:57,407 --> 03:15:00,223
Hill forts of theirs which by the way if you've never seen one

3846
03:15:00,735 --> 03:15:03,039
Go look at an aerial photo they're awesome

3847
03:15:04,063 --> 03:15:06,111
Basically what these people did was find

3848
03:15:06,367 --> 03:15:12,511
You know nature is fortification where nature had crafted a wonderful area to defend and then added in a human

3849
03:15:12,767 --> 03:15:13,279
Touches

3850
03:15:13,535 --> 03:15:15,583
Kimber hear some stone work there

3851
03:15:15,839 --> 03:15:17,887
And what have you but if you have a nice

3852
03:15:18,143 --> 03:15:19,935
White giant Hill

3853
03:15:20,447 --> 03:15:26,591
And you have maybe a nice river that curves around a whole side of it forming a defensive Optical I mean your you got a pretty good start

3854
03:15:26,847 --> 03:15:30,943
A lot of these tribes maybe thought they could hold out in these locations and they were wrong

3855
03:15:32,479 --> 03:15:34,783
Apparently all Caesar had to do was show up

3856
03:15:35,039 --> 03:15:35,807
Just some of these

3857
03:15:36,063 --> 03:15:38,623
Nasty scary tribes that he talked about

3858
03:15:39,135 --> 03:15:44,255
And the second they saw him they gave up One Tribe big nasty tribe tens of thousands of warriors

3859
03:15:44,767 --> 03:15:47,327
Caesar says they saw the Roman Siege weapons and when timeout

3860
03:15:48,095 --> 03:15:49,375
If you're going to use those I'm out

3861
03:15:50,655 --> 03:15:52,959
So overall by Roman technology there

3862
03:15:53,215 --> 03:15:55,263
This is another one of those big nasty tribes

3863
03:15:55,519 --> 03:15:59,359
Didn't even get within 5 miles of their Hill for it and they were coming out to say we're done

3864
03:16:00,639 --> 03:16:02,431
He says the last of the big tribes

3865
03:16:02,943 --> 03:16:06,783
It was opposing him where this tribe called the nervii or the nervi I

3866
03:16:07,551 --> 03:16:09,599
Way up in the north right

3867
03:16:09,855 --> 03:16:11,647
Scary nor he said that they

3868
03:16:12,159 --> 03:16:13,439
Took their people there

3869
03:16:13,695 --> 03:16:15,743
Wives and their children and their elderly

3870
03:16:15,999 --> 03:16:22,143
Their animals and their baggage and possessions and they took him into the deep dark swamps with a Roman couldn't get them

3871
03:16:23,167 --> 03:16:25,215
And we're going to resist self course

3872
03:16:25,983 --> 03:16:28,799
Caesar takes the Army into the land of the nervia

3873
03:16:29,823 --> 03:16:31,103
He says one day

3874
03:16:31,359 --> 03:16:34,175
You know they're deciding where they're going to camp for the night

3875
03:16:34,431 --> 03:16:35,711
We talked about that right

3876
03:16:35,967 --> 03:16:38,015
A little obsessive about the camps but if you were

3877
03:16:38,271 --> 03:16:43,135
As bad at scouting and reconnaissance as the Romans are always joked about being

3878
03:16:43,391 --> 03:16:48,767
And one of my friends also said that behavior is bad it's gotten to the Romans are you better have a good camp with big walls and

3879
03:16:49,279 --> 03:16:49,791
Towers

3880
03:16:51,071 --> 03:16:52,351
In this case Caesar

3881
03:16:52,607 --> 03:16:58,751
Has his army arriving in a long column down the road because where we like to talk about field battles all the time with understanding

3882
03:16:59,007 --> 03:17:03,871
Most of the time these armies are on the move and when they're on the Move they're stretched out in a long line like a snake

3883
03:17:04,127 --> 03:17:05,663
All the way into the distance

3884
03:17:06,175 --> 03:17:07,967
Very vulnerable position to be in

3885
03:17:09,247 --> 03:17:11,295
And when the head of the snake arrives

3886
03:17:11,551 --> 03:17:13,087
At the campsite for the night

3887
03:17:13,343 --> 03:17:17,183
Caesar tells those Legions that are their first to start building the cat

3888
03:17:17,695 --> 03:17:18,975
The legions at the very

3889
03:17:19,231 --> 03:17:22,303
Tale of the snake won't be arriving for some time

3890
03:17:23,839 --> 03:17:28,959
Caesar chooses another one of these Hills that if you've been paying attention and likes all throughout his writings

3891
03:17:29,215 --> 03:17:30,495
He likes an ice Hill

3892
03:17:30,751 --> 03:17:36,895
They can put most of his army on its size-wise he likes a nice gentle slope on one side he loves it if you can have a tray

3893
03:17:37,151 --> 03:17:39,711
Rain feature to Garda Flanagan in this case there's a river

3894
03:17:40,223 --> 03:17:42,527
At the bottom of the softly sloping Hill he says

3895
03:17:42,783 --> 03:17:44,575
Only about three feet deep but it's there

3896
03:17:45,087 --> 03:17:48,671
Benny says on the opposite side of the river is a mirror image of his Hill

3897
03:17:49,439 --> 03:17:52,767
It slopes up from the river gently he says there's about two hundred paces

3898
03:17:53,023 --> 03:17:54,815
So think about a couple of football fields

3899
03:17:55,327 --> 03:17:55,839
Obama

3900
03:17:56,095 --> 03:17:58,655
Sort of Open Country and then there's a wood

3901
03:17:58,911 --> 03:17:59,935
Imma top of the hill

3902
03:18:01,215 --> 03:18:02,239
Little Caesar has the

3903
03:18:02,495 --> 03:18:04,543
Elite Legion put down their packs

3904
03:18:04,799 --> 03:18:10,943
Interpret their military stuff aside get their hammers their nails the timber the shovels and begin making the camp and transform themselves

3905
03:18:11,455 --> 03:18:12,479
Into these amazing

3906
03:18:12,991 --> 03:18:13,759
Construction worker

3907
03:18:14,527 --> 03:18:15,807
Meanwhile he says

3908
03:18:16,063 --> 03:18:18,111
And this could be open to

3909
03:18:18,623 --> 03:18:23,999
Question by the way. What's about to happen here will learn Caesar some criticism during his own lifetime

3910
03:18:24,511 --> 03:18:26,047
Enter military experts ever since

3911
03:18:26,303 --> 03:18:27,583
But he says

3912
03:18:28,095 --> 03:18:34,239
I put out my Cavalry in my light troops and had them screening this whole operation right to protect the owner

3913
03:18:34,495 --> 03:18:35,519
Purple lesions that were

3914
03:18:36,031 --> 03:18:40,127
You know under construction at the moment as more and more of my troops arrived

3915
03:18:40,383 --> 03:18:41,151
From the column

3916
03:18:42,687 --> 03:18:43,967
Eventually Caesar will have

3917
03:18:44,479 --> 03:18:46,527
Six Legions they're building the fort

3918
03:18:46,783 --> 03:18:48,063
With more on the way

3919
03:18:48,575 --> 03:18:52,415
And he says my Cavalry is skirmishing with some of the belgae cavalry

3920
03:18:52,671 --> 03:18:58,815
And he says and then my baggage comes into view in the distance so the Roman baggage is in the middle of this long

3921
03:18:59,071 --> 03:19:02,911
Columnar comes over the horizon and everyone can see it and he says when that happens

3922
03:19:03,423 --> 03:19:05,727
That's the signal for the Ambush to start

3923
03:19:07,775 --> 03:19:09,567
He says that there's an army

3924
03:19:10,079 --> 03:19:12,639
I've never VI in the woods

3925
03:19:13,151 --> 03:19:14,687
On the opposite Hill from suzhou

3926
03:19:14,943 --> 03:19:15,711
An army

3927
03:19:17,247 --> 03:19:18,527
Is my friend said right

3928
03:19:18,783 --> 03:19:22,111
If you're going to be so bad at scouting you miss the army

3929
03:19:22,367 --> 03:19:26,975
Of Barbarians in the woods across from where you're building a camp you better have a strong camp

3930
03:19:27,999 --> 03:19:28,767
In this case

3931
03:19:29,535 --> 03:19:34,911
Right around the time seizures Cavalry gets close enough to the woods maybe to figure out what's in there

3932
03:19:35,167 --> 03:19:37,215
What's in their charges out of the woods

3933
03:19:37,727 --> 03:19:41,055
Caesar salad at astonishing speed that's by Carolyn Hamm

3934
03:19:41,311 --> 03:19:43,871
Carolyn Hammett has the great line astonishing speed

3935
03:19:46,431 --> 03:19:52,575
Seizure then goes on to say that they brush aside his Cavalry and light infantry screen like an insect basically and they come

3936
03:19:52,831 --> 03:19:54,111
Screaming down the hill

3937
03:19:55,647 --> 03:19:56,159
Now

3938
03:19:56,415 --> 03:19:58,207
We have no idea

3939
03:19:58,719 --> 03:19:59,999
How big does hell is

3940
03:20:01,535 --> 03:20:07,679
All we can say is that they scream down that Hill they cross the 3-foot river they start up the next Hill

3941
03:20:07,935 --> 03:20:11,263
Lil Ceaser in six Legions are on not ready for this

3942
03:20:13,823 --> 03:20:18,175
Now we talked earlier about why we chose this as a subject I said

3943
03:20:18,431 --> 03:20:20,735
I was fascinated with a tribal people

3944
03:20:20,991 --> 03:20:23,551
In the situation that we seen all throughout history

3945
03:20:24,063 --> 03:20:28,927
Trying to resist the encroachment of a more technologically and organizationally Superior

3946
03:20:29,183 --> 03:20:30,463
Are more efficient culture

3947
03:20:30,975 --> 03:20:34,815
And I chose this one because unlike the Native American example of the African example

3948
03:20:35,071 --> 03:20:37,375
These people had a chance to win

3949
03:20:38,655 --> 03:20:40,959
Now they were never the betting favorites

3950
03:20:41,471 --> 03:20:41,983
And the

3951
03:20:42,239 --> 03:20:46,591
Way that they perform so far in battles against the Roman army demonstrates that

3952
03:20:47,615 --> 03:20:52,735
The numbers are so much larger than what the North American Native Americans for example could have put together

3953
03:20:52,991 --> 03:20:55,551
But you can see why you got to give these people

3954
03:20:55,807 --> 03:20:58,111
The corner boxing line the punchers chance

3955
03:21:00,671 --> 03:21:06,815
Good luck figuring out how many people there are here if you're going to believe Caesar you're going to get up to number they're like 75

3956
03:21:07,071 --> 03:21:07,839
Thousand

3957
03:21:09,119 --> 03:21:10,399
Those seem absurd

3958
03:21:10,655 --> 03:21:14,495
But there's a lot of Romans there and that's pretty confirmable so it's not going to be too low

3959
03:21:14,751 --> 03:21:17,055
If you said 20000

3960
03:21:17,567 --> 03:21:19,103
That's going to be

3961
03:21:19,615 --> 03:21:23,711
Four times the largest Native American Force I've ever heard of

3962
03:21:24,223 --> 03:21:24,991
4 *

3963
03:21:25,503 --> 03:21:28,063
And we're talking about a charging Out of the Woods all at once

3964
03:21:28,831 --> 03:21:34,975
20000 would also be about how many Zulus were at that famous battle in the late 1800s where they wiped out

3965
03:21:35,231 --> 03:21:37,279
A force of 13 or 14

3966
03:21:38,815 --> 03:21:39,839
Soldiers from Britain

3967
03:21:41,887 --> 03:21:45,727
But the truth is it's probably larger than that so if you said 35,000

3968
03:21:46,495 --> 03:21:49,311
35000 man charging out of a Woods

3969
03:21:50,079 --> 03:21:56,223
Within running distance from you and that's how long you have to get your act together before they hit you

3970
03:21:56,735 --> 03:22:00,319
And try to blow you away like a wave blowing through

3971
03:22:00,831 --> 03:22:02,623
A few bathers on the beach

3972
03:22:04,415 --> 03:22:05,951
Caesar goes into overdrive

3973
03:22:06,975 --> 03:22:07,487
At this point

3974
03:22:08,767 --> 03:22:10,559
And you begin to see

3975
03:22:11,071 --> 03:22:14,399
You know what makes the guy so special he's not Alexander the Great

3976
03:22:14,655 --> 03:22:17,471
Grabbing a spear and leading the Cavalry in charge

3977
03:22:17,727 --> 03:22:19,519
Cesar does grab a shield he says

3978
03:22:20,031 --> 03:22:22,591
But he begins to go and demonstrate leadership

3979
03:22:24,639 --> 03:22:26,431
He also says that these veteran troops

3980
03:22:26,687 --> 03:22:32,063
Do a lot for themselves and Caesar had left their officers with him and so all of them would simply throw down there

3981
03:22:32,319 --> 03:22:34,623
Work tools grab a weapon that they could find

3982
03:22:34,879 --> 03:22:41,023
Caesar says their shields were still in the leather cases their helmets worn off and around and they just ran to the nearest standard

3983
03:22:41,279 --> 03:22:44,095
They forgot anything about going to their own unit they're just trying to form

3984
03:22:44,351 --> 03:22:49,983
A block of human beings that can resist this on Rush that's coming toward them at full running speed

3985
03:22:51,519 --> 03:22:54,079
I'm not understand by tribesmen here

3986
03:22:54,335 --> 03:22:57,151
Are participating in a huge gamble because they certainly know

3987
03:22:57,407 --> 03:23:02,271
That they are going to be like blown horses by the time they reach the Roman line

3988
03:23:02,783 --> 03:23:07,135
They're taking this gamble that there won't be any Roman lines when they get there yet

3989
03:23:07,647 --> 03:23:12,255
And if they're going to be able to attack these Romans while they're still divided and in small

3990
03:23:12,767 --> 03:23:17,119
Lumps that are unconnected to each other in which case they should be able to just blow them away

3991
03:23:17,887 --> 03:23:19,679
But the gamble is if they don't

3992
03:23:19,935 --> 03:23:21,727
They're not going to have a whole lot less

3993
03:23:21,983 --> 03:23:25,567
If this turns into any kind of a long-term slog they're doomed

3994
03:23:26,847 --> 03:23:31,967
Caesar says he grabs a flag he says a couple of words of encouragement to the unit that he's with

3995
03:23:32,223 --> 03:23:37,343
Before going to the next unit to talk to them about the time he gets to the next unit they're already engaged

3996
03:23:39,647 --> 03:23:41,183
This is a moment here

3997
03:23:41,439 --> 03:23:43,743
With these Legions and Caesar with the

3998
03:23:43,999 --> 03:23:45,535
Could easily be overrun

3999
03:23:46,559 --> 03:23:51,935
And it allows us to play with some counterfactual we haven't really been able to discuss yet the first counterfactual is

4000
03:23:52,703 --> 03:23:53,983
What is Caesar loses here

4001
03:23:55,263 --> 03:23:57,055
The second counterfactual is

4002
03:23:57,311 --> 03:23:58,847
What if Caesar dies here

4003
03:24:00,895 --> 03:24:01,663
In the first case

4004
03:24:01,919 --> 03:24:03,199
And we had said earlier that

4005
03:24:03,455 --> 03:24:04,991
The Roman expansion into

4006
03:24:05,503 --> 03:24:06,015
Tribal

4007
03:24:06,271 --> 03:24:11,391
Territory the rich tribal territory to the north of them seemed inevitable just like manifest destiny

4008
03:24:12,671 --> 03:24:14,975
But maybe the question to ask is how many

4009
03:24:15,487 --> 03:24:18,815
Deaths would it take to make something that seemed inevitable

4010
03:24:19,327 --> 03:24:20,607
Not inevitable anymore

4011
03:24:22,399 --> 03:24:25,471
Because we can see that only about 65 years after

4012
03:24:25,727 --> 03:24:26,495
This battle

4013
03:24:27,007 --> 03:24:29,055
The Romans will be ambushed by another tribe of people

4014
03:24:29,311 --> 03:24:34,687
4 tribes of people this time in Germany modern-day Germany and they're probably what we could call German

4015
03:24:36,735 --> 03:24:38,015
They will destroy

4016
03:24:38,271 --> 03:24:41,855
This Roman army a famous battle called the teutoburg evolved

4017
03:24:42,367 --> 03:24:44,415
In 980 I believe it is

4018
03:24:44,927 --> 03:24:50,559
The Roman Commander will commit suicide on the battlefield to avoid falling into the hands

4019
03:24:51,071 --> 03:24:52,607
Apus Barbarian opponents

4020
03:24:53,119 --> 03:24:56,703
Which if you believe the hype top Roman sources

4021
03:24:56,959 --> 03:25:03,103
Is a good thing to do because the Romans conduct is his legendary would be a good way to prevent legendary

4022
03:25:03,359 --> 03:25:04,639
Asian a couple years after that

4023
03:25:04,895 --> 03:25:05,919
Beaten debacle

4024
03:25:06,431 --> 03:25:09,247
To recover what's left of their dead comrades

4025
03:25:09,759 --> 03:25:14,111
And they go into the deep dark forest and supposedly they the Allura details of

4026
03:25:14,367 --> 03:25:16,159
A Roman skeletons

4027
03:25:16,415 --> 03:25:20,767
Is stapled to the trees and piles of skulls and religious

4028
03:25:21,535 --> 03:25:22,303
Alters with

4029
03:25:22,559 --> 03:25:28,703
You're dead Romans and blood everywhere I mean just this horrible tribal nightmarish

4030
03:25:28,959 --> 03:25:30,239
Visitation of all

4031
03:25:30,495 --> 03:25:33,055
Shall we say the native frustration at the situation

4032
03:25:34,591 --> 03:25:40,735
And you have the famous story of the Roman Emperor at the time who will beat his head against the wall and supposedly yelled the name of the jet

4033
03:25:40,991 --> 03:25:44,575
General who killed himself Beres and say there is give me back my Legions

4034
03:25:45,855 --> 03:25:48,927
That was only about 15000 Dead Romans

4035
03:25:49,439 --> 03:25:53,535
And whatever happened there was one of the main components supposedly

4036
03:25:53,791 --> 03:25:58,143
That made the Romans decide you know what we don't need to advance any farther in Germany anymore

4037
03:25:58,399 --> 03:26:01,983
That's a good place to just set the border and we'll expand elsewhere

4038
03:26:02,495 --> 03:26:07,615
If that really played that large of a role in the Romans decided not to go into Germany any farther

4039
03:26:08,127 --> 03:26:08,639
What is

4040
03:26:09,151 --> 03:26:09,919
Caesar lost

4041
03:26:10,175 --> 03:26:11,455
Twice that many men

4042
03:26:11,711 --> 03:26:12,479
At this bar

4043
03:26:13,503 --> 03:26:15,807
And what is twice that many men

4044
03:26:16,063 --> 03:26:17,855
In the larger scheme of things what you say

4045
03:26:18,111 --> 03:26:21,695
Chica the natives have ever done anything to short-circuit manifest destiny

4046
03:26:21,951 --> 03:26:23,743
Well I don't know what if they killed

4047
03:26:23,999 --> 03:26:27,071
30000 American soldiers in an afternoon

4048
03:26:27,583 --> 03:26:28,863
I went and did the math

4049
03:26:29,631 --> 03:26:30,655
And you know these numbers are

4050
03:26:31,423 --> 03:26:31,935
Debatable

4051
03:26:32,191 --> 03:26:38,079
Too but I went to some common sources and I added up all of the combat deaths that the United States has suffer

4052
03:26:38,847 --> 03:26:42,175
From the wars of Independence when we got our independence in this country

4053
03:26:42,431 --> 03:26:44,223
Up until the first world war start

4054
03:26:44,735 --> 03:26:49,599
And then I subtracted the Civil War because those are crazy dance and everybody on both sides dying as in America

4055
03:26:49,855 --> 03:26:50,367
Casualty

4056
03:26:50,623 --> 03:26:51,135
So

4057
03:26:51,391 --> 03:26:56,255
Total us combat deaths excluding the Civil War up to 1917 and it's

4058
03:26:56,511 --> 03:26:58,815
Almost certainly under 30000

4059
03:27:00,863 --> 03:27:01,631
If you lost

4060
03:27:01,887 --> 03:27:07,519
All the people you lost from Independence to the first world war minus the Civil War in an afternoon

4061
03:27:08,031 --> 03:27:11,103
Wood that is slowed down Manifest Destiny at all how much

4062
03:27:12,383 --> 03:27:14,431
If United States ran into a gawlik

4063
03:27:14,687 --> 03:27:18,527
Kingdom on the other side of the western side of the Mississippi early on

4064
03:27:18,783 --> 03:27:22,367
And they inflicted a 30,000 death afternoon on the United States

4065
03:27:23,391 --> 03:27:25,695
The ramifications of that who knows

4066
03:27:26,975 --> 03:27:29,791
But remember the Romans have no guns they have no Cannon

4067
03:27:30,047 --> 03:27:31,327
They're on this hill

4068
03:27:31,583 --> 03:27:35,167
Trying to deal with these people that are going to smash into them

4069
03:27:35,935 --> 03:27:38,239
And seizures running from unit to unit trying to help

4070
03:27:39,007 --> 03:27:41,567
It's the most critical point of his career so far

4071
03:27:41,823 --> 03:27:45,151
If he dies here which is very very possible

4072
03:27:46,175 --> 03:27:47,199
Does the Roman

4073
03:27:47,455 --> 03:27:52,063
Republic fall does the empire ever start I mean the Dominos Start Tumbling

4074
03:27:52,319 --> 03:27:53,599
If there's no Caesar

4075
03:27:53,855 --> 03:27:55,135
In at the end of this afternoon

4076
03:27:58,207 --> 03:28:03,071
Remember Caesar is going to maximize his chances of becoming a casualty

4077
03:28:03,583 --> 03:28:04,863
I continually

4078
03:28:05,119 --> 03:28:07,167
In a running over to whichever part

4079
03:28:07,423 --> 03:28:13,567
I'll his battle line if you can even call it something is organized does that whichever part is the most threatened

4080
03:28:13,823 --> 03:28:16,639
Right where the 911 call is he's going to go there

4081
03:28:18,943 --> 03:28:22,015
When the belgae when the nervi I managed to hit his

4082
03:28:22,527 --> 03:28:23,039
Troops

4083
03:28:23,807 --> 03:28:28,927
Is troops on the left are able to get off he says a throw of their Pila the heavy javelin

4084
03:28:29,183 --> 03:28:30,719
And then charge down the hill

4085
03:28:31,231 --> 03:28:32,511
At this one group of

4086
03:28:32,767 --> 03:28:34,047
Kalter belgae

4087
03:28:34,303 --> 03:28:38,655
They will beat them chase them down the hill chase them over the river

4088
03:28:40,191 --> 03:28:46,335
The Warriors will then regroup and charge the Romans again only to be beaten by the left-wing of the Romans again

4089
03:28:46,591 --> 03:28:49,663
And that left-wing will start advancing up the hill

4090
03:28:50,175 --> 03:28:52,479
George where the Celtic Camp is

4091
03:28:54,527 --> 03:28:57,343
Cesar Center will also weather the storm

4092
03:28:58,367 --> 03:29:03,999
And managed to do something similar by beating and hand-to-hand combat the Warriors that they run into to their front

4093
03:29:04,767 --> 03:29:05,791
And will also advance

4094
03:29:06,559 --> 03:29:09,887
Now the problem is is with the left in the center advancing

4095
03:29:10,399 --> 03:29:11,935
You end up with an open space

4096
03:29:12,191 --> 03:29:17,823
The Roman right-wing no longer has any protection their uncovered on the flank you might say

4097
03:29:19,359 --> 03:29:21,151
And Caesar says a giant group

4098
03:29:21,663 --> 03:29:23,711
Are these nerves VII tribesmen

4099
03:29:24,223 --> 03:29:26,527
With the Commander in like a giant

4100
03:29:27,039 --> 03:29:28,575
Hammerhead column

4101
03:29:28,831 --> 03:29:30,111
Push through this Gap

4102
03:29:31,135 --> 03:29:33,439
And then once they're past the CenterPoint

4103
03:29:33,695 --> 03:29:35,231
Some of them turn around

4104
03:29:35,487 --> 03:29:37,279
And begin to smash into the flank

4105
03:29:37,535 --> 03:29:39,071
Oh Caesars right hand units

4106
03:29:40,095 --> 03:29:43,167
Some of them go straight on ahead toward the Roman camp

4107
03:29:43,423 --> 03:29:46,239
Thoughts of looting and burning and pillaging

4108
03:29:48,543 --> 03:29:51,103
So Caesars right-hand Legions are now in trouble

4109
03:29:52,383 --> 03:29:54,687
He runs over to them to try to help

4110
03:29:55,199 --> 03:29:55,967
Meanwhile

4111
03:29:56,223 --> 03:30:01,855
When the Celtic forces the belgae forces break into Caesar's camp and start looting

4112
03:30:02,111 --> 03:30:04,415
The people that see that think the battle is over

4113
03:30:05,183 --> 03:30:06,719
Caesar says his Cavalry in

4114
03:30:06,975 --> 03:30:08,511
And light troops in

4115
03:30:08,767 --> 03:30:12,351
Been brushed aside like insects and beaten so badly when this first

4116
03:30:12,607 --> 03:30:13,119
Starts

4117
03:30:13,375 --> 03:30:18,239
Are just now we really struggling into Camp they look up and they see

4118
03:30:18,495 --> 03:30:24,127
The very people who just beat the hell out of them running rampant through seizures camp and they go that's that and they run away

4119
03:30:24,895 --> 03:30:25,919
All of the civilian

4120
03:30:26,175 --> 03:30:26,687
And

4121
03:30:26,943 --> 03:30:33,087
An average Joe camp followers run in fear we're told even that seizure is very tough supposedly

4122
03:30:33,343 --> 03:30:36,415
A Celtic Allied Cavalry season

4123
03:30:37,183 --> 03:30:39,743
These belgae running rampant through the Roman

4124
03:30:39,999 --> 03:30:43,583
Camping figures they're done to so they turn around and go home and other words

4125
03:30:44,095 --> 03:30:47,167
Little Caesars bad situation is getting worse by the moment

4126
03:30:47,423 --> 03:30:49,215
So he runs over to the right flank

4127
03:30:49,471 --> 03:30:51,519
With these units are in Desperate trouble

4128
03:30:51,775 --> 03:30:52,799
And basically

4129
03:30:53,055 --> 03:30:56,127
Portrays the situation as dire

4130
03:30:56,383 --> 03:30:59,199
And collapse of the right flank as eminent

4131
03:31:00,991 --> 03:31:01,759
Usually seizure

4132
03:31:02,015 --> 03:31:03,807
Describe the difficulties on

4133
03:31:04,063 --> 03:31:07,135
The right flank is from is a Hanford translation

4134
03:31:07,647 --> 03:31:11,999
And remember when Caesar writes Caesar he's talking about himself in the third person quote

4135
03:31:13,279 --> 03:31:17,119
After addressing the 10th Legion Caesar had gone to the right wing

4136
03:31:17,375 --> 03:31:18,911
Where you found the troops and difficult

4137
03:31:19,423 --> 03:31:25,567
The cohorts of the 12th Legion were packed together so closely that the men were in one another's way and could not fight

4138
03:31:25,823 --> 03:31:26,335
Properly

4139
03:31:26,591 --> 03:31:31,199
All the centurions of the fourth cohort as well as the standard Bearer were killed

4140
03:31:31,455 --> 03:31:32,735
And a standard was lost

4141
03:31:33,247 --> 03:31:36,575
Nearly all the centurions of the other cohorts were either killed or wounded

4142
03:31:36,831 --> 03:31:40,159
Including the chief Centurion Publius extjs Bakula

4143
03:31:40,415 --> 03:31:41,951
Amanda very great courage

4144
03:31:42,207 --> 03:31:46,559
Who was so disabled by a number of severe wounds that he could no longer stand

4145
03:31:46,815 --> 03:31:49,887
The man's movements were slow and some in the rear

4146
03:31:50,143 --> 03:31:54,495
Feeling themselves abandoned we're retiring from the fight and trying to get out of rain

4147
03:31:55,007 --> 03:31:55,775
Meanwhile

4148
03:31:56,031 --> 03:31:59,103
The enemy maintained unceasing pressure up the hill in front

4149
03:31:59,359 --> 03:32:01,407
And we're also closing in on both flanks

4150
03:32:01,663 --> 03:32:04,991
As the situation was critical and no reserves were available

4151
03:32:05,503 --> 03:32:08,063
Cesar snack The Shield from a soldier in the rear

4152
03:32:08,575 --> 03:32:10,111
He had not his own shield with him

4153
03:32:10,623 --> 03:32:16,767
Made his way into the front line address each century and by name and shouted encouragement to the rest

4154
03:32:17,023 --> 03:32:17,535
Cast of the troops

4155
03:32:17,791 --> 03:32:22,655
Ordering them to push forward and open out their rank so that they could use their swords more easily

4156
03:32:23,167 --> 03:32:25,215
He's coming gave them fresh Heart and Hope

4157
03:32:25,471 --> 03:32:29,055
Each man wanted to do his best under the eyes of his commander-in-chief

4158
03:32:29,311 --> 03:32:30,335
However desperate

4159
03:32:30,591 --> 03:32:33,407
Apparel in the enemy's assault was slow down a little

4160
03:32:33,919 --> 03:32:34,431
And quote

4161
03:32:36,223 --> 03:32:40,575
But the legion next door to that was having even worse trouble so Caesar ran over there

4162
03:32:41,343 --> 03:32:43,391
Go to the commanders of that Force 2

4163
03:32:43,903 --> 03:32:50,047
Put his soldiers into a square so that they couldn't be out flanking attack from the rear anymore in that stabilize that's

4164
03:32:50,303 --> 03:32:50,815
Situation

4165
03:32:53,119 --> 03:32:56,447
Historian Adrian goldsworthy writes about this moment saying that

4166
03:32:56,703 --> 03:33:01,055
Caesar had stabilized the situation on the right flank but the collapse was still Eminem

4167
03:33:01,823 --> 03:33:02,847
Was just a matter of time

4168
03:33:03,615 --> 03:33:04,127
The

4169
03:33:04,639 --> 03:33:07,455
The Celtic force was battering these Romans down

4170
03:33:08,735 --> 03:33:09,759
But two things happen

4171
03:33:10,527 --> 03:33:13,599
But ended up having the same effect on this battle

4172
03:33:13,855 --> 03:33:19,999
As the Romans having a third reserve line has done in the previous battle remember they don't have a reserve line

4173
03:33:20,255 --> 03:33:21,023
They don't have a line

4174
03:33:21,279 --> 03:33:22,303
They're not deployed

4175
03:33:23,071 --> 03:33:25,119
What ends up happening is those Romans that had

4176
03:33:25,375 --> 03:33:31,519
Victorious initially on the left side and gone and capture the Barbarian camp on the opposite Hill or now he

4177
03:33:31,775 --> 03:33:34,079
Able to look down and see the problem that Caesar was facing

4178
03:33:34,847 --> 03:33:36,383
So they began to come down the hill

4179
03:33:36,639 --> 03:33:38,431
To renew the fight themselves Plus

4180
03:33:38,943 --> 03:33:41,759
The legions in the very end of the column

4181
03:33:42,015 --> 03:33:43,807
The tale of the snake

4182
03:33:44,319 --> 03:33:45,343
Have finally

4183
03:33:45,599 --> 03:33:48,671
And I've gotten to the top of the hill and look down and see what's going on

4184
03:33:49,183 --> 03:33:50,975
And they now enter The Fray

4185
03:33:51,231 --> 03:33:57,375
So even though Caesar wasn't able to create the traditional Roman 3rd line reserve line to throw in in

4186
03:33:57,631 --> 03:33:58,143
When everything

4187
03:33:58,399 --> 03:33:59,935
We're going to hell in a handbasket

4188
03:34:00,191 --> 03:34:03,007
The circumstances had an effect created one

4189
03:34:03,775 --> 03:34:09,663
An allegiant that came down after capturing the Celtic camp and the ones that came up from the rear of the baggage train

4190
03:34:10,175 --> 03:34:11,711
Turn the tide of the battle

4191
03:34:11,967 --> 03:34:12,479
And

4192
03:34:12,735 --> 03:34:13,759
Remember these

4193
03:34:14,015 --> 03:34:18,879
Belgae these nerves VII and related tribes who sold their soul

4194
03:34:19,135 --> 03:34:22,207
For that initial charge they were like blown horses as we said

4195
03:34:22,463 --> 03:34:25,023
The arrival of fresh troops is the worst thing that could have

4196
03:34:27,583 --> 03:34:28,351
But Caesar says they were

4197
03:34:28,607 --> 03:34:29,119
Tough

4198
03:34:29,375 --> 03:34:30,399
They were ferocious

4199
03:34:30,655 --> 03:34:32,191
They would not give in

4200
03:34:32,447 --> 03:34:34,495
Even when he had them basically

4201
03:34:34,751 --> 03:34:37,823
You know compressed into a disordered mob and he was

4202
03:34:38,079 --> 03:34:41,663
He was killing them all with missile weapons that you didn't even have to risk his troops

4203
03:34:41,919 --> 03:34:45,759
He said the Warriors stood on top of the corpses of their friends

4204
03:34:46,015 --> 03:34:46,783
Cold

4205
03:34:47,039 --> 03:34:47,551
The

4206
03:34:48,063 --> 03:34:48,831
Spears

4207
03:34:49,343 --> 03:34:55,487
Of the enemy out of their Shield or caught them in the air and turned around and threw them back in a yelling defiantly

4208
03:34:55,743 --> 03:34:57,279
Need to the Romans even as they know

4209
03:34:57,535 --> 03:34:58,815
How the afternoon is going to turn out

4210
03:35:00,607 --> 03:35:02,399
A ferocious Warrior enemy

4211
03:35:02,911 --> 03:35:05,727
Allowing themselves to be absolutely decimated

4212
03:35:05,983 --> 03:35:10,591
Rather than running away once again let's remember Caesar has every interest in portraying the

4213
03:35:11,103 --> 03:35:11,871
To be

4214
03:35:12,383 --> 03:35:15,455
As incredibly nasty and brave as possible none the less

4215
03:35:16,223 --> 03:35:17,247
Maybe they were

4216
03:35:19,807 --> 03:35:21,599
Caesar says that after the battle

4217
03:35:22,623 --> 03:35:24,671
Families that had taken shelter in the Deep

4218
03:35:24,927 --> 03:35:25,439
Darkwood

4219
03:35:25,951 --> 03:35:26,719
Swamps came out

4220
03:35:27,487 --> 03:35:27,999
Begging

4221
03:35:28,767 --> 03:35:30,047
Is clemency with

4222
03:35:30,303 --> 03:35:32,095
Which Caesar gives and was known for giving

4223
03:35:32,607 --> 03:35:34,143
Plenty of times with point that out in

4224
03:35:34,399 --> 03:35:36,191
To be fair to him it was part of his act

4225
03:35:36,703 --> 03:35:37,471
Clipart of a stick

4226
03:35:38,751 --> 03:35:41,311
Unites Jena se qua sometimes I'll let you live

4227
03:35:41,823 --> 03:35:42,591
But he did

4228
03:35:43,103 --> 03:35:48,735
He also says though they gave him a rundown of what they suffered in the battle and he says that they told him

4229
03:35:49,247 --> 03:35:51,039
Out of 60000 fighting man

4230
03:35:51,807 --> 03:35:52,575
They only had five

4231
03:35:52,831 --> 03:35:53,343
Country left

4232
03:35:53,855 --> 03:35:54,367
Carry arms

4233
03:35:54,623 --> 03:35:56,159
Now that doesn't tell you

4234
03:35:56,927 --> 03:35:57,695
If those people are

4235
03:35:57,951 --> 03:35:58,463
Heralded

4236
03:35:59,743 --> 03:36:01,535
Incapacitated from wounds

4237
03:36:01,791 --> 03:36:04,351
Likely a combination of both we have no idea what

4238
03:36:04,607 --> 03:36:05,375
The breakdown is

4239
03:36:06,911 --> 03:36:07,935
And they also point out

4240
03:36:08,447 --> 03:36:09,471
The Caesar has

4241
03:36:09,727 --> 03:36:10,495
Destroyed their lead

4242
03:36:11,519 --> 03:36:13,823
In this battle they say out of 600

4243
03:36:14,335 --> 03:36:20,479
The different translations say different things one says senators and others as counselors into this is magistrates but out of 600 of these

4244
03:36:20,735 --> 03:36:22,015
These leading figures in the tribe

4245
03:36:23,039 --> 03:36:24,831
The survivors tell Caesar only

4246
03:36:25,087 --> 03:36:25,599
3r live

4247
03:36:27,135 --> 03:36:29,695
So for all intents and purposes he has destroyed

4248
03:36:33,023 --> 03:36:34,047
I did it in battle

4249
03:36:35,071 --> 03:36:36,863
And that's going to make a crucial difference soon

4250
03:36:37,375 --> 03:36:40,959
There's one little bit of leftover business of the Caesar accomplish is right at the end of this battle

4251
03:36:41,471 --> 03:36:44,799
One of the tribes that was coming to help the nervi I never made it to the battle

4252
03:36:45,823 --> 03:36:47,871
Found out the results turned around and went home

4253
03:36:48,383 --> 03:36:50,431
But that doesn't get you out of trouble

4254
03:36:50,687 --> 03:36:52,991
With Caesar who follows them back home

4255
03:36:53,503 --> 03:36:54,271
He has a very

4256
03:36:54,783 --> 03:36:56,575
How confusing incident involving

4257
03:36:56,831 --> 03:36:58,623
You know the deals of a surrender that

4258
03:36:58,879 --> 03:37:05,023
Maybe were misinterpreted none the less bad things happen so Caesar eventually had to storm the town kill a lot of people

4259
03:37:05,279 --> 03:37:07,583
He says he sold 53000

4260
03:37:07,839 --> 03:37:10,143
People from the population into slavery

4261
03:37:10,399 --> 03:37:12,959
And point out that he sold them all in one lot

4262
03:37:14,239 --> 03:37:16,031
Conversion of Storage Wars

4263
03:37:16,287 --> 03:37:16,799
Or something

4264
03:37:17,055 --> 03:37:17,823
How much for this

4265
03:37:18,079 --> 03:37:19,103
Entire city of slaves

4266
03:37:19,359 --> 03:37:21,151
Say you got 53000 at a bargain price

4267
03:37:22,687 --> 03:37:24,735
And the slaves now let's recall something

4268
03:37:25,503 --> 03:37:26,783
This is money

4269
03:37:27,807 --> 03:37:29,599
Teaching you sell the slaves

4270
03:37:30,111 --> 03:37:31,903
You make money it's one of the

4271
03:37:32,415 --> 03:37:34,207
Things that comprise booty

4272
03:37:35,231 --> 03:37:35,743
Money

4273
03:37:36,255 --> 03:37:36,767
Stuff

4274
03:37:37,023 --> 03:37:39,071
You know whatever you can take and sell

4275
03:37:39,583 --> 03:37:42,655
Whatever you can take for yourself sometime Caesar wood gift

4276
03:37:43,423 --> 03:37:44,191
Slaves

4277
03:37:44,447 --> 03:37:47,263
And I want slaves 5 minutes ago that's for that out

4278
03:37:47,519 --> 03:37:49,823
Which one get this life

4279
03:37:50,335 --> 03:37:51,359
That is a nice

4280
03:37:51,615 --> 03:37:52,127
Little

4281
03:37:52,383 --> 03:37:53,407
Christmas bonus

4282
03:37:53,663 --> 03:37:55,455
If you are Roman soldier or any Soldier

4283
03:37:57,247 --> 03:37:58,783
And a couple of historians

4284
03:38:00,319 --> 03:38:03,903
Say but no one knows because it's not like we have a financial

4285
03:38:04,159 --> 03:38:06,463
Statement on how Caesars doing each year

4286
03:38:06,975 --> 03:38:11,583
But you stopped hearing about seizures terrible Financial crunches now and he's

4287
03:38:11,839 --> 03:38:13,887
He seemed Distributing money more

4288
03:38:14,399 --> 03:38:20,543
He's allegedly paying his troops more than the going rate and he's sharing the winnings with them which is pretty normal but if you're doing

4289
03:38:20,799 --> 03:38:21,567
Doing really well

4290
03:38:21,823 --> 03:38:23,359
The winnings can be really good

4291
03:38:24,639 --> 03:38:25,919
And as a side note

4292
03:38:26,431 --> 03:38:28,479
All of you who know the Roman story understand this

4293
03:38:28,991 --> 03:38:31,551
There's a process underway here that will play

4294
03:38:32,063 --> 03:38:36,927
You know mightily into the destruction of the Roman Republic very soon and that's the

4295
03:38:37,439 --> 03:38:39,231
Allegiance of this Army

4296
03:38:39,743 --> 03:38:44,863
Not necessarily being 100% entirely to the Senate and people of Rome

4297
03:38:45,375 --> 03:38:47,423
But increasingly more and more

4298
03:38:47,679 --> 03:38:48,703
To this man

4299
03:38:49,215 --> 03:38:50,239
Julius Caesar

4300
03:38:51,263 --> 03:38:54,335
And he's far from the only Roman general this is happening to

4301
03:38:54,591 --> 03:38:55,359
His

4302
03:38:55,615 --> 03:38:58,943
Fellow members of the triumvirate are getting into similar situation

4303
03:39:00,991 --> 03:39:02,783
When the allegiance of the truth because

4304
03:39:03,295 --> 03:39:09,439
You know how they're doing in life is so dependent on that single figure at the head of their particular Army when they were Legion ship

4305
03:39:09,695 --> 03:39:13,535
Gifts from the state to a single individual you can see how the recipe for disaster is just

4306
03:39:14,303 --> 03:39:18,399
Will the chain reaction is already started right drums problems go deep into the distance but

4307
03:39:18,655 --> 03:39:20,703
That's a key component that has to happen

4308
03:39:20,959 --> 03:39:22,495
And what I always tell people

4309
03:39:22,751 --> 03:39:23,519
I think they see

4310
03:39:23,775 --> 03:39:25,823
Parallels with the United States today

4311
03:39:26,335 --> 03:39:28,639
And the Roman Republic is yes there's there are some

4312
03:39:29,151 --> 03:39:31,967
But you're missing that key component and it's important

4313
03:39:32,735 --> 03:39:35,039
We don't have armies that are beholding the single

4314
03:39:35,551 --> 03:39:37,855
Military individuals more than they are the state

4315
03:39:38,111 --> 03:39:43,231
Increasingly is this Army and Cesar bond together and share the fruits of their labors they are

4316
03:39:45,535 --> 03:39:51,679
So the question of whether Caesars in debt anymore seems to be that he probably isn't and in fact this little business

4317
03:39:51,935 --> 03:39:52,447
Adventure

4318
03:39:52,959 --> 03:39:55,263
Gall is working out pretty well indeed

4319
03:39:55,775 --> 03:40:01,919
So Caesar says after this little battle with the belgae he sends a message to Rome and he says

4320
03:40:02,687 --> 03:40:03,711
And let me find out

4321
03:40:03,967 --> 03:40:06,783
Not for the last time in his commentary

4322
03:40:07,295 --> 03:40:09,343
Gaul is pacified

4323
03:40:11,391 --> 03:40:12,415
Now let me stop

4324
03:40:12,927 --> 03:40:15,231
Because if you say not for the last time

4325
03:40:15,743 --> 03:40:21,631
Is Gaul really pacify because again you have to wonder what Caesars doing here he may have had a whole lot of reason

4326
03:40:22,399 --> 03:40:24,703
For going back to Rome at this time.

4327
03:40:24,959 --> 03:40:27,263
And telling them pay the war's over and we won

4328
03:40:28,031 --> 03:40:32,127
Can see some advisor going to listen to Caesar you have no idea what it's like on the ground in Rome right now we're trying to get

4329
03:40:32,639 --> 03:40:37,503
These people elected to the Senate you would really help if the timing we're going you said we won in Gaul right now

4330
03:40:38,271 --> 03:40:40,831
I guess what I'm saying is I trust Caesar and his intelligence

4331
03:40:41,343 --> 03:40:41,855
Both his

4332
03:40:42,111 --> 03:40:43,903
Mental intelligence at his reconnaissance

4333
03:40:44,415 --> 03:40:45,439
Enough to think

4334
03:40:46,463 --> 03:40:52,607
That I doubt whether he thought Gaul really was pacified because let's look at what just happened to your into campaign season

4335
03:40:52,863 --> 03:40:53,631
Less than 2 years

4336
03:40:54,655 --> 03:40:57,471
Caesar conquered a place the size of Texas

4337
03:40:58,751 --> 03:40:59,519
Ploutarxos

4338
03:41:00,287 --> 03:41:02,079
300 tribes

4339
03:41:03,615 --> 03:41:04,127
Really

4340
03:41:04,383 --> 03:41:07,199
And you expected to stay subdued

4341
03:41:08,735 --> 03:41:11,551
Well if he did expect that he was wrong

4342
03:41:11,807 --> 03:41:14,367
And if you didn't well there must have been another reason for

4343
03:41:14,879 --> 03:41:17,183
Telling the people back in Rome that the war was over

4344
03:41:17,951 --> 03:41:23,583
Caesar in a rare obvious Bragg in the commentaries points out that when the Romans heard

4345
03:41:23,839 --> 03:41:28,703
The teacher had just wanted ghaul they proclaimed 15 days of Thanksgiving in the capital

4346
03:41:29,471 --> 03:41:30,495
Which Caesar points out

4347
03:41:31,007 --> 03:41:36,895
Is a longer. Of time than anyone before him at ever had a Thanksgiving declared in their honor

4348
03:41:37,919 --> 03:41:38,687
So maybe that

4349
03:41:39,199 --> 03:41:40,223
For it right there

4350
03:41:41,247 --> 03:41:42,015
Let's remember

4351
03:41:42,527 --> 03:41:45,855
Why Caesars in Gaul doing all this

4352
03:41:46,111 --> 03:41:46,623
To begin with

4353
03:41:47,903 --> 03:41:49,695
Because of how it's looking back home

4354
03:41:50,207 --> 03:41:53,023
15 days of Thanksgiving an unprecedented amount

4355
03:41:54,047 --> 03:41:57,887
That makes it all worth it right there doesn't depends on what your goals are of course

4356
03:42:00,447 --> 03:42:03,519
Now the other thing that needs to be pointed out here is how victory

4357
03:42:03,775 --> 03:42:04,799
Heather Way

4358
03:42:05,311 --> 03:42:07,103
Forgiving everything

4359
03:42:07,871 --> 03:42:08,383
Because

4360
03:42:08,639 --> 03:42:10,943
There is an undercurrent in a row my mom

4361
03:42:11,199 --> 03:42:17,343
Prominent individuals admittedly prominent individuals that don't like Caesar anyway and would find something to get him with

4362
03:42:17,599 --> 03:42:18,879
If they could anywhere

4363
03:42:19,647 --> 03:42:22,463
But what seizures doing is grossly illegal on many fronts

4364
03:42:24,767 --> 03:42:25,791
He's raised

4365
03:42:26,047 --> 03:42:26,815
Legions

4366
03:42:27,327 --> 03:42:29,375
Out of his own pocket booking without permission

4367
03:42:31,167 --> 03:42:32,959
His opponents in Rome

4368
03:42:33,215 --> 03:42:36,031
I pointed out things that he's done during this campaign

4369
03:42:36,543 --> 03:42:42,687
That are violations of Roman honor and one or two of them will suggest maybe he should be handed over

4370
03:42:42,943 --> 03:42:46,015
To the former Roman enemies as a

4371
03:42:46,527 --> 03:42:48,575
Well slippery this way the Romans have done that before

4372
03:42:49,087 --> 03:42:51,391
Who are some Roman General on the ground made a deal with

4373
03:42:51,647 --> 03:42:52,671
Another city

4374
03:42:52,927 --> 03:42:56,255
Came back the Roman senate repudiated the deal

4375
03:42:56,511 --> 03:43:02,655
Sent the general back to the former opponents in Chains left him outside of in front of the front gate and said sorry he couldn't make a deal

4376
03:43:02,911 --> 03:43:05,727
You like that does against Roman honor but since he did here you can have him do it

4377
03:43:05,983 --> 03:43:07,007
And what you want

4378
03:43:08,287 --> 03:43:08,799
Never people

4379
03:43:09,311 --> 03:43:12,639
You know of the Cato Camp they were maybe suggestion Caesar deserve treatment

4380
03:43:12,895 --> 03:43:15,967
Like that but very few people were listening you know why

4381
03:43:16,479 --> 03:43:18,527
Cuz the guy just conquered and area

4382
03:43:18,783 --> 03:43:21,343
Larger than all of Italy itself

4383
03:43:21,599 --> 03:43:22,879
Into campaign season

4384
03:43:23,903 --> 03:43:24,927
You can hear the

4385
03:43:25,183 --> 03:43:31,071
Crowd going wrong number one I mean come on when in human history

4386
03:43:31,327 --> 03:43:34,143
Have the populist not celebrated unbelievable Victor

4387
03:43:34,399 --> 03:43:36,703
It's almost weird to imagine

4388
03:43:36,959 --> 03:43:39,263
The general public ever doing the opposite

4389
03:43:41,567 --> 03:43:45,407
So what it took for is easier to get these victories legal or illegal

4390
03:43:45,919 --> 03:43:47,711
Are totally overshadowed by the result

4391
03:43:49,247 --> 03:43:52,831
The result may be an illusion now Caesar says that after

4392
03:43:53,087 --> 03:43:55,391
He's done here he goes and starts to look at

4393
03:43:55,647 --> 03:43:59,999
The next big adventure he's going to do is between illegal to go into Italy around where

4394
03:44:00,511 --> 03:44:01,279
You know the modern

4395
03:44:01,535 --> 03:44:07,679
Adriatic is he's going to start conference and try to that which had been a plan of his all along but now they call is pacify her

4396
03:44:07,935 --> 03:44:10,239
He can put some time into it nieces while he's there

4397
03:44:10,495 --> 03:44:12,799
Gall erupts back into war

4398
03:44:14,335 --> 03:44:18,431
It happened so fast you can't help but wonder if it was ever pacified at all

4399
03:44:19,199 --> 03:44:23,039
And there been some theories floated in a bunch of books I've read lately which I think is facet

4400
03:44:23,551 --> 03:44:27,647
I'm going to run past you cuz it would make a lot of sense winded and it's the idea

4401
03:44:28,159 --> 03:44:32,767
That may be the reason Gul almost immediately erupts into trouble after Caesar says it

4402
03:44:33,023 --> 03:44:33,535
Pacified

4403
03:44:33,791 --> 03:44:39,679
Is it maybe they didn't fully understand what they were agreeing to when they said that they were going to submit to Raw

4404
03:44:39,935 --> 03:44:42,751
Redwoods Rome is treating them as though they have signed a contract

4405
03:44:43,263 --> 03:44:44,543
And if you break the contract

4406
03:44:45,055 --> 03:44:47,103
The ramifications are

4407
03:44:47,359 --> 03:44:50,431
In a mafia-style in nature so don't break the contract

4408
03:44:50,943 --> 03:44:53,503
And maybe like a bunch of Native Americans

4409
03:44:53,759 --> 03:44:58,367
For expected to read like a lawyer this treaty and yet they can hardly write their names

4410
03:44:58,623 --> 03:45:00,159
In the white man's language

4411
03:45:00,415 --> 03:45:06,303
Maybe these Celtic leaders were essentially taken for a ride their Barbarian lawyer is not as good as the Roman ones

4412
03:45:07,071 --> 03:45:13,215
And maybe as soon as they started living under the real terms of the deal maybe was a little different than they thought of what he just during the Great lie

4413
03:45:13,471 --> 03:45:18,079
He's a beast tribes were accustomed to making themselves clients of other Barbarian people

4414
03:45:19,359 --> 03:45:21,407
Very well may have treated them

4415
03:45:21,663 --> 03:45:26,271
In a much more laissez-faire hands-off kind of fashion that might have been

4416
03:45:26,527 --> 03:45:28,319
Their idea of a client in their world

4417
03:45:28,575 --> 03:45:34,719
But now the Romans were coming in and these are going to send the fence surveyors to your property let's see where the property line is your we're going to

4418
03:45:34,975 --> 03:45:41,119
Some former Soldier veterans on part of your property to take your son into the army and oh yeah I'll taxes are going up this year we need extra

4419
03:45:41,375 --> 03:45:43,423
Weed cuz the army star but I mean whatever it might be

4420
03:45:43,679 --> 03:45:44,959
The garlic people are

4421
03:45:45,471 --> 03:45:47,519
Chafing at what it's like to be Roman

4422
03:45:49,311 --> 03:45:53,151
But now I think we get to the Crux question that we started this talk out with

4423
03:45:53,407 --> 03:45:55,711
If you know what would you be willing to sacrifice everything

4424
03:45:56,479 --> 03:45:57,247
If you are

4425
03:45:57,503 --> 03:45:58,271
Chafing

4426
03:45:58,527 --> 03:46:02,111
Another word I just used to get chafing from Roman domination

4427
03:46:02,879 --> 03:46:07,487
At what point is the chafing bad enough for you to risk having the Romans come back

4428
03:46:08,255 --> 03:46:10,559
Beat you in some sort of field battle

4429
03:46:11,071 --> 03:46:12,095
Kill you

4430
03:46:12,351 --> 03:46:16,959
It would be sick before kill you kill your son's rape your wife send your daughters off to slavery Destroyer

4431
03:46:17,471 --> 03:46:19,519
At what point is chafing bad enough

4432
03:46:19,775 --> 03:46:22,847
And then you begin to get into this question of human motivation

4433
03:46:24,383 --> 03:46:25,919
What is it that's worth risking that

4434
03:46:26,175 --> 03:46:26,943
Kind of

4435
03:46:27,711 --> 03:46:28,991
Terrible outcome for

4436
03:46:31,551 --> 03:46:32,831
Caesar says it's liberty

4437
03:46:34,367 --> 03:46:36,671
And freedom and Independence and that's

4438
03:46:36,927 --> 03:46:37,439
Weird

4439
03:46:37,695 --> 03:46:39,999
Not because those are weird motivations

4440
03:46:40,511 --> 03:46:42,303
Topeka Caesars the guy

4441
03:46:42,815 --> 03:46:44,351
Who's going to stamp out these people

4442
03:46:45,887 --> 03:46:48,703
And once again he's giving them aspirations

4443
03:46:49,215 --> 03:46:54,591
That we can sort of relate to that make them sympathetic characters to us in the same way he's put

4444
03:46:55,359 --> 03:46:59,967
You're the voice of an almost war crimes prosecutor in the mouth of his German opponent

4445
03:47:00,223 --> 03:47:01,247
Ariovistus

4446
03:47:01,759 --> 03:47:02,783
He's going to put

4447
03:47:03,551 --> 03:47:09,695
In the words of people like Patrick Henry Give me liberty or give me death and all those kind of people into the mouths of these

4448
03:47:09,951 --> 03:47:10,975
Is Golic opponents

4449
03:47:11,487 --> 03:47:13,791
Who's Liberty he is smashing

4450
03:47:15,327 --> 03:47:18,911
It's fascinating and again it's very complicated I don't fully understand it

4451
03:47:19,167 --> 03:47:21,983
I enjoyed Andrew and Rigby's book as I said on the

4452
03:47:22,239 --> 03:47:23,519
On the whole analysis

4453
03:47:23,775 --> 03:47:29,151
But no consensus exist they just analyze the three-dimensional chess game Caesars playing

4454
03:47:30,687 --> 03:47:32,223
And of course the first question we all ask

4455
03:47:32,479 --> 03:47:32,991
Friday's

4456
03:47:33,247 --> 03:47:39,391
If Caesar says that these people are fighting for Liberty and freedom in when he puts words into their speeches and they talk about

4457
03:47:39,647 --> 03:47:42,719
Liberty and freedom what the heck do people Barbarian people

4458
03:47:43,231 --> 03:47:48,351
2000 years ago mean when they say that or Caesars putting those words into their mouth and their Caesars words

4459
03:47:48,863 --> 03:47:50,911
What does Cesar mean for it to me

4460
03:47:53,215 --> 03:47:57,055
According to Andrew Rigsby it's just what you think it means maybe only more so

4461
03:47:57,823 --> 03:48:01,919
He writes the word and then gives you the Latin word Caesar actually use he says quote

4462
03:48:03,455 --> 03:48:09,343
Freedom libertas wasn't even more politically charged term for the Roman senate is generally today

4463
03:48:09,599 --> 03:48:13,439
Prettiest deeply rooted in the pervasive social institution of slavery

4464
03:48:13,951 --> 03:48:20,095
Despite the many and varied situations to which it was applied libertas remained a powerful

4465
03:48:20,351 --> 03:48:23,935
Slogan because if it's unambiguously positive primary sense

4466
03:48:24,447 --> 03:48:25,215
Conversely

4467
03:48:25,471 --> 03:48:27,263
Slavery servatis

4468
03:48:27,519 --> 03:48:33,407
Recalled the degradation of slaves seen daily in a society which as we have already noted

4469
03:48:33,663 --> 03:48:35,711
Personal dignity was a fighting matter

4470
03:48:36,479 --> 03:48:36,991
And quote

4471
03:48:38,271 --> 03:48:39,039
In other words

4472
03:48:39,295 --> 03:48:41,343
You know Caesars basically giving

4473
03:48:41,599 --> 03:48:43,903
An excuse for these rebellions

4474
03:48:44,415 --> 03:48:45,183
To the Gauls

4475
03:48:45,695 --> 03:48:51,839
But he says right away right is it a question of Freedom versus slavery and pliant Romans understand that it would never settle.

4476
03:48:52,095 --> 03:48:52,607
To be slaves

4477
03:48:52,863 --> 03:48:58,239
And that we today look at and go will I can fully see with the Gulzar about because I'd be on their side to

4478
03:48:59,007 --> 03:49:05,151
It's a very interesting document and it says a lot about the tenor of the times in the audience he was writing for the he

4479
03:49:05,407 --> 03:49:07,455
He could position the whole story this way

4480
03:49:07,711 --> 03:49:13,855
And still expect you to cheer on his victories when he crushes these freedom-loving calls right to pets really

4481
03:49:14,111 --> 03:49:14,623
What they were

4482
03:49:16,927 --> 03:49:18,207
And just with every

4483
03:49:18,463 --> 03:49:19,999
Story of Revolution by the way

4484
03:49:20,255 --> 03:49:26,399
For every account you hear of the Gauls trying to preserve their own liberty and freedom in a very high-minded Patrick Henry send

4485
03:49:26,911 --> 03:49:29,215
You will read the accounts that get much more greedy

4486
03:49:29,471 --> 03:49:31,007
And describe much more

4487
03:49:31,263 --> 03:49:37,407
Base values to the people who are doing these things in this particular group run by this Aristocrat wants

4488
03:49:37,663 --> 03:49:43,551
More power within his try but Roman domination uniforms his Ambitions so he's wanting Revolution

4489
03:49:44,063 --> 03:49:50,207
When the southern tribe who used to collect all the tolls on this River before the Romans took over but now they favor the Rival tribe

4490
03:49:50,463 --> 03:49:53,535
And so you know receipts are down from the river tolls so we're going to rebell

4491
03:49:56,351 --> 03:49:57,887
The ones who are just playing

4492
03:49:58,143 --> 03:50:04,287
Fickle and tired of living under the same set of rules for a significant. Time seizure said that the Gauls all have

4493
03:50:04,543 --> 03:50:09,919
A bunch of men who just Delight in the change of government and they get bored easily and so they're easily roused to

4494
03:50:10,175 --> 03:50:13,759
Some sort of change just for change the sake of who knows what the actual reasons are

4495
03:50:14,015 --> 03:50:17,599
The bottom line though is Cesar barely gets to enjoy

4496
03:50:18,111 --> 03:50:19,135
The winter off

4497
03:50:19,391 --> 03:50:23,999
Before he's back in Gaul right recently pacified Gaul is exploded into problems

4498
03:50:24,255 --> 03:50:27,327
Three or four months after Caesar declares mission accomplished

4499
03:50:29,119 --> 03:50:32,191
There's a strain of historian to think this is all part of the plan

4500
03:50:32,703 --> 03:50:38,847
CJ doesn't want to give up his command remember he be vulnerable in wrong place there still places to conquer money to be

4501
03:50:39,103 --> 03:50:41,407
The major reasons to stay armies to keep

4502
03:50:41,663 --> 03:50:42,431
Assembled

4503
03:50:42,687 --> 03:50:43,711
And in your hands

4504
03:50:46,015 --> 03:50:47,295
But a pattern is going to emerge

4505
03:50:47,551 --> 03:50:51,135
Free for the next couple of years and it's a pattern actually that's not that dissimilar

4506
03:50:51,391 --> 03:50:52,671
From other Roman

4507
03:50:53,439 --> 03:50:56,255
Conquest of Celtic peoples in other parts of Europe

4508
03:50:56,511 --> 03:50:57,279
For this time

4509
03:50:57,791 --> 03:50:58,815
The pattern is

4510
03:50:59,327 --> 03:51:01,375
Charismatic leaders emerge

4511
03:51:01,887 --> 03:51:08,031
Who can manage to unite at least local groupings of tribes into larger confederacy's who then

4512
03:51:08,287 --> 03:51:10,591
Challenge the Romans by rebelling against them

4513
03:51:12,127 --> 03:51:13,919
And the Romans will respond

4514
03:51:14,431 --> 03:51:15,455
With extreme violence

4515
03:51:17,759 --> 03:51:21,343
It's actually very interesting case study for modern people in

4516
03:51:21,599 --> 03:51:24,159
If you're interested in military Affairs in guerrilla warfare

4517
03:51:24,415 --> 03:51:24,927
And I

4518
03:51:25,183 --> 03:51:30,303
Civil Wars and things like that to watch House Caesar approaches in the rooms during this. Approach

4519
03:51:30,815 --> 03:51:32,095
How you quell

4520
03:51:32,351 --> 03:51:33,119
Domestic

4521
03:51:33,631 --> 03:51:36,703
Resistance you know by a population because when I was growing up

4522
03:51:37,215 --> 03:51:41,823
In the wake of the Vietnam War there was so much talk about if you'd only fought the Vietnam War

4523
03:51:42,335 --> 03:51:43,359
You know with the gloves off

4524
03:51:43,871 --> 03:51:44,639
What's the phrase you

4525
03:51:45,663 --> 03:51:51,807
Take away these modern cultural innovations that tell you you know that you can't do this and you can't do that if you go in

4526
03:51:52,063 --> 03:51:56,159
When are you really your star ruthless and you'll change the battlefield scene overnight

4527
03:51:56,671 --> 03:51:58,463
The Romans are an example of that

4528
03:51:59,487 --> 03:52:02,303
In later Roman history they will be very good

4529
03:52:02,559 --> 03:52:07,935
You know what the game of the carrot and the stick and they'll learn how to bribe tribes when it's better to spend money than to be

4530
03:52:08,191 --> 03:52:09,471
Beat people over the head with a stick

4531
03:52:09,727 --> 03:52:13,823
In the Caesar. They're much more in the beat the other people over the head with a stick

4532
03:52:14,335 --> 03:52:14,847
Mode

4533
03:52:15,871 --> 03:52:16,895
And Caesar will go back

4534
03:52:17,407 --> 03:52:19,967
To Gall and spend the next several years

4535
03:52:20,479 --> 03:52:20,991
Truly

4536
03:52:21,247 --> 03:52:22,015
Pacifying

4537
03:52:24,319 --> 03:52:25,855
The methods that Caesar will use the

4538
03:52:26,367 --> 03:52:27,135
To quell this resistor

4539
03:52:28,927 --> 03:52:30,463
When the first people he'll deal with it.

4540
03:52:30,719 --> 03:52:35,071
The Confederacy of peoples on the Atlantic Seaboard in 56 BCE

4541
03:52:35,583 --> 03:52:40,703
He will defeat you have to build a fleet to do at the Romans are crazy good that way

4542
03:52:40,959 --> 03:52:42,751
Defeats the seafaring people

4543
03:52:44,031 --> 03:52:50,175
And because in Caesars mind all of this area is already been pacify we're now dealing with rebellions this isn't a contest

4544
03:52:50,431 --> 03:52:55,551
Best of You Know virtues on the battlefield May the best man win and you'll probably get clemency afterwards

4545
03:52:55,807 --> 03:52:58,623
This is you are rebelling against the authority of the state

4546
03:52:58,879 --> 03:53:03,743
You are setting a bad example for other people we need to keep down so we have to make an example of you

4547
03:53:04,511 --> 03:53:07,583
And I'm the main tribe called the Venice High or sometimes daniti

4548
03:53:08,095 --> 03:53:08,607
Caesar

4549
03:53:08,863 --> 03:53:11,167
Kill their entire leadership beheaded them

4550
03:53:11,679 --> 03:53:13,215
Sold the population into slavery

4551
03:53:15,263 --> 03:53:16,031
He will

4552
03:53:16,287 --> 03:53:19,871
Deal with an German incursion again

4553
03:53:22,175 --> 03:53:23,455
Or so he says

4554
03:53:23,967 --> 03:53:25,759
In 55 BCE

4555
03:53:26,271 --> 03:53:28,831
So he launched is what you might call a

4556
03:53:29,087 --> 03:53:30,111
4re

4557
03:53:30,623 --> 03:53:31,647
A raid

4558
03:53:31,903 --> 03:53:35,231
A punitive Expedition into Germany

4559
03:53:36,255 --> 03:53:38,815
Meanwhile manages to have another battle

4560
03:53:39,071 --> 03:53:40,095
Against the German tribe

4561
03:53:40,863 --> 03:53:42,143
This is the incident by the way they

4562
03:53:42,399 --> 03:53:44,447
Some of the Cato crowd back in Rome

4563
03:53:44,959 --> 03:53:46,239
Suggested to Caesar maybe should be

4564
03:53:46,495 --> 03:53:47,519
Be handed over

4565
03:53:47,775 --> 03:53:49,567
German enemies in Chains

4566
03:53:50,335 --> 03:53:52,895
Because what he did and he admitted freely in

4567
03:53:53,151 --> 03:53:54,175
Is commentaries

4568
03:53:54,687 --> 03:53:55,455
Is this

4569
03:53:55,711 --> 03:53:56,223
Leadership

4570
03:53:56,479 --> 03:53:57,503
This German tribe

4571
03:53:58,015 --> 03:53:59,807
Sounds like a large number of people

4572
03:54:00,063 --> 03:54:04,927
Showed up to Caesar maybe to negotiate what they thought was a surrender

4573
03:54:05,183 --> 03:54:07,231
And instead Caesar grab them

4574
03:54:07,487 --> 03:54:12,351
And holds them and sends his army out to attack the now leaderless and unexpected ending

4575
03:54:12,607 --> 03:54:13,631
German tribe

4576
03:54:15,167 --> 03:54:21,311
And the numbers that died here are crazy unbelievable in crazy I mean

4577
03:54:21,567 --> 03:54:22,847
Wait for it

4578
03:54:23,615 --> 03:54:25,663
400000 German people died

4579
03:54:27,455 --> 03:54:30,783
And Caesar himself in the writing talks about a moment

4580
03:54:31,295 --> 03:54:32,319
In the fighting

4581
03:54:32,575 --> 03:54:35,647
Where there's just crowds of women and children

4582
03:54:35,903 --> 03:54:37,183
And what does he do

4583
03:54:37,695 --> 03:54:42,303
He sends his Cavalry to and this is a quote from the

4584
03:54:43,583 --> 03:54:45,375
Hammond translation

4585
03:54:45,631 --> 03:54:47,167
Hunt them down

4586
03:54:48,959 --> 03:54:51,263
So perhaps we're moving from

4587
03:54:52,543 --> 03:54:58,431
One potential un war crimes tribunal set of charges when we're talkin about

4588
03:54:58,687 --> 03:55:00,735
Free and understood Warfare

4589
03:55:01,759 --> 03:55:03,039
And a contest of arms

4590
03:55:04,063 --> 03:55:04,831
And something like this

4591
03:55:06,623 --> 03:55:09,951
The most amazing things easier does we have to point out the wild Factory don't we

4592
03:55:10,207 --> 03:55:15,583
Is that he will build a bridge over the Rhine River right no small river that

4593
03:55:16,607 --> 03:55:19,423
He will do it in 10 days and I mean it involves

4594
03:55:19,679 --> 03:55:21,471
Cranes and pylons

4595
03:55:21,727 --> 03:55:24,287
And Rams to put pillars into the

4596
03:55:25,055 --> 03:55:26,079
River Bandits

4597
03:55:26,591 --> 03:55:27,871
Incredibly

4598
03:55:28,127 --> 03:55:32,223
Tribes common submit to him simply because they've seen him build this

4599
03:55:33,503 --> 03:55:38,879
He said he had to build it because both did not seem like a good way to cross the river and he wasn't sure it was

4600
03:55:39,135 --> 03:55:41,439
In keeping with Roman dignity he said

4601
03:55:41,695 --> 03:55:44,767
So you spend 10 days and you build a Trestle Bridge

4602
03:55:45,791 --> 03:55:51,935
The Romans cross the bridge burn lots of villages in a killed quite a bit of people in these raids took 18 days comes back

4603
03:55:52,191 --> 03:55:56,031
Back over the Rhine on the bridge they built and then they destroy the bridge

4604
03:55:59,615 --> 03:56:02,175
It's generally assumed that Caesar was trying to send a message

4605
03:56:02,431 --> 03:56:04,735
The message is at least one is clear

4606
03:56:04,991 --> 03:56:05,503
And that's that

4607
03:56:05,759 --> 03:56:09,855
We can come over this River anytime we wanted snowberry rittal don't pretend like you're say

4608
03:56:11,135 --> 03:56:13,951
The other one was just with some historians have also said

4609
03:56:14,207 --> 03:56:15,999
Is it was also Cesar's way of saying

4610
03:56:16,255 --> 03:56:18,047
And by the way this is the Border

4611
03:56:18,559 --> 03:56:22,655
You come over here expect a response not from these garlic peoples

4612
03:56:22,911 --> 03:56:25,471
Home you come to expect you can beat in battle

4613
03:56:25,727 --> 03:56:26,751
But against us

4614
03:56:27,519 --> 03:56:29,567
Did you just lost yet another battle to

4615
03:56:30,847 --> 03:56:35,199
How many dead 400000 Caesar said they were 430,000 people there

4616
03:56:35,711 --> 03:56:38,015
He talks about great numbers of them die

4617
03:56:39,295 --> 03:56:45,439
Even Michael Grant says the numbers may be exaggerated but maybe not that much what do you do with Caesars

4618
03:56:45,695 --> 03:56:48,255
Death Ledger there it just went up by a lot didn't

4619
03:56:48,767 --> 03:56:52,095
And if you believe Cato and that segment of the Romans

4620
03:56:52,351 --> 03:56:54,399
It wasn't something that had to happen

4621
03:56:55,423 --> 03:56:56,447
Caesar prompted at

4622
03:56:57,215 --> 03:56:58,239
Maybe wanted it

4623
03:57:00,543 --> 03:57:01,055
After this

4624
03:57:01,311 --> 03:57:07,455
Defeat of the Germans late in the campaign season right as you're probably pack it in after that big German thing no heat

4625
03:57:07,711 --> 03:57:08,479
It takes a fleet

4626
03:57:08,735 --> 03:57:09,503
And Crosses

4627
03:57:09,759 --> 03:57:14,623
The English Channel goes where no Mediterranean Army has ever gone before

4628
03:57:14,879 --> 03:57:16,671
The foggy Misty

4629
03:57:17,183 --> 03:57:20,511
Almost legendary in Mediterranean circles island of Britain

4630
03:57:22,303 --> 03:57:23,327
Lands there

4631
03:57:23,583 --> 03:57:29,727
Talks about the natives being in chariots and painting themselves blue and Caesar has a battle and of course it's no near run

4632
03:57:30,495 --> 03:57:31,263
All kinds of problems

4633
03:57:31,519 --> 03:57:32,031
Corsi wins

4634
03:57:32,543 --> 03:57:35,103
Are the fleet almost gets destroyed by a storm

4635
03:57:35,359 --> 03:57:39,967
There are howls of protests about his contemporary political opponents

4636
03:57:40,223 --> 03:57:43,295
And let's be honest armchair generals ever since going

4637
03:57:43,807 --> 03:57:44,831
What the heck are you doing

4638
03:57:45,343 --> 03:57:47,903
What does this have to do with anything how do you justify this

4639
03:57:48,159 --> 03:57:50,975
And yet the publicity is outrageously good

4640
03:57:52,511 --> 03:57:53,279
Earlier we said he's

4641
03:57:53,791 --> 03:57:54,559
Leading the SEC

4642
03:57:54,815 --> 03:57:57,119
Expedition like a heavily-armed Lewis and

4643
03:57:57,375 --> 03:57:58,911
Clark exploration team

4644
03:57:59,423 --> 03:58:00,191
LG Egypt

4645
03:58:00,959 --> 03:58:04,543
Landed in Britain and the people back home can't stop talking about it

4646
03:58:05,055 --> 03:58:09,919
All those people that keep talking about him exceeding his wartime Authority and what have you

4647
03:58:10,175 --> 03:58:12,223
You know I'm can hardly make themselves heard

4648
03:58:12,991 --> 03:58:14,015
Above all of them

4649
03:58:15,551 --> 03:58:16,575
The positive comments

4650
03:58:17,855 --> 03:58:19,647
By the way little side note here

4651
03:58:20,159 --> 03:58:24,255
The debate is ongoing whether or not these people in the British Isles

4652
03:58:24,511 --> 03:58:26,815
During this period should be classified as

4653
03:58:27,071 --> 03:58:27,583
Celtic

4654
03:58:27,839 --> 03:58:28,351
Or not

4655
03:58:29,119 --> 03:58:31,423
And again we're not talking in terms of ethnicity is much a

4656
03:58:31,679 --> 03:58:32,447
Culture

4657
03:58:32,959 --> 03:58:35,007
It's a little confusing cuz Caesar says

4658
03:58:35,263 --> 03:58:39,103
One of these tribes that lived on the now French side of the English Channel

4659
03:58:39,359 --> 03:58:40,895
Did some migrating over

4660
03:58:41,151 --> 03:58:44,991
So when Caesar goes to Britain and describes people that sure sound Celtic

4661
03:58:45,247 --> 03:58:49,343
They sound a lot like the people we've been talking about in terms of their dress and their Styles in there

4662
03:58:49,599 --> 03:58:51,647
Attitudes in the religion War.

4663
03:58:52,415 --> 03:58:58,559
You don't know whether or not he's running into that one tribe or whether or not the people all through the rest of it I need the

4664
03:58:58,815 --> 03:59:00,607
Y'all have Celtic names I mean again

4665
03:59:01,119 --> 03:59:03,679
I'm not qualified the way into this ongoing debate

4666
03:59:03,935 --> 03:59:07,263
Apparently Caesar doesn't refer to them specifically as Celts

4667
03:59:07,519 --> 03:59:13,663
In the ancient world that used a different name for them and I'm going to use my very kind of get out of jail free card and say that a Celtic

4668
03:59:13,919 --> 03:59:16,735
Is anyone who consider themselves to be Celtic I don't know

4669
03:59:18,015 --> 03:59:20,319
The Caesars obviously created a problem

4670
03:59:20,575 --> 03:59:23,391
Not a hard one to imagine happening either when he takes a

4671
03:59:23,647 --> 03:59:25,183
Big chunk of his army

4672
03:59:25,439 --> 03:59:31,583
From which now modern-day France and takes it over New Britain because that means it's no longer in what's now modern-day France

4673
03:59:34,143 --> 03:59:35,423
You can already feel

4674
03:59:35,679 --> 03:59:41,311
Your 2,000 plus years later some of the Rumblings going on right of seizures not actively here

4675
03:59:41,823 --> 03:59:44,127
You know The Cauldron starts bubbling again

4676
03:59:44,639 --> 03:59:46,687
The next year 54 BC

4677
03:59:46,943 --> 03:59:49,503
Caesar launches a much better prepared

4678
03:59:49,759 --> 03:59:51,039
And significant

4679
03:59:51,551 --> 03:59:56,415
Raid was what the earlier expedition to Britain probably was this is more like

4680
03:59:56,927 --> 03:59:59,999
NAA reconnaissance in force reminder invasion

4681
04:00:00,255 --> 04:00:02,815
Elaine's their defeats a major British tribe

4682
04:00:03,327 --> 04:00:07,167
And here's sort of army if you're following Caesar story and Caesars narrative

4683
04:00:07,423 --> 04:00:09,727
Throughout the entire narrative we said there's been this V

4684
04:00:09,983 --> 04:00:10,495
Column

4685
04:00:10,751 --> 04:00:12,543
Entity in Gaul itself

4686
04:00:13,567 --> 04:00:15,103
People who are in these tribes

4687
04:00:15,359 --> 04:00:19,711
Certainly in the last friendly tribes but even in Rome's greatest allies you don't like the Roman

4688
04:00:22,015 --> 04:00:23,039
Consul Caesar

4689
04:00:23,295 --> 04:00:26,623
When he's going to go back to Britain for the second time realizes

4690
04:00:26,879 --> 04:00:32,255
But you know he's leaving all these troublemakers back in Gaul so in a very ancient typical Roman thing

4691
04:00:32,511 --> 04:00:38,655
He asks for them to come to an honored guest and probably be the way the invitation said but hostages the way

4692
04:00:39,167 --> 04:00:43,263
Any you would call it today hostages for good behavior we're going to take the troublemakers with us

4693
04:00:45,055 --> 04:00:47,359
There's a whole bunch of famous troublemakers in

4694
04:00:47,871 --> 04:00:49,663
Roman Celtic history

4695
04:00:49,919 --> 04:00:52,991
These people that are like the geronimo's of Celtic

4696
04:00:53,247 --> 04:00:55,551
Resistance and in this case one of them

4697
04:00:55,807 --> 04:00:57,855
Not that I expect everyone to remember

4698
04:00:58,111 --> 04:01:04,255
You know that magician Gandalf Dumbledore religious leader Druid guy we talked about earlier he was

4699
04:01:04,511 --> 04:01:07,583
The reason this whole thing happened though if you believe the official narrative

4700
04:01:07,839 --> 04:01:08,607
Duplication

4701
04:01:09,887 --> 04:01:10,911
By the way you will also c-diff

4702
04:01:11,167 --> 04:01:11,679
Wahkiacus

4703
04:01:12,447 --> 04:01:13,471
And give a Chaka

4704
04:01:14,239 --> 04:01:14,751
We're going to go with you

4705
04:01:16,543 --> 04:01:17,823
Vacations DeSoto

4706
04:01:18,079 --> 04:01:19,103
A Roman friend

4707
04:01:19,615 --> 04:01:22,687
What he's got a brother thinking like two heads of the same coin

4708
04:01:22,943 --> 04:01:27,295
And his brother in this tribe what are Rome's greatest friends in the region

4709
04:01:27,551 --> 04:01:28,575
Is anti Roman

4710
04:01:29,343 --> 04:01:34,975
And his Druid Brothers been covering for him all this time and Caesar says he's been nice about the whole thing because he

4711
04:01:35,231 --> 04:01:39,583
Appreciate this Druid guy and likes him and needs his supporting his tribe is very important

4712
04:01:40,095 --> 04:01:41,631
But this is one of the guys

4713
04:01:42,143 --> 04:01:43,423
His name is Jim norick

4714
04:01:43,679 --> 04:01:48,799
One of the guys Caesar wants to take with him to the British Isles so that he's not causing trouble when Caesar the way

4715
04:01:49,567 --> 04:01:52,127
And this do Norwich character decides that this

4716
04:01:52,383 --> 04:01:52,895
At least

4717
04:01:53,151 --> 04:01:56,735
Caesar Caesar says do nor extinct Caesars going to

4718
04:01:56,991 --> 04:02:01,343
Take heed and all the other troublemakers across the English Channel

4719
04:02:01,599 --> 04:02:02,879
And kill them there

4720
04:02:03,903 --> 04:02:06,463
Away from the prying eyes of his own people

4721
04:02:06,719 --> 04:02:10,815
Able to come back and make up any old excuse why they're not with him anymore

4722
04:02:11,583 --> 04:02:13,887
And if you Norrix doesn't believe this himself

4723
04:02:14,143 --> 04:02:15,935
Cesar said he's going to all these other

4724
04:02:16,191 --> 04:02:20,543
Are tribal leaders and saying you don't go it's easier to to Britney's going to kill us there

4725
04:02:22,079 --> 04:02:28,223
Cesar then talks about you too many excuses that this do norick making of the sort that you know I get seasick and I can't go with

4726
04:02:28,479 --> 04:02:32,063
With you for all these other reasons Caesars has finally when you know Caesar Corners in

4727
04:02:32,575 --> 04:02:33,599
The guy bolts

4728
04:02:34,623 --> 04:02:40,767
Basically showing his true colors Caesar would basically have you understand he's just uncovered and unmask this conspiracy he sends

4729
04:02:41,023 --> 04:02:43,839
Just meant to go bring this guy back Dead or Alive they bringing back dead

4730
04:02:45,887 --> 04:02:50,239
And this guy becomes just one of many troublemakers that Caesar begins

4731
04:02:50,751 --> 04:02:56,895
To go after now is his way of shutting down this garlic resistant I get rid of the the leaders of the

4732
04:02:57,151 --> 04:02:57,663
The resistance

4733
04:02:59,199 --> 04:03:05,343
Because you're some of these tribes have large numbers of people that are of a different political opinion than what them

4734
04:03:05,599 --> 04:03:08,671
George eventually get them in one of these battles that Caesars facing

4735
04:03:08,927 --> 04:03:11,999
He'll face a tribe that has reportedly killed

4736
04:03:12,511 --> 04:03:18,655
All their Senators who disagreed with the idea of rebellion so when we were saying what are you willing to die for

4737
04:03:18,911 --> 04:03:20,703
What are you willing to lose everything for

4738
04:03:20,959 --> 04:03:23,775
There might be disagreement in your community about

4739
04:03:24,031 --> 04:03:24,543
That

4740
04:03:25,311 --> 04:03:29,919
Caesars is one of these tribes killed all the Senators that had a no vote on Rebellion

4741
04:03:30,175 --> 04:03:33,503
And went unified to go meet their fate against the Romans

4742
04:03:36,319 --> 04:03:37,855
The Troublemaker that Caesar head

4743
04:03:38,111 --> 04:03:42,207
Instructed be brought back to him dead or alive that do Norrix guy

4744
04:03:42,463 --> 04:03:48,351
He represents an example of a counter faction in opposition party if you will in his own tribe

4745
04:03:49,631 --> 04:03:51,167
He must have been karizmatik

4746
04:03:51,679 --> 04:03:53,983
He must have been dangerous in the romanized

4747
04:03:54,751 --> 04:03:57,055
And he just becomes the latest victim

4748
04:03:57,311 --> 04:04:02,431
In the Roman standard policy of how you deal with these troublemakers everywhere you encounter them

4749
04:04:04,735 --> 04:04:06,015
It's a sort of if you will

4750
04:04:06,271 --> 04:04:09,343
A very mafia-like approach to the situation but

4751
04:04:09,855 --> 04:04:10,623
Hard to argue

4752
04:04:11,135 --> 04:04:12,159
About its efficacy

4753
04:04:12,927 --> 04:04:13,951
When faced with

4754
04:04:14,719 --> 04:04:15,743
Karizmatik

4755
04:04:15,999 --> 04:04:16,511
Tribal

4756
04:04:16,767 --> 04:04:19,583
Guerrilla leaders if you will kill them when you can

4757
04:04:20,863 --> 04:04:23,423
The Romans have done this many times either directly or indirectly

4758
04:04:25,215 --> 04:04:26,751
I believe earlier we mentioned one of the

4759
04:04:27,263 --> 04:04:28,031
National

4760
04:04:28,799 --> 04:04:29,567
Heroes of

4761
04:04:30,591 --> 04:04:34,943
People of Portugal now when they were in their ancient version and he's one of these people that

4762
04:04:35,199 --> 04:04:39,807
You let a position to roam and they managed to get him assassinated I Believe by his own people

4763
04:04:40,063 --> 04:04:41,343
I believe there was a bribe

4764
04:04:41,599 --> 04:04:42,623
Paid assassination

4765
04:04:44,415 --> 04:04:45,183
In another case

4766
04:04:45,695 --> 04:04:49,023
The Romans ran into one of these leaders and this isn't this conflict

4767
04:04:49,535 --> 04:04:52,095
That was karizmatik that they wanted to get and

4768
04:04:52,607 --> 04:04:54,399
During a Cavalry battle

4769
04:04:54,911 --> 04:04:57,727
The Roman this is from Caesar by the way the Roman leader

4770
04:04:57,983 --> 04:05:04,127
On this site had instructed his Cavalry remember this is at least hundreds of men against hundreds of men and maybe thousands

4771
04:05:04,383 --> 04:05:05,407
Husband against thousands of men

4772
04:05:05,663 --> 04:05:08,735
It when you go out there on the field for this large Cavalry battle

4773
04:05:08,991 --> 04:05:10,783
Don't pay any attention to any of the other

4774
04:05:11,039 --> 04:05:11,551
People

4775
04:05:12,063 --> 04:05:14,367
In front of you go right after that one guy

4776
04:05:15,391 --> 04:05:17,695
And all I could think about was imagine being

4777
04:05:17,951 --> 04:05:24,095
You're that guy you're on the field with your hundreds and hundreds of cohorts thinking we're going to take on their big formation and everyone in their fur

4778
04:05:24,351 --> 04:05:26,655
Formation is after you personally

4779
04:05:27,935 --> 04:05:28,703
Needless to say

4780
04:05:29,471 --> 04:05:31,007
They brought his head back

4781
04:05:31,775 --> 04:05:32,543
Can you run command

4782
04:05:33,567 --> 04:05:34,335
Mission accomplished

4783
04:05:34,591 --> 04:05:35,103
They are

4784
04:05:35,615 --> 04:05:38,687
And another influential maybe Irreplaceable

4785
04:05:38,943 --> 04:05:42,015
Leader of the Celtic opposition is no more

4786
04:05:44,575 --> 04:05:46,879
Right out of the Roman Playboy

4787
04:05:50,207 --> 04:05:52,255
I didn't 54 BCE

4788
04:05:52,767 --> 04:05:54,559
You get one of the pretty good troublemaker

4789
04:05:54,815 --> 04:05:57,375
Baker's right at these are all spark this is a pretty good spot

4790
04:05:58,143 --> 04:06:01,983
His name is ambiorix he was one of several important people in a revolt

4791
04:06:02,239 --> 04:06:05,311
He's a national hero of Belgium now

4792
04:06:05,823 --> 04:06:07,615
Any Fitness template abate

4793
04:06:08,127 --> 04:06:12,991
Have a karizmatik Celtic figure who could unite a bunch of tribes together to oppose the Romans

4794
04:06:14,783 --> 04:06:15,807
He's a particular Lisa

4795
04:06:16,063 --> 04:06:20,927
Successful one of these rebels in the he manages by hooker by crook to kill a bunch of Romans

4796
04:06:21,183 --> 04:06:25,023
I get like 15 cohorts like a legion and five cohorts something like that

4797
04:06:25,279 --> 04:06:29,119
He gets out there and convinces them to leave the safety of their fort

4798
04:06:29,375 --> 04:06:30,911
And then ambushes them

4799
04:06:31,167 --> 04:06:33,983
When they're marching through some deep dark woods No Doubt

4800
04:06:35,007 --> 04:06:39,871
And the Romans would be in trouble all the time during the winter when they would break up to the various areas they had

4801
04:06:40,127 --> 04:06:41,151
Patrolling KeepSafe

4802
04:06:41,407 --> 04:06:43,711
Annie's 4th and it becomes like Fort Apache

4803
04:06:44,223 --> 04:06:46,015
And any time of rebellion happens you know these

4804
04:06:46,271 --> 04:06:52,159
This isolated Legion or two of Romans will find themselves deep in Indian Country surrounded by Angry native

4805
04:06:52,415 --> 04:06:53,439
Time and again

4806
04:06:53,695 --> 04:06:55,231
This becomes part of the narrative

4807
04:06:56,255 --> 04:07:02,399
When Caesar will go back and Rescue all these people or avenge them a lot more of the garlic folks.

4808
04:07:03,935 --> 04:07:05,727
Can you again have to ask yourself

4809
04:07:06,239 --> 04:07:11,615
You know what's going on here and what do you form in terms of an opinion of

4810
04:07:11,871 --> 04:07:14,175
Whether or not it is a good idea

4811
04:07:14,943 --> 04:07:18,015
If you are a follower of ambiorix for example

4812
04:07:18,783 --> 04:07:22,623
To rebell against the Romans because on one hand how could anybody

4813
04:07:23,391 --> 04:07:29,279
So you didn't have a good enough cause when you're talking about your freedom and your Independence right your Liberty your political Liberty

4814
04:07:29,791 --> 04:07:31,839
The sovereignty of your own people whatever it is

4815
04:07:32,351 --> 04:07:33,631
Those are pretty high-minded

4816
04:07:33,887 --> 04:07:34,399
Causes

4817
04:07:34,655 --> 04:07:40,543
But if you're in the meeting amongst your peers and your countrymen and you're having this discussion of do we reveal or don't we

4818
04:07:41,823 --> 04:07:44,127
I mean are you a coward if you stand up and say listen

4819
04:07:44,895 --> 04:07:45,407
We have

4820
04:07:45,663 --> 04:07:47,199
Very little chance

4821
04:07:47,455 --> 04:07:48,735
Sub actually succeeding here

4822
04:07:49,503 --> 04:07:54,367
And if we fail there's a hundred percent chance we're going to lose everything that matters to us

4823
04:07:54,879 --> 04:07:58,719
Including the Liberty that you're worried about now maybe we shouldn't do this

4824
04:08:00,511 --> 04:08:01,791
Those are the kind of choices

4825
04:08:02,047 --> 04:08:03,071
This is the old saying goes

4826
04:08:03,327 --> 04:08:05,119
The try men's Souls right

4827
04:08:06,655 --> 04:08:11,007
I just to get an example of what it might mean in practice take a look at what happened to this ambiorix

4828
04:08:12,031 --> 04:08:13,055
Write this latest Spark

4829
04:08:14,591 --> 04:08:15,871
The guy who when he destroyed the

4830
04:08:16,127 --> 04:08:17,151
Roman Legions in the D

4831
04:08:17,407 --> 04:08:18,687
Deep dark woods on the March

4832
04:08:19,455 --> 04:08:21,503
Daniel Caesar made it out to be like a

4833
04:08:22,015 --> 04:08:28,159
Custer's Last Stand situation with the officers in the men who were left over commit suicide because they're just there

4834
04:08:28,415 --> 04:08:30,207
Trapped by the natives around it I mean it

4835
04:08:30,719 --> 04:08:33,279
It's a harrowing terrible story and Caesar lunches

4836
04:08:33,791 --> 04:08:36,607
Recriminations at certain commanders I mean

4837
04:08:36,863 --> 04:08:37,375
It's a

4838
04:08:37,887 --> 04:08:39,935
Staying and so the bad guy

4839
04:08:40,191 --> 04:08:46,335
Well probably hero in the Gully guys with the bad guy the Roman story have your ex is going to be pursued as if to the end

4840
04:08:46,591 --> 04:08:47,103
End of the Earth

4841
04:08:47,359 --> 04:08:49,151
And Caesar has this ongoing

4842
04:08:49,407 --> 04:08:54,271
You know what temp to track him down he finally hasn't getting away and riding off into the sunset with like only for

4843
04:08:54,527 --> 04:08:57,855
Bodyguardz is the only amount of people he would trust his life to

4844
04:08:59,391 --> 04:09:05,023
Of course it's a good end of the movie it mean that the Geronimo figure here from the Roman point-of-view gets away

4845
04:09:05,791 --> 04:09:08,863
Lives to ride another day off into the sunset whatever

4846
04:09:09,887 --> 04:09:12,191
But unfortunately it's whole tribe can't do that

4847
04:09:12,959 --> 04:09:14,495
And Caesar will

4848
04:09:15,519 --> 04:09:16,799
Wipe them out of existence

4849
04:09:18,847 --> 04:09:23,455
Well that's the way he frames It Anyway historians are not sure if that was really what happened

4850
04:09:23,711 --> 04:09:29,855
It's pretty fair to say though that Caesar treats this tribe to tribe the damn your ex was a leading figure in

4851
04:09:30,623 --> 04:09:34,207
As harshly or more harshly than any other entity

4852
04:09:34,719 --> 04:09:36,255
Cesar punished in his career

4853
04:09:40,095 --> 04:09:43,167
And so you might think to yourself okay now that these people have seen

4854
04:09:43,935 --> 04:09:45,215
What almost everything is

4855
04:09:45,471 --> 04:09:47,775
Is the Romans after this. We'll start going after

4856
04:09:48,287 --> 04:09:50,847
Celtic cultural things that they think are

4857
04:09:51,359 --> 04:09:52,639
Inciting revolt

4858
04:09:52,895 --> 04:09:55,967
Or bringing tribes together we mentioned Druids earlier

4859
04:09:56,223 --> 04:09:57,247
There's a pan

4860
04:09:57,759 --> 04:10:02,367
Tribal nature to these Druids maybe where they come together from multiple tribes

4861
04:10:02,623 --> 04:10:04,415
In meetings to debate things and it

4862
04:10:04,671 --> 04:10:09,791
At certain points after this. The Romans will think that the Druids are sold of a hotbed of resistance

4863
04:10:10,303 --> 04:10:16,191
And Target then the Romans could be very accommodating to your local Traditions as long as you didn't mess with them

4864
04:10:16,703 --> 04:10:22,335
If you cause trouble and they decided that these local Traditions had something to do with it goodbye local traditions

4865
04:10:23,103 --> 04:10:23,871
So this is where

4866
04:10:24,127 --> 04:10:26,687
Some who will say that maybe we're not talking about

4867
04:10:27,199 --> 04:10:32,319
An actual genocide here as much as we're talking about a cultural genocide may have a point there

4868
04:10:33,855 --> 04:10:34,623
As we said before

4869
04:10:34,879 --> 04:10:37,439
Genocide question is somewhat

4870
04:10:37,951 --> 04:10:38,975
Clouded by the fact

4871
04:10:39,487 --> 04:10:42,303
That the people in this story have a choice

4872
04:10:42,815 --> 04:10:45,119
Unlike those involved in the Second World War

4873
04:10:45,631 --> 04:10:48,703
Write the choices submit and stay quiet or die

4874
04:10:50,495 --> 04:10:52,543
How does having a choice like that

4875
04:10:53,055 --> 04:10:57,919
Make this sort of a holocaust if indeed that's the proper term for the Celtic Holocaust

4876
04:10:58,175 --> 04:11:00,223
How does having a choice make it different

4877
04:11:00,735 --> 04:11:01,759
Cuz it obviously does

4878
04:11:02,271 --> 04:11:05,855
From something like what the victims of the second world war Holocaust went through

4879
04:11:07,647 --> 04:11:10,207
I would also be remiss if I didn't at least point out

4880
04:11:10,975 --> 04:11:14,303
But this idea of choice may have been in illusion

4881
04:11:14,559 --> 04:11:15,071
For most of the

4882
04:11:16,095 --> 04:11:16,607
Story

4883
04:11:16,863 --> 04:11:19,935
Caesar himself sad and I don't know how well we can believe him

4884
04:11:20,191 --> 04:11:22,495
That they were really only three class

4885
04:11:23,007 --> 04:11:24,799
Do use a modern term in the garlic

4886
04:11:25,055 --> 04:11:25,823
Society

4887
04:11:26,079 --> 04:11:27,359
You had the knights

4888
04:11:27,871 --> 04:11:31,199
You're basically the aristocracy in the nobility you had The Druids

4889
04:11:31,455 --> 04:11:34,527
And then you had everyone else he said everyone else is basically a Slave

4890
04:11:36,063 --> 04:11:38,111
This is probably Roman hyperbole in

4891
04:11:38,623 --> 04:11:41,695
And misinformation what not archaeologists like Barry cunliffe

4892
04:11:42,719 --> 04:11:45,535
And John Collins will point out that there's a lot more

4893
04:11:45,791 --> 04:11:48,863
Nuance to something like that than Caesar points out but

4894
04:11:49,119 --> 04:11:52,447
His point might be well taken how many people if you give the

4895
04:11:52,703 --> 04:11:53,471
Choice of

4896
04:11:53,983 --> 04:12:00,127
You know if you just acquiesce to Roman conquest and submit everything will be fine but if you don't you're all going to die

4897
04:12:00,383 --> 04:12:03,455
You sold into slavery how many people get to make that choice in that

4898
04:12:03,711 --> 04:12:06,015
Garlic Society on that decision

4899
04:12:06,527 --> 04:12:09,599
I would submit that it's probably likely and Common Sense

4900
04:12:10,367 --> 04:12:14,719
The most of the people in this situation or simply caught up in the gears of History

4901
04:12:15,231 --> 04:12:16,767
Like most people in any other piece

4902
04:12:17,023 --> 04:12:17,535
.

4903
04:12:19,583 --> 04:12:23,167
Sometimes it seems like we're all just along for the historical ride

4904
04:12:23,423 --> 04:12:23,935
Does net

4905
04:12:25,727 --> 04:12:27,519
In this case Caesar will spend

4906
04:12:28,031 --> 04:12:29,823
The entire campaign season 2

4907
04:12:30,079 --> 04:12:32,127
53 BCE essentially

4908
04:12:32,639 --> 04:12:33,151
Punishing

4909
04:12:34,175 --> 04:12:34,943
Punitive

4910
04:12:35,199 --> 04:12:36,479
Traditions finishing off

4911
04:12:37,247 --> 04:12:37,759
Battles

4912
04:12:38,271 --> 04:12:40,575
Small Things is Adrian goldsworthy says he

4913
04:12:40,831 --> 04:12:45,183
He campaigns the entire campaign season in Gaul but he doesn't fight a major battle what's he doing

4914
04:12:45,439 --> 04:12:46,463
Pacifying

4915
04:12:47,743 --> 04:12:48,767
And it's ugly

4916
04:12:49,279 --> 04:12:50,815
Brutal business on the ground

4917
04:12:51,583 --> 04:12:55,167
And we don't have details but goldsworthy has an interesting line where he says

4918
04:12:55,935 --> 04:12:58,751
That the archaeological record has shown

4919
04:12:59,263 --> 04:13:02,591
That the quantities of gold and other precious materials found

4920
04:13:02,847 --> 04:13:07,199
Insights in this area after Caesar's time in Gaul plummet

4921
04:13:08,479 --> 04:13:08,991
Jesus quote

4922
04:13:10,271 --> 04:13:15,903
Overall the archaeological record shows a market decline in the quality and quantity of material culture

4923
04:13:16,159 --> 04:13:19,743
And suggest that the region did not recover for at least a generation

4924
04:13:20,511 --> 04:13:21,023
And quote

4925
04:13:22,559 --> 04:13:23,071
So

4926
04:13:23,327 --> 04:13:23,839
Swelling

4927
04:13:24,351 --> 04:13:24,863
The

4928
04:13:25,119 --> 04:13:28,191
Spirit of the population to resist that's an age-old counter surge

4929
04:13:28,447 --> 04:13:29,215
Urgency strategy

4930
04:13:30,751 --> 04:13:36,895
Don't just go out to the rank-and-file though the people you go after their leadership as we said and seas are determined that this one

4931
04:13:38,431 --> 04:13:42,271
It seems highly respected figure it's hard to draw any other conclusion considering what his

4932
04:13:42,783 --> 04:13:44,063
Demise

4933
04:13:44,319 --> 04:13:49,439
Created in terms of resentment procedure determines that this garlic leader name Echo or Echo

4934
04:13:49,695 --> 04:13:53,535
Is in part responsible or was somehow involved in this resistance Maybe

4935
04:13:54,559 --> 04:13:55,071
Secretly

4936
04:13:55,327 --> 04:13:58,143
Supplying them with something where have you and Caesar decides he must die

4937
04:13:59,679 --> 04:14:01,215
So he has him flogged

4938
04:14:01,471 --> 04:14:01,983
To death

4939
04:14:03,007 --> 04:14:06,591
Which two deaths of the bolt of a bullwhip run electrical cord

4940
04:14:06,847 --> 04:14:08,639
Hitting you until you die

4941
04:14:09,663 --> 04:14:11,455
Caesar had his head cut off which is an extra

4942
04:14:11,711 --> 04:14:12,735
Twist of the knife given the

4943
04:14:13,503 --> 04:14:16,063
Religious reverence the garlic people in the Celtic people

4944
04:14:16,319 --> 04:14:17,087
Half of the head

4945
04:14:19,135 --> 04:14:19,903
And then

4946
04:14:20,671 --> 04:14:21,439
Caesar gets

4947
04:14:21,695 --> 04:14:22,719
Swept-back

4948
04:14:22,975 --> 04:14:25,535
Into the Maelstrom of Roman Palace

4949
04:14:26,047 --> 04:14:27,071
Because all of a sudden

4950
04:14:27,327 --> 04:14:32,703
You know if it's a Roman ship of state has been foundering for a long time and taking on water

4951
04:14:32,959 --> 04:14:35,263
All of a sudden this year the ship just

4952
04:14:36,031 --> 04:14:42,175
Go straight down in the bow to the stern of it sticks straight up in the air and all of a

4953
04:14:42,431 --> 04:14:43,199
It's teetering

4954
04:14:43,455 --> 04:14:49,087
And Caesar course because this entire life of his revolves around Roman politics and how he doing it

4955
04:14:49,343 --> 04:14:54,207
Gets drawn back into the situation there's Riot there's killings the Senate houses burn down

4956
04:14:54,975 --> 04:14:57,023
And the garlic healthy people

4957
04:14:57,279 --> 04:14:58,047
Hear of this

4958
04:14:59,839 --> 04:15:00,607
And they think

4959
04:15:01,119 --> 04:15:02,911
Maybe Caesars not coming back

4960
04:15:03,679 --> 04:15:04,703
At the same time

4961
04:15:04,959 --> 04:15:08,031
They are upset about this nobleman being whipped to death

4962
04:15:08,287 --> 04:15:14,175
They're upset about the pacification there's a whole bunch of tribes Adrian goldsworthy reminds me

4963
04:15:14,943 --> 04:15:18,015
That are some of the most powerful tribes in Gaul

4964
04:15:18,527 --> 04:15:24,671
Some of the most sophisticated to the ones who have the most contact with Rome which is why most of them are Roman friends which is why up until this

4965
04:15:24,927 --> 04:15:25,439
Time

4966
04:15:25,695 --> 04:15:27,231
They haven't really participated

4967
04:15:27,743 --> 04:15:30,303
In the defense of Gaul cuz they run the Roman side

4968
04:15:31,071 --> 04:15:32,607
But they're starting to realize

4969
04:15:33,119 --> 04:15:34,655
Did the Roman side

4970
04:15:34,911 --> 04:15:41,055
Is going to control all of them at some point you may be a more favorite tribe under Roman domination

4971
04:15:41,311 --> 04:15:42,847
But you're still under Roman domination

4972
04:15:43,359 --> 04:15:46,175
Goldsworthy did a great job explaining the situation he writes quote

4973
04:15:47,199 --> 04:15:51,039
Caesars understanding and manipulation of tribal politics was generally good

4974
04:15:51,295 --> 04:15:55,391
But over the winter of 53-52 BC his policy failed badly

4975
04:15:55,903 --> 04:15:57,951
There were a number of reasons for this failure

4976
04:15:58,207 --> 04:16:02,815
But it is root with a growing sense of the extent to which his presence had changed things

4977
04:16:03,839 --> 04:16:08,191
This was especially true of the Celtic Golic peoples of Central and Southern Golf

4978
04:16:08,703 --> 04:16:12,543
One of the three broad groups into which Caesar's commentaries divided

4979
04:16:12,799 --> 04:16:14,847
Quote on quote the whole of God

4980
04:16:15,359 --> 04:16:19,199
These tribes had not yet fought against Caesar to any meaningful degree

4981
04:16:19,455 --> 04:16:20,991
Although it was in their lands

4982
04:16:21,247 --> 04:16:24,831
Did the campaigns against the helvetii and ariovistus have been way

4983
04:16:25,343 --> 04:16:28,159
Dominating the trade routes with the Roman world

4984
04:16:28,415 --> 04:16:30,463
Tribes like to eat sequani

4985
04:16:30,975 --> 04:16:31,743
And arverni

4986
04:16:31,999 --> 04:16:35,839
We're wealthier and more politically sophisticated than the people to the north

4987
04:16:36,351 --> 04:16:41,215
They had Aiden Caesar and he in turn had favored the tribes and leaders most sympathetic to him

4988
04:16:41,471 --> 04:16:42,495
And he had thought

4989
04:16:42,751 --> 04:16:47,103
Or at least so he claimed on their behalf against the helvetii in REO Vista

4990
04:16:47,615 --> 04:16:49,919
Now over the course of the next year

4991
04:16:50,175 --> 04:16:52,479
Virtually all of them would turn against him

4992
04:16:52,735 --> 04:16:57,855
This was not simply a question of rebellion by those who would not receive the proconsuls favor

4993
04:16:58,111 --> 04:17:04,255
I had watched his Rivals were elevated above them the rebels eventually included many Chief into a done rather well Wonder

4994
04:17:04,511 --> 04:17:05,535
The Roman domination

4995
04:17:06,047 --> 04:17:07,839
That was at the heart of this new mood

4996
04:17:08,095 --> 04:17:11,679
The realization that Caesar and his Legions were in Gaul to stay

4997
04:17:11,935 --> 04:17:17,055
And would not be returning to the confines of the transalpine province after a few Swift campaign

4998
04:17:17,567 --> 04:17:21,919
Rome now expected or power to be acknowledged on a permanent basis throughout golf

4999
04:17:22,431 --> 04:17:24,223
DIY have become a conqueror

5000
04:17:24,479 --> 04:17:27,551
Without ever facing serious resistance from the Celtic peoples

5001
04:17:28,319 --> 04:17:28,831
And quote

5002
04:17:30,623 --> 04:17:36,767
Well of course they hadn't faced serious resistance got these are have been practicing the divide-and-conquer strategy on them he

5003
04:17:37,023 --> 04:17:39,839
I've been using these powerful tribes that were friendly to Rome

5004
04:17:40,095 --> 04:17:41,887
Against the powerful tribes that weren't

5005
04:17:42,399 --> 04:17:45,471
And now the ones that are friendly to wrong realize that it doesn't matter

5006
04:17:45,727 --> 04:17:47,519
You know which side you would lie with

5007
04:17:47,775 --> 04:17:51,359
You're going to be living under Roman control either way

5008
04:17:52,383 --> 04:17:53,663
And it makes them

5009
04:17:54,175 --> 04:17:55,199
Receptive

5010
04:17:55,967 --> 04:18:00,575
To the idea that come forward once it's clear that the political problems in Rome

5011
04:18:01,087 --> 04:18:03,135
Make trap Caesar there

5012
04:18:03,391 --> 04:18:05,951
While his Legions are wintering in golf

5013
04:18:06,975 --> 04:18:07,487
What if

5014
04:18:07,999 --> 04:18:09,023
All golf

5015
04:18:09,535 --> 04:18:10,047
Could you not

5016
04:18:10,815 --> 04:18:13,119
Against Caesar especially while he was away

5017
04:18:15,167 --> 04:18:17,471
Think of how crazy the movie idea would be

5018
04:18:19,263 --> 04:18:20,799
Screenwriter developed

5019
04:18:21,055 --> 04:18:22,591
Treatment based on the idea

5020
04:18:22,847 --> 04:18:24,895
Did all the North American tribes

5021
04:18:25,151 --> 04:18:26,431
Unite together

5022
04:18:26,943 --> 04:18:28,223
In a common

5023
04:18:28,735 --> 04:18:30,783
Effort militarily speaking

5024
04:18:31,295 --> 04:18:32,575
To defeat

5025
04:18:32,831 --> 04:18:33,855
The European colony

5026
04:18:34,111 --> 04:18:35,647
Nest on the Eastern Seaboard in

5027
04:18:36,159 --> 04:18:37,183
I don't know 16 V

5028
04:18:40,255 --> 04:18:40,767
They would have

5029
04:18:41,023 --> 04:18:46,143
Of course had to have conducted their own Native American version of the Lewis and Clark expedition so those Eastern tribes

5030
04:18:46,655 --> 04:18:49,727
Trekking across North American find out that there's a West Coast

5031
04:18:49,983 --> 04:18:54,335
Native living there at some point

5032
04:18:54,847 --> 04:19:00,991
Have this big Face-Off between all the native tribes in North America against the relative newcomer Europeans

5033
04:19:03,039 --> 04:19:08,927
It's too crazy to imagine though is that you wouldn't be able to suspend disbelief the premise is too far-fetched

5034
04:19:11,231 --> 04:19:12,255
That's what happens in golf

5035
04:19:14,303 --> 04:19:15,583
That's why it's such a rare moment

5036
04:19:17,375 --> 04:19:19,935
The divide-and-conquer strategy

5037
04:19:20,447 --> 04:19:22,239
All of a sudden fails

5038
04:19:22,495 --> 04:19:23,263
All at once

5039
04:19:24,543 --> 04:19:25,055
And these

5040
04:19:25,311 --> 04:19:27,871
Tribal people realize their predicament

5041
04:19:28,383 --> 04:19:33,247
At the same time and are able to drop their age-old animosities

5042
04:19:34,015 --> 04:19:36,575
And decide together that it's now or never

5043
04:19:37,855 --> 04:19:41,695
We're going to maintain our freedom even our freedom to fight each other

5044
04:19:41,951 --> 04:19:44,255
For tribal soupremacy down the road

5045
04:19:44,511 --> 04:19:46,047
We're going to have to unite now

5046
04:19:46,559 --> 04:19:49,887
And defeat this threat before it's too late and it might already be too late

5047
04:19:51,423 --> 04:19:54,495
This opportunity of Caesar getting roped back in the politics of Rome

5048
04:19:54,751 --> 04:19:55,775
Opens up the door

5049
04:19:56,287 --> 04:19:57,311
Caesar says that

5050
04:19:58,079 --> 04:20:04,223
And there's a lot of other grievances that are coming to a head all at the same time including Caesars execution of that Noble Monaca or a

5051
04:20:04,479 --> 04:20:05,247
Graco that he had whipped

5052
04:20:05,503 --> 04:20:06,015
To death

5053
04:20:06,271 --> 04:20:10,111
And he says that these garlic tribes come together it's makes him sound like the leadership

5054
04:20:10,367 --> 04:20:12,159
Ships Come Together in the deep dark woods

5055
04:20:13,439 --> 04:20:14,975
Archaeologist Barry cunliffe suggest

5056
04:20:15,231 --> 04:20:15,743
It would not be

5057
04:20:16,255 --> 04:20:17,279
Strange to think of

5058
04:20:17,791 --> 04:20:19,327
The Druids

5059
04:20:19,583 --> 04:20:24,959
Being the ones who sort of officiated an event like this both for sacred reasons but also because they're so.

5060
04:20:25,215 --> 04:20:25,727
The diplomats

5061
04:20:25,983 --> 04:20:26,751
The Penn National

5062
04:20:27,519 --> 04:20:30,591
Sanctifier of these tribes I mean they would have been the respected

5063
04:20:30,847 --> 04:20:31,615
People to

5064
04:20:32,127 --> 04:20:37,759
As the referees and judges and arbitrators in a case like this there are stories by the way of Druids

5065
04:20:38,271 --> 04:20:41,343
Stopping marching to the middle of a battlefield between

5066
04:20:41,855 --> 04:20:47,999
The lines of two armies about to clash and stopping the conflict of these are people with huge amounts of moral Authority and cuddle

5067
04:20:48,255 --> 04:20:49,023
Suggestion

5068
04:20:49,535 --> 04:20:52,095
For such a sacred important situation is this

5069
04:20:52,351 --> 04:20:53,631
Piracy in the Grove

5070
04:20:54,143 --> 04:20:55,167
Caesar portrays it

5071
04:20:55,423 --> 04:20:56,191
Would not be

5072
04:20:56,703 --> 04:20:57,471
You beyond the pale

5073
04:20:58,751 --> 04:21:01,823
In fact considering what these tribes are pledging to do

5074
04:21:02,335 --> 04:21:08,479
You would want to have a signed contract in blood you want to have The Druids officiating you want to have a lot of witnesses and if you know

5075
04:21:08,735 --> 04:21:09,247
Notary public

5076
04:21:09,759 --> 04:21:11,295
Because the challenge here

5077
04:21:11,807 --> 04:21:13,855
Is it now everyone is aware with the stakes are

5078
04:21:15,135 --> 04:21:16,415
Then everyone knows now

5079
04:21:16,927 --> 04:21:21,791
But if they rebelled they're going to get the treatment that these tribes that have had everybody wiped out

5080
04:21:22,047 --> 04:21:22,559
Efface

5081
04:21:23,071 --> 04:21:24,351
Everyone understands

5082
04:21:24,607 --> 04:21:25,375
The two

5083
04:21:25,631 --> 04:21:28,959
Fight back now is to wager everything

5084
04:21:31,007 --> 04:21:35,103
Once again the Genesis of the story Ground Zero is Caesar himself

5085
04:21:36,127 --> 04:21:39,455
I would love to know if it's even true how he found out about it

5086
04:21:39,967 --> 04:21:41,503
But he gives an account of this

5087
04:21:42,015 --> 04:21:44,319
Tribal meeting in the deep dark woods

5088
04:21:45,343 --> 04:21:50,207
My Thomas Holmes translation of Caesar which dates back to the early 1900s and is a

5089
04:21:50,463 --> 04:21:53,279
Has some fabulous different words in it then

5090
04:21:53,535 --> 04:21:57,375
Most of the more modern ones I mean instead of saying call is pacified over and over

5091
04:21:57,631 --> 04:21:59,935
He uses the word tranquilized which gives it a

5092
04:22:00,703 --> 04:22:01,215
Feel

5093
04:22:02,495 --> 04:22:06,335
He picks up the story where seizures back and Rome dealing with all the political trouble

5094
04:22:06,847 --> 04:22:12,991
And the Celtic people in Gaul hear about that political trouble which then prompts this meeting in the woods here

5095
04:22:13,247 --> 04:22:14,783
Tell my home translation of Si

5096
04:22:15,039 --> 04:22:15,807
Caesar have it

5097
04:22:17,855 --> 04:22:18,367
Picking up right after

5098
04:22:18,623 --> 04:22:21,183
Procedure talked about all those problems in Rome keeping in there

5099
04:22:21,439 --> 04:22:21,951
Quote

5100
04:22:22,463 --> 04:22:26,303
The news of these events speedily made its way to transalpine Gaul

5101
04:22:26,815 --> 04:22:30,911
The Gauls Amplified and embellished the story is the faxing to war it

5102
04:22:31,423 --> 04:22:35,007
Spreading rumors that Caesar was detained by the disturbances in the capitol

5103
04:22:35,263 --> 04:22:39,103
And that while these beers conflicts were raging he could not rejoin his army

5104
04:22:39,615 --> 04:22:41,919
The opportunity stimulated the Gauls

5105
04:22:42,175 --> 04:22:42,687
Stimulated

5106
04:22:43,199 --> 04:22:45,759
Stimulated the Gauls they were already smarting

5107
04:22:46,271 --> 04:22:46,783
Another good one

5108
04:22:47,039 --> 04:22:53,183
They were already smarting under their subjugation to the Roman people and they now began unreservedly in boldly

5109
04:22:53,439 --> 04:22:55,487
Deform projects for war

5110
04:22:55,743 --> 04:23:00,095
Deleting men of Gaul mutually arranged meetings in secluded Woodland spots

5111
04:23:00,607 --> 04:23:01,119
They spoke

5112
04:23:01,375 --> 04:23:02,911
Bitterly of the death of a CO

5113
04:23:03,679 --> 04:23:04,447
That was a man who's with

5114
04:23:05,983 --> 04:23:09,311
Telling their Heroes that the same fate might befall them

5115
04:23:09,567 --> 04:23:12,383
In deploring the fortune that oppress the whole country

5116
04:23:12,639 --> 04:23:13,663
They made promises

5117
04:23:13,919 --> 04:23:18,527
And offered rewards of every kind to induce volunteers to strike the first blow

5118
04:23:18,783 --> 04:23:21,343
And risked their lives to restore the liberty of God

5119
04:23:22,111 --> 04:23:22,623
And quote

5120
04:23:24,415 --> 04:23:30,559
There he goes again Caesar making these people in their cause sound like the one you'd want to get behind right garlic

5121
04:23:30,815 --> 04:23:31,327
Liberty

5122
04:23:32,863 --> 04:23:36,959
It would oppose that wretched have to be Darth Vader doing pose that what's Caesar doing

5123
04:23:38,239 --> 04:23:39,007
As we said earlier

5124
04:23:39,263 --> 04:23:40,543
You're the experts disagree

5125
04:23:40,799 --> 04:23:42,847
Caesar's writing on multiple planes here

5126
04:23:43,103 --> 04:23:47,967
There's lots of speculation some of its fun I'll just give you one of the ideas out there that might

5127
04:23:48,479 --> 04:23:50,015
You know again speculation

5128
04:23:50,527 --> 04:23:54,367
Might help explain know what he's been doing this whole time we've been making the Celtic

5129
04:23:54,879 --> 04:23:56,671
Side out to be somewhat admirable

5130
04:23:58,207 --> 04:23:59,743
There's an idea out there that you sort of

5131
04:23:59,999 --> 04:24:01,023
Setting the stage

5132
04:24:01,791 --> 04:24:02,815
What happens

5133
04:24:03,071 --> 04:24:05,119
A generation or two down the road

5134
04:24:05,631 --> 04:24:06,911
After they've conquered all the

5135
04:24:08,447 --> 04:24:14,591
I mean you have to kind of sell the idea back in Rome a little bit don't you that listen don't worry we'll incorporate

5136
04:24:14,847 --> 04:24:15,359
Gall

5137
04:24:15,615 --> 04:24:18,175
Into raw but there is simulator bull

5138
04:24:18,687 --> 04:24:23,551
You know for sure there are intractable and they're not housebroken in their culture is substandard by Roman

5139
04:24:24,831 --> 04:24:30,975
Measure but we can fix that can a couple Generations will turn them into good romance and the way you can tell it's because look at

5140
04:24:31,999 --> 04:24:33,023
Same values

5141
04:24:33,791 --> 04:24:34,303
I mean

5142
04:24:34,559 --> 04:24:35,839
Yeah if you put these

5143
04:24:36,607 --> 04:24:38,399
Phrases and Concepts

5144
04:24:38,655 --> 04:24:43,519
In the mouths of a Roman character in a Roman stage play

5145
04:24:43,775 --> 04:24:45,567
The Roman audiences going to cheer

5146
04:24:46,591 --> 04:24:47,103
In other words

5147
04:24:47,359 --> 04:24:50,943
And he sort of making the case according to one of these theories are red

5148
04:24:51,199 --> 04:24:55,039
Were the Gauls are trainable but the Germans are never

5149
04:24:55,295 --> 04:24:55,807
Going to be house

5150
04:24:56,831 --> 04:24:59,647
Therefore we can incorporate the Gauls and down the road

5151
04:24:59,903 --> 04:25:01,951
You know after we break him to the yolk of Empire

5152
04:25:03,231 --> 04:25:07,327
Can teach him up right look at how well those Gauls and short-haired golub been doing now for

5153
04:25:07,583 --> 04:25:09,119
For 50 60 70 years

5154
04:25:09,375 --> 04:25:15,519
You know we can we can make these people into good romance and you can tell just look at how their spouting phrases that would make

5155
04:25:15,775 --> 04:25:17,055
Them good Romans today

5156
04:25:17,567 --> 04:25:19,871
It's an interesting idea and it would explain

5157
04:25:20,639 --> 04:25:21,663
My Caesar makes

5158
04:25:21,919 --> 04:25:24,223
Their cause sympathetic as he's crushing it

5159
04:25:25,759 --> 04:25:29,599
It does sound a little bit like he misjudged how serious it was

5160
04:25:30,367 --> 04:25:35,487
When he got word of it back in Rome the situation was starting to mellow out a little bit back there he says

5161
04:25:35,999 --> 04:25:39,071
And then he hears about these problems but as one historian pointed out

5162
04:25:39,327 --> 04:25:44,191
You know he conquered this area what four five six years ago initially

5163
04:25:44,447 --> 04:25:47,263
And he's had problems with it every year headaches

5164
04:25:47,775 --> 04:25:52,639
Brightsparks the way we describe them all these aren't headaches and he doesn't know yet this is more like a stroke

5165
04:25:53,919 --> 04:25:55,455
And all the spark that we talked about

5166
04:25:55,967 --> 04:25:56,479
Earlier

5167
04:25:56,991 --> 04:25:59,807
Finally fan into a general forest fire

5168
04:26:00,319 --> 04:26:03,391
As all of Gaul will go up basically

5169
04:26:03,647 --> 04:26:06,975
In Rebellion including the great friendly tribes of Rome

5170
04:26:08,511 --> 04:26:10,303
And it starts with one of those moves

5171
04:26:10,559 --> 04:26:11,839
That a tribe does

5172
04:26:12,095 --> 04:26:17,727
As a way of sort of Dipping their dagger in the assassination victim and saying okay I'm in

5173
04:26:17,983 --> 04:26:21,567
Involves tribe it's always been possible for the Romans it is the one that

5174
04:26:21,823 --> 04:26:26,431
Steps forward allegedly at this Woodland conspiracy is says will strike the first blow

5175
04:26:26,943 --> 04:26:29,247
They go after this hill for town

5176
04:26:29,759 --> 04:26:31,551
By the Celtic tribe that

5177
04:26:31,807 --> 04:26:34,367
Full of Roman Traders and businessmen

5178
04:26:34,623 --> 04:26:37,695
And after they take the town they Massacre all the Roman

5179
04:26:39,743 --> 04:26:40,767
So essentially saying you the rest

5180
04:26:41,023 --> 04:26:44,863
The tribes okay we agreed to do this we're all in there's no going back for us who's next

5181
04:26:46,911 --> 04:26:48,959
And the rhythm of the story is interesting

5182
04:26:49,471 --> 04:26:49,983
Because

5183
04:26:50,239 --> 04:26:52,031
You will have the tribes

5184
04:26:52,287 --> 04:26:53,823
Join the Rebellion

5185
04:26:54,335 --> 04:26:55,871
You know usually in Big Shot

5186
04:26:56,127 --> 04:26:57,151
But even

5187
04:26:57,663 --> 04:27:03,807
You all along the way some big tribal at the last moment change sides and and so slowly but surely the Rebellion games

5188
04:27:04,063 --> 04:27:04,575
Steam

5189
04:27:06,367 --> 04:27:12,511
The massacre that kicks it off that we mentioned earlier the news about spreads like wildfire in the central

5190
04:27:12,767 --> 04:27:13,535
Gauley tribes go up

5191
04:27:13,791 --> 04:27:17,375
In Flames except for the ones most loyal to Rome we are the

5192
04:27:17,887 --> 04:27:19,167
Are the big tribe that matter

5193
04:27:19,679 --> 04:27:20,447
They're the ones

5194
04:27:20,703 --> 04:27:26,847
Who initially went to Rome and said we need help cuz this Germans been brought it I mean this is the Ally of Ally

5195
04:27:27,103 --> 04:27:27,871
Wise for the Romans

5196
04:27:28,383 --> 04:27:29,151
In this region

5197
04:27:29,407 --> 04:27:31,711
So they're the ones that they worry about that's where

5198
04:27:31,967 --> 04:27:34,527
The Romans get all their supply help

5199
04:27:34,783 --> 04:27:39,391
The grain that's where they store their hostages when they take them from other garlic tribit sort of there

5200
04:27:39,647 --> 04:27:42,975
Administrative Center in Gaul these are our good allies and we can trust

5201
04:27:43,999 --> 04:27:44,511
Well

5202
04:27:46,047 --> 04:27:49,375
On paper it may look that way but remember what we said earlier

5203
04:27:49,887 --> 04:27:51,423
Is garlic tribes are not United

5204
04:27:52,191 --> 04:27:53,727
An even Caesar says there's

5205
04:27:53,983 --> 04:27:54,751
With and rifle

5206
04:27:55,007 --> 04:27:55,519
Faction

5207
04:27:56,031 --> 04:28:01,151
So think Democrats and Republicans Tories and Labour and whatever you want to say write your

5208
04:28:01,407 --> 04:28:07,551
Your two sides of the coin and maybe just because a tribe is taking a particular course of action it maybe like 51

5209
04:28:07,807 --> 04:28:10,111
Percent of the tribe wants to do it in 49% dozen

5210
04:28:11,135 --> 04:28:13,951
So sometimes it doesn't take a whole lot of change

5211
04:28:14,719 --> 04:28:17,023
To sort of make the scales tipped the other way

5212
04:28:17,535 --> 04:28:19,327
And when the first big tribe

5213
04:28:19,839 --> 04:28:20,607
Galls

5214
04:28:21,119 --> 04:28:22,399
Commit to this massacre

5215
04:28:22,911 --> 04:28:29,055
Romans it's on in the number of these tribes start to get up and eat cuz it's Caesar says that's kind of the garlic character

5216
04:28:29,311 --> 04:28:32,383
Anyway writes the excitement happening and want to get on board

5217
04:28:33,407 --> 04:28:36,223
And by the time he realizes how bad things are

5218
04:28:36,735 --> 04:28:37,503
He's in trouble

5219
04:28:37,759 --> 04:28:41,343
Because he's a long way from the action and he's got enemies between him

5220
04:28:42,111 --> 04:28:43,135
In Roman

5221
04:28:43,391 --> 04:28:43,903
Northern

5222
04:28:44,159 --> 04:28:45,183
Italy now

5223
04:28:45,695 --> 04:28:47,999
Angle when the armies are so the first

5224
04:28:48,255 --> 04:28:50,303
Chapter of this story has Caesar

5225
04:28:50,815 --> 04:28:56,447
Doing amazing things let's be honest he's an amazing guy and in the speed of movement that he employs for example

5226
04:28:56,703 --> 04:28:57,471
Who is crazy

5227
04:28:57,727 --> 04:28:59,775
And his audacity he takes the Great

5228
04:29:00,031 --> 04:29:00,543
Calculator

5229
04:29:01,055 --> 04:29:05,919
Alexander would have jumped off the cliff in darkness and whatever happens happens

5230
04:29:06,175 --> 04:29:06,943
I'm a God right

5231
04:29:07,199 --> 04:29:08,735
Caesar took a calculated risk

5232
04:29:08,991 --> 04:29:11,039
His audacity in his speed

5233
04:29:11,551 --> 04:29:14,367
Is continually on display in so he manages

5234
04:29:14,623 --> 04:29:16,415
To get back to his armies

5235
04:29:16,671 --> 04:29:18,463
His armies managed to break out of a

5236
04:29:18,719 --> 04:29:21,791
I've been ambushed when more of these tribes start going the other way

5237
04:29:23,327 --> 04:29:24,863
And while this is going on

5238
04:29:26,143 --> 04:29:31,519
A figure emerges on the scene that we only really know of because of Caesar

5239
04:29:32,031 --> 04:29:32,799
But he's

5240
04:29:34,335 --> 04:29:34,847
Fascinate

5241
04:29:35,359 --> 04:29:36,383
And anyway

5242
04:29:36,895 --> 04:29:38,431
Could be an example

5243
04:29:38,687 --> 04:29:44,831
Of that beam see idea we talked about earlier you know how the Celts might have been caught in the beam CD because they

5244
04:29:45,087 --> 04:29:46,111
Transition from

5245
04:29:46,367 --> 04:29:48,927
A more ferocious Barbarian way of life to use it

5246
04:29:49,183 --> 04:29:50,463
100 years ago

5247
04:29:50,975 --> 04:29:53,279
And a more Romans in existence in that they

5248
04:29:53,535 --> 04:29:57,119
Play Datsik maybe lost in my court jester silly Theory

5249
04:29:57,375 --> 04:30:02,751
The ferociousness of the more Barbarian tribes and not yet gain advantages that comes

5250
04:30:03,007 --> 04:30:08,383
Would being able to handle Logistics and supply and and finance an organization and all these Roman thing

5251
04:30:09,663 --> 04:30:13,247
This person that will crop up at the last available MoMA

5252
04:30:14,271 --> 04:30:16,063
Will try to turn

5253
04:30:16,319 --> 04:30:18,623
The Celtic armies into something that can fight

5254
04:30:18,879 --> 04:30:19,391
The Romans

5255
04:30:21,695 --> 04:30:24,255
Because just because you can make a lot of garlic

5256
04:30:24,511 --> 04:30:26,559
Tribe decide to join a rebellion

5257
04:30:26,815 --> 04:30:32,959
And maybe grab hold of more Warriors than they've ever been able to put together in one place in golf

5258
04:30:33,215 --> 04:30:35,263
You still can't feed them right

5259
04:30:35,775 --> 04:30:37,823
We learn that earlier in Caesar's Conquest

5260
04:30:38,079 --> 04:30:41,407
These armies can't just get bigger they have to get better

5261
04:30:42,431 --> 04:30:44,223
And they have to be able to support

5262
04:30:44,479 --> 04:30:45,503
Bigger better arm

5263
04:30:46,527 --> 04:30:47,551
So how do you do that

5264
04:30:48,063 --> 04:30:48,831
Will enter

5265
04:30:49,343 --> 04:30:50,879
This amazing character

5266
04:30:52,415 --> 04:30:56,255
You can pronounce his way several different ways and you can have fights over I've always gone

5267
04:30:56,767 --> 04:30:57,791
With me I can get erect

5268
04:30:58,559 --> 04:31:00,863
But they're saying generates is also popular

5269
04:31:01,375 --> 04:31:03,167
He is the Great

5270
04:31:03,935 --> 04:31:04,959
Unifier

5271
04:31:05,215 --> 04:31:06,239
I've been gawlik p

5272
04:31:06,495 --> 04:31:08,543
People in the last possible moment

5273
04:31:09,311 --> 04:31:10,847
You know when resistance is possible

5274
04:31:13,151 --> 04:31:14,431
He appears on the scene

5275
04:31:15,199 --> 04:31:16,223
As a king

5276
04:31:16,479 --> 04:31:17,503
By the time Caesar

5277
04:31:20,319 --> 04:31:21,343
He came from a tribe

5278
04:31:21,855 --> 04:31:26,207
Pretty out of this hole Celtic gallic war thing at this point

5279
04:31:29,023 --> 04:31:33,887
That's a try by the way that's one of those developed ones that has more of a senate the Mormon oligarchic sort of

5280
04:31:34,143 --> 04:31:34,911
Roman system

5281
04:31:35,423 --> 04:31:36,959
And there can get her exes

5282
04:31:37,215 --> 04:31:39,007
I'd had apparently been

5283
04:31:39,263 --> 04:31:44,895
Executed for trying to become king of these people taking them back to an old way of government by the way

5284
04:31:45,407 --> 04:31:49,503
Early in Rome's history when their Republic was new and they had ditched the monarchy

5285
04:31:50,015 --> 04:31:56,159
The crime of trying to reinstall the monarchy was was equally harshly punished but in this case remember yours

5286
04:31:56,415 --> 04:31:57,695
Supposed to be burned alive

5287
04:31:57,951 --> 04:31:58,975
She try to do that so I guess

5288
04:31:59,487 --> 04:32:02,047
Without really saying so maybe they're can get erect

5289
04:32:02,303 --> 04:32:05,119
His dad was burned alive for trying to become a king

5290
04:32:06,143 --> 04:32:09,215
When is whole Rebellion take place as The Story Goes

5291
04:32:09,471 --> 04:32:13,055
I can get her ex and his family members including an uncle

5292
04:32:13,311 --> 04:32:13,823
Will

5293
04:32:14,079 --> 04:32:16,383
Minnesota fight over what to do

5294
04:32:16,639 --> 04:32:18,175
There can get erect will

5295
04:32:18,687 --> 04:32:20,479
Apparently be wanting to become a king

5296
04:32:20,735 --> 04:32:24,063
And maybe take on the Roman of the uncle opposes him so very can get arrested

5297
04:32:24,319 --> 04:32:25,599
Thrown out of his City

5298
04:32:25,855 --> 04:32:31,743
Caesar says he goes out and using garlic Liberty and freedom as his as his

5299
04:32:31,999 --> 04:32:34,303
Rallying cry rally always

5300
04:32:34,559 --> 04:32:36,351
Caesar says Desperado

5301
04:32:37,119 --> 04:32:40,447
And dead-enders but you could really see them as Maybe

5302
04:32:40,959 --> 04:32:43,263
Patriotic young Golic Warriors

5303
04:32:43,775 --> 04:32:45,567
Finally ready to rise up I mean

5304
04:32:45,823 --> 04:32:46,847
Depends on the way you're viewing

5305
04:32:47,103 --> 04:32:48,639
I guess they must have been pretty

5306
04:32:49,663 --> 04:32:55,807
Decently intimidating because we'll come back to his home City with all these Desperados and

5307
04:32:56,063 --> 04:32:58,367
Dead-enders around him essentially

5308
04:32:58,879 --> 04:32:59,391
Launch 8

5309
04:32:59,647 --> 04:33:03,487
Who if you will against his home City become the king of those people

5310
04:33:03,743 --> 04:33:07,071
And then begin to Rally tribes together

5311
04:33:09,119 --> 04:33:11,167
These tribes begin to seed

5312
04:33:11,423 --> 04:33:15,519
Authority to him as a war leader which is very unusual in the Celtic world

5313
04:33:17,311 --> 04:33:18,335
Historian in class

5314
04:33:18,591 --> 04:33:19,871
Closest Michael and Sage

5315
04:33:20,639 --> 04:33:26,783
Points out that vert can get erect didn't start this Rebellion against the Romans but he quickly came in and sort of

5316
04:33:27,039 --> 04:33:27,807
Took it over

5317
04:33:30,623 --> 04:33:36,767
He sent embassies everywhere and formed alliances Sage says many names all these big important rhyme

5318
04:33:37,535 --> 04:33:40,095
That we can get our experience to communicate Within

5319
04:33:40,607 --> 04:33:45,215
Say listen the time is now remember it's only been a few years since Caesar conquered this place oh

5320
04:33:45,471 --> 04:33:48,031
These are all recently

5321
04:33:48,287 --> 04:33:49,567
Subdued people

5322
04:33:50,335 --> 04:33:55,711
And they sort of understand that this is how it's going to be unless they move at some point

5323
04:33:55,967 --> 04:34:00,063
And there can get over to sending embassies to all these tribe saying that point is now

5324
04:34:02,879 --> 04:34:04,927
Michael and Sage writes the beer can get erect

5325
04:34:05,183 --> 04:34:05,951
It was chosen

5326
04:34:06,463 --> 04:34:08,511
The war leader of these tribes

5327
04:34:09,023 --> 04:34:11,327
Have began implementing policies

5328
04:34:12,095 --> 04:34:13,887
That were very ungodly

5329
04:34:14,143 --> 04:34:15,167
In nature

5330
04:34:15,679 --> 04:34:18,239
But that a Roman like Caesar could appreciate

5331
04:34:18,495 --> 04:34:20,031
Because they're more like Roman Standard

5332
04:34:20,287 --> 04:34:21,311
Sage rights quote

5333
04:34:22,079 --> 04:34:24,127
There can't get erection was chosen as commander

5334
04:34:24,383 --> 04:34:26,943
And quickly set about organizing the rebel Army

5335
04:34:27,455 --> 04:34:33,343
In accordance with standard garlic procedure he demanded and received hostages from each of his allies

5336
04:34:33,855 --> 04:34:34,879
Is pledges of good faith

5337
04:34:35,135 --> 04:34:39,743
And issued orders to them to provide a specific number of soldiers for the Allied Army

5338
04:34:40,255 --> 04:34:42,559
Enforces orders with ferocious punishment

5339
04:34:43,071 --> 04:34:45,119
That included execution and torture

5340
04:34:45,631 --> 04:34:47,167
This was an extraordinary developer

5341
04:34:47,679 --> 04:34:51,775
During his campaigns in gaul caesar had faced individual tribes

5342
04:34:52,031 --> 04:34:53,823
4 coalitions on the battlefield

5343
04:34:54,335 --> 04:34:57,407
Perhaps the largest was that of the belgae in 57 BC

5344
04:34:57,663 --> 04:35:02,783
However in these conflicts there is no hint of any Central organization among Allied try

5345
04:35:03,295 --> 04:35:06,623
After seizures initial refusal to engage the belgic army

5346
04:35:06,879 --> 04:35:10,207
The tribe simply returned home to face these are individually

5347
04:35:10,719 --> 04:35:15,071
Beer can get erect represent an entirely New Direction and garlic resistance to the Roman

5348
04:35:15,583 --> 04:35:19,935
For the first time their opponent was a centrally organized and directed Army

5349
04:35:20,191 --> 04:35:23,007
That represented an alliance of a number of different tribes

5350
04:35:23,519 --> 04:35:28,127
Which creation was in part due to the extraordinary personality of your can get erect

5351
04:35:28,383 --> 04:35:30,943
And also to the effects of the Roman Conquest

5352
04:35:31,455 --> 04:35:37,599
The Gauls repeated failures against Caesar had led to the realization that their traditional military meth

5353
04:35:37,855 --> 04:35:38,879
Is were no longer adequate

5354
04:35:39,391 --> 04:35:43,487
The Roman army in Gaul was too large to be dealt with without a collective effort

5355
04:35:43,743 --> 04:35:49,887
Importantly he provided a model of a highly organized and centralized Army that there can get Alex karev

5356
04:35:50,143 --> 04:35:53,215
Rick Lee saw was the only possibility of defeating the Roman

5357
04:35:54,239 --> 04:35:54,751
And quote

5358
04:35:56,543 --> 04:35:57,823
Sage goes on to point out

5359
04:35:58,335 --> 04:35:58,847
That

5360
04:35:59,103 --> 04:36:01,151
There can get her riches try was

5361
04:36:01,663 --> 04:36:03,199
Friends with the Romans and that

5362
04:36:03,455 --> 04:36:07,295
It was not unusual for garlic nobleman a friendly tribes to serve

5363
04:36:07,807 --> 04:36:13,695
With the Romans on campaign is Allied Cavalry and it's possible although he points out we have no evidence one way or the other

5364
04:36:13,951 --> 04:36:18,047
The Vera can get erection done this once upon a time too and maybe was quite familiar

5365
04:36:18,559 --> 04:36:19,839
With the way the Romans fought

5366
04:36:20,607 --> 04:36:22,399
Adrian goldsworthy even suggest

5367
04:36:22,911 --> 04:36:26,751
Possibility that Caesar and Burger King Garrick's knew each other personally

5368
04:36:28,031 --> 04:36:29,311
From years before this.

5369
04:36:31,103 --> 04:36:32,127
Completely new Laird

5370
04:36:32,383 --> 04:36:32,895
Things wouldn't it

5371
04:36:34,687 --> 04:36:35,199
Nonetheless

5372
04:36:35,455 --> 04:36:37,759
There are some things that I can get erect now as the

5373
04:36:38,015 --> 04:36:43,135
Supreme Commander the warlord of all these tribes in Gaul with the exception of a few who are slowly but surely

5374
04:36:43,391 --> 04:36:43,903
Come on board

5375
04:36:44,671 --> 04:36:46,719
He can control some things now

5376
04:36:46,975 --> 04:36:51,583
With greater Authority than any garlic ruler since Caesar first arrived on the scene

5377
04:36:51,839 --> 04:36:53,119
But there's other things you can't change

5378
04:36:53,631 --> 04:36:57,215
He can start ordering tribes around now so instead of having to beg

5379
04:36:57,471 --> 04:37:00,799
A tribe you normally your enemies with better temporarily fighting with

5380
04:37:01,055 --> 04:37:01,823
For supplies and

5381
04:37:02,079 --> 04:37:04,127
An nth roots and whatnot you can order it

5382
04:37:05,151 --> 04:37:06,431
So you can begin to

5383
04:37:07,199 --> 04:37:10,271
Mimic in a may be less efficient way

5384
04:37:10,527 --> 04:37:12,575
Things like Roman Supply

5385
04:37:13,343 --> 04:37:13,855
And

5386
04:37:14,367 --> 04:37:20,511
Working together and telling One Tribe to go over here in another tried to go over there as part of some larger strategy

5387
04:37:20,767 --> 04:37:21,791
Which is a huge Improvement

5388
04:37:22,047 --> 04:37:25,375
But you're not changing the reality on the Tactical level on the ground

5389
04:37:25,631 --> 04:37:29,983
You're not turning your Golic warriors with their swords and their Shields into Roman legionnaire

5390
04:37:30,751 --> 04:37:32,287
You're not inventing Centurian

5391
04:37:32,799 --> 04:37:37,151
You're not getting Battlefield discipline and drill and organization at that level

5392
04:37:38,175 --> 04:37:39,199
So you still can't

5393
04:37:39,455 --> 04:37:40,479
Face the legions in the

5394
04:37:42,527 --> 04:37:44,575
And you can get Eric seems to know this

5395
04:37:44,831 --> 04:37:46,623
Because he's going to be famous for telling

5396
04:37:46,879 --> 04:37:49,695
The rest of the Gauls that they have to do something

5397
04:37:49,951 --> 04:37:53,791
It runs against their nature in terms of this heroic ether

5398
04:37:54,559 --> 04:37:56,863
He tells them they are essentially going to have

5399
04:37:57,887 --> 04:38:04,031
A guerrilla war and they're going to have to adopt a scorched-earth strategy and they're going to have to destroy

5400
04:38:04,543 --> 04:38:05,311
Their stuff

5401
04:38:05,567 --> 04:38:06,591
And where they live

5402
04:38:06,847 --> 04:38:07,359
And every

5403
04:38:07,871 --> 04:38:08,639
In order to defeat

5404
04:38:08,895 --> 04:38:09,407
Cadiz Roman

5405
04:38:09,663 --> 04:38:10,175
Now we talk

5406
04:38:10,431 --> 04:38:13,759
Earlier about some of the greatest tragedies in human history being

5407
04:38:14,271 --> 04:38:20,415
When some of the things on the list that you're willing to die for become the cost of other things on the list that you're willing to die for

5408
04:38:21,439 --> 04:38:23,231
And this is the greatest test

5409
04:38:23,487 --> 04:38:25,279
In the history of any Golic leader

5410
04:38:25,535 --> 04:38:26,559
That we seen

5411
04:38:27,071 --> 04:38:28,607
Well maybe anywhere in the house

5412
04:38:29,375 --> 04:38:29,887
Swear

5413
04:38:30,143 --> 04:38:35,263
You are going to have members of rival tribes making decisions that tell you you have to

5414
04:38:35,519 --> 04:38:38,079
To burn down your homes in your city and leave

5415
04:38:42,175 --> 04:38:43,455
Tribes listen

5416
04:38:43,967 --> 04:38:49,599
And agreed to adopt the strategy of their can get erect this is a sign one of the desperate times

5417
04:38:50,111 --> 04:38:51,903
And two of his unrivaled

5418
04:38:52,159 --> 04:38:52,671
Authority

5419
04:38:53,183 --> 04:38:54,719
For the first time in history

5420
04:38:54,975 --> 04:38:56,255
Gall or

5421
04:38:56,511 --> 04:38:57,791
Most of it anyways

5422
04:38:58,047 --> 04:39:00,351
Acting under the control of sort of one mind

5423
04:39:00,863 --> 04:39:01,375
One-wheel

5424
04:39:01,631 --> 04:39:02,655
The Nazis would have

5425
04:39:05,215 --> 04:39:06,751
Create a situation where

5426
04:39:07,519 --> 04:39:10,079
The Gauls are now at least on

5427
04:39:10,335 --> 04:39:12,127
Par with Caesar in the ability

5428
04:39:12,639 --> 04:39:16,223
To have a United strategy and this has never before been the case

5429
04:39:18,271 --> 04:39:21,343
But just because you have more power than any garlic Warlord

5430
04:39:21,855 --> 04:39:26,463
You can find in the previous history book doesn't mean you're the one who always get to the side

5431
04:39:26,975 --> 04:39:27,487
What to do

5432
04:39:28,511 --> 04:39:32,863
We all know right War the game of seizing the initiative and sometimes responding to

5433
04:39:33,119 --> 04:39:33,631
The other person

5434
04:39:33,887 --> 04:39:34,655
Doing that sometimes you get

5435
04:39:34,911 --> 04:39:36,447
Play offense but sometimes the other guy

5436
04:39:37,471 --> 04:39:37,983
Right

5437
04:39:38,495 --> 04:39:39,263
In this case

5438
04:39:39,775 --> 04:39:43,871
There will be games that both Caesar and vercingetorix will play with these cities

5439
04:39:44,127 --> 04:39:45,151
Is it sort of ironic

5440
04:39:45,663 --> 04:39:48,223
And one of the things they're saying getting rich is known for his telling that

5441
04:39:48,479 --> 04:39:52,319
Celtic people have to burn all these cities will where do all the major encounters happen

5442
04:39:52,575 --> 04:39:53,343
Outside these gall

5443
04:39:55,903 --> 04:40:00,767
Much of this encounter involve sieges any attempt to relieve sieges for various political reasons

5444
04:40:01,023 --> 04:40:06,143
Caesar will show up on the scene and go Bam Bam and take a couple of towns realfast remaining the Celtic

5445
04:40:06,399 --> 04:40:07,167
People that they cannot

5446
04:40:07,423 --> 04:40:08,447
Stand up to Roman Siege

5447
04:40:08,703 --> 04:40:09,215
Is very well

5448
04:40:09,727 --> 04:40:10,751
Then they will defeat

5449
04:40:11,263 --> 04:40:16,127
Some garlic Cavalry in a skirmish sort of reminding the Gauls that they can't face up to Roman

5450
04:40:16,639 --> 04:40:21,247
Field tactics and field armies very well either so what do you do then

5451
04:40:22,783 --> 04:40:23,295
This is where the straw

5452
04:40:23,807 --> 04:40:24,575
She comes into play

5453
04:40:26,367 --> 04:40:27,903
Scorched-earth type deal

5454
04:40:28,159 --> 04:40:32,255
Also very can get erect according according to Caesar we should emphasize that

5455
04:40:32,511 --> 04:40:35,583
Give this big speech where you tell them you're going to have to destroy everything at

5456
04:40:35,839 --> 04:40:39,167
It's great it's worth quoting in full and notice at the End by the way

5457
04:40:39,679 --> 04:40:41,471
Three throws up one of those

5458
04:40:41,983 --> 04:40:43,519
And you'll lose everything

5459
04:40:43,775 --> 04:40:49,919
Kinds of pictures to these people right I realize I'm asking you to do a lot and it's a bunch of things you'd be willing to die for maybe

5460
04:40:50,431 --> 04:40:54,783
But it's there to preserve other things you be willing to die for remember the steaks

5461
04:40:55,295 --> 04:40:56,831
This from the essay Hanford

5462
04:40:57,343 --> 04:40:58,623
Addition in this is Cesar

5463
04:40:58,879 --> 04:41:01,439
You're putting this into bear can get erect his mouth room

5464
04:41:02,719 --> 04:41:07,071
Procedure will mention these other cities that he's now taking already on the way to dealing with this

5465
04:41:07,327 --> 04:41:08,095
Rebellion

5466
04:41:08,351 --> 04:41:10,399
And they sound like names out of The Lord of the Rings

5467
04:41:10,655 --> 04:41:11,167
Don't they

5468
04:41:11,423 --> 04:41:11,935
Quote

5469
04:41:13,215 --> 04:41:15,007
After this series of reverses

5470
04:41:15,263 --> 04:41:16,543
Ed Villano doing them

5471
04:41:16,799 --> 04:41:19,103
Incentive them and novio doing them

5472
04:41:19,359 --> 04:41:22,431
There can get Eric some and his followers to a council of War

5473
04:41:22,687 --> 04:41:26,015
And told them that their plan of campaign must be completely changed

5474
04:41:26,783 --> 04:41:27,295
This is

5475
04:41:27,551 --> 04:41:28,319
Beer can get a ride

5476
04:41:28,575 --> 04:41:29,855
Stalking according to Caesar

5477
04:41:30,367 --> 04:41:30,879
Quote

5478
04:41:31,391 --> 04:41:37,023
We must strive by every means he said to prevent the Romans from obtaining forage and supplies

5479
04:41:37,279 --> 04:41:41,375
This will be easy since we are strong and Cavalry in the season is in our favor

5480
04:41:41,631 --> 04:41:47,007
There is no grass to cut so the enemy will be forced to send out party to get hay from the barn

5481
04:41:47,263 --> 04:41:52,127
And our Cavalry can go out every day and see that not a single one of the returns alive

5482
04:41:52,639 --> 04:41:58,015
What is more when our lives are at stake we must be prepared to sacrifice our private possession

5483
04:41:58,527 --> 04:42:04,671
How long the enemy's line of March we must burn all of the villages and Farms within the radius that the foragers can come

5484
04:42:05,183 --> 04:42:11,327
We ourselves have plenty of supplies because we can rely upon the resources of the people in whose territory the campaign

5485
04:42:11,583 --> 04:42:12,351
Pain is conducted

5486
04:42:12,607 --> 04:42:18,239
But the Romans will either succumb to starvation or have to expose themselves to Serious risk

5487
04:42:18,495 --> 04:42:21,055
By going far from their camp in search of food

5488
04:42:21,311 --> 04:42:26,431
We can either kill them or strip them of their baggage which will be equally effective since without it

5489
04:42:26,687 --> 04:42:27,967
They cannot keep the field

5490
04:42:28,479 --> 04:42:30,271
We should also burn all the town

5491
04:42:30,527 --> 04:42:34,111
Except those that are rendered impregnable by natural and artificial defenses

5492
04:42:34,623 --> 04:42:40,767
Otherwise they may serve as refuges for shirkers among our own numbers and give the enemy the chance of looting the stores are

5493
04:42:41,023 --> 04:42:43,583
Provisions and other property that they contain

5494
04:42:44,607 --> 04:42:46,143
You may think these measures heart

5495
04:42:46,399 --> 04:42:47,167
And cruel

5496
04:42:47,423 --> 04:42:53,567
But you must admit it would be a still harsher fate to have your wives and children carried off into slavery

5497
04:42:53,823 --> 04:42:54,847
Have you killed yourself

5498
04:42:55,359 --> 04:42:58,431
Which is what will inevitably befall you if you are Concord

5499
04:42:59,199 --> 04:42:59,711
And quote

5500
04:43:01,503 --> 04:43:05,599
That is by the way sort of Caesar pointing out I guess you could read it to this yes that's

5501
04:43:05,855 --> 04:43:07,135
True that is what I'll do to

5502
04:43:09,695 --> 04:43:11,487
Caesar says that most of these tribes

5503
04:43:11,743 --> 04:43:12,767
That were working with

5504
04:43:13,023 --> 04:43:19,167
They're can get erect complied and he says one of them burned 20 of their Town simultaneously

5505
04:43:19,423 --> 04:43:20,447
The smoke in the skies

5506
04:43:21,215 --> 04:43:22,239
The One Tribe

5507
04:43:22,751 --> 04:43:28,895
Back to the other garlic tries not to make them burn their City down it was the special City they said I mean they were wrapped up

5508
04:43:29,151 --> 04:43:34,527
Dumping it was one of the finest doing all the gall please don't make them do that since like please don't make me choose between

5509
04:43:34,783 --> 04:43:38,623
One thing on my list that I be willing to die for and some other thing on the list

5510
04:43:39,391 --> 04:43:44,767
So you never can get erections softer than he seems in other parts of the story or maybe he didn't have as much Authority

5511
04:43:45,023 --> 04:43:46,303
As you suggested

5512
04:43:46,559 --> 04:43:48,095
By Caesar but none the less

5513
04:43:48,351 --> 04:43:49,887
These people are able to get there

5514
04:43:50,143 --> 04:43:50,911
City spared the

5515
04:43:51,167 --> 04:43:51,679
This hill

5516
04:43:52,191 --> 04:43:53,727
Top town of theirs

5517
04:43:53,983 --> 04:43:58,079
Supposedly one of the arguments they made is listen it's impregnable don't worry and

5518
04:43:58,335 --> 04:43:59,103
Then Caesar took it

5519
04:44:01,663 --> 04:44:02,687
This is the city of

5520
04:44:02,943 --> 04:44:03,455
Avarakkai

5521
04:44:04,735 --> 04:44:06,527
And traditionally is considered to

5522
04:44:06,783 --> 04:44:07,295
Be one of the

5523
04:44:07,551 --> 04:44:08,831
The three main encounter

5524
04:44:10,111 --> 04:44:11,903
That formed the military side

5525
04:44:12,159 --> 04:44:13,439
This Golic Rebellion

5526
04:44:14,463 --> 04:44:15,743
But it's worth pointing out that

5527
04:44:15,999 --> 04:44:18,559
In the same way that the word pacification

5528
04:44:18,815 --> 04:44:20,863
Covers of town of low-level violin

5529
04:44:21,119 --> 04:44:21,887
That doesn't quite

5530
04:44:22,399 --> 04:44:24,703
You reach the standards of making it into the history

5531
04:44:25,983 --> 04:44:29,055
Talking about this garlic rebellion and then boiling it down

5532
04:44:29,311 --> 04:44:32,639
2-3 sieges in the violence associated with that

5533
04:44:33,151 --> 04:44:33,919
Is a

5534
04:44:34,431 --> 04:44:35,455
Minimizer

5535
04:44:35,711 --> 04:44:38,527
Also of all the things that we're going on SO2

5536
04:44:38,783 --> 04:44:40,575
Under the radar under the historical right

5537
04:44:42,623 --> 04:44:46,207
Archaeologist Barry cunliffe points out an interesting sort of ironic facts

5538
04:44:46,463 --> 04:44:49,791
You have your king Garrick's you're saying they're going to have to burn the cities of the Romans have

5539
04:44:50,047 --> 04:44:52,607
No high value targets and yet here they are

5540
04:44:52,863 --> 04:44:56,959
Going after high value targets anyway all of the major Encounters in this Rebellion

5541
04:44:57,215 --> 04:44:58,495
Will happen around cities

5542
04:44:59,007 --> 04:45:00,031
So what happened there

5543
04:45:00,287 --> 04:45:04,127
They should be burned down should they but each one sort of has an excuse for why it's still there

5544
04:45:05,407 --> 04:45:06,687
I'm very kind of points out

5545
04:45:07,199 --> 04:45:08,991
What sort of ironic is that

5546
04:45:09,247 --> 04:45:11,551
It's only in the parts of Gaul

5547
04:45:12,319 --> 04:45:16,415
Did it had significant contact with the Roman to become more Roman like

5548
04:45:16,927 --> 04:45:19,231
Did you have these sorts of cities

5549
04:45:19,487 --> 04:45:22,303
Are the Romans and Julius Caesar to Target to begin with

5550
04:45:22,815 --> 04:45:25,631
Why did you go to the less civilized amusing hair

5551
04:45:26,399 --> 04:45:32,031
Civilized tribal north of where the nerves VII in the belgae are and everything they don't even have Sundays

5552
04:45:33,055 --> 04:45:35,615
You're much more decentralised you going to have to chase the

5553
04:45:36,127 --> 04:45:38,943
Tribal people out of their little hearts and Into the Woods

5554
04:45:39,711 --> 04:45:41,759
But here you can almost treat these

5555
04:45:42,271 --> 04:45:45,087
Garlic States remember that's the way some translators

5556
04:45:45,343 --> 04:45:47,135
Translate it now not tribes but States

5557
04:45:47,391 --> 04:45:51,231
You can almost treat them the way you treat these states in the Eastern Greece

5558
04:45:51,487 --> 04:45:55,071
When the Romans go there they just go to the major population centers and take them

5559
04:45:55,327 --> 04:45:56,095
Warzone

5560
04:45:57,631 --> 04:46:01,727
Some of these Gauley tribes are becoming more like the Romans or the Romans can fight them more like

5561
04:46:01,983 --> 04:46:03,007
Their traditional enemy

5562
04:46:03,263 --> 04:46:05,823
They can go after basically the capitals of the states

5563
04:46:06,079 --> 04:46:07,103
Administrative Center

5564
04:46:07,615 --> 04:46:09,407
The tribal heart if you will

5565
04:46:11,455 --> 04:46:12,479
Carlos writes quote

5566
04:46:13,503 --> 04:46:19,647
In dealing with the more urbanized tribes of central Gall Caesars tactic was simply to pick off the pop

5567
04:46:19,903 --> 04:46:21,695
Population centers one by one

5568
04:46:22,207 --> 04:46:23,999
Such an approach would have been impossible

5569
04:46:24,255 --> 04:46:27,071
Among the tribes of America and belgica

5570
04:46:27,327 --> 04:46:29,887
With this degree of centralization had not yet developed

5571
04:46:30,399 --> 04:46:30,911
And quote

5572
04:46:32,191 --> 04:46:35,519
It's funny that knock on the Gauls is always been that they weren't able to work

5573
04:46:35,775 --> 04:46:36,287
Work together

5574
04:46:36,799 --> 04:46:37,311
+ 2

5575
04:46:37,567 --> 04:46:40,639
Take things to the next level developmentally speaking

5576
04:46:40,895 --> 04:46:41,663
Inform 3

5577
04:46:41,919 --> 04:46:43,967
Example more organized state

5578
04:46:46,015 --> 04:46:48,063
A John Heywood I think was the author that I read that.

5579
04:46:48,319 --> 04:46:51,391
Went the complete hundred 80 degrees on that theory and said that

5580
04:46:51,903 --> 04:46:57,023
What would have kept the Kell safer longer wish to be even more decentralized

5581
04:46:57,279 --> 04:46:59,327
And his theory if I remember correctly

5582
04:46:59,583 --> 04:47:00,351
Was that

5583
04:47:00,607 --> 04:47:01,887
And when the Romans faced

5584
04:47:02,399 --> 04:47:06,495
Other urbanized centers in other place is Egypt Greece any place like that

5585
04:47:06,751 --> 04:47:09,823
They would destroy those States in one or two battles because

5586
04:47:10,079 --> 04:47:15,199
The other centralized State brought all of its assets to one place in the Romans destroyed them there

5587
04:47:15,455 --> 04:47:16,479
But look how long

5588
04:47:16,991 --> 04:47:17,759
Again if I'm remembering

5589
04:47:18,271 --> 04:47:20,063
He said it took to defeat the Celts

5590
04:47:20,575 --> 04:47:24,927
And the various other people's of the Spanish and Portuguese area right of a

5591
04:47:25,183 --> 04:47:30,815
Lusitania and all there because those tribes were so divided and so decentralized you always had to keep

5592
04:47:31,071 --> 04:47:33,119
Going after another tribe it's an interesting Theory

5593
04:47:34,911 --> 04:47:37,727
But in this case the fact that there were even cities at all

5594
04:47:38,495 --> 04:47:39,007
4

5595
04:47:39,263 --> 04:47:40,031
Cesar to Target

5596
04:47:40,543 --> 04:47:41,567
Is a facet of

5597
04:47:42,079 --> 04:47:47,455
The Gauls becoming more and more like the Romans and by the way this is something seizure now portrays in his

5598
04:47:47,967 --> 04:47:49,759
Writings and it becomes a feature

5599
04:47:50,015 --> 04:47:54,367
Of what's going on in the longer the Romans are out here now fighting the Gaul Caesar says

5600
04:47:54,623 --> 04:47:56,415
The more the Gauls are imitating the wrong

5601
04:47:56,671 --> 04:47:59,231
Romans becoming even more dangerous or there's this now

5602
04:47:59,999 --> 04:48:01,791
Undercurrent of need

5603
04:48:02,815 --> 04:48:04,607
Not only are the Gauls perhaps

5604
04:48:04,863 --> 04:48:06,143
Worthy of becoming Romans if we

5605
04:48:06,399 --> 04:48:07,679
We just train them up a little bit but

5606
04:48:07,935 --> 04:48:10,495
The more contact they have with us the more like

5607
04:48:11,007 --> 04:48:13,567
Romans are becoming here in battle so we better hurry

5608
04:48:15,871 --> 04:48:20,991
Annovera come Caesar and the Romans will be unable because of

5609
04:48:21,247 --> 04:48:22,015
The fact that this

5610
04:48:22,271 --> 04:48:23,551
L4 disc

5611
04:48:24,063 --> 04:48:28,415
City on a giant Mesa is a good way to put it that's what these Hill forts that

5612
04:48:28,671 --> 04:48:29,183
Become

5613
04:48:29,439 --> 04:48:32,767
Hill towns that eventually Morphine to Hill City

5614
04:48:33,279 --> 04:48:34,047
In these more

5615
04:48:34,303 --> 04:48:38,399
Sophisticated garlic states are like right it's it's not a man made fish

5616
04:48:38,655 --> 04:48:39,167
Feature

5617
04:48:39,423 --> 04:48:40,447
It's something

5618
04:48:40,703 --> 04:48:43,519
What was the lines in The Lord of the Rings that has stood here

5619
04:48:43,775 --> 04:48:47,615
Since the dawn of time and then man put some fortifications on top of it

5620
04:48:48,127 --> 04:48:49,663
Avaricum has Marshall

5621
04:48:49,919 --> 04:48:50,687
Is all around

5622
04:48:50,943 --> 04:48:53,247
It's all the Romans can't do their normal

5623
04:48:53,503 --> 04:48:56,319
Practice of building a giant wall around the whole place be

5624
04:48:56,575 --> 04:48:57,599
Because we're going to build in the middle

5625
04:48:57,855 --> 04:48:58,367
Swamp

5626
04:48:59,647 --> 04:49:01,183
There's only one entrance to the place

5627
04:49:01,439 --> 04:49:02,463
So it looks like

5628
04:49:02,719 --> 04:49:08,095
If This Were A Golic besieging army they would be stymied but of course this is the Romans

5629
04:49:09,119 --> 04:49:09,887
Andover course

5630
04:49:10,143 --> 04:49:11,679
Almost 30 days

5631
04:49:12,191 --> 04:49:13,215
They build a

5632
04:49:13,727 --> 04:49:18,591
Counter Mountain maybe you could say it's hard to understand some of the sources talk about a ramp

5633
04:49:18,847 --> 04:49:20,639
Others talk about a mound

5634
04:49:20,895 --> 04:49:23,455
But essentially Caesar build something on one

5635
04:49:23,711 --> 04:49:24,479
Part of

5636
04:49:24,735 --> 04:49:27,551
One side of the fortification to equalize the height

5637
04:49:28,575 --> 04:49:31,647
And it takes the legionaries almost a month and it's like

5638
04:49:31,903 --> 04:49:33,695
400 ft long

5639
04:49:33,951 --> 04:49:35,999
About 80 ft High

5640
04:49:36,255 --> 04:49:41,631
And you just marvel at what the Romans are capable of doing and listen a lot of other ancient armies could too

5641
04:49:42,143 --> 04:49:43,679
When you have that many people

5642
04:49:43,935 --> 04:49:49,055
Involved in laboring for 10 hours a day 7 days a week you can get a lot done

5643
04:49:50,847 --> 04:49:53,919
Now the Romans while they're building this or under pressure because

5644
04:49:54,175 --> 04:49:57,503
There can get erect his strategy of scorched Earth is working

5645
04:49:57,759 --> 04:50:03,391
He's brought his army and he's keeping it 15 or 16 miles away from the Romans were building their Siege engines and

5646
04:50:03,647 --> 04:50:05,183
Creating this giant Mound or ramp

5647
04:50:05,695 --> 04:50:10,303
And they're picking off Roman stragglers as the Romans look for food and they're looking for food

5648
04:50:11,839 --> 04:50:12,607
Already this

5649
04:50:13,119 --> 04:50:16,447
Strategy is starting to bite as one of the historians on red footage

5650
04:50:17,215 --> 04:50:19,263
The scorched-earth strategy starting to bite

5651
04:50:20,031 --> 04:50:22,591
But the siege is working too and at one point Caesar says

5652
04:50:22,847 --> 04:50:25,663
The man in the Garrison decide they're going to try to slip out

5653
04:50:25,919 --> 04:50:28,991
Get severe can get erect his army live to fight another day

5654
04:50:29,247 --> 04:50:32,831
The problem is is that that town contains not just those Warriors

5655
04:50:33,087 --> 04:50:34,367
But their families too

5656
04:50:35,135 --> 04:50:37,695
And Caesar says their attempt to sneak out

5657
04:50:37,951 --> 04:50:42,815
You know without alerting the Romans was foiled when the women started screaming and crying

5658
04:50:43,583 --> 04:50:48,703
You know when they realized the men were leaving begging and beseeching them not to leave them to the Fate

5659
04:50:48,959 --> 04:50:50,751
A falling into the hands of the Romans

5660
04:50:52,287 --> 04:50:52,799
Soda

5661
04:50:53,055 --> 04:50:56,383
Screwed up their playing they alerted the enemy because they were so loud and

5662
04:50:57,407 --> 04:50:58,687
Warriors had to give up their ideas

5663
04:50:58,943 --> 04:50:59,455
You're slipping away

5664
04:51:00,479 --> 04:51:02,271
But it's an emotional reminder

5665
04:51:02,527 --> 04:51:03,807
Reason of the steaks you can get

5666
04:51:04,063 --> 04:51:04,831
Caught up in the

5667
04:51:05,087 --> 04:51:05,599
Did this happen

5668
04:51:06,623 --> 04:51:07,647
Bananas next year this

5669
04:51:08,159 --> 04:51:08,671
Forget that

5670
04:51:08,927 --> 04:51:10,975
No we have women and children screaming

5671
04:51:11,487 --> 04:51:13,023
Because they think their men are leaving

5672
04:51:13,535 --> 04:51:17,631
Because it's better to save at least the Warriors than to have everyone die right

5673
04:51:19,167 --> 04:51:23,007
Because that's what's going to happen when less than a month after The Siege started

5674
04:51:23,775 --> 04:51:24,287
After

5675
04:51:24,543 --> 04:51:26,847
A rainstorm begins and the Gauls

5676
04:51:27,359 --> 04:51:29,919
So don't lose their focus on one part of the wall for a second

5677
04:51:30,687 --> 04:51:32,991
The Romans take over the wall

5678
04:51:33,759 --> 04:51:39,647
Close off the city and you know they kind of point out of you ever been to like one of the old towns and some of these European cities

5679
04:51:40,159 --> 04:51:40,671
Stockholm

5680
04:51:40,927 --> 04:51:41,439
Examples

5681
04:51:41,951 --> 04:51:42,719
When you walk

5682
04:51:42,975 --> 04:51:43,743
Truitt you realize

5683
04:51:43,999 --> 04:51:46,047
How really narrow in Pence

5684
04:51:46,303 --> 04:51:48,351
Small all these old-fashioned

5685
04:51:48,863 --> 04:51:54,239
Medieval and ancient streets were in all the little side streets and how clogged they could be

5686
04:51:54,495 --> 04:51:57,311
If you like crowds of people trying to oh I don't know

5687
04:51:57,823 --> 04:52:00,639
Get away from pursuers at the same time

5688
04:52:01,151 --> 04:52:02,687
Caesar points out that every place gets

5689
04:52:02,943 --> 04:52:03,455
Choke

5690
04:52:03,711 --> 04:52:04,735
People trying to get away

5691
04:52:05,503 --> 04:52:06,527
Atlanta population

5692
04:52:06,783 --> 04:52:08,831
40000 Caesar says about 8

5693
04:52:09,087 --> 04:52:09,599
800

5694
04:52:10,111 --> 04:52:10,623
Survived

5695
04:52:13,695 --> 04:52:14,719
Man woman child

5696
04:52:14,975 --> 04:52:16,255
Old infirm Devery

5697
04:52:18,047 --> 04:52:18,559
And

5698
04:52:18,815 --> 04:52:20,607
Goldsworthy another's pulling out that

5699
04:52:20,863 --> 04:52:21,375
This might not

5700
04:52:21,631 --> 04:52:23,423
Have been part of Caesars plan

5701
04:52:23,679 --> 04:52:29,823
He will be very strategic as he sort of puts down this Rebellion who gets clemency and who gets out

5702
04:52:30,079 --> 04:52:31,359
Absolutely decimated

5703
04:52:31,871 --> 04:52:35,455
The important tribe that used to be friendly to the Roman Caesar tends to be kind of

5704
04:52:35,967 --> 04:52:36,735
Light-handed

5705
04:52:36,991 --> 04:52:37,503
That's right

5706
04:52:37,759 --> 04:52:40,063
Oh we're sorry you left you should come back to the room

5707
04:52:40,319 --> 04:52:41,599
But the people that have been

5708
04:52:41,855 --> 04:52:45,951
Nasty the whole time at the Romans have nothing too politically game with often are used at the

5709
04:52:46,207 --> 04:52:46,719
Examples

5710
04:52:48,255 --> 04:52:49,279
In this case though

5711
04:52:49,535 --> 04:52:52,095
Cesar is giving up a lot of money

5712
04:52:52,351 --> 04:52:54,655
When these people are being killed in the streets of America

5713
04:52:55,679 --> 04:52:57,471
And even these soldiers who stood

5714
04:52:57,727 --> 04:53:02,079
To get a cut right in my to gotten their own slave but they're busy killing the booty

5715
04:53:02,335 --> 04:53:03,871
In these narrow streets of this

5716
04:53:04,383 --> 04:53:05,407
Garlic town

5717
04:53:06,687 --> 04:53:08,735
In some of the historians goldsworthy's one of them I think

5718
04:53:08,991 --> 04:53:11,295
Made the suggestion that this might have been an army that

5719
04:53:11,551 --> 04:53:12,575
I was just so angry

5720
04:53:12,831 --> 04:53:15,135
For all sorts of reasons including the killing of that

5721
04:53:15,391 --> 04:53:18,207
The Roman businessmen in traders to kick-off this Rebellion

5722
04:53:18,463 --> 04:53:24,607
But they couldn't be controlled or were mad enough to think to hell with the money to hell with the slave to hell with the booty I'm killing these

5723
04:53:27,423 --> 04:53:27,935
And it's another

5724
04:53:29,215 --> 04:53:29,727
Tragedy

5725
04:53:30,239 --> 04:53:31,007
It goes into

5726
04:53:31,263 --> 04:53:32,287
Stomping Down Golf

5727
04:53:32,543 --> 04:53:33,055
Like resistance

5728
04:53:35,359 --> 04:53:39,967
Normally a disaster like a verican would have heard a war leaders reputation but Caesar

5729
04:53:40,479 --> 04:53:44,319
Suggest and it's not hard to believe that it actually helped American getaways

5730
04:53:45,599 --> 04:53:47,903
Because he had been one of the people that said

5731
04:53:48,159 --> 04:53:49,951
We should be burning this town down

5732
04:53:51,231 --> 04:53:52,255
And then when his

5733
04:53:52,511 --> 04:53:58,655
Advice wasn't chosen because he's not an absolute ruler in any sense of the word he should have chosen almost like an outside

5734
04:53:58,911 --> 04:54:02,751
Contractor if you want to look at it this way by these trying if they don't like his leadership they can Bolt

5735
04:54:03,007 --> 04:54:04,287
Singly or in groups

5736
04:54:05,567 --> 04:54:08,383
In this case he looks like he was in the right all along

5737
04:54:08,895 --> 04:54:10,175
So after their akum

5738
04:54:10,431 --> 04:54:14,015
Tagalog Army continues to harass and Shadow Caesars Romans

5739
04:54:14,527 --> 04:54:18,111
Remember Caesars Romans are the only Roman army here

5740
04:54:18,623 --> 04:54:22,719
So there's no other pincer that can come around and do stuff if Caesar want the

5741
04:54:22,975 --> 04:54:23,743
Do something

5742
04:54:23,999 --> 04:54:27,583
In two places at the same time he has to split the Army he's got

5743
04:54:28,095 --> 04:54:31,423
Which means if the Gauls could keep Caesar's Army set of occupied somewhere

5744
04:54:31,679 --> 04:54:37,823
They're free to move around and do things in every other area of the theater for example there can get a rich is continually sending it

5745
04:54:38,079 --> 04:54:40,895
His emissaries to all these other tribes that haven't joined the Rebellion yet

5746
04:54:41,919 --> 04:54:42,943
There's one in particular

5747
04:54:43,455 --> 04:54:45,247
It would transform the situation

5748
04:54:45,759 --> 04:54:47,551
If you can get a restricted flip them

5749
04:54:48,319 --> 04:54:48,831
It's this

5750
04:54:49,087 --> 04:54:51,391
Tried so close to the Roman the easy way

5751
04:54:52,159 --> 04:54:54,975
The ones who got us involved in the story to begin with that

5752
04:54:55,231 --> 04:54:57,535
So-called ruined efficacious is a

5753
04:54:57,791 --> 04:54:58,559
Member of the EU

5754
04:54:58,815 --> 04:54:59,583
Do we try bright

5755
04:55:00,863 --> 04:55:01,887
The reason that they're so important

5756
04:55:02,655 --> 04:55:05,471
Is because that's who's providing Caesars food right now

5757
04:55:06,239 --> 04:55:09,823
And regarding his food supply lines also with their Warrior

5758
04:55:10,335 --> 04:55:11,359
What would happen

5759
04:55:11,615 --> 04:55:12,383
If they flipped

5760
04:55:14,431 --> 04:55:16,223
Fast forward to what's going on

5761
04:55:16,479 --> 04:55:16,991
Caesar

5762
04:55:17,503 --> 04:55:18,783
And this garlic army or soda

5763
04:55:19,039 --> 04:55:20,063
Shadowing each other

5764
04:55:20,575 --> 04:55:22,111
I can get Eric takes his army

5765
04:55:22,367 --> 04:55:24,927
I've been to some hills around this

5766
04:55:25,695 --> 04:55:30,047
But call it a very large Hill or a mini Mountain

5767
04:55:30,559 --> 04:55:32,095
And it's very top hits

5768
04:55:32,351 --> 04:55:33,631
2400 +

5769
04:55:33,887 --> 04:55:35,423
What's feet above the ground level

5770
04:55:35,679 --> 04:55:37,471
And this is another

5771
04:55:37,727 --> 04:55:41,055
Garlick Hill City or Hilltown or fortified

5772
04:55:41,311 --> 04:55:42,079
Whatever

5773
04:55:42,335 --> 04:55:43,871
Definition you want to use

5774
04:55:44,383 --> 04:55:49,503
And once again there's an excuse why it escaped burning this is very can get a rix's

5775
04:55:50,015 --> 04:55:50,527
Tribal cap

5776
04:55:51,039 --> 04:55:51,807
This is his home

5777
04:55:52,063 --> 04:55:52,575
Basically

5778
04:55:53,087 --> 04:55:57,439
So maybe it's a do as I say not as I do situation you all burn down your town but I'm not

5779
04:55:57,951 --> 04:55:58,463
Mine

5780
04:55:59,487 --> 04:56:00,511
Or maybe

5781
04:56:00,767 --> 04:56:02,303
This place was so easily.

5782
04:56:02,559 --> 04:56:03,839
Offended and so hard to take

5783
04:56:04,095 --> 04:56:05,119
Did beer can get a restarting

5784
04:56:05,375 --> 04:56:07,423
The place he could pin Caesar down

5785
04:56:07,679 --> 04:56:09,727
While he destroyed his Supply

5786
04:56:10,495 --> 04:56:11,519
And by getting

5787
04:56:11,775 --> 04:56:13,311
This friendly tribe

5788
04:56:13,567 --> 04:56:15,871
It was providing seizures food to flip

5789
04:56:16,639 --> 04:56:17,407
Caesars in terrible

5790
04:56:17,663 --> 04:56:20,479
Trouble camped out in front of this city called your govea

5791
04:56:21,247 --> 04:56:22,271
And you're govea

5792
04:56:22,527 --> 04:56:24,831
Is normally considered II begin count

5793
04:56:25,599 --> 04:56:26,111
One of the bean

5794
04:56:26,367 --> 04:56:26,879
3

5795
04:56:27,135 --> 04:56:28,927
As part of these garlic Wars

5796
04:56:29,951 --> 04:56:31,231
It's also one

5797
04:56:31,487 --> 04:56:33,279
Were you have to take Caesar

5798
04:56:33,535 --> 04:56:38,655
But even less face value because this is not the high-water mark of Caesar's generalship

5799
04:56:39,423 --> 04:56:43,007
And so for a piece of propaganda like these War commentaries

5800
04:56:43,519 --> 04:56:48,639
If you're ever going to shade the truth and try to make yourself look better and spend things this is going to be the play

5801
04:56:48,895 --> 04:56:49,407
Place where you do

5802
04:56:50,431 --> 04:56:54,015
Normally seizure would look at a place like this and think let's starve it out

5803
04:56:54,527 --> 04:56:58,367
But given the supply situation he be more likely with his army to starve

5804
04:56:58,623 --> 04:57:00,927
Before the people in your govea did

5805
04:57:02,975 --> 04:57:05,535
What's more seizures a little light on troops at this point

5806
04:57:06,559 --> 04:57:08,863
Just one of the moves that some have criticized over the

5807
04:57:09,119 --> 04:57:09,631
Ciara's butt

5808
04:57:10,143 --> 04:57:13,727
We told you earlier Caesar needs to things done simultaneously

5809
04:57:13,983 --> 04:57:18,335
In different places he doesn't have another Army in Romy can call on hands to split his own

5810
04:57:18,847 --> 04:57:22,431
And before this battle The Siege at your go via he does

5811
04:57:22,943 --> 04:57:25,247
And sends out about 40% of his forces

5812
04:57:25,503 --> 04:57:29,087
To go handle something involving a couple of other tribes that need a good thrashing

5813
04:57:30,111 --> 04:57:31,391
But it means that you're going to be there not

5814
04:57:31,647 --> 04:57:32,159
There

5815
04:57:32,671 --> 04:57:33,951
So when you start considering

5816
04:57:34,207 --> 04:57:38,303
Oh maybe enclosing an entire mini Mountain

5817
04:57:38,815 --> 04:57:40,863
With walls and fences and

5818
04:57:41,119 --> 04:57:43,423
Things to cut it off from the outside world

5819
04:57:43,679 --> 04:57:47,007
And you look at your six Legions you may be thinking to yourself I really don't have

5820
04:57:47,263 --> 04:57:47,775
Enough people for that

5821
04:57:48,031 --> 04:57:48,543
Second strategy

5822
04:57:48,799 --> 04:57:49,311
Right now

5823
04:57:51,359 --> 04:57:53,407
A describing sieges is always differ

5824
04:57:53,919 --> 04:57:58,271
So I'll just use these these rough ideas but basically when Caesar gets there and sees what he's up against

5825
04:57:58,783 --> 04:57:59,807
He starts nibbling

5826
04:58:00,063 --> 04:58:01,855
Terrain features nearby that will help

5827
04:58:02,111 --> 04:58:03,647
He'll nearby

5828
04:58:03,903 --> 04:58:10,047
Where he takes that little Hill that the Gauls haven't really defended it'll be harder for the gulf to get water so becomes his little game

5829
04:58:10,303 --> 04:58:12,095
Of nibbling on terrain features

5830
04:58:12,863 --> 04:58:17,471
Building camps doing all this other stuff and then while he's doing it he gets word

5831
04:58:17,983 --> 04:58:19,775
That the easy we have flipped

5832
04:58:20,287 --> 04:58:23,103
And at the baggage in his rear is compromised

5833
04:58:23,615 --> 04:58:26,431
And the food may not be arriving so he takes a large

5834
04:58:26,687 --> 04:58:29,503
Portion of the legions he's working with a jerk over yet

5835
04:58:29,759 --> 04:58:34,367
And goes down to deal with the problem with the supply lines and while he's gone

5836
04:58:35,135 --> 04:58:41,279
Supposedly they're can get erection the Warriors come out of the the heights down the hill and attack this Roman

5837
04:58:41,535 --> 04:58:42,047
Camp

5838
04:58:42,559 --> 04:58:47,423
Roman Camp built for like six Legions but now only defended by two

5839
04:58:47,935 --> 04:58:49,727
Would you can see would make it difficult

5840
04:58:50,751 --> 04:58:53,567
Caesar gets word of this when he's on his way back

5841
04:58:53,823 --> 04:58:56,895
I'm dealing with the supply line problems with like four Legions

5842
04:58:57,407 --> 04:59:01,247
And when he gets to the Campisi's that they have managed to beat off the assault with her

5843
04:59:01,503 --> 04:59:04,063
Artillery and all kinds of things but they're if they're in a bad way

5844
04:59:05,855 --> 04:59:07,391
Procedure devices this strategy

5845
04:59:07,647 --> 04:59:09,439
He's going to faint an attack

5846
04:59:09,695 --> 04:59:10,719
On one side

5847
04:59:10,975 --> 04:59:15,583
Get all the Celtic warriors to go to that side of the top of the Mesa of the Hill Ford

5848
04:59:15,839 --> 04:59:19,935
And then Caesar will attack on the on the far side that's now abandon with some more troops

5849
04:59:20,447 --> 04:59:21,471
So he set this up

5850
04:59:21,727 --> 04:59:24,031
Eventually gets to the point where the Gauls take the bait

5851
04:59:24,287 --> 04:59:27,615
They all come to the one side of the Mesa to deal with seizures faint

5852
04:59:27,871 --> 04:59:29,407
Caesar sends his Legions around the

5853
04:59:29,663 --> 04:59:31,967
Supposedly now undefended other side

5854
04:59:32,223 --> 04:59:34,527
They start doing real well they get through the

5855
04:59:34,783 --> 04:59:40,159
The main wall they're starting to cut up some of the camp in the women in the children that I mean maybe this is going to win

5856
04:59:40,671 --> 04:59:45,279
And then the Celtic warriors that have been drawn off to the other side of the Mesa by The Faint

5857
04:59:45,791 --> 04:59:46,303
Come back

5858
04:59:47,071 --> 04:59:47,583
And math

5859
04:59:50,655 --> 04:59:54,239
There can get a raise himself might have led the cavalry charge

5860
04:59:55,007 --> 04:59:57,311
That sent the Romans careening

5861
04:59:57,823 --> 04:59:59,359
Back down the hill

5862
04:59:59,871 --> 05:00:06,015
Caesar will get together a bunch of Legion that are not involved at the bottom somewhere near the bottom of the hill so that his own

5863
05:00:06,271 --> 05:00:08,063
Don't troops can then hide behind them and

5864
05:00:08,319 --> 05:00:12,159
His new troops that are uninvolved in the combat can ward off the pursuing

5865
05:00:12,415 --> 05:00:12,927
Celts

5866
05:00:13,439 --> 05:00:15,231
Cesar Chavez will admit to

5867
05:00:15,743 --> 05:00:17,279
Like 700 dead legionaries

5868
05:00:17,535 --> 05:00:19,839
Is between 40 and 50 of these people are century

5869
05:00:21,631 --> 05:00:23,423
There's been an interesting debate you can read

5870
05:00:23,935 --> 05:00:27,007
On whether or not this is the Roman habit of ink

5871
05:00:27,263 --> 05:00:28,031
Encouraging

5872
05:00:28,543 --> 05:00:34,687
Well conspicuous bravery would be one way of putting it if you wanted to spend it one way reckless endangerment

5873
05:00:34,943 --> 05:00:36,991
For personal gain might be another

5874
05:00:37,503 --> 05:00:40,831
But Caesar kind of blames that a little bit at the same time

5875
05:00:41,343 --> 05:00:43,903
Xi jinping encouraging this kind of audacity

5876
05:00:44,159 --> 05:00:44,927
Forever

5877
05:00:45,183 --> 05:00:48,511
You know where these legionary in their centurions are rewarded for

5878
05:00:48,767 --> 05:00:53,119
Throwing themselves into the breach and being extra tough and extra aggressive

5879
05:00:53,375 --> 05:00:58,751
In this case Caesar says that one point these Gauls will be throwing these dead Romans

5880
05:00:59,263 --> 05:01:05,407
Over the walls head-first and Caesar will name at least one of these dead Romans being

5881
05:01:05,663 --> 05:01:06,431
Thrown over

5882
05:01:06,687 --> 05:01:07,711
The wall by the

5883
05:01:07,967 --> 05:01:09,759
Celtic warriors who killed him by name

5884
05:01:10,527 --> 05:01:11,551
So you know the guy

5885
05:01:12,319 --> 05:01:14,623
So you're seeing thrown over the walls dead I mean it

5886
05:01:15,135 --> 05:01:21,279
It sounds like it was a nasty situation to some historians have suggested the casualties could be a great deal higher than Caesar was admitting to

5887
05:01:22,815 --> 05:01:24,351
The military setback that

5888
05:01:24,607 --> 05:01:26,399
Cesar suppers at your govea

5889
05:01:27,423 --> 05:01:29,983
Combined with the losing

5890
05:01:30,751 --> 05:01:33,055
Of the Eataly tribe to the Rebellion

5891
05:01:33,823 --> 05:01:35,359
Begins to flip yet more try

5892
05:01:35,615 --> 05:01:37,919
Tampa science how quickly this is happening

5893
05:01:38,431 --> 05:01:41,247
Everything were talking about he was happening in 52 BCE

5894
05:01:42,015 --> 05:01:45,855
Normally when you think of this. You think of an era of almost glacial

5895
05:01:46,879 --> 05:01:47,391
Operation

5896
05:01:49,183 --> 05:01:51,487
Army is advancing or sieges rndc just

5897
05:01:51,743 --> 05:01:52,255
Years

5898
05:01:52,767 --> 05:01:54,047
All of this is happening in 50

5899
05:01:54,303 --> 05:01:54,815
B2

5900
05:01:55,071 --> 05:01:56,095
Which shows you how

5901
05:01:56,351 --> 05:01:57,887
Quickly events are unfolding

5902
05:01:59,167 --> 05:02:01,983
And by the way Caesar was not given conventional dates

5903
05:02:02,495 --> 05:02:06,591
So you could say that all this stuff happened in this one year but you don't know when sometimes

5904
05:02:06,847 --> 05:02:08,639
He'll give you an inkling of a Caesar

5905
05:02:09,151 --> 05:02:09,919
Rise you can say what this happen

5906
05:02:10,431 --> 05:02:11,199
In the winter or this happened

5907
05:02:11,455 --> 05:02:12,479
In the spring or what have you

5908
05:02:13,247 --> 05:02:14,015
But most

5909
05:02:14,271 --> 05:02:17,343
Armies I can think of from the ancient. Well up

5910
05:02:17,599 --> 05:02:19,135
Mean to almost the modern era

5911
05:02:19,903 --> 05:02:22,975
Would have a hard time dealing with the speed of something going this fast

5912
05:02:23,487 --> 05:02:24,767
I keep trying to imagine

5913
05:02:25,023 --> 05:02:28,095
Are European armies from the Middle Ages trying to crush this Revolt this

5914
05:02:28,351 --> 05:02:28,863
This quickly

5915
05:02:29,375 --> 05:02:30,655
Part of it of course is wrong

5916
05:02:30,911 --> 05:02:31,935
But the other part is

5917
05:02:32,703 --> 05:02:34,751
And what sort of Bad Karma clock

5918
05:02:35,007 --> 05:02:38,591
Did the Gauls have that this happened that they get one of the great generals

5919
05:02:38,847 --> 05:02:40,127
In all human history

5920
05:02:40,383 --> 05:02:45,503
And a guy at the top of his resume when he's bragging about his god-given qualities is going to put

5921
05:02:46,015 --> 05:02:48,063
Speed and decisiveness of movement

5922
05:02:49,343 --> 05:02:51,647
As if the Celts already didn't have enough

5923
05:02:52,159 --> 05:02:55,743
You're going against them in this deal between the technology and the

5924
05:02:55,999 --> 05:03:00,607
Your lack of centralization all the things we've been talking about they got to get this guy at this time to

5925
05:03:02,143 --> 05:03:03,935
In fact it's worse than just that

5926
05:03:04,447 --> 05:03:08,799
Caesar's political antenna as you might imagine from a guy holding his feels

5927
05:03:09,055 --> 05:03:12,127
In the Rome of the late Republic are exquisite

5928
05:03:12,895 --> 05:03:15,967
And his ability to read the proper way to respond

5929
05:03:16,223 --> 05:03:18,271
Did these tribes in order to play them

5930
05:03:18,527 --> 05:03:20,063
As much as he can

5931
05:03:20,575 --> 05:03:22,879
In a like it musical instrument is crazy

5932
05:03:23,391 --> 05:03:29,279
If some tribe get clemency others get wiped out and you got to know how to play this game to keep most of them in your camper at least

5933
05:03:29,791 --> 05:03:35,935
The 49% of the try maybe that wishes they were in your camp but are currently in the minority you think of

5934
05:03:36,191 --> 05:03:37,471
About guys coming from

5935
05:03:37,727 --> 05:03:40,543
Tiara Caesar was born in Marius and sulla

5936
05:03:41,055 --> 05:03:44,383
They might have been equally successful in destroying these garlic armies

5937
05:03:45,151 --> 05:03:48,479
But I imagine Caesars going to look like a great being

5938
05:03:48,735 --> 05:03:49,247
Softer

5939
05:03:49,759 --> 05:03:55,391
When it comes to the genocide of the Holocaust were talking about if it's Marius or sell Edition out the Punisher

5940
05:03:57,695 --> 05:03:58,463
Baby everything

5941
05:03:58,719 --> 05:03:59,743
When we talk about these

5942
05:03:59,999 --> 05:04:01,279
Historical genocides

5943
05:04:01,535 --> 05:04:03,839
Crimes against humanity and all these modern terms

5944
05:04:04,351 --> 05:04:06,399
Maybe they all need to be graded on

5945
05:04:06,655 --> 05:04:07,423
Kirby

5946
05:04:09,727 --> 05:04:11,263
None of us at this point in the story

5947
05:04:12,031 --> 05:04:13,823
This is about the low water mark

5948
05:04:14,079 --> 05:04:17,407
Caesars entire career and most of the generals would be toasted

5949
05:04:19,967 --> 05:04:20,479
Remember now

5950
05:04:21,247 --> 05:04:24,575
This is an army seizures that was already feeling the bite

5951
05:04:24,831 --> 05:04:26,111
Of the scorched-earth policy

5952
05:04:26,367 --> 05:04:28,927
He was not doing all that great to begin with

5953
05:04:29,439 --> 05:04:32,255
The military setback at your goby is not huge in the military

5954
05:04:32,511 --> 05:04:34,303
Since the Romans can suck up those casual

5955
05:04:35,071 --> 05:04:36,351
But in a political sentence

5956
05:04:37,119 --> 05:04:37,887
Separatist Orion

5957
05:04:38,143 --> 05:04:42,751
Roman invincibility more tribes join the Rebellion

5958
05:04:43,007 --> 05:04:44,031
But bigger than that

5959
05:04:44,543 --> 05:04:46,335
Is the flipping of these we try

5960
05:04:46,847 --> 05:04:49,151
For all sorts of reasons but just look at one of them

5961
05:04:50,175 --> 05:04:56,319
The E do we control Rome's administrative base in Gaul their storage locker if you will

5962
05:04:56,831 --> 05:05:00,927
Where they put all their stuff while they're traipsing around Gall at the city called noviodunum

5963
05:05:01,439 --> 05:05:02,719
And when we do we flip

5964
05:05:02,975 --> 05:05:04,511
They take noviodunum

5965
05:05:04,767 --> 05:05:05,279
With them

5966
05:05:06,303 --> 05:05:07,327
Then they Sackett

5967
05:05:07,583 --> 05:05:10,399
Almost as if they were conquering their own City

5968
05:05:10,655 --> 05:05:12,703
So that they can keep it out of the Romans

5969
05:05:13,215 --> 05:05:14,239
What did it have in it

5970
05:05:14,751 --> 05:05:15,263
Here's

5971
05:05:15,519 --> 05:05:16,287
Historian

5972
05:05:16,543 --> 05:05:18,847
Nick Fields talking about noviodunum

5973
05:05:19,103 --> 05:05:19,871
And its importance

5974
05:05:20,127 --> 05:05:20,639
The Caesar

5975
05:05:21,407 --> 05:05:21,919
Quote

5976
05:05:22,687 --> 05:05:25,247
Here were to be found all his gaulish hostages

5977
05:05:25,759 --> 05:05:29,343
His brain reserved his War chest remounts for his cavalry

5978
05:05:29,599 --> 05:05:31,135
And the best part of the army bag

5979
05:05:31,647 --> 05:05:32,671
Epor rhetoric

5980
05:05:32,927 --> 05:05:33,951
Indira Damaris

5981
05:05:34,207 --> 05:05:39,583
Too young Chieftains of the E do we turned on the Roman Garrison at noviodunum and slaughtered them

5982
05:05:39,839 --> 05:05:41,631
Together with the Traders gathered there

5983
05:05:41,887 --> 05:05:48,031
Release the hostages divided the money and carried as much grain as they could transport and dump the Romaine

5984
05:05:48,287 --> 05:05:48,799
Thunder in the river

5985
05:05:49,055 --> 05:05:50,079
Hand torch the town

5986
05:05:50,591 --> 05:05:51,103
And quote

5987
05:05:52,383 --> 05:05:54,175
Fields actually said APA done which is the

5988
05:05:54,431 --> 05:05:55,711
Word for garlic town

5989
05:05:56,735 --> 05:05:57,759
The point is think about

5990
05:05:58,015 --> 05:06:00,063
This from the Golic perspective

5991
05:06:00,319 --> 05:06:03,647
This is an Apache raid the successful

5992
05:06:03,903 --> 05:06:07,743
And it takes an enemy who's already reeling from jerr govea

5993
05:06:07,999 --> 05:06:12,607
And stab them in the back I mean this is a huge moment from a native perspective here

5994
05:06:13,119 --> 05:06:18,239
And the potential ramifications that become possible now Caesars defeat in the distance

5995
05:06:19,007 --> 05:06:23,871
Well that's a chance that the Native American tribes never had even if they had

5996
05:06:24,127 --> 05:06:25,151
Gone after the

5997
05:06:25,407 --> 05:06:30,015
You're very early settlements in Virginia and places like that could they have wiped them out forever

5998
05:06:30,271 --> 05:06:30,783
Could they have

5999
05:06:31,295 --> 05:06:34,623
How do Europeans draw a line and say we're not Crossing this ocean anymore

6000
05:06:35,135 --> 05:06:37,183
Because you can't live on the other side the natives will kill you

6001
05:06:37,439 --> 05:06:42,303
Same thing with Africa it was just too late in technology since the odds were too one-sided

6002
05:06:42,815 --> 05:06:43,583
Look at this here

6003
05:06:44,863 --> 05:06:47,167
This is an opportunity for the tribal people to win

6004
05:06:47,679 --> 05:06:48,447
Caesars in trouble

6005
05:06:50,239 --> 05:06:51,007
Think about what you say

6006
05:06:51,519 --> 05:06:52,543
Having the hostages.

6007
05:06:53,311 --> 05:06:54,847
For a change in power and authority

6008
05:06:55,615 --> 05:06:57,151
Here Caesar had been keeping the

6009
05:06:57,407 --> 05:07:02,783
Your sons and daughters of the powerful and important people of all these garlic tribes he hoped to keep under his thumb

6010
05:07:03,039 --> 05:07:05,855
And now all of a sudden they fall into the hands of the rebels

6011
05:07:06,623 --> 05:07:07,135
The corset

6012
05:07:07,391 --> 05:07:08,415
Rebels can do any number of things

6013
05:07:08,927 --> 05:07:10,463
Right they could be magnanimous

6014
05:07:10,719 --> 05:07:15,327
Give them back to these other goalie tribes and say Seagal stick together and by the way you owe me a favor

6015
05:07:16,351 --> 05:07:18,399
Also if they wanted to play hardball say something like

6016
05:07:18,655 --> 05:07:21,471
Caesar doesn't have your children anymore we do

6017
05:07:21,983 --> 05:07:23,775
So you're joining the Rebellion right

6018
05:07:25,567 --> 05:07:26,591
Turn the last now that

6019
05:07:26,847 --> 05:07:31,199
The EDI we are on board we are told that beer can get erect at now with big tribal meet

6020
05:07:32,223 --> 05:07:33,247
And in this meeting

6021
05:07:33,503 --> 05:07:37,343
The EDI we are apart of it they actually make it play for the leadership at their SmackDown

6022
05:07:38,111 --> 05:07:40,671
And almost all the other tribes in Gaul

6023
05:07:41,183 --> 05:07:42,207
Plutarch says that they were like

6024
05:07:42,463 --> 05:07:46,815
300 tribes are states that Caesar subdued I can't believe it's anywhere near that many

6025
05:07:47,327 --> 05:07:52,703
Some of these may have been really really small but let's just say it's a hundred 150 Caesar says he's got like two

6026
05:07:53,215 --> 05:07:54,239
That still support him

6027
05:07:54,751 --> 05:07:58,079
Severe can get erect has this big meeting with all the other tribes the Giant

6028
05:07:58,335 --> 05:07:59,871
Pangola Council

6029
05:08:00,383 --> 05:08:01,407
And you do Wonder

6030
05:08:01,919 --> 05:08:03,455
Is say the Native Americans

6031
05:08:03,711 --> 05:08:09,855
Or some of these other people who are victims of colonial Conquest ever were able to get all of their people together in one place

6032
05:08:10,111 --> 05:08:14,975
Who are the representatives of them and also to try to unite and speak with one voice

6033
05:08:15,743 --> 05:08:17,535
This is an amazing thing when you think about it

6034
05:08:17,791 --> 05:08:18,559
All of Gaul

6035
05:08:18,815 --> 05:08:19,583
With the exception of

6036
05:08:19,839 --> 05:08:22,399
Apple tribes are United against Caesar in Caesars in trouble

6037
05:08:23,423 --> 05:08:24,447
This is a historic moment

6038
05:08:26,495 --> 05:08:27,775
He's basically cut off

6039
05:08:28,031 --> 05:08:30,335
From getting new troops in Italy at this point

6040
05:08:30,591 --> 05:08:36,735
And remember the Romans don't use their own Cavalry anymore what do they use while local Allied troops

6041
05:08:37,247 --> 05:08:39,551
Who's that lied to the Romans now

6042
05:08:40,063 --> 05:08:44,415
So Caesars got an issue where did he get his Cavalry from well this is where we find out

6043
05:08:45,439 --> 05:08:47,231
You know those who enjoy

6044
05:08:47,487 --> 05:08:51,327
Little teeny tactical things on the battlefield that end up having perhaps

6045
05:08:51,583 --> 05:08:54,399
Huge effects on History love this part of the story

6046
05:08:54,911 --> 05:08:56,191
But this is where we find out

6047
05:08:56,447 --> 05:08:59,263
The seizures been making friends on the other side of the Rhine

6048
05:08:59,775 --> 05:09:02,079
What does German people that you can't House break

6049
05:09:02,591 --> 05:09:03,103
You can't

6050
05:09:03,359 --> 05:09:07,967
You can incorporate you can't assimilate but if you need the Cavalry bad enough you can maybe

6051
05:09:08,479 --> 05:09:09,247
Work out a deal

6052
05:09:10,783 --> 05:09:11,807
Caesar starts bringing

6053
05:09:12,063 --> 05:09:12,575
This

6054
05:09:13,343 --> 05:09:16,927
Friendly German Cavalry from some of these tribes Maybe

6055
05:09:17,183 --> 05:09:21,023
That were the enemies of the people Caesar was beating up on in Germany

6056
05:09:21,535 --> 05:09:23,327
And we hear their appearance and it's

6057
05:09:23,839 --> 05:09:25,887
Bedeviled take more games

6058
05:09:27,167 --> 05:09:28,959
Most wargaming rules

6059
05:09:29,215 --> 05:09:32,799
Twin talking about this German Cavalry in this. Gave it

6060
05:09:33,055 --> 05:09:33,823
Special powers

6061
05:09:34,591 --> 05:09:36,639
Especially special powers

6062
05:09:36,895 --> 05:09:38,175
/ Celtic troops

6063
05:09:38,687 --> 05:09:39,455
You know why

6064
05:09:39,711 --> 05:09:41,503
Because the Celtic troops were scared of them

6065
05:09:43,039 --> 05:09:46,623
These are the same kinds of forces remember that Caesar had noticed

6066
05:09:47,135 --> 05:09:47,903
And driven off

6067
05:09:48,415 --> 05:09:51,487
Many more times their number in garlic Cavalry earlier

6068
05:09:52,255 --> 05:09:54,303
So what's going on you know when we talk about

6069
05:09:54,815 --> 05:09:55,839
Intimidation

6070
05:09:56,351 --> 05:09:57,887
For all these qualities that are

6071
05:09:58,143 --> 05:09:59,423
Hard to quantify

6072
05:09:59,935 --> 05:10:06,079
What do you get when you take 400 German Cavalry which is not enough to make a big difference anywhere in these

6073
05:10:06,335 --> 05:10:06,847
Size battles

6074
05:10:07,103 --> 05:10:08,127
And they dominate

6075
05:10:09,407 --> 05:10:11,711
What kind of Superman are we talking about here

6076
05:10:12,223 --> 05:10:16,319
And people have wondered ever since now we can go into the unquantifiable things but they are of course

6077
05:10:16,831 --> 05:10:17,855
Unquantifiable

6078
05:10:18,367 --> 05:10:21,439
You could talk about the fact that these Germans had a way

6079
05:10:21,695 --> 05:10:25,279
Of utilizing infantry with the Cavalry so they have

6080
05:10:25,535 --> 05:10:29,375
One light infantrymen to go with one Calvary men and they were supposed to operate together

6081
05:10:29,631 --> 05:10:31,167
And the light infantrymen supposedly

6082
05:10:31,423 --> 05:10:36,799
Hold on to the manes of these horses they rode into battle and it would almost act like a night with his squire

6083
05:10:37,567 --> 05:10:38,079
And at this

6084
05:10:38,335 --> 05:10:41,919
Combined Arms Mobile infantry formation with

6085
05:10:42,175 --> 05:10:42,943
Unique and

6086
05:10:43,199 --> 05:10:43,967
Deadly

6087
05:10:45,247 --> 05:10:46,271
They're also

6088
05:10:46,527 --> 05:10:51,391
Some theories that these Germans weren't just your average German Warrior but this is more like

6089
05:10:51,903 --> 05:10:53,951
You know a bunch of German adventurers

6090
05:10:54,207 --> 05:10:59,583
And it's like the Magnificent Seven or something but it's the Magnificent 400 or later maybe 600 in there all these

6091
05:11:00,095 --> 05:11:01,887
You know badass German Seether

6092
05:11:02,143 --> 05:11:03,935
Germans who make other German scare

6093
05:11:04,191 --> 05:11:08,799
So you might be that kind of a deal that explains why they're so dominating on the battlefield

6094
05:11:09,311 --> 05:11:13,151
Once again it's kind of confusing isn't it why Caesar who's writing this propaganda piece

6095
05:11:13,407 --> 05:11:15,199
Please Roman audience blah blah blah

6096
05:11:15,455 --> 05:11:16,223
Why is he

6097
05:11:16,479 --> 05:11:19,807
Saying such nice things about the Germans and giving them so much credit

6098
05:11:21,343 --> 05:11:22,879
Hard to figure out especially for an onyx

6099
05:11:23,391 --> 05:11:24,159
Like yours truly

6100
05:11:24,415 --> 05:11:27,487
All I can say is that in a number of different encounters

6101
05:11:27,999 --> 05:11:30,303
These Germans are going to make all the difference in the world in fact

6102
05:11:30,559 --> 05:11:33,887
The reason that we're going to have the climactic battle

6103
05:11:34,143 --> 05:11:35,167
This great

6104
05:11:35,679 --> 05:11:36,703
Spare pump

6105
05:11:36,959 --> 05:11:41,823
Right that's what the German general say this this climactic intense decide the whole War

6106
05:11:42,079 --> 05:11:44,127
In a situation in this one city

6107
05:11:44,895 --> 05:11:48,735
Is maybe because this German Cavalry turn the tide at a battle

6108
05:11:49,247 --> 05:11:53,343
Revere can get erection assembled all the dang Cavalry could get his hands on price

6109
05:11:55,135 --> 05:11:58,975
Tell the other tribes he didn't want any infantry he already had 80,000

6110
05:11:59,743 --> 05:12:02,303
Many historians will point out 80 thousand is a lot to

6111
05:12:02,559 --> 05:12:03,327
Speed already

6112
05:12:03,839 --> 05:12:05,887
And at this point in the story and again

6113
05:12:06,143 --> 05:12:07,423
You got to love the way these things work

6114
05:12:08,447 --> 05:12:14,591
Dirty ghetto resume want that infantry more as a way to hold some of these tribes hostage we got your Warrior

6115
05:12:14,847 --> 05:12:16,639
Be good right don't flip back to the Romans

6116
05:12:17,151 --> 05:12:19,455
But at this late stage in the garlic

6117
05:12:19,967 --> 05:12:22,783
In a military development it's their Cavalry that's everything

6118
05:12:23,807 --> 05:12:29,439
And Caesar will end up re hooking up with those forces that he had sent away to do other things before your govea

6119
05:12:29,695 --> 05:12:30,975
They will start to March

6120
05:12:31,231 --> 05:12:34,815
In a direction that looks like maybe they're leaving

6121
05:12:36,351 --> 05:12:38,399
And this is where maybe verican Garrix

6122
05:12:38,911 --> 05:12:39,423
Confused

6123
05:12:39,935 --> 05:12:40,959
Lot of the different histories

6124
05:12:41,471 --> 05:12:42,239
Portray this

6125
05:12:42,495 --> 05:12:43,519
As an attempt

6126
05:12:43,775 --> 05:12:44,287
2

6127
05:12:44,799 --> 05:12:47,871
Attack the Romans as the Romans March away

6128
05:12:48,383 --> 05:12:53,247
There can get erections put 15000 Cavalry were told together

6129
05:12:53,503 --> 05:12:59,647
All of whom have pledged to not go home to their wives and children or anything unless they have ridden twice through the ROM

6130
05:12:59,903 --> 05:13:00,671
How many column

6131
05:13:01,183 --> 05:13:03,231
Attack these Romans on the March

6132
05:13:04,767 --> 05:13:09,631
And the German Cavalry working in conjunction with the legionaries once again Saves the Day

6133
05:13:11,167 --> 05:13:11,679
And

6134
05:13:12,191 --> 05:13:12,959
Sends

6135
05:13:13,215 --> 05:13:14,495
There can get her ex and his

6136
05:13:14,751 --> 05:13:20,895
Counseling reeling back towards the first place to Rally which is this Garlic City once again remarkably under

6137
05:13:21,151 --> 05:13:22,175
Untouched by flames

6138
05:13:22,943 --> 05:13:23,711
Call Delicia

6139
05:13:26,015 --> 05:13:27,295
Caesar says by the way that he

6140
05:13:27,551 --> 05:13:29,343
Pursues Tagalog Army so close

6141
05:13:30,111 --> 05:13:31,647
He kills 3000 members

6142
05:13:31,903 --> 05:13:32,671
Their rear guard

6143
05:13:33,439 --> 05:13:34,975
They try to cover the armies were

6144
05:13:35,231 --> 05:13:35,743
Retreat into

6145
05:13:36,767 --> 05:13:37,535
Hilltown Tavern

6146
05:13:38,559 --> 05:13:39,071
You can say Alicia

6147
05:13:40,095 --> 05:13:40,607
Able to

6148
05:13:42,911 --> 05:13:43,423
This is a tip

6149
05:13:43,679 --> 05:13:45,215
Typical Golic Hilltown in the Sun

6150
05:13:46,495 --> 05:13:49,055
Protected by natural features to make it pretty tough

6151
05:13:49,311 --> 05:13:49,823
Have to take

6152
05:13:52,383 --> 05:13:53,919
Michael and Sage says it is

6153
05:13:54,943 --> 05:13:55,711
Plateau

6154
05:13:56,223 --> 05:13:56,991
Near Dijon

6155
05:13:58,015 --> 05:13:58,527
Right now about

6156
05:13:59,039 --> 05:13:59,807
1400

6157
05:14:00,319 --> 05:14:00,831
Hi

6158
05:14:01,599 --> 05:14:02,111
About one point

6159
05:14:02,367 --> 05:14:03,903
2 miles long 600

6160
05:14:04,159 --> 05:14:05,183
50 yards wide

6161
05:14:06,463 --> 05:14:09,279
On three sides the train is like impossible

6162
05:14:09,535 --> 05:14:10,303
All Rivers

6163
05:14:10,559 --> 05:14:12,351
Craggy Rocky Terrain

6164
05:14:12,607 --> 05:14:13,887
Put on one side on the west

6165
05:14:14,143 --> 05:14:14,911
It's a nice gentle

6166
05:14:15,167 --> 05:14:16,703
Smoke a couple of miles long

6167
05:14:17,727 --> 05:14:18,495
There's another history point

6168
05:14:18,751 --> 05:14:20,031
Think of a peninsula

6169
05:14:20,287 --> 05:14:21,055
And it's a little like

6170
05:14:21,567 --> 05:14:24,127
Severe can get a rich retreats to this city

6171
05:14:25,663 --> 05:14:28,991
Then turns around and blocks the entrance to the peninsula with his army

6172
05:14:29,247 --> 05:14:32,831
Digs a ditch build a 6ft tall wall made of loose stones

6173
05:14:33,087 --> 05:14:36,159
And above him sits this hill Ford City with

6174
05:14:36,671 --> 05:14:38,719
The tribe whose home it is

6175
05:14:38,975 --> 05:14:39,999
Is there a lot of civilians

6176
05:14:40,767 --> 05:14:41,791
He should have weights for Caesar

6177
05:14:42,303 --> 05:14:43,071
Caesar shows up

6178
05:14:43,327 --> 05:14:44,095
Take a look at this

6179
05:14:44,351 --> 05:14:44,863
Slice

6180
05:14:45,375 --> 05:14:46,143
And decides

6181
05:14:46,911 --> 05:14:47,679
Well this is something you have

6182
05:14:47,935 --> 05:14:48,447
How to put under seat

6183
05:14:48,703 --> 05:14:49,215
Obvious

6184
05:14:50,495 --> 05:14:51,007
But how do you

6185
05:14:51,263 --> 05:14:51,775
Put a

6186
05:14:53,055 --> 05:14:57,407
Place this large Under Siege this is a huge Endeavor if you really want to go there but

6187
05:14:58,175 --> 05:15:00,223
As we've said all along the Romans are

6188
05:15:00,735 --> 05:15:02,015
I want a great secret web

6189
05:15:02,527 --> 05:15:03,295
Is the fact that there

6190
05:15:03,551 --> 05:15:06,879
Legionaries are about half construction worker half Soldier

6191
05:15:08,671 --> 05:15:10,207
Astoria Michael M stage rights

6192
05:15:10,719 --> 05:15:13,535
Caesar looking at Elysian deciding what to do quote

6193
05:15:14,559 --> 05:15:19,167
Since a direct assault was precluded the only alternative was to capture the town by sea

6194
05:15:19,679 --> 05:15:22,495
Which required the construction of massive fortification

6195
05:15:23,007 --> 05:15:25,311
One of the Striking aspects of the garlic War

6196
05:15:25,567 --> 05:15:29,919
Is the engineering skill the Romans displayed in constructing Seas fortifications

6197
05:15:30,431 --> 05:15:34,783
This expertise was part of a wider development in the use of fortification by the Romans

6198
05:15:35,039 --> 05:15:39,135
They were used extensively not only in Siege is but also on the battlefield

6199
05:15:39,647 --> 05:15:44,767
The Romans constructed a continuous Siege wall over 10 miles in length to close off Elysium

6200
05:15:45,279 --> 05:15:45,791
And quote

6201
05:15:47,583 --> 05:15:48,863
Well that just for starters

6202
05:15:49,375 --> 05:15:55,007
But basically once Vera can get a Rick Steves what's going on here and the scope of what Caesars about to do

6203
05:15:55,263 --> 05:16:01,407
He launches a Cavalry attack down that one gentle slope of the peninsula of this Plateau is occupying

6204
05:16:01,919 --> 05:16:05,503
And gets into a dust-up with both Caesars legionaries

6205
05:16:05,759 --> 05:16:10,367
An Caesar's German Cavalry and once again the German Cavalry make the difference

6206
05:16:10,623 --> 05:16:12,927
And they pursue along with the Romans

6207
05:16:13,183 --> 05:16:18,047
These garlic Calvary members who Caesar says get caught up kind of in their own defenses and they start

6208
05:16:18,303 --> 05:16:23,167
Clogging up around the narrow parts and they get just massacred in crowds of people

6209
05:16:23,423 --> 05:16:23,935
He just crushed

6210
05:16:24,191 --> 05:16:24,703
The death

6211
05:16:26,495 --> 05:16:28,287
So Caesar says that this

6212
05:16:28,799 --> 05:16:30,079
Tells beer can get a Rex

6213
05:16:30,335 --> 05:16:32,895
But he's not going to be able to break this Siege himself

6214
05:16:33,151 --> 05:16:34,687
And also as this

6215
05:16:35,199 --> 05:16:39,551
Fortification starts to become complete what are you going to do with Calvary anyway

6216
05:16:39,807 --> 05:16:45,695
The teacher said he sends his Cavalry away send all the Cavalry back to their home try because this is an army that is a

6217
05:16:45,951 --> 05:16:49,535
Consolidation of a bunch of Allied tribes now right almost everyone

6218
05:16:50,047 --> 05:16:54,911
So you send the Cavalry back to their own tribe and Cesar said he tells them to bring a relief Army

6219
05:16:55,423 --> 05:17:00,031
Put together rising of the tribes and come here and save us we've got Caesar pin down right here

6220
05:17:01,055 --> 05:17:04,639
As I can get away to sending this Cavalry all back to their home tribes

6221
05:17:05,151 --> 05:17:07,967
Caesar again putting the words in his mouth has him saying

6222
05:17:08,223 --> 05:17:11,551
You know don't leave me here don't forget who fought for your Liberty

6223
05:17:12,063 --> 05:17:17,439
And then something to the effect of oh yeah and I have 80000 of your countrymen with me you would want to see them die either would you

6224
05:17:18,463 --> 05:17:19,743
Would you bring us two numbers here

6225
05:17:19,999 --> 05:17:20,511
Here for a second

6226
05:17:20,767 --> 05:17:21,535
Because who the hell knows

6227
05:17:22,047 --> 05:17:23,327
What else you going to say

6228
05:17:23,583 --> 05:17:24,863
About these ancient battles

6229
05:17:25,375 --> 05:17:30,751
Sometimes you can reliably come close to something on the Roman sikasil say something like we had this many Legions

6230
05:17:31,263 --> 05:17:33,823
You know they're probably understrength you know they probably got

6231
05:17:34,079 --> 05:17:39,967
Young part-time combatants were their servants and Camp helpers and all that the other so you don't know but you can estimate better

6232
05:17:40,479 --> 05:17:43,295
On the garlic numbers you only have seizure to go from and he's

6233
05:17:43,551 --> 05:17:44,319
Outrageous

6234
05:17:45,343 --> 05:17:47,135
But as every historian says what are you

6235
05:17:47,647 --> 05:17:48,927
Fill the blank with

6236
05:17:49,951 --> 05:17:50,719
I like the way

6237
05:17:50,975 --> 05:17:53,791
Adrian goldsworthy figures 86 what's about to happen here

6238
05:17:55,071 --> 05:18:01,215
You don't know the numbers of Celts involved but you can reliably say it involved more than it ever been assembled a task

6239
05:18:01,471 --> 05:18:01,983
Single place

6240
05:18:03,263 --> 05:18:04,543
Because this relief Army

6241
05:18:04,799 --> 05:18:07,103
The begins to come together is going to be

6242
05:18:07,359 --> 05:18:08,639
According to Caesar

6243
05:18:08,895 --> 05:18:09,919
Absolutely normal

6244
05:18:11,711 --> 05:18:15,551
Now Caesar may have expected the relief Army may not have

6245
05:18:16,319 --> 05:18:18,879
Accounts different interpretations differ on that front

6246
05:18:19,391 --> 05:18:22,719
But if he didn't expect it at some point he hears it it's coming

6247
05:18:23,231 --> 05:18:24,255
So he begins doing

6248
05:18:24,511 --> 05:18:27,583
What is battle for the sea just kind of known for

6249
05:18:28,095 --> 05:18:29,631
He begins building

6250
05:18:29,887 --> 05:18:30,911
Another wall

6251
05:18:31,167 --> 05:18:32,191
And another fortify

6252
05:18:32,447 --> 05:18:37,311
Vacation facing in the opposite direction from the one he's already mostly completed

6253
05:18:38,591 --> 05:18:39,359
So another words

6254
05:18:39,871 --> 05:18:41,407
Is besieging

6255
05:18:41,663 --> 05:18:42,175
The

6256
05:18:42,943 --> 05:18:48,575
Celtic Army in this hill Town while preparing to be besieged himself

6257
05:18:49,087 --> 05:18:49,855
From without

6258
05:18:50,623 --> 05:18:52,415
The Roman army is going to operate

6259
05:18:52,671 --> 05:18:57,023
Within two separate seeds while they're going to Camp there they're going to live there

6260
05:18:57,535 --> 05:19:01,119
And they're going to starve out this Celtic Army on the hill

6261
05:19:01,631 --> 05:19:05,727
While frustrating the efforts of the relief Army that showing up to rescue it

6262
05:19:08,031 --> 05:19:10,591
So for visual purposes if you imagine a

6263
05:19:11,359 --> 05:19:13,919
Hill or a plateau completely

6264
05:19:14,175 --> 05:19:20,063
Surrounded by fortifications or ring of fortifications and then an even larger ring surrounding that

6265
05:19:20,831 --> 05:19:21,599
I read somewhere it's like

6266
05:19:22,111 --> 05:19:22,623
14 miles

6267
05:19:22,879 --> 05:19:23,391
Circumference

6268
05:19:23,647 --> 05:19:24,159
Something

6269
05:19:24,415 --> 05:19:25,695
And Visually you'll get the right

6270
05:19:25,951 --> 05:19:26,463
A picture

6271
05:19:27,231 --> 05:19:27,999
Imagine

6272
05:19:28,511 --> 05:19:34,655
Watchtower that had artillery in them I thought I read somewhere 1500 was an estimate somebody to

6273
05:19:35,167 --> 05:19:35,679
For the number

6274
05:19:36,191 --> 05:19:36,703
Aldo's

6275
05:19:37,471 --> 05:19:38,495
I watched hours

6276
05:19:38,751 --> 05:19:41,567
This is a place that's going to be able to

6277
05:19:41,823 --> 05:19:42,335
House

6278
05:19:43,103 --> 05:19:47,199
60 to 80000 Roman soldiers and Friends

6279
05:19:47,967 --> 05:19:53,855
Show me think of the sides were talking about here it has multiple camps each campus it is a fort in and of itself

6280
05:19:54,367 --> 05:19:59,487
It has 23 things that are like of the Roman word means little castles or little fortresses

6281
05:20:00,255 --> 05:20:01,023
It's crazy

6282
05:20:01,535 --> 05:20:05,631
The best short description I ever read because they're hard to find because even Caesar

6283
05:20:05,887 --> 05:20:07,679
Who's normally very spare with words

6284
05:20:08,191 --> 05:20:11,007
Can't help but go On and On by seizure standards

6285
05:20:11,263 --> 05:20:12,287
But all these pits

6286
05:20:12,543 --> 05:20:16,127
Still with sharpened stakes and I mean all these things that are awaiting

6287
05:20:16,383 --> 05:20:17,407
The garlic Warriors

6288
05:20:18,687 --> 05:20:19,455
John worry run

6289
05:20:19,711 --> 05:20:20,223
The great book online

6290
05:20:20,735 --> 05:20:21,247
Warfare

6291
05:20:21,503 --> 05:20:22,783
And he described

6292
05:20:23,551 --> 05:20:24,063
Defenses

6293
05:20:24,575 --> 05:20:25,855
Which is a weird word right there

6294
05:20:26,111 --> 05:20:28,159
Defenses in one sense but they're also the

6295
05:20:28,415 --> 05:20:30,975
Fortifications besieging the other Army in another

6296
05:20:31,231 --> 05:20:33,279
Is how he described the fortifications

6297
05:20:33,535 --> 05:20:34,047
Analicia

6298
05:20:34,303 --> 05:20:34,815
Quote

6299
05:20:35,839 --> 05:20:39,935
The Roman entrenchments LinkedIn encircling chain of camps in Fort

6300
05:20:40,447 --> 05:20:42,495
The interdict was 20 ft wide

6301
05:20:43,007 --> 05:20:44,287
With sheer size

6302
05:20:44,543 --> 05:20:46,591
IE not tapering at the bottom

6303
05:20:47,103 --> 05:20:52,223
And the main circunvalacion was constructed 400 Paces behind this ditch

6304
05:20:52,479 --> 05:20:54,271
Here there were two trenches

6305
05:20:54,783 --> 05:20:57,855
Each 15 feet wide and 8 feet deep

6306
05:20:58,367 --> 05:21:02,975
The river was diverted to carry water into the inner trench wherever possible

6307
05:21:03,487 --> 05:21:07,071
Behind the trenches was a 12-foot earthwork in Palisade

6308
05:21:07,327 --> 05:21:10,143
With antler drawings projecting from

6309
05:21:10,655 --> 05:21:15,263
Breastworks in battlements were overlooked by turrets at intervals of 80 ft

6310
05:21:16,031 --> 05:21:19,871
Cesar also sold the ground Beyond his fortification

6311
05:21:20,127 --> 05:21:22,943
With prongs and pitfalls of various patterns

6312
05:21:23,199 --> 05:21:26,271
Illustratively are humorously termed lilies

6313
05:21:26,783 --> 05:21:27,295
And

6314
05:21:27,551 --> 05:21:28,063
Stingers

6315
05:21:28,575 --> 05:21:31,391
A parallel line of fortifications was then provided

6316
05:21:31,647 --> 05:21:34,975
As an outer circunvalacion against the inevitable really for

6317
05:21:35,487 --> 05:21:38,815
The inner perimeter was 10.1 miles long

6318
05:21:39,071 --> 05:21:41,375
The outer 12.9 MI

6319
05:21:42,143 --> 05:21:42,655
And quote

6320
05:21:43,935 --> 05:21:46,751
So if you wanted these garlic Warriors looking to

6321
05:21:47,263 --> 05:21:51,359
Strike a blow maybe a fatal blow in the defense

6322
05:21:51,871 --> 05:21:55,455
Or reconquest of garlic Celtic Liberty

6323
05:21:55,711 --> 05:21:59,551
And you show up here to do battle with the Romans before you even get

6324
05:21:59,807 --> 05:22:00,319
2

6325
05:22:00,575 --> 05:22:05,951
The actual place where the Romans are going to their standing behind their Earth and Timber

6326
05:22:06,207 --> 05:22:07,487
Fortifications there

6327
05:22:07,743 --> 05:22:10,815
Behind all these defenses you get to get through the gauntlet

6328
05:22:11,583 --> 05:22:14,143
And The Gauntlet is worried points out starts with

6329
05:22:14,655 --> 05:22:16,959
A huge 20 ft wide

6330
05:22:17,215 --> 05:22:19,263
It'll say howdy but the other trenches R8

6331
05:22:19,775 --> 05:22:21,823
Diva figure at least eight feet deep

6332
05:22:22,079 --> 05:22:22,591
Trench

6333
05:22:23,871 --> 05:22:25,919
That'll break up the momentum of a giant

6334
05:22:26,175 --> 05:22:27,711
Human wave charge won't

6335
05:22:28,223 --> 05:22:30,527
But that's about six football fields he's

6336
05:22:30,783 --> 05:22:31,807
Says from the rest of the defense

6337
05:22:32,319 --> 05:22:35,903
Is when you run into them you're running into things like a double

6338
05:22:36,159 --> 05:22:38,207
Line of trenches 15 ft yd

6339
05:22:38,463 --> 05:22:40,511
Deep one of them filled with water

6340
05:22:41,535 --> 05:22:43,327
You're also running into an

6341
05:22:43,583 --> 05:22:45,887
This is something you can see it and there's almost enjoyment

6342
05:22:47,423 --> 05:22:48,959
Citic constructed all these little trap

6343
05:22:49,471 --> 05:22:51,775
They sound like the kind of traps when I was growing up

6344
05:22:52,031 --> 05:22:54,591
The North Vietnamese the Vietcong always set

6345
05:22:55,103 --> 05:22:56,639
You know these these things were they

6346
05:22:56,895 --> 05:22:57,919
Put a big sharpener

6347
05:22:58,943 --> 05:23:05,087
Unit 3 feet in the ground and then covered up with leaves and wait for someone to walk by but the Romans have like thousands of though

6348
05:23:05,599 --> 05:23:06,367
In front of the arrow

6349
05:23:07,135 --> 05:23:08,671
Trenches and then they have a

6350
05:23:09,183 --> 05:23:11,231
A bunch of other things that are similar

6351
05:23:11,487 --> 05:23:14,047
But disguise differently and they mix them all together

6352
05:23:14,559 --> 05:23:17,119
So that as you're approaching know you're coming towards

6353
05:23:17,375 --> 05:23:18,143
Artillery

6354
05:23:18,655 --> 05:23:24,799
The Roman start shooting at you and you're just starting to get your blood up you're not worried about where you're stepping and everything and then all of a sudden you run

6355
05:23:25,055 --> 05:23:26,079
Into all these traps

6356
05:23:26,847 --> 05:23:30,943
And then right after the Trap there's another more trenches and then you run into the prom

6357
05:23:31,711 --> 05:23:32,735
Worry called them

6358
05:23:32,991 --> 05:23:36,319
I was reading how they did this the Roman soldiers would go cut all these branches

6359
05:23:37,087 --> 05:23:43,231
And then they would cut the ends off the branches and sharp and all the ends and then they would arrange them in a way so that it was like a giant

6360
05:23:43,487 --> 05:23:44,255
And hedge

6361
05:23:45,535 --> 05:23:49,887
Knife Thorns I guess you could say a giant almost it's almost like ancient barbed wire

6362
05:23:50,143 --> 05:23:55,263
And they would either put it at the bottom of one of these trenches or right as you were clamoring out of one of

6363
05:23:56,031 --> 05:23:58,079
Clamoring out of this 8-foot Trench

6364
05:23:58,335 --> 05:24:02,687
And you know what your human wave attack has been somewhat disrupted and what's at the top of the trench this

6365
05:24:03,199 --> 05:24:04,479
Giant Hedge

6366
05:24:04,991 --> 05:24:05,503
Braum's

6367
05:24:06,783 --> 05:24:12,415
And all this of course is before the garlic Warriors even make it to the Roman Stockade in Earthen

6368
05:24:12,671 --> 05:24:13,439
Set of wall

6369
05:24:14,719 --> 05:24:15,999
Historian Nick field says

6370
05:24:16,511 --> 05:24:18,303
That 6000 trees

6371
05:24:18,815 --> 05:24:19,327
Warlock

6372
05:24:19,839 --> 05:24:20,351
To create the

6373
05:24:22,143 --> 05:24:23,679
They might have been tough for the

6374
05:24:24,447 --> 05:24:27,775
Celtic people to overrun without all that stuff in front of the

6375
05:24:28,543 --> 05:24:34,687
And let's not forget that Behind These fortification of these very same legionaries that have beaten these garlic Warriors most of the time

6376
05:24:34,943 --> 05:24:37,247
Time in the open field without even having the help

6377
05:24:39,551 --> 05:24:41,343
Guard towers everywhere as we

6378
05:24:41,855 --> 05:24:42,623
Artillery

6379
05:24:44,159 --> 05:24:45,439
Daniel Caesar doesn't he

6380
05:24:46,207 --> 05:24:46,975
Aldi

6381
05:24:47,743 --> 05:24:48,255
Remember

6382
05:24:49,023 --> 05:24:50,303
There is a reportedly

6383
05:24:50,559 --> 05:24:51,071
ATS

6384
05:24:51,327 --> 05:24:53,631
Thousand let's lower that to something more believe

6385
05:24:54,399 --> 05:24:55,679
35000

6386
05:24:56,191 --> 05:24:58,751
Golic Warriors essentially in his rear

6387
05:24:59,519 --> 05:25:01,055
That Army he's besieging

6388
05:25:01,823 --> 05:25:06,943
If the Army from outside the ring attacks Caesar the relief Army

6389
05:25:07,455 --> 05:25:08,735
And he turns to face it

6390
05:25:09,247 --> 05:25:12,575
He's got very can gutter extend that Army in his rear

6391
05:25:12,831 --> 05:25:14,879
So they can coordinate their attacks

6392
05:25:15,647 --> 05:25:17,951
Well Caesars got a heck of a challenge in front of him

6393
05:25:18,208 --> 05:25:21,024
If you are a tribal Army trying to resist

6394
05:25:21,280 --> 05:25:23,072
Colonization from one of those you know

6395
05:25:24,864 --> 05:25:27,168
Technologically more sophisticated more centralized

6396
05:25:27,424 --> 05:25:28,960
Power Rangers Dino throughout history

6397
05:25:29,728 --> 05:25:35,872
This is one of the better chances as I said you're going to find it's a gamble this is wagering as we've been saying

6398
05:25:36,128 --> 05:25:36,896
Interrupt this talk

6399
05:25:37,152 --> 05:25:37,920
Everything

6400
05:25:38,944 --> 05:25:41,504
If you are these Celtic peoples and yet at the same time

6401
05:25:42,016 --> 05:25:44,832
This is a pretty good wager it might be a bit of a long shot

6402
05:25:45,600 --> 05:25:49,696
But this is a chance that you would think for example Native American tribes were

6403
05:25:49,952 --> 05:25:50,976
Forgiving everything

6404
05:25:51,488 --> 05:25:53,792
To Simply have a chance to maybe win

6405
05:25:55,072 --> 05:25:58,400
He said that maybe 80000 Romans are here we don't know how many Celtic

6406
05:25:58,656 --> 05:25:59,936
People are coming in the relief Force

6407
05:26:00,960 --> 05:26:03,264
But the people inside the besieged

6408
05:26:03,520 --> 05:26:06,592
Hilltown don't know that it really forces coming at all

6409
05:26:07,360 --> 05:26:11,200
Cesar points out that there can get erection his army up on the Hill Florida cutoff

6410
05:26:11,712 --> 05:26:12,992
Germany news and information

6411
05:26:13,248 --> 05:26:17,856
They have this due date in their heads when they think there were leaving Army's going to show up but the Army doesn't

6412
05:26:18,880 --> 05:26:23,488
Food starts running low and they start having these hardcore debates inside

6413
05:26:23,744 --> 05:26:26,560
The hill for the monks the various garlick leaders in

6414
05:26:26,816 --> 05:26:27,584
People of note

6415
05:26:28,864 --> 05:26:30,144
There's like 46 tribe

6416
05:26:31,424 --> 05:26:32,192
I think Caesar right in

6417
05:26:32,960 --> 05:26:33,728
Involved in this

6418
05:26:33,984 --> 05:26:36,288
This is a pan tribal group of people

6419
05:26:36,544 --> 05:26:40,640
They're starting to think that there's no relieving Army coming maybe so what are we going to do

6420
05:26:41,920 --> 05:26:43,456
One group wants to surrender

6421
05:26:43,712 --> 05:26:48,832
Another wants to charge out there and sort of like a giant Bonsai charge of deathrite make a good

6422
05:26:49,088 --> 05:26:50,112
Song at least

6423
05:26:50,368 --> 05:26:51,904
And then there's a third group that wants

6424
05:26:52,160 --> 05:26:55,744
The holdout cuz they think a relieving Army is coming and seizure put one of these

6425
05:26:56,768 --> 05:26:57,536
Fantastic

6426
05:26:58,048 --> 05:27:01,888
Speeches into the mouths of one of these is one of the longest I think I read it's the longest speech

6427
05:27:02,144 --> 05:27:04,448
Seizure put in anybody's mouth in the whole commentary

6428
05:27:04,704 --> 05:27:08,800
And he means it in a bad way he wants you to look at this people and think aren't they disgusting

6429
05:27:09,056 --> 05:27:11,104
Because this garlic guy is saying

6430
05:27:11,360 --> 05:27:13,152
We need to be prepared to be cattle

6431
05:27:13,920 --> 05:27:14,944
We need to just eat

6432
05:27:15,456 --> 05:27:16,224
The old people

6433
05:27:16,736 --> 05:27:19,552
And useless now this here is a way of holding out

6434
05:27:20,320 --> 05:27:21,856
And the speech is worth

6435
05:27:22,112 --> 05:27:22,624
Recount

6436
05:27:23,136 --> 05:27:23,648
I'm Caesar

6437
05:27:24,160 --> 05:27:25,696
Again he's trying to make this guy look

6438
05:27:26,464 --> 05:27:26,976
Degraded

6439
05:27:27,232 --> 05:27:28,768
By this but there's another way to look at it

6440
05:27:29,024 --> 05:27:29,536
Which is

6441
05:27:29,792 --> 05:27:31,584
Again this is a committee

6442
05:27:31,840 --> 05:27:37,472
What does it mean when you sacrifice were willing to sacrifice everything it means you're willing to go cannibal if that's what it takes

6443
05:27:38,496 --> 05:27:39,008
This is from

6444
05:27:39,776 --> 05:27:42,080
My Thomas Holmes translation of Caesar

6445
05:27:42,848 --> 05:27:44,384
Procedure says that this song

6446
05:27:45,152 --> 05:27:51,040
Nobleman's garlic no woman makes the speech when she said should not be passed over he doesn't think another word somebody should say

6447
05:27:51,552 --> 05:27:53,088
Disc golf at these horrible things

6448
05:27:53,344 --> 05:27:54,368
And so here Caesar

6449
05:27:54,624 --> 05:27:56,928
With this goal and he has him saying quote

6450
05:27:57,184 --> 05:27:59,232
I do not intend he said

6451
05:27:59,488 --> 05:28:03,840
To notice the view of those who dignify the most abject slavery

6452
05:28:04,096 --> 05:28:05,376
Buy the title of surrender

6453
05:28:05,888 --> 05:28:08,448
Bright hold that they are not to be counted as Citizens

6454
05:28:08,960 --> 05:28:10,240
Or admitted to a counselor

6455
05:28:10,496 --> 05:28:14,080
I am only concerned with those who are in favor of a sortie

6456
05:28:14,336 --> 05:28:15,360
Meaning of Rage

6457
05:28:15,616 --> 05:28:16,640
Bonsai tree

6458
05:28:17,152 --> 05:28:19,200
Praise You are all agreed

6459
05:28:19,456 --> 05:28:23,040
In their council is to be recognized the memory of our ancient Valor

6460
05:28:23,296 --> 05:28:26,368
To be unable to bear privation for a short span

6461
05:28:26,880 --> 05:28:27,904
That I called weekend

6462
05:28:28,416 --> 05:28:29,952
Not manly resolution

6463
05:28:30,208 --> 05:28:35,072
It is easier to find a man who will upfront death than men who will patiently endure suffering

6464
05:28:35,328 --> 05:28:37,632
And yet I would give my sanction to this View

6465
05:28:38,144 --> 05:28:41,216
So highly do I respect the authority of its advocates

6466
05:28:41,728 --> 05:28:45,056
If I saw no evil involved in it say the sacrifice of our own live

6467
05:28:45,824 --> 05:28:49,408
Informing our plans we must have regard to the whole of Gaul

6468
05:28:49,920 --> 05:28:52,480
For we have called upon the whole of Gaul to help us

6469
05:28:52,992 --> 05:28:56,576
If 80000 men fall on one field what

6470
05:28:56,832 --> 05:29:02,976
Think you will be the feelings of our friends and Kinsmen when they are constrained to fight almost on the very corpses of

6471
05:29:03,232 --> 05:29:03,744
The slain

6472
05:29:04,256 --> 05:29:05,536
To save you

6473
05:29:05,792 --> 05:29:08,352
They have counted their personal danger is nothing

6474
05:29:08,608 --> 05:29:11,168
Do not then robbed them of your Aid

6475
05:29:11,424 --> 05:29:11,936
Do not

6476
05:29:12,192 --> 05:29:16,800
By your folly or righteousness or lack of resolution ruin the whole of Gaul

6477
05:29:17,056 --> 05:29:19,360
And subjected to Perpetual slavery

6478
05:29:19,616 --> 05:29:20,384
Can it be that

6479
05:29:20,640 --> 05:29:22,176
Because they have not arrived

6480
05:29:22,432 --> 05:29:23,968
Punctually to the day

6481
05:29:24,224 --> 05:29:26,528
You doubt their good faith and resolution

6482
05:29:26,784 --> 05:29:27,296
What then

6483
05:29:27,552 --> 05:29:33,184
Do you suppose that the Romans are toiling day after day on those outer lines simply to amuse themselves

6484
05:29:34,208 --> 05:29:38,560
Is the messengers of your countrymen cannot reassure you because all in versus bard

6485
05:29:38,816 --> 05:29:41,632
Except Roman testimony that they're coming is near

6486
05:29:42,144 --> 05:29:43,424
Dread of that event

6487
05:29:43,680 --> 05:29:46,496
Keeps them busy upon their works Night and Day

6488
05:29:47,264 --> 05:29:47,776
And quote

6489
05:29:49,056 --> 05:29:50,336
Other words he's saying

6490
05:29:50,848 --> 05:29:55,456
If you doubt the relieving Army is on the way tell me why the Romans are going to all this trouble

6491
05:29:56,992 --> 05:29:58,272
He then says that they ought to be

6492
05:29:58,528 --> 05:29:59,296
Prepared to eat

6493
05:29:59,552 --> 05:30:00,064
Each other.

6494
05:30:00,320 --> 05:30:02,624
What it takes to regain garlick Liberty

6495
05:30:04,416 --> 05:30:05,184
Instead

6496
05:30:05,696 --> 05:30:10,560
What one translation here called the Council of War decides to send out the useless mouth

6497
05:30:10,816 --> 05:30:11,840
Central long

6498
05:30:12,096 --> 05:30:18,240
You know how long the food will last a little more sort of counting on the Romans maybe to take in these women and children and old

6499
05:30:18,496 --> 05:30:19,520
Old people and infirm

6500
05:30:20,032 --> 05:30:23,616
You know the people who used to live in that town before it became a Battlefield

6501
05:30:24,128 --> 05:30:25,152
So they can get erect

6502
05:30:25,664 --> 05:30:29,504
Send those people out to the Roman lined and Caesar probably sends them back

6503
05:30:31,808 --> 05:30:37,952
It's been explained that maybe Caesar didn't have the food to feed these people those people were besieging Caesar make us slaves and then feed us

6504
05:30:38,208 --> 05:30:39,488
Just like slavery just wanted to eat

6505
05:30:39,744 --> 05:30:44,608
And Caesar didn't have a ton of food himself obviously but also he thought sending them back might eat up

6506
05:30:44,864 --> 05:30:46,912
There can get her riches food supply even faster

6507
05:30:47,168 --> 05:30:50,752
The problem is is neither side relented in those people began to die

6508
05:30:52,032 --> 05:30:53,056
In between the lines

6509
05:30:53,312 --> 05:30:55,104
Eating grass is the way one

6510
05:30:55,360 --> 05:30:56,384
Ancient source describe

6511
05:30:58,176 --> 05:30:59,456
Deadly Women and Children

6512
05:30:59,712 --> 05:31:05,856
The families of some of these Warriors dying in front of you day after day of slow starvation and exposure to the other

6513
05:31:06,112 --> 05:31:09,696
Goes on and you have no idea if your friends are coming

6514
05:31:10,208 --> 05:31:11,488
And then one day

6515
05:31:12,256 --> 05:31:12,768
They do

6516
05:31:14,304 --> 05:31:16,352
And they are visible in the distance

6517
05:31:16,608 --> 05:31:19,424
Cincinbear can get erection his troops can see them

6518
05:31:19,680 --> 05:31:22,496
Operating on an open playing in the distance

6519
05:31:23,008 --> 05:31:27,104
In a way that is all but like a Sky Rider saying

6520
05:31:27,616 --> 05:31:28,128
Rejoice

6521
05:31:29,152 --> 05:31:31,712
In all of Gaul is here you are rescued

6522
05:31:33,248 --> 05:31:37,344
And on multiple Hills in the distance the Roman C

6523
05:31:37,600 --> 05:31:39,136
What Adrian goldsworthy said is

6524
05:31:39,392 --> 05:31:40,672
Almost certainly the largest

6525
05:31:41,184 --> 05:31:44,256
All the army ever assembled however many people that might be

6526
05:31:47,072 --> 05:31:47,584
Ashley Goldsboro

6527
05:31:48,608 --> 05:31:49,376
Only one out of

6528
05:31:49,888 --> 05:31:50,656
The largest armies

6529
05:31:50,912 --> 05:31:51,680
It's a Jew says

6530
05:31:52,192 --> 05:31:52,704
Likely the large

6531
05:31:52,960 --> 05:31:54,496
Starmie

6532
05:31:55,008 --> 05:31:58,080
Hopelessly outdated but impossibly logical friend

6533
05:31:58,336 --> 05:32:01,408
From 100 years ago Hans delbruck who thinks all these numbers are

6534
05:32:01,920 --> 05:32:02,432
Crazy

6535
05:32:03,200 --> 05:32:09,344
Admits that it might have been possible that this was a larger-than-normal army because even though he's the guy who's always going to say you know how

6536
05:32:09,600 --> 05:32:10,368
How are you going to feed them

6537
05:32:10,624 --> 05:32:13,184
He says it's possible that these people were never meant to eat

6538
05:32:13,440 --> 05:32:13,952
Very long

6539
05:32:14,976 --> 05:32:17,024
But this really farmies like a cruise missile

6540
05:32:17,280 --> 05:32:19,840
To be launched right at Caesar the Romans and eased

6541
05:32:20,096 --> 05:32:20,608
Defenses

6542
05:32:21,376 --> 05:32:25,984
And so you don't have to worry about them breaking up like the belgae did you know if they're starving over a month or so

6543
05:32:28,544 --> 05:32:29,568
So figure

6544
05:32:29,824 --> 05:32:32,640
You have an army here if we talkin about the Native Americans

6545
05:32:32,896 --> 05:32:35,456
Having two thousand Warriors and it's a pretty good amount

6546
05:32:35,968 --> 05:32:39,808
Were the Zulus having 20000 and it's a large Zulu Army

6547
05:32:40,320 --> 05:32:41,088
This Army

6548
05:32:41,344 --> 05:32:42,368
Might be

6549
05:32:42,880 --> 05:32:46,464
When you combine the numbers inside the Hill Ford with the relief Army

6550
05:32:46,976 --> 05:32:48,512
120000

6551
05:32:48,768 --> 05:32:52,352
130000 the ancient sources haven't well over 300,000

6552
05:32:52,608 --> 05:32:55,680
250000 infantry in the relief Force alone

6553
05:32:55,936 --> 05:32:56,960
Those are crazy

6554
05:32:57,216 --> 05:32:57,984
But once again

6555
05:32:59,008 --> 05:33:00,032
If this is a hundred and twenty

6556
05:33:00,288 --> 05:33:00,800
Thousand

6557
05:33:01,568 --> 05:33:03,616
Tribal Warriors in one place

6558
05:33:04,640 --> 05:33:06,176
Well you know I like that Napoleon

6559
05:33:06,432 --> 05:33:08,992
Quality quantity has a quality all its own

6560
05:33:10,016 --> 05:33:12,320
That'll make up for a lot of Roman advantages wangjing

6561
05:33:13,344 --> 05:33:14,624
Just having so many people

6562
05:33:15,904 --> 05:33:16,416
And

6563
05:33:16,928 --> 05:33:17,696
You can understand

6564
05:33:17,952 --> 05:33:19,488
David brooks idea that maybe these p

6565
05:33:19,744 --> 05:33:23,072
People are just meant to be used right away when you see how quickly everything unfolds

6566
05:33:23,584 --> 05:33:25,120
Alief Army shows up

6567
05:33:25,376 --> 05:33:27,424
Camps out of these Hills about a mile from the Romans

6568
05:33:27,680 --> 05:33:30,752
Goes down to this plane which is the only part of the

6569
05:33:31,008 --> 05:33:34,080
Mary which is really like a battlefield the one open space that

6570
05:33:34,336 --> 05:33:39,968
That Western area the gentle slope of the plateau so all the real fighting especially the wide-open Cavalry stuff happen

6571
05:33:40,224 --> 05:33:40,736
There

6572
05:33:41,504 --> 05:33:46,112
And they go out and they demonstrate their and that's where they're can get erection all his beleaguered besieged

6573
05:33:46,624 --> 05:33:52,768
Starving people who've already seen those people from the town starve him between the two armies you not throw up a cheer season

6574
05:33:53,792 --> 05:33:56,096
And let's remember why we say Caesar says

6575
05:33:57,376 --> 05:33:59,168
Why we're so reliant on

6576
05:33:59,424 --> 05:33:59,936
Vim

6577
05:34:00,448 --> 05:34:02,496
He's the only eyewitness from this battle

6578
05:34:02,752 --> 05:34:04,288
Do we have any account from

6579
05:34:05,056 --> 05:34:09,408
And anyone else's account of this battle off and uses him as a source

6580
05:34:10,432 --> 05:34:12,224
So he's both invaluable

6581
05:34:12,480 --> 05:34:15,552
And at the same time obviously biased as hell although

6582
05:34:16,064 --> 05:34:17,088
Anyone you got

6583
05:34:17,344 --> 05:34:18,624
Open this bottle who wrote about his

6584
05:34:19,392 --> 05:34:19,904
How to be pretty

6585
05:34:21,440 --> 05:34:27,584
In this case there when Caesar plays up the fear a lot of times when seizures playing up the fear of the dangerousness of a situation

6586
05:34:28,352 --> 05:34:34,240
You can perhaps suggest that you doing it to magnify his own greatness but this looks legitimately dangerous here

6587
05:34:35,264 --> 05:34:38,080
This looks like a moment in history as we said

6588
05:34:38,336 --> 05:34:40,640
Where the tribal people kind of have a shot

6589
05:34:41,152 --> 05:34:45,248
120000 hundred thirty thousand Warriors gives you a shot

6590
05:34:47,296 --> 05:34:53,440
So when they're can get a rich and his people see this relief Army Caesar says they come running down from their positions

6591
05:34:53,696 --> 05:34:57,792
Towards that trench that separates them from the Romans and they begin filling it in

6592
05:34:58,304 --> 05:34:59,840
In other words preparing to do

6593
05:35:00,096 --> 05:35:06,240
Their job in this whole attack which is to attack the Roman from the other side when the big relief Army smashes Against the Wind

6594
05:35:06,496 --> 05:35:07,008
At the front

6595
05:35:07,776 --> 05:35:10,336
Teacher says he has all those people take up the positions

6596
05:35:12,128 --> 05:35:17,248
And then he sends his Cavalry down into this plane to engage the garlic Cavalry that's down there

6597
05:35:17,760 --> 05:35:18,272
Now

6598
05:35:18,784 --> 05:35:24,672
Who knows about these numbers estimates are Caesar had about six thousand Cavalry wide mixing things

6599
05:35:24,928 --> 05:35:26,208
Still have some garlic Calvary

6600
05:35:26,976 --> 05:35:27,488
Spanish

6601
05:35:28,000 --> 05:35:30,304
Community and we know we had some Germans

6602
05:35:31,584 --> 05:35:32,352
The Gauls

6603
05:35:32,864 --> 05:35:34,400
Well and Gauls and

6604
05:35:34,656 --> 05:35:40,800
They fight and Skirmish all afternoon apparently and the gulls are getting the better of it when Caesar says

6605
05:35:41,056 --> 05:35:46,176
All of a sudden and not for the last time these German Cavalry once again turn the tide

6606
05:35:47,968 --> 05:35:51,040
Kill a bunch of the Gauls chasing off win the day

6607
05:35:51,808 --> 05:35:55,136
And he says that there can get Alex and his people who are

6608
05:35:55,392 --> 05:36:01,536
You're standing by having field in the trench waiting to attack dejectedly head back uphill toward the town

6609
05:36:01,792 --> 05:36:02,560
After they see that

6610
05:36:02,816 --> 05:36:06,400
This relief Army isn't going to be giving them any relief today

6611
05:36:07,936 --> 05:36:08,704
So then you get

6612
05:36:09,216 --> 05:36:09,984
The next day

6613
05:36:10,752 --> 05:36:14,848
And something happens that seemed to validate some of those earlier points we were making

6614
05:36:15,104 --> 05:36:18,688
But in the later books of seizures as Ender Rigsby point.

6615
05:36:19,200 --> 05:36:20,224
He begins to

6616
05:36:20,480 --> 05:36:26,624
Point out that these people are growing and they're changing and they're their prolonged contact and fighting with the Romans

6617
05:36:26,880 --> 05:36:27,904
Just making them more dangerous

6618
05:36:28,672 --> 05:36:30,720
Maybe said earlier this is the reason sometimes

6619
05:36:31,232 --> 05:36:34,048
Used to explain why the Germans will

6620
05:36:34,304 --> 05:36:40,192
Sack Rome in 410 AD right prolonged contact with the Romans made them Roman enough so that they could do that

6621
05:36:40,448 --> 05:36:41,984
Will seizures kind of alleging is this

6622
05:36:42,240 --> 05:36:43,776
No commentary his goes on

6623
05:36:44,288 --> 05:36:46,080
Did the Celts are going that way

6624
05:36:46,592 --> 05:36:50,432
And they need to be dealt with now before they get any better because they spend

6625
05:36:50,688 --> 05:36:52,480
The next day during the day

6626
05:36:53,248 --> 05:36:59,392
Calmly and coolly and logically and diligently the Romans might notice cuz they was the

6627
05:37:00,416 --> 05:37:01,184
Ounces so lazy

6628
05:37:01,696 --> 05:37:05,024
I'm liking to avoid hard labor but they're cutting down trees

6629
05:37:05,792 --> 05:37:07,072
And they're making ladders

6630
05:37:08,096 --> 05:37:09,888
Play commotion putting together bundles of

6631
05:37:10,144 --> 05:37:10,656
Styx

6632
05:37:10,912 --> 05:37:17,056
Play when they run toward these Roman trenches they can all throw their bundle into the trench and eventually the bundles Philip the French and you can run

6633
05:37:17,312 --> 05:37:17,824
Over them

6634
05:37:18,848 --> 05:37:19,360
In the words

6635
05:37:20,128 --> 05:37:22,944
They're not rushing at the defense is like a bunch of

6636
05:37:23,200 --> 05:37:24,224
War mad

6637
05:37:24,480 --> 05:37:25,504
Battle crazed

6638
05:37:25,760 --> 05:37:27,296
Barbarians that you can just

6639
05:37:27,808 --> 05:37:28,832
You pick off cuz they're so

6640
05:37:29,088 --> 05:37:29,600
Stupid

6641
05:37:29,856 --> 05:37:31,392
They are calmly and logically

6642
05:37:31,648 --> 05:37:32,160
Replanting

6643
05:37:32,928 --> 05:37:34,208
For an organized assault

6644
05:37:36,512 --> 05:37:37,024
Scarier

6645
05:37:38,560 --> 05:37:40,352
And then when the Sun goes down

6646
05:37:40,864 --> 05:37:44,448
Things are only lit by Torchlight maybe Moonlight Uno's

6647
05:37:45,728 --> 05:37:47,008
The largest army

6648
05:37:47,264 --> 05:37:49,312
Probably ever assembled in Gaul

6649
05:37:49,824 --> 05:37:50,848
One that is

6650
05:37:51,104 --> 05:37:57,248
Infinitely larger than any North American tribal army ever assembled in exponentially large

6651
05:37:58,528 --> 05:37:59,040
Throws it

6652
05:37:59,296 --> 05:38:00,576
Self against the Roman

6653
05:38:01,088 --> 05:38:01,600
Defenses

6654
05:38:02,368 --> 05:38:02,880
At night

6655
05:38:04,672 --> 05:38:06,208
Caesar writes that after midnight

6656
05:38:06,720 --> 05:38:08,000
This Celtic Army

6657
05:38:08,256 --> 05:38:09,792
Right just creeps up

6658
05:38:10,048 --> 05:38:10,560
Quietly

6659
05:38:11,328 --> 05:38:14,400
And then launches its attack all at once making a lot of noise

6660
05:38:14,656 --> 05:38:17,984
All at once I mean imagine you're up in the Golic Hill Ford besieged

6661
05:38:18,496 --> 05:38:21,056
Wondering what's coming next cuz you're out of touch with these

6662
05:38:21,824 --> 05:38:22,848
Forces on the other side of the road

6663
05:38:23,616 --> 05:38:24,640
And then the

6664
05:38:24,896 --> 05:38:27,200
Stillness of the night is broken by this

6665
05:38:27,456 --> 05:38:28,736
Loud roar

6666
05:38:29,248 --> 05:38:29,760
And you answered

6667
05:38:30,016 --> 05:38:31,552
Delino something's going

6668
05:38:31,808 --> 05:38:33,344
Going on down there so they can get her

6669
05:38:33,600 --> 05:38:35,392
Blows the trumpet Caesar size

6670
05:38:35,648 --> 05:38:39,744
Begins to get his forces together to support the attack on his side meanwhile

6671
05:38:40,256 --> 05:38:40,768
This

6672
05:38:41,024 --> 05:38:43,328
Celtic force is throwing themselves again

6673
05:38:43,584 --> 05:38:45,376
The Roman defenses in the dark

6674
05:38:46,400 --> 05:38:47,424
And falling in

6675
05:38:49,472 --> 05:38:50,240
And traps

6676
05:38:50,752 --> 05:38:54,592
And Spurs and all these things that Caesar so lovingly and devilishly

6677
05:38:55,104 --> 05:38:55,616
Described

6678
05:38:56,128 --> 05:38:58,176
They're bad enough in daytime but at night

6679
05:38:58,688 --> 05:38:59,712
Well you can see how it'd be

6680
05:39:00,480 --> 05:39:01,504
A bigger problem he says he's

6681
05:39:01,760 --> 05:39:05,344
Galls are falling into the pits in there they're being skewered by these

6682
05:39:05,600 --> 05:39:06,112
Steaks

6683
05:39:06,368 --> 05:39:08,160
We sharpen pieces of wood

6684
05:39:08,928 --> 05:39:11,232
Size of a man's thigh some of them others are

6685
05:39:11,488 --> 05:39:17,632
Much smaller meant to go through your foot and disable you meanwhile Roman artillery shooting from the walls

6686
05:39:17,888 --> 05:39:20,960
Did you you're trying to get through the trenches you got to deal with these prongs

6687
05:39:23,520 --> 05:39:28,128
But Caesar makes it out to be a near run thing and they are beating off this attack

6688
05:39:28,640 --> 05:39:31,456
Well like something out of one of those old westerns

6689
05:39:31,712 --> 05:39:33,504
Where the Native Americans are

6690
05:39:33,760 --> 05:39:36,576
Are attacking the small little fort

6691
05:39:36,832 --> 05:39:38,880
And there seems to be an endless supply of them

6692
05:39:39,136 --> 05:39:43,744
And you seem to almost be at your last leg Caesar specifically names he's good at this remember

6693
05:39:44,000 --> 05:39:45,024
Two of his

6694
05:39:45,536 --> 05:39:48,608
One of my translations cause of generals which is not a good

6695
05:39:48,864 --> 05:39:50,912
Beijing bohemian senior commanders on the scene

6696
05:39:51,168 --> 05:39:52,192
One of them is Mark

6697
05:39:52,448 --> 05:39:55,008
Antony Marcus Antonius and of course he'll be

6698
05:39:55,520 --> 05:39:58,848
Ancient tabloid fodder later when he hooks up with Cleopatra

6699
05:39:59,104 --> 05:40:01,408
But he's one of the people that will run to the aid

6700
05:40:01,664 --> 05:40:03,968
Of the beleaguered sectors whenever it's needed

6701
05:40:05,504 --> 05:40:06,528
Caesar says that even with all the

6702
05:40:06,784 --> 05:40:10,368
Traps and everything they got set up these Gauls are throwing down there

6703
05:40:10,624 --> 05:40:16,768
Bundles of sticks and they got their ladders in the end it's a near run thing at several different places and then the dawn breaks

6704
05:40:17,024 --> 05:40:19,584
Cindy Golic wave subside

6705
05:40:21,376 --> 05:40:27,008
And this melting of the Gauls back to their Camp is portrayed as some historians as the failure of the assault

6706
05:40:27,264 --> 05:40:28,288
Call but other historians

6707
05:40:28,544 --> 05:40:30,848
Suggested that first battle they fought the

6708
05:40:31,104 --> 05:40:33,920
The calvary one that the Germans once again turn the tide at

6709
05:40:34,432 --> 05:40:39,808
I made it impossible for these Celtic infantryman to operate in this big field during daylight so

6710
05:40:40,064 --> 05:40:41,344
Whatever the reasoning

6711
05:40:41,856 --> 05:40:44,672
The relief Army loses its second battle against

6712
05:40:44,928 --> 05:40:48,768
Caesar and the first assault that it makes against the fortifications

6713
05:40:49,024 --> 05:40:50,048
Of the Romans

6714
05:40:50,304 --> 05:40:51,328
Tails as well

6715
05:40:52,352 --> 05:40:53,376
And Caesar says

6716
05:40:53,888 --> 05:40:57,472
That part of the problem here is that Vera can get a Rick's and the troops

6717
05:40:58,240 --> 05:41:02,336
Besieged in the hill Fort never got their act together in time to help

6718
05:41:02,848 --> 05:41:08,736
Dead by the time the relief Force melts back toward the camp at morning there can't get a rich hasn't launched his attack yet

6719
05:41:10,016 --> 05:41:11,296
So that's a traditional garlic

6720
05:41:11,552 --> 05:41:13,600
Coordination problem it's not surprising

6721
05:41:13,856 --> 05:41:18,976
Although there can get her to done a pretty good job avoiding those kind of traditional garlic mistake so maybe it's

6722
05:41:19,232 --> 05:41:19,744
Surprising in that

6723
05:41:21,536 --> 05:41:26,656
Caesar says that the garlic leadership which remember is made up of a ton of different tribes under

6724
05:41:26,912 --> 05:41:32,544
Several major WarChiefs from different tribes as a Native American fan I can't help but think of some of

6725
05:41:32,800 --> 05:41:36,640
The the Chiefs that I've always thought most highly of working together obviously

6726
05:41:37,152 --> 05:41:39,968
Different working together in some giant effort like this

6727
05:41:40,480 --> 05:41:43,040
But they have a conference to try to figure out what's going wrong

6728
05:41:43,296 --> 05:41:45,600
Cuz we've lost two battles in 2 or 3 days

6729
05:41:46,624 --> 05:41:49,184
They were upset about the reconnaissance pointing out maybe the

6730
05:41:49,440 --> 05:41:50,720
Yeah we should have lost so many people

6731
05:41:50,976 --> 05:41:51,744
Both of those traps

6732
05:41:52,000 --> 05:41:53,024
That we didn't know about

6733
05:41:53,280 --> 05:41:55,328
And then they interview the locals who are

6734
05:41:55,584 --> 05:41:56,352
After all

6735
05:41:56,608 --> 05:41:57,888
Garlic themselves

6736
05:41:58,400 --> 05:42:01,984
About the local lay of the land is there some weak spot in the Roman forum

6737
05:42:02,240 --> 05:42:04,032
Vacations turns out there is

6738
05:42:04,544 --> 05:42:07,872
A hill that Cesar couldn't incorporate into his defenses

6739
05:42:08,384 --> 05:42:09,920
The Celts find out about it

6740
05:42:10,432 --> 05:42:16,576
Caesar says 60,000 of them under one of these WarChiefs you got to love it when 60000 is a detached

6741
05:42:16,832 --> 05:42:17,344
Attachment of you

6742
05:42:17,600 --> 05:42:19,904
Your forces on whatever the real number might be

6743
05:42:20,160 --> 05:42:21,952
60 thousand of them sneak

6744
05:42:22,464 --> 05:42:23,744
Over to this week spot

6745
05:42:24,512 --> 05:42:26,048
And then when they launched

6746
05:42:26,304 --> 05:42:28,352
Their attack there will be corresponding at

6747
05:42:28,608 --> 05:42:30,144
Tax launched elsewhere to help

6748
05:42:31,168 --> 05:42:31,680
Interesting

6749
05:42:31,936 --> 05:42:35,264
To wondering whether the people of the time understood what this is

6750
05:42:35,776 --> 05:42:37,312
This is the actual

6751
05:42:37,824 --> 05:42:39,360
In a spin of the roulette wheel

6752
05:42:40,128 --> 05:42:46,272
Right now I mean this is the encounter that will decide and Caesar will say this he says during the fighting to his men

6753
05:42:46,784 --> 05:42:49,856
This is the encounter and they will come down Caesar says to a moment

6754
05:42:50,368 --> 05:42:55,744
It will decide the course of the war that he's been fighting for the better part of a decade

6755
05:42:56,256 --> 05:42:58,048
And given what we know now

6756
05:42:58,304 --> 05:43:02,400
Decide the state of garlic Liberty for the next five centuries

6757
05:43:04,448 --> 05:43:06,496
Caesar says that it is about noon

6758
05:43:07,008 --> 05:43:08,288
Did the surprise attack

6759
05:43:08,800 --> 05:43:09,824
Is launched against

6760
05:43:10,080 --> 05:43:11,872
The weak part of the Roman fortification

6761
05:43:12,128 --> 05:43:18,272
And they say it's the week part because instead of being able to be situated on top of a hill with a good view all around this one party

6762
05:43:18,528 --> 05:43:20,832
Are the camp had to be situated below the crest

6763
05:43:21,344 --> 05:43:23,648
But that means you don't know and can't see what's on the

6764
05:43:23,904 --> 05:43:25,952
The opposite side of the crest of reverse slope

6765
05:43:26,464 --> 05:43:31,328
And in this case if you believe Cesar 60,000 handpicked tribal warriors were

6766
05:43:31,584 --> 05:43:34,656
And around noon they come Galloping over that slope

6767
05:43:35,168 --> 05:43:36,960
Heading towards a part of the camp

6768
05:43:37,216 --> 05:43:41,568
Remember Caesars troops are numerous but they're strung out over the entire length of

6769
05:43:41,824 --> 05:43:43,872
This 14 mile circumference or whatever it is

6770
05:43:44,128 --> 05:43:48,736
There's about two Legions maybe eight ten thousand people right here close by

6771
05:43:49,248 --> 05:43:54,880
With 60,000 sounds crazy so we'll say 30,000 screaming Warriors coming down that hill at them

6772
05:43:56,416 --> 05:43:57,184
As we mentioned

6773
05:43:57,696 --> 05:44:00,256
This isn't all Caesar have to deal with because of course

6774
05:44:00,768 --> 05:44:02,048
They launched a strike

6775
05:44:02,304 --> 05:44:03,584
From the main area

6776
05:44:03,840 --> 05:44:08,448
This great big plane that all the battles been fought on the main Roman defenses well those Kelly

6777
05:44:08,704 --> 05:44:10,240
Come out to play again to

6778
05:44:10,496 --> 05:44:13,824
Historians are divided on whether or not this is a real Attack

6779
05:44:14,080 --> 05:44:16,128
Intended to produce results of its own

6780
05:44:16,640 --> 05:44:18,176
Or whether it's purely a diversion

6781
05:44:18,432 --> 05:44:24,064
But you can't just send a bunch of legionaries from there now to go bolster the week area cuz they're busy

6782
05:44:24,320 --> 05:44:25,088
And

6783
05:44:25,344 --> 05:44:29,952
Because this is the climactic battle you would expect that their can get erect up in the Hill Ford

6784
05:44:30,464 --> 05:44:31,488
With his lean

6785
05:44:31,744 --> 05:44:33,536
Hungry besiege troops

6786
05:44:34,048 --> 05:44:35,840
Would also launch an attack to help to

6787
05:44:36,096 --> 05:44:41,216
So they come down off the hill and they do the same and then they begin to concentrate

6788
05:44:41,472 --> 05:44:43,264
Right near that same

6789
05:44:43,520 --> 05:44:44,288
Weak spot

6790
05:44:44,544 --> 05:44:50,176
That the 60,000 pick the guys from outside are concentrating on this is now the Crux of the battle

6791
05:44:50,688 --> 05:44:56,832
So seizure goes to a place where he can see really well at his job as he sees it and he emphasizes this instead

6792
05:44:57,088 --> 05:45:02,720
Being the heroine commander on the ground wielding a sword and leading his men like King Arthur or Alexander

6793
05:45:02,976 --> 05:45:06,560
Caesar's job is to hold on to the precious reserves and Dole them out

6794
05:45:06,816 --> 05:45:12,960
To wherever they're needed most and he does this but what's going to happen when he runs out of Reserve

6795
05:45:13,472 --> 05:45:16,032
What's going to happen when you have a threatened part of the line

6796
05:45:16,288 --> 05:45:20,640
And no more legionary to send there to bolster it cuz you'll do this several times in the Bible

6797
05:45:22,176 --> 05:45:27,296
Finally the situation of the weak spot in the fortification is so bad it's in danger of being overrun

6798
05:45:27,808 --> 05:45:29,856
Which everyone seems to think would mean the battle

6799
05:45:30,880 --> 05:45:32,160
The Caesar has to go in South

6800
05:45:33,440 --> 05:45:36,768
The last thing he does before he runs to that spot of the line though

6801
05:45:37,024 --> 05:45:39,328
And it turns out to be crucial wouldn't you know

6802
05:45:39,584 --> 05:45:44,192
It'll take a few Legions that he scraped together with some Cavalry including our German friends

6803
05:45:44,448 --> 05:45:49,568
Put them under the command of someone says ride outside the fortifications and whip around

6804
05:45:50,080 --> 05:45:56,224
And try to get behind the enemy that were fighting in that area and see what you can do basically and then seizure

6805
05:45:56,480 --> 05:45:57,504
Grab some more Legions

6806
05:45:57,760 --> 05:45:59,552
I guess that's the bottom of the barrel

6807
05:45:59,808 --> 05:46:00,832
And heads beer in South

6808
05:46:03,136 --> 05:46:06,720
Arrived to the threatened part of the line and you instantly have this

6809
05:46:07,232 --> 05:46:09,792
Feeling that he's just walked into the Alamo

6810
05:46:10,048 --> 05:46:12,608
When it's totally Under Siege annies Davy Crockett

6811
05:46:12,864 --> 05:46:17,728
He didn't have to be at a place where he might die and I'm in a few moments but now he's walked into it

6812
05:46:17,984 --> 05:46:19,264
Of his own free will

6813
05:46:19,776 --> 05:46:21,824
Caesar says that everyone notices the Red Cloak

6814
05:46:22,080 --> 05:46:23,872
Which is why you wear the Red Cloak but he

6815
05:46:24,384 --> 05:46:29,248
He has the same effect that is super celebrity would have on both sides he says

6816
05:46:29,760 --> 05:46:31,040
Celtic and Roman alike

6817
05:46:32,320 --> 05:46:38,464
Remember this is not Modern Warfare where because of the projectile weapons everybody stays as far apart from each other as they can

6818
05:46:38,976 --> 05:46:40,512
Is Ancient Warfare

6819
05:46:40,768 --> 05:46:43,840
We're Wars decided as the Romans always say by hand stroke

6820
05:46:44,352 --> 05:46:46,144
So you got to be close and everyone is

6821
05:46:46,656 --> 05:46:50,752
And Caesar says that they see him arriving and both sides fight harder because of it

6822
05:46:51,776 --> 05:46:52,544
What's more

6823
05:46:53,056 --> 05:46:55,616
A lot of this battle is visible from

6824
05:46:55,872 --> 05:47:02,016
The battle lines of people who are not involved in the fighting so they're cheering to Caesars of the 1st Cavalry battle in the plane

6825
05:47:02,272 --> 05:47:03,552
Both sides are cheering it's like a

6826
05:47:03,808 --> 05:47:06,112
Murderous bloody game of quidditch or something

6827
05:47:06,624 --> 05:47:12,768
In this case Caesar says because of the way that he'll is slope which made it vulnerable to begin with most of the Gauls

6828
05:47:13,024 --> 05:47:16,864
And whatnot in a lot of Romans two can watch this entire fighting are cheering and making noise

6829
05:47:17,376 --> 05:47:20,704
And the way seizure narrates this is It's a near run

6830
05:47:21,472 --> 05:47:21,984
He says his troops

6831
05:47:22,240 --> 05:47:23,008
Throw their Spears

6832
05:47:23,520 --> 05:47:24,544
Fight with swords

6833
05:47:25,568 --> 05:47:27,104
People are cheering and yelling

6834
05:47:27,360 --> 05:47:28,896
I'm Different sides of the battlefield

6835
05:47:29,920 --> 05:47:32,224
Shouts are going up he says from the hillsides

6836
05:47:34,016 --> 05:47:35,296
And then he describes

6837
05:47:36,064 --> 05:47:36,832
This moment

6838
05:47:37,600 --> 05:47:41,184
Again you know you can't help but think the Eagles are coming it's one of those

6839
05:47:41,952 --> 05:47:46,560
You had to be it's like the people who were at the sinking of the USS Indianapolis

6840
05:47:46,816 --> 05:47:52,704
The delivered the nuclear bomb and they're in the water and the sharks are eating them and they've been in there for 5 days and then the

6841
05:47:52,960 --> 05:47:56,288
Rescue plane appears and there's that moment where you just

6842
05:47:56,544 --> 05:47:58,848
Never happy in your whole life to see anything

6843
05:47:59,360 --> 05:47:59,872
Caesar looks

6844
05:48:00,128 --> 05:48:00,640
And he sees

6845
05:48:01,152 --> 05:48:02,944
Among other things

6846
05:48:03,456 --> 05:48:04,992
Is German Allied

6847
05:48:05,248 --> 05:48:08,832
Or mercenary Cavalry maybe the Magnificent 400

6848
05:48:09,600 --> 05:48:10,880
Of the German people

6849
05:48:11,648 --> 05:48:12,416
Behind

6850
05:48:12,928 --> 05:48:16,256
The Celtic Force that's about to overrun that part of the fortify

6851
05:48:16,512 --> 05:48:17,024
Vacations

6852
05:48:18,304 --> 05:48:19,584
And slaughtering suzhou

6853
05:48:21,632 --> 05:48:24,192
It's one paragraph from Caesar arriving

6854
05:48:24,448 --> 05:48:27,008
At the beleaguered section of the fortifications

6855
05:48:27,520 --> 05:48:29,568
To the complete turn of the tide

6856
05:48:29,824 --> 05:48:33,664
From the wonderful Hammond translation Caesar talks about arriving

6857
05:48:33,920 --> 05:48:35,712
On the scene in his Red Cloak

6858
05:48:36,480 --> 05:48:38,272
And no word on whether he

6859
05:48:38,528 --> 05:48:40,832
He was doing the little Darth Vader breast

6860
05:48:41,600 --> 05:48:42,112
And he did

6861
05:48:43,392 --> 05:48:44,416
Caesar says quote

6862
05:48:45,184 --> 05:48:47,488
Cesar hurry to join in the fighting

6863
05:48:47,744 --> 05:48:52,864
The conspicuous color of the cloak he habitually Warren battle proclaimed his arrival

6864
05:48:53,120 --> 05:48:59,264
Because the downward slope swear in Clearview from the heights above the enemy spotted the Cavalry Squad

6865
05:48:59,520 --> 05:49:02,336
Quadrant and cohorted order to follow him

6866
05:49:02,592 --> 05:49:03,360
Enjoined Baba

6867
05:49:03,872 --> 05:49:05,664
A shout went up from both sides

6868
05:49:05,920 --> 05:49:08,992
And was answered by another from the rampart and Defense work

6869
05:49:09,504 --> 05:49:11,040
Are men through their Spears

6870
05:49:11,296 --> 05:49:12,320
Then fought with sword

6871
05:49:13,088 --> 05:49:15,904
Suddenly the Cavalry was glimpsed in the rear

6872
05:49:16,160 --> 05:49:17,952
More cohorts were advancing

6873
05:49:18,208 --> 05:49:19,744
The enemy turn tail

6874
05:49:20,000 --> 05:49:22,048
And the cavalry charge them as they fled

6875
05:49:22,560 --> 05:49:24,096
Massive Slaughter follow

6876
05:49:24,864 --> 05:49:25,376
And quote

6877
05:49:27,424 --> 05:49:30,240
Once again Caesar spare with words but you get the

6878
05:49:30,496 --> 05:49:31,008
The picture

6879
05:49:32,032 --> 05:49:33,312
It was a nightmare

6880
05:49:34,336 --> 05:49:36,640
We don't know how many people died in the fighting the

6881
05:49:36,896 --> 05:49:37,408
4

6882
05:49:37,664 --> 05:49:40,480
That climactic moment in Celtic history

6883
05:49:42,016 --> 05:49:46,368
We don't know how many died afterwards I've seen estimates although Caesars not helping

6884
05:49:46,624 --> 05:49:50,208
At the Romans lost more than 10,000 which is a lot by Roman Standard

6885
05:49:50,720 --> 05:49:51,744
The counts lost way more

6886
05:49:53,792 --> 05:49:54,560
They lost enough

6887
05:49:55,072 --> 05:49:55,840
So that when these

6888
05:49:56,352 --> 05:49:57,632
Survivors of this

6889
05:49:57,888 --> 05:50:04,032
Charge in this attack on this one part of the fortification made it back to their own Camp about a mile away they knew it was over

6890
05:50:06,592 --> 05:50:07,872
And they began to break up

6891
05:50:08,896 --> 05:50:09,408
And go home

6892
05:50:11,456 --> 05:50:15,296
And it's indicative of how hard fought this battle was

6893
05:50:16,320 --> 05:50:19,392
Caesar and the Romans didn't just totally destroy them then

6894
05:50:19,648 --> 05:50:20,160
Caesars

6895
05:50:20,416 --> 05:50:21,440
The pursuit had to be

6896
05:50:21,952 --> 05:50:24,000
Postpone for a little bit while they recovered

6897
05:50:26,048 --> 05:50:26,560
And of course

6898
05:50:27,072 --> 05:50:27,584
Not forget

6899
05:50:28,608 --> 05:50:29,376
There can get a ride

6900
05:50:29,632 --> 05:50:30,400
Breaks his besiege

6901
05:50:30,656 --> 05:50:31,168
Starmie

6902
05:50:31,680 --> 05:50:32,448
Is Allied

6903
05:50:32,704 --> 05:50:34,496
Army of many tribes

6904
05:50:34,752 --> 05:50:36,032
Watch this whole thing

6905
05:50:37,056 --> 05:50:38,336
I now know they're due

6906
05:50:39,360 --> 05:50:39,872
Along with

6907
05:50:41,152 --> 05:50:41,664
Well

6908
05:50:42,176 --> 05:50:42,688
Everything

6909
05:50:43,200 --> 05:50:43,712
Else

6910
05:50:46,016 --> 05:50:47,808
You know I'm always fascinated by the

6911
05:50:48,064 --> 05:50:50,368
Dreams of The Human Experience

6912
05:50:51,904 --> 05:50:54,208
And the emotional and intellectual

6913
05:50:54,464 --> 05:50:54,976
Edge

6914
05:50:55,488 --> 05:50:56,000
Involved

6915
05:50:56,256 --> 05:50:57,280
And some of the Affairs I mean

6916
05:50:57,536 --> 05:50:58,816
Think about if you could take

6917
05:50:59,584 --> 05:51:00,352
A photo

6918
05:51:01,376 --> 05:51:02,400
Of what it looks like

6919
05:51:02,656 --> 05:51:03,680
American Gutter exist

6920
05:51:03,936 --> 05:51:04,448
Point of view

6921
05:51:05,216 --> 05:51:07,008
And when this battle is over as he looks

6922
05:51:07,264 --> 05:51:07,776
Out

6923
05:51:08,544 --> 05:51:10,592
At the Panorama laid out

6924
05:51:10,848 --> 05:51:11,360
Beforehand

6925
05:51:11,616 --> 05:51:15,200
Roman defenses the skyline in the disaster in the foreground

6926
05:51:16,480 --> 05:51:16,992
Print Outlook

6927
05:51:17,504 --> 05:51:18,528
What are your emotions

6928
05:51:19,040 --> 05:51:19,552
As this

6929
05:51:19,808 --> 05:51:21,088
All sinks in

6930
05:51:22,112 --> 05:51:22,880
What this mean

6931
05:51:25,696 --> 05:51:26,976
And once again Caesar makes him out to

6932
05:51:27,232 --> 05:51:29,280
To be kind of a noble savage if you will

6933
05:51:29,536 --> 05:51:30,816
To bring up one of those literary

6934
05:51:31,072 --> 05:51:32,096
Conventions again

6935
05:51:33,120 --> 05:51:33,632
And has

6936
05:51:33,888 --> 05:51:34,656
I can get erect

6937
05:51:34,912 --> 05:51:40,032
Basically saying you know do with me what you will I only did what I did for Golic Liberty

6938
05:51:41,824 --> 05:51:42,848
Is it kill me

6939
05:51:43,104 --> 05:51:45,408
Or hand me over to the Romans alive whatever you

6940
05:51:47,456 --> 05:51:48,480
So Caesar says

6941
05:51:48,736 --> 05:51:50,016
He sets up this chair

6942
05:51:50,272 --> 05:51:55,648
Are you sitting outside this camp and they're bringing prisoners to a notable figures from inside The Siege is they empty this

6943
05:51:55,904 --> 05:51:56,416
Splice out

6944
05:51:56,672 --> 05:51:57,440
And then

6945
05:51:58,464 --> 05:52:02,560
Caesar makes no big deal about their kengarex surrendering

6946
05:52:02,816 --> 05:52:08,960
Which may be closer to the truth some historians say about Adrian goldsworthy says Caesar would never allow himself to be upstaged

6947
05:52:09,472 --> 05:52:11,008
In his own commentaries

6948
05:52:11,520 --> 05:52:16,896
Maybe he's suggesting you should believe the Cassius Dio or Plutarch accounts which are more romanticized

6949
05:52:17,408 --> 05:52:19,456
What sound much more in keeping with

6950
05:52:19,968 --> 05:52:24,576
Where can you get a wreck this status as a noble native tribal chief

6951
05:52:24,832 --> 05:52:25,344
Kind of

6952
05:52:25,856 --> 05:52:27,904
I mean you put an African king

6953
05:52:28,160 --> 05:52:30,208
A great Native American Chief or

6954
05:52:30,464 --> 05:52:34,816
A Pacific Islander King for example meaning this works in a lot of places

6955
05:52:35,072 --> 05:52:37,376
In that same position in the movie

6956
05:52:37,888 --> 05:52:39,168
And it works just as well

6957
05:52:40,704 --> 05:52:42,496
But the sources saying if you eat

6958
05:52:42,752 --> 05:52:44,800
Allow for a little amalgamation of them

6959
05:52:45,312 --> 05:52:47,616
There can get a rich will go and put on

6960
05:52:48,128 --> 05:52:49,408
Is best armor

6961
05:52:49,920 --> 05:52:51,968
Adorn himself with his best weapons

6962
05:52:52,736 --> 05:52:56,576
Get on his horse ride down to Caesar who sitting in the chair

6963
05:52:56,832 --> 05:52:58,624
Do a circle around him

6964
05:52:58,880 --> 05:53:02,208
Get off the horse throw his armor down sit at Caesars feet in.

6965
05:53:02,464 --> 05:53:02,976
What's a word

6966
05:53:04,768 --> 05:53:05,792
To be led away

6967
05:53:07,584 --> 05:53:08,096
The people who were

6968
05:53:08,352 --> 05:53:10,400
We'll throw him into the Roman dungeon

6969
05:53:11,424 --> 05:53:13,728
To wait his fate which will have to

6970
05:53:13,984 --> 05:53:15,264
Intercom after

6971
05:53:15,776 --> 05:53:17,312
Caesar's schedule lightens up

6972
05:53:17,824 --> 05:53:19,872
Because he's got a whole civil war to fight

6973
05:53:20,128 --> 05:53:25,248
And he's going to tear the guts out of the Republic and when he finally gets a chance to settle down and party

6974
05:53:25,760 --> 05:53:30,880
You know he'll have 20 days of Thanksgiving proclaimed in his absence when Rome hears about this whole thing

6975
05:53:31,648 --> 05:53:36,256
But for him to actually participate and enjoy himself it's going to be a while and and when that happens though

6976
05:53:36,512 --> 05:53:38,560
There's lots of different entertainment very Exotics

6977
05:53:38,816 --> 05:53:41,888
Stopping the highlight of this the party favor of party favors

6978
05:53:42,144 --> 05:53:43,424
Will be there can get away

6979
05:53:43,680 --> 05:53:48,032
6 years later paraded in Chains as part of this procession

6980
05:53:48,544 --> 05:53:49,824
Can be taken down to one of these

6981
05:53:50,080 --> 05:53:50,592
Dungeons

6982
05:53:51,104 --> 05:53:52,640
And he will be ritually Strang

6983
05:53:55,712 --> 05:53:57,248
So think about the human misery

6984
05:53:58,016 --> 05:53:58,784
It emanates

6985
05:53:59,040 --> 05:53:59,552
Scrum

6986
05:53:59,808 --> 05:54:00,832
The results of this

6987
05:54:01,344 --> 05:54:02,624
I like the way

6988
05:54:03,136 --> 05:54:05,440
Historian Nick field soda breaks down

6989
05:54:05,952 --> 05:54:09,280
The importance of these days I mean remember earlier in this conflict

6990
05:54:09,792 --> 05:54:13,376
I mentioned that Cesar Soto breaks it down to like a frantic moment

6991
05:54:13,632 --> 05:54:15,424
Practically that the whole battle hinges

6992
05:54:16,704 --> 05:54:19,520
Think about what that moment going the other way

6993
05:54:19,776 --> 05:54:22,336
Which might lead to that battle going the other way

6994
05:54:22,592 --> 05:54:24,640
Would mean over the Long Haul

6995
05:54:25,664 --> 05:54:26,944
Story Nick Fields rights

6996
05:54:27,456 --> 05:54:27,968
About the

6997
05:54:28,480 --> 05:54:28,992
Affect

6998
05:54:29,248 --> 05:54:31,040
Of the Alesia Siege quote

6999
05:54:31,552 --> 05:54:33,856
Battles are singular moments in history

7000
05:54:34,368 --> 05:54:35,904
Productive of strange events

7001
05:54:36,416 --> 05:54:38,720
Much may depend upon a small detail

7002
05:54:38,976 --> 05:54:41,024
The effects of a detail maybe victory

7003
05:54:41,536 --> 05:54:43,840
Any effects of Victory maybe long last

7004
05:54:44,608 --> 05:54:45,632
Delizia was such

7005
05:54:46,144 --> 05:54:47,424
Bring a very real sense

7006
05:54:47,680 --> 05:54:50,496
It's symbolized the extinction of gaulish Liberty

7007
05:54:51,008 --> 05:54:52,544
Rebellions would come and go

7008
05:54:52,800 --> 05:54:56,896
But never again would have gaulish warlord independent of Rome

7009
05:54:57,152 --> 05:54:59,200
Hold sway over the tribes of Gaul

7010
05:54:59,712 --> 05:55:00,736
To gain Liberty

7011
05:55:00,992 --> 05:55:01,760
Beer can get erect

7012
05:55:02,016 --> 05:55:06,112
A strong and popular leader had hazarded everything at Elysium

7013
05:55:06,624 --> 05:55:07,136
And loss

7014
05:55:08,672 --> 05:55:09,184
And quote

7015
05:55:11,744 --> 05:55:14,816
Which begs a more fundamental and difficult

7016
05:55:15,840 --> 05:55:18,400
When you look at the cost of losing

7017
05:55:19,168 --> 05:55:21,472
Was the fight in the goal worth

7018
05:55:23,008 --> 05:55:26,336
The Gauls went from being political slaves to being

7019
05:55:26,592 --> 05:55:27,104
Actual

7020
05:55:27,360 --> 05:55:28,128
Slaves

7021
05:55:29,920 --> 05:55:31,456
Historian Paul gavigan in his

7022
05:55:31,968 --> 05:55:32,480
The Cutting Edge

7023
05:55:33,504 --> 05:55:39,136
A statement that I thought was so deep it itches it makes you question the entire Paradigm when you think about

7024
05:55:39,392 --> 05:55:42,208
Admiring the resistance too hard

7025
05:55:42,464 --> 05:55:45,280
Did NeverEnding never-say-die resistance

7026
05:55:45,792 --> 05:55:47,072
Which is the thing that makes the

7027
05:55:47,328 --> 05:55:49,888
The movie so great as the Native Americans

7028
05:55:50,144 --> 05:55:54,240
In the face of Calamity continue to resist against overwhelming odds

7029
05:55:54,496 --> 05:55:58,336
Write me out come is known the Doom is upon them and they still fight back

7030
05:55:59,360 --> 05:55:59,872
Downtown right

7031
05:56:00,640 --> 05:56:01,152
Quote

7032
05:56:01,408 --> 05:56:05,760
Unfortunately the Gauls protracted the war meaning the garlic War

7033
05:56:06,016 --> 05:56:07,552
49 bloody years

7034
05:56:08,064 --> 05:56:12,160
It has been estimated at least 1 million of the natives perished in the process

7035
05:56:12,928 --> 05:56:13,952
From another perspective

7036
05:56:14,464 --> 05:56:16,256
This was their War of Independence

7037
05:56:17,024 --> 05:56:17,536
But they lost

7038
05:56:18,304 --> 05:56:18,816
And quote

7039
05:56:20,352 --> 05:56:26,496
When you're one of those garlic Warriors looking over the edge of the Hill for to the devastation after

7040
05:56:26,752 --> 05:56:27,776
In the Battle of Alesia

7041
05:56:28,800 --> 05:56:30,848
You realize now what the downside of

7042
05:56:31,104 --> 05:56:31,872
Give me liberty

7043
05:56:32,896 --> 05:56:34,432
Give me death choice

7044
05:56:34,944 --> 05:56:35,456
Going to look like

7045
05:56:38,784 --> 05:56:41,344
And the gavigan quote makes you wonder about

7046
05:56:42,368 --> 05:56:44,160
And what's the proper amount of

7047
05:56:44,928 --> 05:56:46,464
Resistance to offer in the

7048
05:56:46,720 --> 05:56:47,232
Face of

7049
05:56:47,744 --> 05:56:51,072
A conqueror who will take everything from you

7050
05:56:51,584 --> 05:56:52,352
For resisting

7051
05:56:53,632 --> 05:56:57,472
The hard question because one might be willing to sacrifice one's own life

7052
05:56:57,984 --> 05:57:00,032
But balk at the idea of sacrifice

7053
05:57:00,288 --> 05:57:01,568
Pricing for children

7054
05:57:01,824 --> 05:57:02,336
And I mean it

7055
05:57:02,848 --> 05:57:04,384
One of those choices as we said

7056
05:57:04,896 --> 05:57:07,712
Will your pitting things that you literally would give

7057
05:57:07,968 --> 05:57:08,480
You are life

7058
05:57:09,504 --> 05:57:11,040
Or against other things that you would give you

7059
05:57:13,088 --> 05:57:13,856
The hardest choices

7060
05:57:14,624 --> 05:57:15,136
In the human

7061
05:57:15,392 --> 05:57:16,160
Experience I think

7062
05:57:17,696 --> 05:57:18,464
The resistance of

7063
05:57:18,720 --> 05:57:22,304
People that have been called Celtic are lumped in with Celtic

7064
05:57:22,816 --> 05:57:27,424
We continue for many generations and Celtic civilization would 2

7065
05:57:28,448 --> 05:57:31,776
This conquest of the Gauls in the submission

7066
05:57:32,544 --> 05:57:38,688
That this supposedly enforces doesn't mean they're going to stop speaking a Celtic language in these areas for example in their will

7067
05:57:39,456 --> 05:57:45,600
In a people talking about this scourge of these Celtic languages that are still tenaciously holding on centuries

7068
05:57:46,112 --> 05:57:46,624
After this

7069
05:57:47,904 --> 05:57:49,440
Whether or not you classify

7070
05:57:49,696 --> 05:57:51,744
The people in the British Isles and Ireland

7071
05:57:52,000 --> 05:57:53,536
Celtic I'm using air quotes

7072
05:57:53,792 --> 05:57:54,816
But my hands here to

7073
05:57:55,328 --> 05:57:57,376
Seems to be a judgment call best left

7074
05:57:57,632 --> 05:57:58,656
Stop to experts

7075
05:57:59,424 --> 05:58:01,984
But the DNA evidence as we said earlier

7076
05:58:02,496 --> 05:58:03,264
May indicate

7077
05:58:03,520 --> 05:58:04,544
There are things

7078
05:58:04,800 --> 05:58:06,336
That go well

7079
05:58:06,848 --> 05:58:08,640
Into the roots of all the p

7080
05:58:08,896 --> 05:58:09,664
People in that region

7081
05:58:10,176 --> 05:58:11,712
The predate the Celtic.

7082
05:58:11,968 --> 05:58:12,480
Quite a bit

7083
05:58:13,248 --> 05:58:16,320
If there are similarities in them it might be a combination of

7084
05:58:16,576 --> 05:58:18,624
Cross cultural contamination

7085
05:58:19,136 --> 05:58:20,928
With some things that are very old indeed

7086
05:58:21,696 --> 05:58:23,488
None-the-less maybe those personality

7087
05:58:23,744 --> 05:58:25,024
Traits often associated with

7088
05:58:25,792 --> 05:58:28,096
People's aren't altogether gone or made up

7089
05:58:29,120 --> 05:58:30,912
Much of this by the way as you know

7090
05:58:31,168 --> 05:58:32,960
Abilene was rediscovered

7091
05:58:33,216 --> 05:58:38,080
Over the last couple hundred years as part of the Awakenings of nation states and their roots

7092
05:58:38,336 --> 05:58:39,872
Who they are and who they were

7093
05:58:41,664 --> 05:58:43,712
I certainly know that the Irish consider themselves

7094
05:58:44,224 --> 05:58:46,016
You know as Celtic as Kelly gets

7095
05:58:47,040 --> 05:58:49,856
And I happen to know that at least a few of them haven't given up

7096
05:58:50,112 --> 05:58:50,624
The fight

7097
05:58:51,136 --> 05:58:53,440
Maybe the Romans think they won

7098
05:58:53,952 --> 05:58:58,048
But maybe they just got outlasted I remember when I was a

7099
05:58:58,304 --> 05:58:59,072
Kids 7

7100
05:58:59,328 --> 05:58:59,840
2 years old

7101
05:59:00,352 --> 05:59:00,864
V8

7102
05:59:01,376 --> 05:59:06,496
I had an Irish girl who was taking care of us some stereotypically named Maureen

7103
05:59:07,520 --> 05:59:11,104
19 years old 20 years old that You Came Upon me one day

7104
05:59:11,360 --> 05:59:13,664
With my soldiers all set up having a bad

7105
05:59:14,688 --> 05:59:15,712
Romans again

7106
05:59:16,480 --> 05:59:16,992
Celts

7107
05:59:18,272 --> 05:59:19,296
She said who's going to win

7108
05:59:20,320 --> 05:59:23,392
Image of the Romans are going to win did the Romans always beat the couch

7109
05:59:24,672 --> 05:59:25,440
She said oh really

7110
05:59:26,464 --> 05:59:27,744
What language are they speaking

7111
05:59:28,000 --> 05:59:28,768
Concurrently

7112
05:59:29,792 --> 05:59:31,584
Pieces bearing mine back at home

7113
05:59:32,096 --> 05:59:33,376
We're still speaking the IRA

7114
05:59:35,680 --> 05:59:36,192
Corcyra

7115
05:59:36,704 --> 05:59:37,216
Gaelic

7116
05:59:38,496 --> 05:59:39,008
Is it count

7117
05:59:39,264 --> 05:59:39,776
Language

7118
05:59:41,056 --> 05:59:41,568
Note

7119
05:59:42,336 --> 05:59:43,360
But it ain't dead yet
