00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,048
What you're about to hear is part 5

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:04,352
The multi-part series on the first World War

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:09,984
If you haven't caught the earlier episodes and you want to know what's going on it might be worth your time to go back in this

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,752
Listen to them

5
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,544
You've already heard them or you don't care about

6
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:13,824
I got them please

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,616
Join us for

8
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:16,640
Part 5

9
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,176
Blueprint for Armageddon

10
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,272
December 7th

11
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,576
1941

12
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,160
A date which will live

13
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,208
In infamy

14
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:44,800
Leo events

15
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:58,368
Call nist time and place I take pride in the words ich bin ein Berliner

16
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:04,768
Instagram

17
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,896
This kind of examination because people have got to know whether or not their president question

18
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:27,296
If we dig deep in our history and our document and remember that we are not descended from fearful men

19
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,416
It's hardcore history

20
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,048
Earlier in the story

21
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,352
We brought up the often

22
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,888
Quoted phrase

23
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,680
Is that one man's terrorist

24
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,216
Is another man's freedom

25
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,824
We brought it up in relation to the man actually

26
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,848
Launched

27
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,872
The incident.

28
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,408
Spark the first World War

29
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,224
Serbian nationalist gavrilo princip

30
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:57,760
Killed

31
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:02,624
The heir to the austro-hungarian throne the Archduke Franz Ferdinand

32
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,440
Thereby precipitating the crisis

33
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,232
That actually started the war

34
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,792
The austro-hungarian saw print ship

35
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,328
Unequivocally

36
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,096
The terrorist

37
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,656
Is Serbian nationalist

38
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,424
Brethren

39
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,704
Revered him

40
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:23,360
In fact not that long ago a statue was unveiled in Sarajevo where the assassination happened

41
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:24,896
Honoring

42
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,664
The Assassin

43
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,224
So you review

44
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,504
Of the

45
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,296
Motives of these

46
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,832
People really depends on

47
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,136
Who's doing the viewing at the time

48
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,952
Friendship is far from the only figure in the story

49
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,000
Who falls into a similar category

50
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,584
The United States is dealing with one themselves

51
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
Elves

52
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,120
In 19

53
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
16

54
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,032
For example in January 1916 just has the German military is putting the finishing touches

55
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,336
On what will become

56
00:02:54,848 --> 00:03:00,992
The quintessentially horrible Battle of Verdun the quintessentially 20th century style battle

57
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,808
The killing field created by Mac

58
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,344
Artillery the meat grinder

59
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,368
It will be for done

60
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:12,256
The United States is attention is taken off European Affairs by events going on in Northern Mexico

61
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,328
Mexico has been

62
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,912
Convulsed by Revolution since1910

63
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,984
Northern Mexico often becomes one of these

64
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,544
Hotbeds of unrest and instability

65
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,384
And in January 1916 gunmen waylay

66
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,408
A train

67
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,688
In northern Mexico

68
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,760
Now

69
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,784
This is at the

70
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,184
Tail end of the era where train robberies are not uncommon but these gunmen aren't there to rob the train in fact if they go up

71
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,208
Up and down the aisles

72
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
They leave

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,048
The Mexican national the locals alone

74
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,864
But they pull off

75
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,936
Every American from the train that they fine

76
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,264
They find 16 to 18

77
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,032
Workers

78
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,384
Employees of a US Corporation operating in northern Mexico

79
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:06,272
They take these Americans off the train line them up

80
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,552
In front of the track

81
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,112
Forced them to strip

82
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
And then execute

83
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,000
We know this because one of The Americans

84
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,327
Feigned death and got away and told his story

85
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,887
I believe he said that the bodies were also mutilate

86
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,703
This very well may have been

87
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:31,103
An attempt to provoke a response on the part of the US government and if so the mutilation is just part of adding fuel to

88
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
To the fire

89
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:35,199
A little something to make the US government even angrier

90
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,479
At this event

91
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:42,623
And things have been escalating to this point in northern Mexico for sometime groups affiliated with the same gunman had been

92
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:47,743
Hacking isolated Americans and murder here and murder their rape here were there but this was

93
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,535
Upping the ante significantly

94
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,327
None the less

95
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,375
The maneuver accomplished

96
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,399
Nothing

97
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,423
Concrete

98
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,191
Note

99
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,239
So a couple of months later

100
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,263
In March

101
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,799
1916

102
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,591
This group of

103
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,663
Gunman or Outlaws or revolutionaries

104
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,455
If you're looking at it from another point of view

105
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
Up the ante again

106
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
Across

107
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,551
The US map

108
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
Mexican border

109
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
In strength

110
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
More than a hundred

111
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,207
Go after

112
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,023
American interest on the US side of the Border

113
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,863
Culminating in net in an attack on a US city

114
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,399
Columbus New Mexico

115
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
In the middle of the night

116
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,239
They Roar through this town

117
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,311
Shooting looting killing and burning

118
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,871
18 Americans will be

119
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,919
Kill the town will be burned down

120
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
And the

121
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
Bandits

122
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,247
Or

123
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,271
Terrorist

124
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,343
Or revolutionary depending on your point of view

125
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,135
Will escape back into Mexico

126
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53,023
Now is a side note then as now Americans are heavily armed people

127
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,327
And those Bandits paid a high price

128
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,423
Forearm what they did to that town many more of them died

129
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,959
Then Americans died

130
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:05,311
None the less the idea that you were safe and protected

131
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,639
Within the confines of the US borders with shatter

132
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,943
In a way that hadn't happened

133
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,783
Since the Apache Wars in that region attended 30 years previous

134
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,599
The attackers of Columbus New Mex

135
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,879
Chicago were affiliated

136
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,951
With a Mexican revolutionary leader

137
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,999
Known to history not his

138
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,047
Actual name is Pancho Villa

139
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:32,191
Navia almost certainly wasn't in Columbus New Mexico he'd been hurt not that long before

140
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,983
But these gunmen

141
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,263
We're part of

142
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
In his man

143
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,383
And if you look at this superficially

144
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,943
There's a lot of similarity

145
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,479
Between Pancho Villa

146
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,271
And Osama bin Laden

147
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,575
This is not said to insult

148
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,391
Mexican folks who still in some cases Revere

149
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:55,487
Pancho Villa's memory but it's hard to avoid that at least from the American side of things

150
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,767
There are rough

151
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
Analogies that you can

152
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,351
No point to free sample

153
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,143
Like bin Laden

154
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,471
Via had Once Upon a Time been a friend to the United

155
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,799
Someone we thought we could work with

156
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
The news

157
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,127
An armed and trained in hell

158
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
In fact

159
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,967
After

160
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,783
Bat attack in Columbus New Mexico when it was obvious the

161
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,831
Some response had to be put together

162
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
President Woodrow Wilson

163
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,159
American leader

164
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,463
Launches an expedition

165
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,023
A military Expedition into northern Mexico

166
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,095
Since about five thousand men

167
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,887
Across the border

168
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:40,031
There was a a an official leader but he wasn't the guy who actually LED things on the ground that I know that things on the ground

169
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,823
Was an American General named

170
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,847
John Pershing

171
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,919
Whose nickname by the way was blackjack

172
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,527
And a year before to show you how close

173
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:54,111
The United States have been DaVita at one time the year before

174
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:58,207
Pershing launches this expedition to go capture this terrorist Pancho Villa

175
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,255
He loses his whole family

176
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,791
Terrible house

177
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,863
Parson's wife

178
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,167
His little girls they were

179
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,191
Little children

180
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,215
Died in the fire

181
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,007
And

182
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,543
As he was

183
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,335
Wallowing in

184
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,895
Almost Soul crushing grief

185
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,967
Amongst the condolence letters he received

186
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,015
Was one from this

187
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
Pancho Villa

188
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
Person

189
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,831
That he would be chasing

190
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,111
About a year later

191
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,951
There are a lot of interesting things

192
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,743
That this Expedition

193
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,767
Cross the border

194
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,303
Shows not just

195
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,327
Mexicans

196
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,607
Not just Americans

197
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:40,959
But European observers everywhere who all throughout this war

198
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
I wondered

199
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,031
What do United States is going to do

200
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,079
And what their capabilities are

201
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:52,991
All of a sudden they have a US military force in the field to have a look at and measure up against the standards of

202
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,039
Early 20th century War

203
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,063
Be honest

204
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,111
American Endeavor look

205
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,135
Looks like a disaster

206
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,463
It doesn't look a whole lot different

207
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:06,047
Then efforts 30 years ago to the year

208
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,583
That were launched

209
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,143
To go after the last Apache leader to

210
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:14,751
You break off the US reservation system with 40 Warriors

211
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:19,103
I'm going to some of the same country that via and his men were hiding in

212
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:25,759
Looks like a very similar Army just add some motor cars which is what the US

213
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Military

214
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,831
Was employing to give them some Mobility

215
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:34,719
And some airplanes that look like they were invented by the Wright brothers themselves in fact

216
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:39,583
The pilots were trained in some cases by Orville and Wilbur Wright that's how recent

217
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:43,679
You know airplane development is and the US planes are so rickety

218
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,983
And so new and none of them survive

219
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,519
The first week or two

220
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,799
Of operation down

221
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,919
One of the more interesting

222
00:09:54,175 --> 00:10:00,319
Aspects to the US operations in northern Mexico to go get Pancho via is the US doesn't know Northern Mexico in there

223
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,599
Maps are all wrong

224
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:05,439
And so they have leading their army as Scouts

225
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,719
Apache

226
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,047
Chinese Apache

227
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,095
Include allegedly some

228
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,423
Apache Scouts who were amongst the Apache Scouts

229
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,495
The hunted down Geronimo 30 years before

230
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,335
In fact there's quite a connection to a lot of these people involved in this conflict

231
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,663
John General John Blackjack Pershing

232
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
Was a junior officer

233
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,735
Trailing Geronimo

234
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
30 years

235
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
Before these event

236
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,135
It's believed the Pancho via wanted to

237
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,255
Get the US to attack northern Mexico and bog them down in this insane

238
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,791
Saying country to fight

239
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,631
Insane Terrain insane weather conditions

240
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:51,263
And thereby raise his standing among several revolutionary leaders

241
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,055
Vying for control

242
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:58,687
Of the instability in Mexico that have been going on since the 1910 Revolution

243
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,455
Began

244
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:04,063
But if Europeans already had a stereo

245
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,599
Typical View

246
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:11,487
Of the United States is a nation of cowboys and an army mired in an almost old west

247
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,023
Sort of approach

248
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,631
The Expedition into northern Mexico to capture Pancho Villa

249
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
Did nothing

250
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,935
To disabuse them

251
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
Of that stereotype

252
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,031
Too many European Observers

253
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,335
It wasn't just a frontier Army

254
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,663
The United States of America look like they possess

255
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,991
It's kind of a frontier mentality to go along with it

256
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,343
One of the things that was really hard for European planners has been

257
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,135
On both sides of the war by the way

258
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:43,743
Is it a beginning to look more and more like the United States are going to play this huge role in the war

259
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,279
What did that even mean

260
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,679
Can I say to never sent over lots of men to go fight in some European War

261
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,775
It was alien to the American Experience or what they actually do that

262
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,151
There were a lot of European Observer that thought that even if us got into the war they wouldn't send troops

263
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,199
Americans don't do that

264
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,247
And that's

265
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:09,343
Part of what makes that pre first world war United States of America

266
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,415
Hard for modern Americans to understand

267
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
If you know your grandpa

268
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,743
If you're lucky enough to Adventure Grandpa

269
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,767
Explain

270
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,583
You begin to get a real feel

271
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,399
Bring what they're about even if they're very different than you are

272
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,423
But they're real

273
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,959
You can relate to

274
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,311
United States of 1916 is like a great great great great

275
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:34,175
You can read all about it you want those people are different from you and you don't understand and you never knew

276
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,455
You never knew anyone like

277
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,759
The modern United States

278
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,551
Of America is the most

279
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,855
Interventionist great power in the world

280
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,415
In 1916

281
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
It was the office

282
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:52,607
And it had a long mythology connected to its very founding

283
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,911
It reinforced the idea

284
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,959
But that's the way American forum

285
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
Policy should be

286
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,847
Before the United States could involve itself in the first World War

287
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,431
It had to somehow deal with this lasting Legacy

288
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:09,247
Dating all the way back to

289
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,319
Pre-revolutionary days but why don't you just start with the

290
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:16,159
Farewell speech of the first American President George Washington

291
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,743
The speech that was really read aloud

292
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
Once a year

293
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,815
Patriotic fervor

294
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,119
Beach the told Americans

295
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,423
To stay out of Europe's Wars

296
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,007
In the middle of his

297
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:36,383
Goodbye speech to the American people in his resigning from public life he said quote

298
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,223
The Great rule of conduct for us

299
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,831
In regard to foreign Nations is in extending our commercial relations

300
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:48,671
To have with them as little political connection as possum

301
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,487
So far as we've already formed engagements

302
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,047
Let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith

303
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
Here

304
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,095
Let us stop

305
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,911
Europe has a set of primary interests

306
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,727
Which to us have none or very remote relation

307
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
Hence

308
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,311
She must be engaged in frequent controversies

309
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,895
The causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns

310
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:15,551
Hence therefore it must be unwise enough to implicate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary

311
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:20,927
Vicissitudes of her politics were the ordinary combinations in collisions of her friendship

312
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
Or enmity

313
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,791
Our detached and distant situation invites

314
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,095
And enables us to pursue a different course

315
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,167
If we remain one people under an efficient government

316
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,055
The. Is not far off when we made the five material injury from external annoying

317
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:43,711
When we met take such an attitude and will cause the neutrality we met at anytime resolved upon to be

318
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,503
Scrupulously respected

319
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,111
When belligerent Nations under the impossibility of making Acquisitions upon us

320
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,695
Will not likely Hazard the giving us provocation

321
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:56,511
Which we may choose peace or War Hazard interest

322
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,559
Guided by Justice shall Council

323
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:02,911
Why forego the advantages of so peculiar situation

324
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,239
Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground

325
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:10,335
Why by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe

326
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,871
Entangle our peace

327
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,943
And prosperity in the toils of European ambition

328
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,479
Rivalship interest

329
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,247
Humor

330
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
Caprice

331
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:22,111
Is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances

332
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,159
With any portion of the foreign world

333
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,207
And quote

334
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,791
When Americans review those people like demigod

335
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:35,167
And that's peaches reread to America's schoolchildren and reread publicly once a year on the anniversary

336
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,447
You can see

337
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:41,055
But if you were an American who thought the United States should enter the first World War

338
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,359
You have a lot of Mythology to overcome

339
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,175
A lot of ingrained ideological training

340
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:54,623
And lest you think that those are revolutionary sentiments from the beginning of a Nation a lot of times people are very

341
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,439
Emotional and sentimental in Loft

342
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,743
Idealistic when a nation is founded

343
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,279
Cools over time

344
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:06,143
45 years after Washington gave that speech the current president of the United States

345
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,959
A second-generation guy like a

346
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,495
George W bush kind of

347
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,823
John Quincy Adams

348
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,615
Give another one of these

349
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,383
Chinese foreign policy

350
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:24,575
Coining a famous phrase that Americans would use every since you're going abroad in search of monsters to slay

351
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,879
The very

352
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:30,975
Antithesis of the idea that the United States government is going to use

353
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,511
As the slogan

354
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:37,887
To get the United States into the first world war John Quincy Adams in the middle of Warren his speech just dealing with

355
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:42,239
What the country's foreign policy should be 45 years after Washington

356
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,031
Gave his speech said quote

357
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,359
Speaking about the United States here in the feminine pronoun

358
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
White quote

359
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:54,015
Wherever the standard of freedom and Independence has been or shall be unfurled

360
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,599
There will her heart her benedictions and her prayers be

361
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:01,183
But she goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy

362
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,767
She is the well-wisher to the freedom and Independence of all

363
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,583
She's the champion and Vindicator only of her own

364
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,143
She will recommend the general cause

365
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,679
By the countenance of her voice

366
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,495
And the benignant sympathy of her example

367
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:20,895
She well knows that by once enlisting under other banners than her own where they even the banners of 4 in in

368
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
Independence

369
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,199
She would involve herself

370
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:27,807
Beyond the power of extrication in all the wars of interest and intrigue

371
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,623
Have individual avarice Envy and ambition

372
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,903
Which assumed the colors

373
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,951
Can you strip the standard of freedom

374
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:38,559
The fundamental maxims of her policy would insensibly change from Liberty

375
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,583
Divorce

376
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,959
The front light upon her brows with no longer being with the ineffable Splendora freedom and Independence

377
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:49,567
But in its stead would soon be substituted and Imperial diadem

378
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:54,687
Flashing in false and tarnish luster the murky Radiance of dominion and Power

379
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,247
She might become the dictatress of the world

380
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,319
She would be no longer the ruler of her own spirit

381
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,111
And quote

382
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
This kind of

383
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:08,767
Historical Legacy of idealism this mythology if you will that Americans

384
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,607
You know had reinforced all the time provided a natural counterweight

385
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,399
4patriots

386
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,703
To choose a side that seem to be

387
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,775
Do opposite of what patriotism normally

388
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,079
Implied anura patriotism

389
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:27,967
Was a key part of nationalism it's the and grabbing of the flag sometimes and pushing your Nations glory and and and

390
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,503
And borders farther

391
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,319
That was true in the United States to

392
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,623
Everybody's human the same sorts of

393
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:38,463
In a rallying cries off and work on Americans that work on other people

394
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:44,863
But you also had this refuge for people who were patriotic and who could take an anti-interventionist position

395
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:49,983
And couch it as much in the flag as those were suggesting the real Patriot

396
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,823
You know joined up and fought the Spanish in Cuba for example

397
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,615
As Theodore Roosevelt

398
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,943
The former president of the United States and and

399
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,247
Volunteer for that Spanish

400
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,271
American War

401
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,575
You know kept taking the opposite viewpoint

402
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:08,415
Going to the United States of America lived in a different time than those founding fathers

403
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,975
And it real patriotism in real man

404
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,303
Would be ready to join the first world war in the United States is

405
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,583
I'm looking like a

406
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,887
Powered by not being involved

407
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,983
The Theodore Roosevelt is not the president in 1916

408
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,031
But he's needling the guy who is

409
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:27,615
A guy from the other party a Democrat named Woodrow Wilson

410
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,151
One of the most

411
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,991
Enigmatic and hard to get your mind around figures

412
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,783
In the story

413
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,367
And part of the reason that Wilson is so hard

414
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,927
To figure out is because the historians don't agree

415
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:45,535
The majority of historians have always taken Wilson sort of at face value

416
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,095
And portray him as

417
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:52,447
One of the most if not the most idealistic president in American history

418
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,799
A guy who is so peace-loving he's virtually gone DS

419
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,383
And a man who did everything he could

420
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,687
To keep the United States out of War

421
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,967
And the fight for this

422
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,271
Wonderful just fair peace after

423
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,039
That's the

424
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:10,879
Sort of the Goodwill Goodwill send in the evil Woodrow

425
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
Wilson Insurance

426
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,439
Have some historians see them

427
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:18,047
The other historical campus smaller but very vociferous very loud and growing

428
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:22,911
And those are the people who for a lot of domestic reasons it should be pointed I don't like Woodrow Wilson at all

429
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,191
And often

430
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:30,079
You know escribe Sinister or Vino motives for him doing what he was doing

431
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,615
And the Sea man

432
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,431
Who wanted to get involved with the allies

433
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:38,015
Who sought peace for his own vainglorious reasons

434
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,295
Who was

435
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,319
A

436
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:44,415
Schemer and a person who hid behind a mask that promised

437
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,999
You know idealism in peace and they were German generals for example

438
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,023
Or never

439
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,863
Falling for that story that Wilson was some Bambi deer in the Headlights

440
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,959
On the world stage and always thought that was just a really good mask

441
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:01,311
It is Machiavellian scheming hid behind making him even more.

442
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,359
His disguise was better

443
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:10,271
Unless I'm not going to wait as a fan of History into which Wilson I believe with the real Wilson but look at how it adds to the

444
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,807
Uncertainty of the whole thing

445
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,343
What is the sky all about

446
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:19,744
Now I personally think that the air of mystery that surrounds Woodrow Wilson

447
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,328
Make some more interesting character and he's a giant

448
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:27,680
Enigma that's quickly becoming perhaps the most important single individual

449
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,240
In the story by the end of 1916

450
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,800
But you know I didn't have to live with them

451
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,920
The people in this tale he's not a character he's a world leader

452
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:41,760
And what the United States does in this war might decide to conflict

453
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,808
So the stakes couldn't be higher

454
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,368
Winston Churchill

455
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,416
Writing after the first World War

456
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:54,048
She's got a very interesting view on Wilson it's hard to describe you can see he's he's walking on eggshells sometime

457
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:59,680
But he says this guy we didn't know anything about it when he comes out of Academia basically

458
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,728
Age is only in the American system

459
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,800
Do you get these people that can come from totally outside

460
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
Politics

461
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,872
A complete unknown Eagles in Britain

462
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:14,272
Such a prime minister would have spent years in the in the House of Commons or what-have-you you know working their way up there would be in the pub

463
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:17,856
Buckeye the whole time they would be an unknown quantity by the time they got the top job

464
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,952
He Marvels at the fact that Woodrow Wilson is an unknown

465
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,256
You know the most powerful man

466
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,792
In the United States

467
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:29,376
And quickly becoming the most important single figure

468
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,192
In the war Churchill writes about Wilson quote

469
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,240
In all his strength

470
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:38,336
And in all his weakness in his nobility and in his foibles he was

471
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:41,664
In spite of his long academic record in brief governorship

472
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,688
An unknown

473
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,296
And I'm measured quantity to the mighty people who made him their ruler in 1912

474
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,368
Still more was he a mystery To The World At Large

475
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,416
Writing with every sense of respect

476
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,720
It seems no exaggeration to pronounce

477
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,512
The action of the United States

478
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,328
With its repercussions on the history of the world

479
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:05,472
Depended during the awful. Of Armageddon upon the workings of this man's mind and spirit

480
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,288
To the exclusion of almost every other Factor

481
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:14,432
And then he played a part in the fate of nations in comparably more direct and personal than any other man

482
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
And quote

483
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,016
That's why we're talking about

484
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,320
The United States so much in this afternoon

485
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,880
And if one of the other

486
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:26,208
Parts of the Wilson story that are interesting is when you get

487
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:29,024
Human beings in positions of great power and authority

488
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,584
Often times their little quirks

489
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,376
Or idiosyncrasies

490
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,168
Or characteristics

491
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,728
Can make-or-break history

492
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,032
I mean we all have little

493
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,848
Things about us that might be quirky or idiosyncratic

494
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,200
Because we're not in positions of power and authority they don't really make much of a difference if

495
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:52,064
If I don't Hitler leave the military after the first World War II decorated Corp

496
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,392
And goes and opens up a sausage shop in Munich

497
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,416
Is corks

498
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:59,232
And idiosyncrasies and characteristics

499
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,024
Don't make a big difference on the world

500
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,584
You probably never hear about them they only affect

501
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,120
In other people he have contact

502
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:11,264
But you take that same figure and you making the iron-fisted dictator of one of the Great

503
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,568
20th century Nations on the planet

504
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,408
And all of a sudden that man's quirks and idiosyncrasies and characteristics

505
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,456
Can create a deadly Holocaust

506
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,528
Now Wilson didn't have those kind

507
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,064
The characteristics at least

508
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,856
I haven't heard that even from the evil witch

509
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,464
But he did have characteristics that impacted this whole situation one was

510
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:33,536
He was almost always convinced that he was right

511
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:38,656
The paraphrasing here we said something to the effect of one that he felt pity

512
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,984
4 people who had different opinions than him play knew they were wrong

513
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:47,360
You can watch the way he operates in government and he's a supremely gifted politician

514
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:52,224
But what time those people are unwilling to let other men

515
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,992
Carry out

516
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:56,064
You know their policies and end their programs

517
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,648
Because they know they could do it better and you can see that from Wilson to

518
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,952
After the war

519
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:05,280
The man is going to become the British prime minister game David Lloyd George

520
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:09,120
We'll have to sit by the French military leader on one side

521
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:15,776
And the president of the United States on the other and he said it was like sitting between Napoleon on one side and that was the French leader

522
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,056
Jesus

523
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:17,824
On the other

524
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,616
That was Woodrow Wilson

525
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:24,736
And Jesus was probably more the way Wilson saw himself

526
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,296
George was trying to convey

527
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,320
And the way others

528
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,880
Negotiating

529
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,416
With the savior

530
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,464
Can require a debt

531
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,048
And Wilson's demeanor

532
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,168
And so the professorial air of superiority and that I'm always right

533
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,240
Kind of Savior are about him sometimes

534
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,008
Robbed

535
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:50,848
Some people the wrong way and certainly influence the way

536
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,640
That Wilson handled things

537
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:56,736
And there were several big challenges to American neutrality

538
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:00,064
It Wilson had to deal with an all were especially acute

539
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,344
In 1960

540
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,416
One involved American lives

541
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,720
The other involved American money

542
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,256
And the last involved

543
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,792
An American election

544
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,584
Start with

545
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:14,144
Perhaps the number one most obvious

546
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:19,008
Thing sucking United States into the whirlpool The Vortex of the first World War

547
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:23,104
And it was something that was so obviously doing that you can feel

548
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,736
The momentum even now reading the history books about this sort of slide into a war because

549
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:33,600
The Germans use of this Thoroughly Modern science fiction almost weapon the submarine

550
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,672
I have a submarine with creating conditions where

551
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,768
A couple of Americans here and there every now and then we're dying on ships

552
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,072
Every now and then it was worse than that

553
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,864
When the Lusitania went down

554
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,656
Which was a Titanic like

555
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,680
Liner

556
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,984
To a submarine torpedo

557
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,288
More than a hundred Americans went down with that ship

558
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,336
How long

559
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,872
Any Nation put up with that

560
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,944
The problem is is that the US would complain

561
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,480
And work something out with the Germans

562
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,528
Tensions with drop and then a month later

563
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,576
Month-and-a-half later boom it happens again

564
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,368
It's like a sore

565
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,928
Kept getting poked with a needle before it was

566
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,952
Able to heal

567
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,232
And yet

568
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,328
Wilson kept making the conditions more and more

569
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,888
Impossible to fulfill so those

570
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:24,544
Anti wilsonian historian to say no no you misunderstand Wilson was trying to create the conditions that the Germans couldn't help

571
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,104
Violate and then get the United States into the war

572
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,664
And then claim it was forced upon the America

573
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,736
For example Wilson at one point his administration

574
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:36,320
Which high-minded rhetoric and speeches was defending the right

575
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,880
Of an American passenger

576
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,928
Remember Americans could travel on

577
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,952
American ships

578
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:47,072
Neutral ships in certain times the Germans have sworn they wouldn't go after those

579
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:50,144
Wilson was defending the right of an American to travel

580
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,424
On a British ship

581
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,496
Aura French ship right a belligerent ship

582
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,544
And defending their right

583
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:00,384
Travel on a belligerent ship even if it was carrying munitions

584
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:04,992
And defending their right to travel on a belligerent ship carrying munitions

585
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:08,576
It also was carrying defensive guns on it they could hurt us every

586
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,136
When the Germans

587
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,416
Throw up their hands

588
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,696
And say

589
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:16,000
That's a damn Wilson didn't look like it

590
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:19,072
That's the kind of guy you going to trust with peas

591
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,632
I mean look heated head and their attitude

592
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:24,192
He doesn't hold the British to any of these same

593
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:29,312
Rules he's trying to hold up to the British blockade going to use submarines that use mine

594
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,224
They would mind the North Sea they create the zones where they would stop every line if they could get their hands on make it go to a British port

595
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,784
Search it in a decided with contraband

596
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,624
And Wilson and his administration were pretty darn quiet about that

597
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,976
Occasional protests and nothing more to the Germans just look like rank Hip Hop

598
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:51,072
And to anti wilsonian historian to them it looks like a perfect

599
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,608
Example to show

600
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,656
Really these ideals

601
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,448
That Wilson professed

602
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,032
We're very conveniently ignored when they ran against what he wanted

603
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:05,664
There were other complications that affected what he wanted to

604
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,968
One had to do with perhaps

605
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,784
The most ancient of motivations

606
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,064
I've all economically

607
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,880
The United States

608
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:19,744
Was making a killing on the first world war by 1916 pardon the pun

609
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,560
And it began to affect

610
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,376
It's entire Outlook toward the conflict

611
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:31,520
It's one of the longest term impact by the way of the first World War

612
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,848
The results of which we live with everyday in our modern world

613
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,128
But it's sort of sinks

614
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:39,712
Beneath the radar it's a lot easier to understand the submarine warfare question

615
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,784
And it is the economic transfer of wealth

616
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,808
From Europe

617
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,832
To the United States

618
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,648
This war

619
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,696
Was so total in it

620
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,464
Steaks

621
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:55,072
That these that the sides fighting it found no good reason

622
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:58,144
Not to spend every bit of capital they had to win

623
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,776
When Britain started this war in 1914 she was the richest country in the world

624
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:09,664
It was not long after the era where the phrase the Sun never sets on the British Empire was in Vogue

625
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:14,528
The British Empire Control directly or indirectly about a third of the planet

626
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:19,392
She was wealthy and she's been sucking up a lot of the wealth of Europe for a hundred years

627
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:23,232
During Europe's most dominant time.

628
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,024
On the world stage the era

629
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:30,912
Penal colonies in and post-napoleonic Splendor right the Victorian age

630
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:38,080
And yet when 1914 started the British didn't just have their own bills to pay in this most expensive of all human conflict

631
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,872
The underrot their Dominion

632
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,920
The candidacy Australia the New Zealand

633
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,712
The underworld countries like

634
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:48,832
Italy and paid for almost all their costs during the war the Russians to a lot of other small powers

635
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:52,416
The amounts of money that were changing hands I've seen so many different

636
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,976
Attempts to come up with it all you have to know though is

637
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,000
It's ungodly

638
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:00,096
At one point it was like 75 million dollars a week

639
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,400
In 19

640
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,680
16 money

641
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:10,080
When is it incredible wealth transfer when Britain started buying stuff from places like the United States When The War started

642
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:10,848
Use cash

643
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,128
And goals

644
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,176
1916

645
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,456
We talkin about credit

646
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:16,992
Debt

647
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,344
And if you wanted to think of New York is being like a giant vacuum cleaner

648
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,696
With the sucking hose end in London just sucking out a hundred years

649
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,744
A civilizational wealth

650
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,536
Acquirement

651
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,072
It's not a bad image

652
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:35,936
In 4 years the center of world banking as we send another episode

653
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,216
Is transferring

654
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,008
From London to New York

655
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,568
Same thing for the center of World Trade

656
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,664
And all of a sudden by 1916

657
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,992
Wilson is acquiring a huge amount of power

658
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,552
Because the United States is the banker

659
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,368
And these people are beginning to owe it money

660
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,184
The British realize it at the same time

661
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,744
History Injustice

662
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,768
Don'key rights

663
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,352
About Wilson's new ability

664
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:08,704
Because he controls the purse strings of the Allied side in this war

665
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,520
To dictate any sort of outcome he might want

666
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,080
Donkey rights quote

667
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:19,456
If Wilson desire to force the Allies to the peace table the opportunity had come

668
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,224
And he knew it

669
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,528
On October 3rd 1960

670
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:28,672
Hey British interdepartmental conference noted the nation's utter dependence upon American munitions

671
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,696
Steel

672
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,464
Foodstuffs

673
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,744
Oil wheat

674
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,280
Cotton and lubricants

675
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:37,120
Where do United States to engage in economic reprisals

676
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,424
Britain's war effort with practically stop

677
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,800
Of the five million Pounds Sterling needed to prosecute the war reported to government economist

678
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:49,408
John Maynard Keynes later that week 2 million must come from North America

679
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:55,808
Quotes in a few months time claimed the treasury official the American public will be in a position to dictate

680
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:59,392
Hey to this country on matters that affect us more nearly than that

681
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,416
And quote

682
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,952
The author continues quote

683
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:06,304
Reginald McKenna Chancellor of the exchequer concurrent with cane

684
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,608
Telling the cabinet in late October quote

685
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:15,008
My next June or earlier the president of the American Republic will be in a position if he wishes

686
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,056
To dictate his own terms to us

687
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:22,688
And quote the author says at the end of December McKenna told an American journalist that Wilson could quote

688
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:26,272
Force the Allies to their knees anytime in a moment

689
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,064
And quote

690
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,416
United States in late 1916 is like a bank

691
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,976
And Europe and especially great

692
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:38,560
Britain was the financial underwriter in the whole Allied war effort basically

693
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,840
Always the bank money

694
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,400
I give the bank a lot of power

695
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,448
But there's an old

696
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,472
Lying in bed

697
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:49,568
And if you owe the bank a little bit of money it's the bank who has

698
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,128
If you owe a bank a lot of money

699
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,920
That power goes back

700
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:59,296
To the person that was the money because the bank now has a vested interest in seeing that that person survives

701
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,088
So that they can pay them back

702
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,928
The United States is beginning to worry about what happens

703
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:08,256
If we can't sell this war material any

704
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,584
Or we can get paid for the credit we're loaning out

705
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,680
The US has had a very uncomfortable

706
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:19,264
Sort of prosperity to send on it in the past 2 years

707
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:23,616
In 1914 the first world war breaks out the American economy is not doing well at all

708
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,480
My 1916 halfway through the year the American economy is

709
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,040
Coming along nicely thank you

710
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,856
Some historians have actually called the United States

711
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:40,512
He nation of War profiteers at this point if if Wilson was successful in creating a negotiated peace at the end of May

712
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:44,608
1916 somehow and you wanted it at that point declare the winner

713
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,400
In the first World War

714
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,448
Do you know which two Powers I nominate

715
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,752
I nominate Japan

716
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:57,152
In the United States and the Japanese hardly fought in the War doll and by the end of 1916 the United States had

717
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:57,920
Fought in the War.

718
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:02,272
Those are the victors the Japanese get involved in 1914 for purely

719
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,064
Opportunistic reasons

720
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,160
They can take over all the German Holdings in their neck of the woods and the Germans can't do anything

721
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,208
To get all this territory

722
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,232
For basically nothing

723
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,536
The United States

724
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,560
Is selling

725
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,352
Amazing about

726
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:22,752
Both sides need everything in the Americans will sell to anybody but they can't get their stuff to Germany

727
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:28,128
They still made loans and tried to get stuff to them but by and large the British blockaded shut that down

728
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,944
But you could still trade with the British and we did

729
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,760
And the idea

730
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,832
That that trade might somehow go away

731
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:39,392
Began to filter into the halls of government

732
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:44,256
The prosperity that this war brought the United States created another vested interest

733
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,816
And there are economic historians intend

734
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,864
Storing to look more at

735
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,984
Economic motivation for white countries do things that pointed this is the most important

736
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,312
Undercurrent of why the war was really going the way it was

737
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,896
That is another reason to and this is very pedestrian

738
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:07,040
But Woodrow Wilson in 1916 was an American president faced an election campaign

739
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,856
And this is where the

740
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:13,952
The real uniqueness of the American situation is demonstrate

741
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,768
What is the president do

742
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,560
Who's running for re-election

743
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:22,400
And the big elephant in the living room situation is this war in Europe

744
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,960
When he's facing an electorate made up

745
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,752
Immigrant

746
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,568
A people

747
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,640
On both sides of that conflict in the old world

748
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,968
Historian David Stevenson does a great job

749
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,248
Breaking down

750
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:41,088
Are the ethnic makeup of the United States and showing you

751
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:45,440
All these weird problems that the United States would have if it got into this conflict

752
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,976
That other nations wouldn't

753
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,768
For example he points out

754
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,632
That large chunks of the United States is made up of immigrants are some of these countries

755
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,680
The two main groups that are that are

756
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,960
Problematic

757
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:01,312
For anyone who wants to talk about siding with the Allies in this first World War

758
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,592
Are German Americans

759
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,616
An Irishman

760
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,920
Google Stevenson rice

761
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:06,944
Quote

762
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,784
Support for American neutrality was strongest in the interior

763
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,576
And especially the middle west

764
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,880
Where the German Americans were concentrated

765
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:20,256
I'm home only an insignificant minority favored intervention on the side of the Central Powers

766
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:24,864
US population in 1910 of 92 million he writes

767
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,680
Two and a half million have been born in Germany

768
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:32,032
And 5.78 million had one or two german-born Para

769
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,824
In 1917

770
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:39,200
522 German language newspapers and journals were published in the United States

771
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:42,016
German Americans were the largest ethnic group

772
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,296
In Baltimore

773
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,064
Pittsburgh

774
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,904
Chicago Detroit Los Angeles and San Francisco

775
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,672
And quote

776
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,512
He then goes on to talk about Irish Americans

777
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,560
Who and we didn't even get into this

778
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,584
This is as a person

779
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,400
A partly Irish American descent

780
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:02,240
I would have just gone off on on the whole Irish

781
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:05,312
Uprising the Easter Uprising what happened

782
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:08,896
During the conflict of which the Germans may have had a role

783
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:13,504
The British considered this and especially nasty stab in the bank

784
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,600
Backstabbing during wartime reacted by killing a lot of Irish unit

785
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,952
Killing Irish leaders in the uprising

786
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,072
Infuriating Americans of Irish descent of which there were a ton

787
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,376
That's what your politicians like Woodrow Wilson

788
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:34,496
You have to deal with the fact that you have a ton of Voters who are the only people that can keep you in power

789
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:37,056
Who are really interested in not

790
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,336
Joining the side

791
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,384
Of the Allies maybe or anyone

792
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:44,736
The slogan for the 1916 campaign that's most remembered

793
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,272
On the Woodrow Wilson side

794
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,576
Is the one that said quote

795
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,112
He kept us out of War

796
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,392
And quote

797
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,464
That was a slogan that appealed

798
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,744
2 most America

799
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,072
Wilson's peace oriented

800
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,632
Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan

801
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,680
Had said at one point that New York

802
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,984
And the major newspapers want war

803
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,264
The rest of the country one

804
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,032
Wants peace

805
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,104
If you're an American planner

806
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:15,712
It's interesting how many times you can open up the history books and see references to

807
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:19,040
The uncertainty of what these large immigrant

808
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:22,624
Descendant populations would do if the US

809
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,672
Join the Allied side in the war

810
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:28,512
2.5 million Americans born in Germany

811
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:32,352
What are they going to do when War breaks out of potential terrorists

812
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,888
And so it became

813
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,680
Real interesting issue before the

814
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:38,496
Conflict involved the United States as to whether or not

815
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:43,104
Do United States was unified in the idea that it would go fight on any side in the

816
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,968
Now what do you do if you're one of these American figures

817
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:50,272
Perhaps one of the top politicians

818
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,344
Who want the United States to get into the first World War

819
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:56,928
What's your strategy for dealing with these Americans

820
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,464
Who don't want to go

821
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,256
Want to stay neutral

822
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:04,352
You may be a huge majority of the country during this time.

823
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:10,752
If you're a politician in your used to sort of putting your finger in the wind and going in the direction that people want to go but they don't want to go

824
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,544
Go in the direction you want to go

825
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,848
And what's your strategy for dealing with that

826
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:19,968
The strategy of several of the top political figures in this. What to play the super Payton

827
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,272
Accused

828
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,552
Americans

829
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:26,112
Who disagreed with the idea of getting into the war

830
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,648
As being

831
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,416
Disloyal

832
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,768
Intake for example the former President Theodore Roosevelt

833
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,304
In 1916

834
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,840
Roosevelt is not running for

835
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,656
But he's campaigning and helping

836
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:44,800
The guy who is from his own party that the Republican that's challenging Woodrow Wilson in the November 1916 election

837
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,640
Now Roosevelt is in an interesting position here

838
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,712
Desperately wants to get into the first World War

839
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,528
You think it's cowardly that the US is staying out

840
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,064
He's publicly

841
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,160
Slamming Woodrow Wilson from pillar-to-post for not wanting to get involved in the con

842
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,976
He Compares him on the campaign Trail

843
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:06,304
To Pontius Pilate in Jesus Wilson's neutrality

844
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,840
Is worse than Pontius Pilate

845
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,120
Remember Pontius Pilate

846
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,912
He's the Roman official

847
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:14,496
Who in the Bible sentences Jesus to be crucified

848
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,056
That's a pretty good political

849
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,104
Swam with the president isn't it

850
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,640
But then

851
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:25,760
Roosevelt makes a point to go after what if the time were referred to as hyphenated American

852
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,808
You know people who have a hyphen

853
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,576
Between there

854
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,112
Description of your nationality

855
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:30,880
German

856
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,904
-

857
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,184
Irish

858
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,208
-

859
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,488
Jewish

860
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,768
Hyphen American

861
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,048
And it was a

862
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:42,400
Feeling amongst a lot of Americans that these people weren't real America

863
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,704
That they had conflicted loyalties

864
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:48,288
And it was also this idea that you had to have 100%

865
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,056
Loyalty

866
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,080
To the United States

867
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:56,479
And any consideration with what the ancestral home might want what's equivalent in Roosevelt's on words

868
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,271
Used to being immoral Trader

869
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,087
So how do you deal

870
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:05,695
With the fact that you want the United States to do something that most Americans don't want to do

871
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,743
You slam is traitorous

872
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,023
Those who opposed it

873
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:10,815
Now

874
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,631
Wilson was in a bit of a different position because not only

875
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:20,031
Many historians think they did not want to get in the war maybe but he certainly had a public Persona of not wanting to get in

876
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:20,799
The war

877
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,383
But Wilson didn't like anyone

878
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,407
Who disagreed with

879
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,943
And you can see

880
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:32,831
Wilson's attitude about those who would oppose his policies even in peacetime

881
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:38,463
In his response to a telegram he received from an irish-american there's of hyphenation right Irish

882
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,487
Hyphen American

883
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,511
Leader

884
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,815
In September 1916 the guy name

885
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,095
Jeremiah O'Leary

886
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,911
Ann O'Leary was telling Wilson something that's that's

887
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:53,311
Perfectly logical he's explaining to him that all of these moves that seem to lean toward the Allied side of the war going to be

888
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,127
Issues in the campaign right there's nothing controversial about that

889
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,919
O'Leary's cable said quote

890
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:03,551
Your foreign policy is your failure to secure compliance with all American Rights

891
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:09,951
Your leniency with the British Empire your approval of War loans the ammunition traffic RAC

892
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:10,975
Is in this campaign

893
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:11,999
And quote

894
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,839
Most American political figures would understand that's just

895
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:21,727
Someone from the opposition explaining if that's how the American political system works is nothing wrong with that especially not in peacetime

896
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:25,311
Wilson Road back to Jeremiah O'Leary quote

897
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,103
Your telegram received

898
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:32,223
I would feel deeply mortified to have you or anybody like you vote for me

899
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:36,575
Since you have access to many disloyal Americans and I have not

900
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:39,135
I will ask you to convey this message to them

901
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,671
And quote

902
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,463
In other words

903
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:46,815
Just simply opposed Woodrow Wilson's policies in peacetime

904
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:49,887
Doesn't make you part of the loyal opposition

905
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,423
It makes you disloyal

906
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:54,495
What is a president who feels

907
00:43:54,751 --> 00:44:00,383
The peacetime opposition to peacetime policies is disloyal what's a guy like that going to do

908
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,663
When it's no longer

909
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,991
Well here's a little preview to think

910
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:10,879
We still have laws on the books that we're currently enforcing and using in the war on terror

911
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:13,951
Their President Wilson's response to critics

912
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,511
Put dress him negatively

913
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:17,791
In Wartime

914
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:23,423
Unless you think that this isn't over reaction there may be misplaced

915
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,215
Priorities

916
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,799
It's worth noticing that in late 1916

917
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,359
There are several belligerents in this war

918
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:36,479
Who are most threatened not by Foreign armies defeating their armies

919
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,759
On the battlefield

920
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:40,063
By their own populations

921
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,343
Collapsing from within

922
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,367
Morally

923
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:46,207
Or in terms of their unity and support for the government

924
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:50,047
In an era where more and more

925
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:56,191
Of the armies of these modern twentieth-century States could take a punch and stay on the battlefield fighting

926
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,471
Year after year

927
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:02,079
The chink in the National armor for some of these states was proving to be

928
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,615
The homefront

929
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,431
And nowhere by the way

930
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,967
Do you see a better example

931
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:11,807
I'm just sweeping away of the 19th century mentality

932
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:14,111
When and how the homefront is viewed

933
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:17,439
The homefront of course is a shorthand word for the people back

934
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:21,023
Living their civilian lives and supporting the war economy

935
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:24,863
Helping to make Munitions and all the stuff that helps support those troops at the front

936
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:29,215
In the 19th century in Europe some more genteels

937
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,543
Rivera there were all sorts of Peace conventions in

938
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:35,359
And laws of war meetings to do to help

939
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:41,759
Spare civilians and keep them as far away from the suffering of War as possible that was considered to be a civilization advanced

940
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,087
It's interesting and end

941
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,111
Telling I think

942
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:49,695
To watch that sort of genteel peacetime mentality

943
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:53,279
Crash into the rocks of reality that are the 20th century

944
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,583
We're all of those

945
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,399
Rules look like rainbows and unicorns

946
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:04,543
I mean from another time with gas in each other with univ insecticide Humane Society said that you meant to say

947
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,847
Something you use to spray on human beings

948
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,127
Like their aunts

949
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,967
Are there golden 19th century genteal conventions right there

950
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:14,783
In the same applied to civilians we have the Germans

951
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,367
Using Zeppelin raids to drop bombs on on

952
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:23,487
British cities I mean there goes those nineteenth-century conventions right there and the German bombers who do it

953
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:26,303
Insight this idea that everyone is a combatant

954
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,631
If the homefront is a legitimate Target

955
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,911
In Total War

956
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:35,519
Then so are the civilians going about their daily lives in places like Germany and Austria-Hungary

957
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:39,871
When the British cut off trade to those places they begin to do the

958
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:45,247
Put an entire nation or an entire Alliance

959
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,271
Dance under sea

960
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,343
And one British official actually said you know

961
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:55,999
What's the difference between putting a city under siege which has been done throughout history in the civilian population in that pussy

962
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,279
Mid-City always suffers

963
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,303
Inputting a nation

964
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,071
Under Siege

965
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:03,167
The British clampdown this blockade at the beginning of the war

966
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:06,495
By the middle and latter part of 1916

967
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,543
At long-term Anaconda likes

968
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,335
Strategy really begins to bite

969
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:11,871
And

970
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:15,711
Part of the reason why is the societies are already straining

971
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:19,039
To the maximum to just keep their militaries

972
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,319
In the field

973
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,391
And I think it's easy to forget exactly

974
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:28,767
What does strain on these societies Nawaz because you look at the we know we've often compared

975
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:35,167
The size of these are modern armies to what Alexander the Great conquered the known world with back in the end of the 330 SB

976
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:35,935
BCE

977
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,727
Alexander the Great is a

978
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,495
Core

979
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,055
In one of these modern armies

980
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:46,431
Listen to What a German Army Corps of which they had dozens in the army

981
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,735
Requires to sustain itself

982
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,783
Imagine an ancient economy

983
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,551
Me trying to

984
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,319
Provide this

985
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,623
This is from Hozier

986
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,391
Herve

987
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,695
And his book on the first World War

988
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,463
Quote

989
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:02,303
The Army consumed copious amounts of food and fodder

990
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:06,911
A single core of 35000 soldiers monthly

991
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:09,727
Devoured 1 million pounds of meat

992
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:12,287
600000 loaves of bread

993
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:15,103
189000 lb of fat

994
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:21,247
Or he says 242000 lb of canned meat and 121000 lb of marmalade

995
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:24,575
And he says 73000 lb of coffee

996
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,855
It's horses

997
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,879
Perfect size

998
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:31,231
Needed 7 million pounds of oats and more than 4 million pounds of hay

999
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:38,143
We 18th Army Corps he says for example estimated that it needed 1,000 wagons extending

1000
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:41,471
49 miles to Halt its monthly allotment of bread

1001
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:46,591
It's butchers Slaughter 1320 cows 1100 hog

1002
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,919
And 4158 sheep every month

1003
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:53,759
Taken as a whole he says the German Army weekly

1004
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:54,783
Demolished

1005
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,831
60 million pounds of bread

1006
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:02,207
131 million pounds of potatoes and 17 million pounds of meat

1007
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:05,023
No one in the government or the general staff he writes

1008
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:09,631
Had given serious considerations to such a mammoth needs for a. Of 4 years

1009
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:10,911
And quote

1010
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,727
No no one saw that coming

1011
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,031
Someone from the ancient world I mean

1012
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,823
This could never have been sustained

1013
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:18,847
Before the modern era

1014
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,895
But sustaining it

1015
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:21,919
Tok

1016
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:22,943
All of those

1017
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,479
Necessary

1018
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,503
Foodstuffs

1019
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,807
Out of the civilian populations mouth

1020
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,855
And they were beginning

1021
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:30,879
2 *

1022
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:31,647
Because of it

1023
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:38,815
The winter of 1960 and 1917 will be remembered by Germans forever as the turn up

1024
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:43,167
And that's the winter where the hunger blockade

1025
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,191
Really big

1026
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,727
Astorian

1027
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,751
Eric Thornburg

1028
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:51,103
That's 1916 turn to 1917

1029
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,383
Caloric intake

1030
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:55,455
Wechat already begun to fall in late 1914

1031
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:58,271
Play do about a third of pre-war consumption levels

1032
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:03,391
Money connections and the black market help the lucky ones but even the Upper Crust

1033
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,159
Suffered

1034
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,439
Now quoting a noble

1035
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,999
Woman we are all gaunt and bony now

1036
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,303
We have dark shadows around our eyes

1037
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,399
And I thought your chiefly taken up with wondering where our next meal will be

1038
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,191
Brose continues quote

1039
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:21,311
Poor kid almost disappeared from dinner tables and restaurants where Crow was now serve

1040
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:24,639
Milk was reserved almost exclusively for young children

1041
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:27,967
Butter and sugar could be purchased only in very small quantities

1042
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:31,039
Eggs were rationed to 2 per person per month

1043
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:34,623
And turnips and rutabagas had begun to replace potatoes

1044
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,391
And quote

1045
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,695
Brothers goes into a couple of

1046
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:38,975
Reminisces

1047
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,767
From Germans about what those taste

1048
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,303
Liking then says quote

1049
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:46,911
Inevitably as nutrition level spell bodies to come to a variety available

1050
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:47,935
Like Ricky

1051
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:48,959
Scurvy

1052
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,775
Dysentery tuberculosis and influenza

1053
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:57,919
Estimates place the number of blockade related deaths by Wars end at 730000

1054
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:00,479
Which makes popular outrage understand

1055
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:07,903
Now as with everything in the first world war there are historical dissenters who will

1056
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:08,671
Challenge

1057
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,207
Every aspect of

1058
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:13,279
What's known as the hunger blockade affecting the Central Powers

1059
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,559
But nonetheless

1060
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,863
Important thing to understand is that it

1061
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,167
It creates a dynamic in this conflict

1062
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,191
Forces

1063
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,239
German side

1064
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,519
To do something

1065
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,079
They're the ones

1066
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:28,383
Continually getting less food

1067
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:32,991
Their adversaries the British and the French do not have a food insecurity problem

1068
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:38,367
That Dynamic forces the Germans to do something to change their situation or they'll just strangle

1069
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:40,415
I mean if you're already living through

1070
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:45,535
What Germans are calling the turnip winter in 1916 and 1917

1071
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:49,375
What are they going to call the next winner of 1917-1918

1072
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,679
You don't have to be a genius to see

1073
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,727
That you now have to do something

1074
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,263
To change the state of

1075
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,031
Affairs

1076
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:00,895
German public opinion begins to demand.

1077
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:05,759
Now I should point out that that just pretty much makes them the equal of all the other

1078
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:08,575
Populations of all the other belligerent seemingly

1079
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,879
Doesn't seem like anyone

1080
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:14,463
Particularly happy with the way their government is Prosecuting the war

1081
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:18,047
Regardless of which country you're talking about at least amongst the majors

1082
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,607
In Britain

1083
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,679
At the end of 1960 in their government Falls

1084
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:27,007
And the new prime minister who Rises

1085
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:27,775
Is

1086
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,055
The very embodiment

1087
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:33,919
What voters would vote for if they wanted to shake things up and get somebody different in there

1088
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:36,479
His name is David Lloyd George

1089
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:39,039
Usually just called Lloyd Georgia

1090
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,063
Feisty

1091
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,903
Welshman of a much more working-class background than you normally see in these

1092
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,927
Positions

1093
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:50,815
Might be exactly what in the average dissatisfied with the way the Warriors going British to this and wanted

1094
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:54,399
Now it is a little interesting that only a couple of weeks

1095
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:56,703
It's before Lloyd George gets the job

1096
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:00,799
He's recorded as having said about the Allies in Britain

1097
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,079
We lost this war

1098
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,639
Now he's

1099
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:08,479
In charge of Britain's war effort it's also interesting to note that you could

1100
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:14,879
How how up in the air the outcome of the first world war is in 1916 where you can find leading figures on both

1101
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:17,951
Side who think their side has lost the war

1102
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,511
Nonetheless

1103
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:24,863
The French also get into the game 1960s been a terrible year for them to just as a

1104
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,143
Has been for the British

1105
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:28,703
And they finally find the courage

1106
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:31,775
To get rid of their longtime military leader

1107
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:32,799
The legend

1108
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:33,567
Joseph joffre

1109
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:35,871
He's been living off the

1110
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:41,247
The fumes of his reputation from the Battle of the Marne a long time I think it's safe to say been underperforming

1111
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:45,343
And the French finally they can't fire and he's too much of a legend but they finally so

1112
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,183
Kick him upstairs and promote him to a ceremony opposed to replace him

1113
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:52,767
With the First new French leader since the war started the guy name

1114
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:56,863
The Russian population in public

1115
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,935
Which isn't really supposed to have much of a sway

1116
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,727
Supposedly cuz they live in a

1117
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,567
In a strange sort of autocracy with a part-time legislature

1118
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:09,663
But they're making their feelings known to more on that in a minute

1119
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:11,199
And in Germany

1120
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:14,527
The population just wants a way out of this trap

1121
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,575
Some people would like to see

1122
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:18,111
Efforts made towards

1123
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:20,671
Figuring out a way out of the War Witch

1124
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:25,535
They have people who say this in all the belligerent countries but you have to be careful

1125
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,351
A little while ago we talked about Woodrow Wilson

1126
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:32,447
Suggesting that people who might oppose his policies were just loyal

1127
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:34,239
You could get you thrown in the

1128
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:36,287
Jails in a lot of these belligerent

1129
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:40,895
If you appear to be disloyal so too much peace talk could get you in a lot of trouble

1130
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,967
Nonetheless there was a body of German public opinion

1131
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:45,503
It was pushing for another route

1132
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:48,831
They wanted their government to take the gloves off

1133
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:51,391
Stop playing nice

1134
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,183
With the adversary

1135
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,999
They wanted their government

1136
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:59,583
To unleash the submarines and to heck with what the Americans would do

1137
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:05,983
Germans the American policy look to be a very conniving way to Simply deny Germany

1138
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:09,311
The use of the submarines if you make the rules too restrictive

1139
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:12,127
And then the Americans case the rule basically was

1140
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:18,527
Then an American traveling on some ship gives it some magical protection simply by stepping on board you can't think that she

1141
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,807
Now there's an American on it

1142
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:23,391
That pretty much nullifies the submarine for Germany

1143
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:26,207
At all but if that's the only way

1144
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:30,303
You see a chance to end the war with a German victory over the British

1145
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,327
What is that mean

1146
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,911
Can you let the Americans hamstring you like that

1147
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:40,287
Add to that the fact that a lot of Germans don't really see the Americans all that neutral already

1148
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:45,919
And think that maybe Britain could be defeated in for 6 months before the Americans have a chance to do much of anything

1149
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:51,807
Add to that the fact that when public opinion beers in that direction

1150
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:58,207
There are Germans in the military High command a majority of them that were already thinking that themselves now they have public opinion

1151
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,743
The submarine

1152
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,815
The Americans come in the war

1153
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:08,703
There were German leaders though that didn't like this choice

1154
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:12,031
Wanted to find another option rather than

1155
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:14,591
You know use the sub to get the United States into the war

1156
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,663
Chief among them was a chance

1157
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,199
Germany the top lid

1158
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,735
Pickle guy's name was bethmann-hollweg

1159
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,015
Can we discuss him before

1160
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:27,903
This is all by the way very controversial very complicated very convoluted you're getting the Dan Carlin

1161
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,183
Condensed

1162
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:31,231
Potentially unreliable version of this

1163
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:34,815
But it's a fascinating time in the conflict because

1164
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,863
The politicians

1165
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:40,703
Blood by holding think they find a way to throw a monkey wrench

1166
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:47,359
Into that terrible choice that the allies of sort of voice did the Germans on with the hunger blockade and everything that they got to make a move

1167
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,127
So

1168
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,151
They make a very

1169
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,175
Unexpected

1170
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,991
December 12th 1916

1171
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,271
Bethmann hollweg

1172
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,551
And the Germans

1173
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:56,831
Announce

1174
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,391
That they are prepared

1175
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:02,207
To enter into negotiations

1176
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,743
Twin the war

1177
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:08,607
Now it should be pointed out that such

1178
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:12,447
Calls for peace in discussions about peace and going on since the war started

1179
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:14,495
Woodrow Wilson had stepped up

1180
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,287
Pretty much right at the beginning and said

1181
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:18,079
I'll meet you at anytime you want

1182
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:24,479
They were attempts by both sides in the war to try to make A Separate Peace with somebody else and maybe get

1183
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:28,831
In one of the Allies above your enemy to drop out of the war but those are peace terms

1184
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:32,159
Just to get an edge in the conflict are not peace terms to end the war

1185
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,951
The Germans were making the first

1186
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,743
Apparently serious

1187
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,023
Certainly public

1188
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:37,791
Offer

1189
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,071
To sit down

1190
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:42,143
And start talking about the issues that kept the conflict going

1191
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,191
This was

1192
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:45,727
Huge

1193
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:46,495
Shock

1194
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:53,407
Not exactly to the Wilson Administration they've been getting some information fed through some back channels that the Germans might be ready to

1195
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:57,503
To do this but the Americans felt that they were going to unleash this being peace proposal

1196
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:02,623
When the Germans do what they preempt Woodrow Wilson's version and he have to rush his out you know

1197
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,903
About a week later

1198
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:10,303
A little bit miffed that the Germans stole his Thunder a little bit but all of a sudden in December 1916 after this horrible

1199
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,071
Here

1200
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:12,863
There were peace proposals on the table

1201
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:16,191
And it puts everybody in a really uncomfortable position

1202
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,519
German to taking a real chance by the way

1203
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:21,823
By trying this proposal route

1204
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,175
If this is a high-stakes card game and I often think of the warden in terms like that

1205
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:32,575
The Germans because of the hunger block and everything else are forced to play a card and everyone thinks they're going to play that really high-risk high-reward

1206
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:34,111
More dangerous car they have

1207
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,671
The unrestricted submarine warfare card

1208
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:39,743
Instead they play a potentially equally

1209
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,023
Perilous card

1210
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:43,583
The one that no one's expecting they play the peace card

1211
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:47,167
The peace card can blow up in your face if you don't play it deaf

1212
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,703
Case in point

1213
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:55,103
What are your enemies going to think when you become the first power to come forward and start talking about stopping the war

1214
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,407
They're going to think you need to

1215
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,199
What's more

1216
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:03,807
Is it danger your own people might think that too and you spend a lot of effort in this War 2

1217
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:06,623
Stiffen their backbone and keep their resolve in place

1218
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:09,951
How much are you going to undercut it if you become the first power to seek

1219
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:10,719
Peace

1220
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:14,303
So this whole thing has to be worded very careful

1221
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:16,607
And it is but almost

1222
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,911
In such a way to give your

1223
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:23,007
To give you whiplash as you're moving your neck between

1224
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:27,103
The humanitarian side of the German Chancellor's proposals

1225
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:30,687
And the side is filled with overwhelming hubris

1226
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:34,527
The Germans talk about what this war is doing the civilization

1227
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:41,183
And how they be willing to get into conversations about ending it but they're still invincible and they're going to win the war and they don't need to do this

1228
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:45,279
And what would the terms be on the other side maybe you could say that

1229
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,047
Allies

1230
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,119
Historians have argued about

1231
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,655
The motives behind this

1232
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:54,239
Ever since but the truth of the matter is if you look at this like a card game

1233
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:58,079
There were some good reasons for the Germans to play that piece card

1234
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:00,127
Whether or not it was realistic

1235
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:02,175
And whether or not the other side except

1236
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,991
And some historians say this was

1237
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,039
What it was intended to do the whole time

1238
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:09,343
Provide some diplomatic cover

1239
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:12,159
For the start of the unleashing of the submarine

1240
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:15,743
To go and say hey we'll talk about peace

1241
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:18,303
Then when it's rejected be able to turn around

1242
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,839
To your own people

1243
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:26,239
And say you know you better give up those hopes of an easy piece we just tried they won't do it this is a fight to the end stiffen yourself

1244
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:33,151
And also to show the world including the neutrals and including the people on the other side of the wards population that we're not the ones

1245
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,431
Keeping this Carnage going

1246
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:37,247
We could have been over but your side wants to keep fighting

1247
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:40,063
Most especially

1248
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:42,367
Is an attempt to maybe

1249
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:47,743
Influence public opinion in the neutral countries especially the most important neutral country the United States

1250
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:50,815
Which has so many german-americans in it

1251
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:55,423
That they were more than 520 German language newspapers as we said

1252
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,983
What do you think the editorials are going to be

1253
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,519
In those newspapers

1254
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:03,359
After Germany makes a peace proposal and the Allies SWAT it down

1255
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,175
That's going to put some pressure

1256
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:12,575
On the US government to stay out of the war and that's going to influence American public opinion over who the bad guys and who the good guys are

1257
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:14,879
That may have been the overriding intention

1258
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:17,439
Others German peace efforts but nobody knows

1259
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,719
It may have been

1260
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:19,487
A

1261
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:23,071
Serious attempt to at least start negotiations going

1262
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:29,727
And to take a position that didn't make you seem too vulnerable at the outset the Germans pick the right time to do it it was right after

1263
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:32,799
The capital of Romania fell to the central powers are there

1264
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:35,359
Negotiating from a position of strength here

1265
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:37,151
And the Allies SWAT it down

1266
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,199
They have to

1267
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:47,903
The problem with asking these powers to State publicly what their War aims are in order to create a piece

1268
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:52,511
Used to show that the war aims of these Powers have gotten so out of hand

1269
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:55,839
That they bear no resemblance to anything that could be negotiate

1270
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,143
Historian Gwynne Dyer

1271
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:58,911
Rodan

1272
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:01,215
As we may have cooled it already on this program

1273
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:01,983
Quotes

1274
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:06,335
What the governments of Europe who found themselves trapped in the first Total War discovered

1275
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:10,687
To their dismay was it at the means used to fight the war total

1276
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,967
And so must be the end

1277
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:16,319
It was almost impossible to stop short of total victory for one side

1278
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:18,367
And unconditional surrender for the other

1279
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:19,903
And quote

1280
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,439
The old

1281
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:26,559
Territorial exchanges and the paying of reparations

1282
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,583
And the

1283
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,911
Giving up or acquiring of colonies

1284
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:33,727
Was a nineteenth-century sort of Warrant

1285
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,263
It sounded out of place

1286
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:39,103
In the twentieth century of the British or the French or the Germans or anyone

1287
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:42,687
Had said that their War aims involved a little change of territory

1288
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:46,527
A little reparations money or what have you it would have seemed so out of

1289
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:48,063
Portion to the cost

1290
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,367
There would be real Danger

1291
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:55,231
That the public would think that's what the country was fighting for wasn't worth what the public was paying for

1292
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:58,815
In addition to that occur

1293
01:02:59,071 --> 01:02:59,583
Course

1294
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02,143
There were some craving territorial

1295
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:05,727
Ambitions involved in no one wanted to State those in fact

1296
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,007
Outside

1297
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,311
Promised other people territories

1298
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,847
Two allies of theirs

1299
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:12,127
For example

1300
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,663
The Italians were promised

1301
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:17,759
Territory from the austro-hungarian Empire once the war was over

1302
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:21,087
The British couldn't very well say that was a Warframe

1303
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,367
And still not look like

1304
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,391
Cynical

1305
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:26,207
Games been in this war when everyone by the way

1306
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,743
On all these sides

1307
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:31,327
Is a cynical games with but you can't show that to the public what's more

1308
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:36,447
The idea of War aims that stopped short of defeating the enemy unconditionally

1309
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:39,263
Clash with your propaganda

1310
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:43,615
This is a war that using such 20th century ideas

1311
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:46,687
As a war to end all wars

1312
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:51,807
And a war to make the world safe for democracy

1313
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:56,159
It's not a war to acquire a few colonies on the Mediterranean and some oil in the Middle East

1314
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,183
Based on the breakup of

1315
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,719
The austro-hungarian empire

1316
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:05,631
It's a war for these high-minded ideals the problem is is if your propaganda portrays the Germans as the second coming of the month

1317
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:06,399
Ingles

1318
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:09,471
Well actually the Huns is the word the propaganda use

1319
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:10,751
And their baby killers

1320
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:11,775
And nurse

1321
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:16,383
Executioners and none rappers and all the things that propaganda makes them out to be

1322
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:19,711
How can you possibly sit down and sign a piece of paper to compromise

1323
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,991
That's what them and have peace again

1324
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,807
When the Vatican

1325
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,111
Was I at this time trying to

1326
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:28,671
Help create the conditions were peace could happen

1327
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:33,535
The Vatican kept telling the powers to live up to those pre-war agreements to make war

1328
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,559
Less horrible

1329
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:38,399
And they were saying that they were favoring this not because

1330
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,679
They were

1331
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:40,703
Idealistic

1332
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:41,471
Because

1333
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:44,287
If these powers kept doing everything in there

1334
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:50,943
Edomite to destroy one another they were going to hate each other so much that there was going to be no space Andres mutual respect left

1335
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:52,735
To carve out a piece lighter

1336
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,807
The Germans were no happier by the way

1337
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:57,599
Estate their warframes Pub

1338
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:59,647
For the exact same reason

1339
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,975
There was an implied threat in

1340
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,791
Included when the Germans came forward with this attempt

1341
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,327
To get negotiations started

1342
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,375
An implied threat was

1343
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:12,447
If negotiations didn't happen in Warren fruitful

1344
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:15,263
They would play the unrestricted submarine warfare

1345
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,591
The peace negotiations

1346
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:20,895
Are over by the end of January

1347
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:21,663
Weary

1348
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:24,479
In the middle of January actually on January 20th

1349
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:26,271
Wilson makes a famous speech

1350
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,551
A vase

1351
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:30,623
Speech where he calls for peace without victory

1352
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:35,487
And your so-called peace without victory speech

1353
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:39,583
On the 22nd of January when essentially he already knew

1354
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,655
It wasn't going to happen Wilson lays down the kind of P

1355
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:45,471
Peace that Europe will have to broker to end the first World War

1356
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:47,007
If it's to be a lasting

1357
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,799
You can't be one of those pieces

1358
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:52,383
You know where the knife is turned in one side is left hating the other

1359
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:58,271
When you think about how the first world war ended and how it's sold the seeds for the Second World War

1360
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:00,575
Wilson sounds like Nostradamus with some

1361
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:04,927
In this part of the speech where he talks about you know having to have this

1362
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:05,951
Kind of peace

1363
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:06,975
He says quote

1364
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:09,535
I'm speaking only to face reality

1365
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:12,095
Add to FaceTime without soft concealment

1366
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:15,423
Victory would mean peace forced upon the loser

1367
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:18,751
A Victor's terms imposed upon the vanquished

1368
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,799
It would be accepted in humiliation

1369
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:21,823
Under duress

1370
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,127
Add an intolerable sacrifice

1371
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:25,407
And would leave a sting

1372
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,431
A resentment

1373
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:29,247
A bitter memory upon which terms of Peace would rest

1374
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:32,575
Not permanently but only as upon quicksand

1375
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:35,135
Only a peace between equals can last

1376
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:38,463
Only a piece the very principle of witches equality

1377
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:41,023
And a common participation in a common benefit

1378
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:44,863
The right State of Mind the right feeling between nations

1379
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:47,167
It is as necessary for a lasting peace

1380
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:50,495
As is a just settlement of vexed questions of territory

1381
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:52,543
National Allegiance

1382
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:54,591
And quote

1383
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,895
So you not only calling

1384
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:57,919
Peace

1385
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:02,271
Where nobody can claim a victory we just stop fighting

1386
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:04,575
And begin negotiating

1387
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:06,367
For a postwar world

1388
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:08,927
In which Wilson and envisions

1389
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:12,255
A new international Global structure

1390
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,791
To enforce

1391
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,095
Global Peace and harmony

1392
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:20,703
So that we never have a first world war again as I said for those historians who suggested

1393
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:21,727
Wilson

1394
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:25,055
Is out to make Wilson the biggest historical figure he can

1395
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,591
That would be a heck of a leg

1396
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,615
I can see if he can pull that

1397
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:31,455
But instead

1398
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,479
Within a couple of months

1399
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:35,039
The United States will be in the war

1400
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,367
And from the Allied perspective

1401
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:40,159
Not a moment too soon

1402
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:43,743
The end of 1916

1403
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,279
Early 1970

1404
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,583
We've been spending quite a bit of time

1405
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:48,351
Setting

1406
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,375
This.

1407
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:50,911
In the war up

1408
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:55,263
But this. In the war is probably the most important 6 months in the last

1409
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,031
Hundred years

1410
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:01,151
People talk about the first world war this transformative moment

1411
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:03,199
And the after effects that we're living with

1412
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:05,759
No even now all around us

1413
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:09,087
But the most transformative moment in that conflict

1414
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,367
What's about to happen now

1415
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:12,415
And

1416
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,183
You know

1417
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:17,023
I can't help it find some sort of metaphor analogy approach to looking at it but I mean it

1418
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,559
It's like we have this tree

1419
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,839
And they've been shopping at it

1420
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,631
For two years and at the end of 1960

1421
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,423
Falls over

1422
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:27,263
Winston Churchill says three ingredients acting together

1423
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:29,823
Create what he calls the second climax

1424
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:30,847
Of the war

1425
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,127
In the spirit

1426
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,687
We dealt with two of those ingredients

1427
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,455
The Americans

1428
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:36,991
And the submarine

1429
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,039
3-ingredient

1430
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,063
Involves Russia

1431
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:45,695
Dealing with what you could

1432
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:47,743
Safely call the first rate

1433
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:51,327
The countries that were at the top of every

1434
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,863
When The War started

1435
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:55,679
The rich powerful cohesive Unified

1436
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:58,495
In a top-of-the-line States the Frances the Britain

1437
01:08:58,751 --> 01:08:59,263
The Germany's

1438
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:02,591
But if they are worn down by

1439
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:03,615
You know this

1440
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:04,639
Many years

1441
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:05,663
This war

1442
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,687
To this point

1443
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:10,015
To where they are now where the Germans are undernourished

1444
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,575
For lack of a more provocative term

1445
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:17,439
What must be the situation that the countries that weren't for 3

1446
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:21,535
Great powers in the war started the ones that had challenges and were struggling in various areas

1447
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:24,351
How are two years war treating them

1448
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:26,911
Will the Italians

1449
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,983
Have open disagreements about peace

1450
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:30,751
In there

1451
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:31,519
Government

1452
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:36,127
Been in the trenches there are pamphlets distributed by

1453
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,919
Socialist that say

1454
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,199
Next winter

1455
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:41,247
Not another man in the trenches

1456
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:43,039
The generals are not

1457
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:45,087
Please with Outlets hard to blame

1458
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,111
They're unlikely

1459
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:48,927
Your 10th or 11th Battle of the isonzo river

1460
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:49,951
Fighting over this

1461
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:53,535
Torturous mountainous terrain with create an environment

1462
01:09:54,047 --> 01:10:00,191
You know it's a little teeny horrible war in and of itself with all these unique things I mean just to give you one example

1463
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:06,591
In the mountain war that the Italians are fighting the austro-hungarian when shells hit their all carved into rock mean instead of

1464
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:07,871
Trench is a lot of times

1465
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,407
They've blown out like

1466
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,687
Chasms for

1467
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:13,759
Cover but when the shells hit the Rocks the Rocks just

1468
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:14,527
Winter

1469
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:19,135
Creating like a secondary amount of shrapnel that's just horrifying and then when you get wounded

1470
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,159
Your way up

1471
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:26,303
Six seven thousand feet you got to be brought down through the mountainous alpine conditions to the nearest weigh station.

1472
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:29,375
They still find Frozen things up there even today

1473
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,911
The horrible conflict

1474
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:35,263
And by 1916 the Italians are unlike their 10th or 11th

1475
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:40,127
Version of it and all they have to show for this more more dead people they wouldn't be human

1476
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:42,943
If they weren't starting to get a little fed up with this in fact

1477
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,223
That just puts them on

1478
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:45,503
Car with how it seems

1479
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,807
The populations of all the belligerent country

1480
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:48,575
Preacher doing

1481
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:51,647
The house Austria-Hungary doing remember they're the ones that

1482
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:58,047
You know kind of over at Ground Zero when this whole War got started they're the ones who had the Archduke that got himself assassin

1483
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:59,071
They're the ones that

1484
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:04,703
Hino sent that uncompromising letter to the serbians they're the ones that sparked this war how they doing

1485
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:06,495
Well I bet they wish they hadn't

1486
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,543
They're in terrible shape

1487
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:11,615
The venerable emperor that ruled there for so long

1488
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:14,431
The benign face of stability and finally died

1489
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,711
To be

1490
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:17,759
Succeeded by

1491
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:24,159
The next Emperor was a much younger man and look at his country and says that the Germans this war has to end in nineteen

1492
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:24,927
17

1493
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:27,487
In Austria-Hungary is worse than done

1494
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:36,447
This new emperor during this coming year will go behind the Germans back to the Allies reportedly

1495
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,263
And try to sew to sell them out

1496
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:43,871
And the Germans find out about it and then they never going to take their eyes off Austria-Hungary gain all the sudden

1497
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,943
Annie's brothers in arms don't trust each other anymore

1498
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:49,247
It was very interesting move that a lot of pee

1499
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:50,015
People talked about

1500
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:56,159
It's almost like World War version of Rudolph Hess flying to Great Britain you know to make A Separate Peace for

1501
01:11:56,415 --> 01:12:00,255
Nazi Germany in the second world war just this weird little Endeavor and all it does is

1502
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:03,327
Learn Austria-Hungary Germany's mistrust

1503
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,631
And then you have

1504
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:06,655
The Russians

1505
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:11,263
Are the Russians from the very start of this

1506
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:13,823
This war even before this war for a very long time

1507
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:16,639
Have been this contradiction in power

1508
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:19,967
In one sense they are massively

1509
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:23,551
Powerful in a military sense theoretically they are terrifying

1510
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:27,135
And yet they are at the same time

1511
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:30,207
So fatally flawed in the underpinning

1512
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:37,119
Anything Rush is doing in this world he seems to be like riding some real or we're walking a tightrope and and Design

1513
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:38,911
Blaster wounded any moment just

1514
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,447
It was an unsteady

1515
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:41,727
So the situation

1516
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:44,287
There's a story that sort of shows this

1517
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,079
This contradiction in terms

1518
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:49,151
The military leader the Russian military leader Bruce seal

1519
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,175
You'll have

1520
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:55,551
Inoffensive named after him in 1916 we talked about it nowhere near as much as it deserves

1521
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,831
In the last program

1522
01:12:57,855 --> 01:13:00,415
This once again puts the Russians out there

1523
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:04,767
In a good light shows you what they can do when they get that their act together and they are

1524
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:05,791
Devastating

1525
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:12,191
750000 casualties in the austro-hungarian Army mortally wounded it is

1526
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:12,959
Frightening

1527
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:14,239
What the Russians can do

1528
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:16,287
You know when things go the right way

1529
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:19,359
A Priscilla tells a story that shows you just how

1530
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,127
Bailey

1531
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:24,223
You compromised everything is you how Rodney insides are he says

1532
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:29,087
At the height of this offensive when everything's going so well he's receiving unsigned

1533
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:29,855
Letters

1534
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,391
From his own soldiers

1535
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:34,719
Telling him that if the fighting doesn't stop soon

1536
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:35,999
They're going to kill him

1537
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:40,095
Russia's been

1538
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:42,655
Having internal problems

1539
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:43,935
4

1540
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:44,703
Decade

1541
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,263
The currents are

1542
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,799
Nicholas II

1543
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:55,711
Bizarre Bazaar emperor of the old name that goes back hundreds of years but they still call

1544
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:58,271
Call Nat because that's essentially what the office still is

1545
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:02,623
In his name is official long title it says he's the article

1546
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,415
And

1547
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:06,463
Even if the Russian Duma has been given

1548
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,999
1% in the

1549
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:10,047
Dodge Dart 99% of the power

1550
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:14,655
He's a and an example of the old world

1551
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,447
At its most Royal

1552
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:19,263
And yet he knows

1553
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:20,543
How

1554
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:22,847
Rightfully fragili underpinnings are

1555
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:25,151
When he was a mere adolescent

1556
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:27,199
He saw his grandfather

1557
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:29,759
Carried into the Royal Palace

1558
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:31,551
With his legs

1559
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:32,831
Orangish red

1560
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,647
His groin gone his stomach ripped out

1561
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:39,487
A Spaceman gold and he's bleeding out on the Royal carp

1562
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:41,791
Pretend and the royal family including

1563
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:42,815
Nicholas

1564
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:46,655
The second the man who will be Nicholas II watch their grandfather died

1565
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:47,935
15 minutes

1566
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:50,495
Even killed

1567
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:52,287
In an assassination

1568
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:54,847
Another one of these stories where

1569
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:57,407
You know there's always out in his bullet-proof

1570
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,175
Sled

1571
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:04,831
And I can a bomber throws a bomb it sounds a little like the whole Sarajevo thing the kicked out the first World War II bomber throws a bomb to bomb

1572
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:07,135
Goes off kills people who are not the target

1573
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:10,463
The target comes out in this case is our comes out to look around

1574
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,511
And there's another bomber in the crowd

1575
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:16,351
Supposedly the Tsar at the time it said something about enough thank God

1576
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:21,471
But nothing happened in the other assassin that he's throwing the bomb and I'm saying it's a little too early to thank God

1577
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,007
Boom

1578
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,823
Any bleeds out in the Royal Palace floor

1579
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:29,919
While the Czar who will be commanding Russia as the autocrat

1580
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,455
In the first World War

1581
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:37,087
As a 13 or 14 year old boy watches he knows how dangerous the job is

1582
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:39,391
He knows that there's

1583
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,671
A violin

1584
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,439
Current

1585
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:42,975
Rottenness

1586
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,767
That opposes his sister

1587
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,559
He's dealing with it all the time

1588
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:53,215
One of the things that makes this story so interesting that was when you're dealing with one person

1589
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:54,495
With almost

1590
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:55,519
Total power

1591
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:57,055
As we said earlier

1592
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:59,359
Their little idiosyncrasies

1593
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:02,943
Make a big impact on history

1594
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:05,247
In the case of Nicholas II

1595
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:08,063
The autocrat of all the Russians right

1596
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,879
His idiosyncrasies involve

1597
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:12,671
Some things that

1598
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:13,951
I think most

1599
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:18,559
People out there who have children can at least relate to a little bit of

1600
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,631
It's interesting that there's a

1601
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:22,655
Judas story

1602
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:25,215
The chest has a

1603
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:25,983
Personal

1604
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:26,751
Tragedy

1605
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:28,287
Wrapped up in it

1606
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:29,823
This is an example why you

1607
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:31,103
Can't reduce history

1608
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:32,383
2

1609
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,663
Some sort of mathematics

1610
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:35,199
Or some sort of

1611
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:38,783
Predictable set of rules are there human beings involved

1612
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:41,087
In the case of the Tsar

1613
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:43,135
It's a fascinating story

1614
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:43,903
Play The Man

1615
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:47,999
Just so you know I mean this is how you were wise this is the Old Europe is being destroyed

1616
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:50,815
He's the first or second cousin with everybody

1617
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:58,495
He's the first cousin with the King of England he's the second cousin with the Emperor of Germany I mean he's related to every

1618
01:16:58,751 --> 01:16:59,775
Everybody and his wife

1619
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,567
Is the first cousin

1620
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:03,359
Of the king of England I mean

1621
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:05,919
A little incestuous Maybe

1622
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,735
But that explains why

1623
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:10,015
The czar

1624
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:12,319
And his wife mourn her in a second

1625
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,623
Who only have one son

1626
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:16,671
Give birth to a son

1627
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:17,951
Who's a hemophiliac

1628
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,023
It runs in the family

1629
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:27,423
Queen Victoria who sort of the the the descended that all these people can trace their Heritage back you said that this did not run

1630
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,191
And her family

1631
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:29,983
But it seemed to

1632
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:33,823
Victoria of course was German in her roots

1633
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,871
So was the czar's wife is Irina

1634
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:37,919
Alexandra

1635
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:40,223
Both of them

1636
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:41,247
Lovage

1637
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:45,343
And I say this because you know you would think today would of course they did

1638
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:48,415
Listen this is an era where especially amongst nobility

1639
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:54,815
You often had three political marriages you also have these very old-fashioned things that were very common back then with a husband and wife really didn't love me

1640
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:55,839
Each other the husband was out

1641
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:58,143
You know with all the girls all it wasn't like that

1642
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:01,215
With Nicholas and Alexandra this is what this was a lobster

1643
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:01,983
Really why

1644
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:04,031
And not just between the two of them

1645
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:05,567
But with their children too

1646
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:08,639
They love their children the way we think of

1647
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:11,711
Every modern person loving their children all the way they should

1648
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:14,271
And that is not to say that people in the past didn't

1649
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:20,927
Although you find a lot of examples in the royal family throughout history with the father hardly sees the Sunday. It's not like that with

1650
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:24,511
They take an active day today roll

1651
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:27,327
In their parenting and they wrote letters to each other

1652
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,863
Constantly Road in English

1653
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:31,935
But they both spoke well

1654
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:34,239
The tsarina was German but but

1655
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:37,311
She spoke Russian she spoke English the Czar spoke everything

1656
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:41,663
And they communicated in more than a thousand letters with each other will you get a real feel for the

1657
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,711
I'm one of the things

1658
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:45,503
They are absolutely terrified

1659
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:48,319
Is there Sun who's got haemophilia

1660
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:51,647
He's their only son he's the next

1661
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:52,415
Zar

1662
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:56,767
And he is almost certainly going to die young from this

1663
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:00,351
I just so you know haemophilia is a disease where your blood.

1664
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:03,679
Not to get too technical cuz I couldn't explain it anyway

1665
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:05,727
But but basically

1666
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:10,079
Any little cut or bruise has the potential to spiral out of control

1667
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,359
The normal

1668
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:14,687
In a rough-and-tumble of a of a young child's life

1669
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:15,455
Will kill you

1670
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:19,039
And in this era especially

1671
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:21,343
Parents just assumed almost Adesa

1672
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:22,879
And these two

1673
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:25,695
Parents as any parent we would think of today probably

1674
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:26,719
Could hardly handle

1675
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:27,487
I thought

1676
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:30,815
And they were looking around for cures and trying to find them

1677
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:33,119
And eventually they found someone

1678
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,655
Who seem to be able to

1679
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:35,679
Fix their son

1680
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:41,567
And because of the little idiosyncrasy connected to who this person tended to be

1681
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:44,383
World history completely halt

1682
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,247
And in the funny part about it is and I know it

1683
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:53,087
If it is a tragic story that it's an interesting story to bring human story

1684
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:55,647
But there are elements to it that would make a good

1685
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,183
In a sitcom

1686
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,975
Or a good movie premise

1687
01:19:59,231 --> 01:19:59,999
As I walked

1688
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:03,583
2 in to talk about this today I remember the movie that was kind of based on the premise

1689
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:07,167
Nick Nolte and Eddie was called Down and Out in Beverly Hills

1690
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:12,287
And the story is about a vagrant kind of homeless kind of guy who by hooker by crook ends up

1691
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:15,360
You know he's living with a rich family in Beverly Hills

1692
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:17,152
Really fabulously Rich family

1693
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:22,528
And of course because of the dichotomy and their lifestyles in the way they view the world hilarity ensues right

1694
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:24,576
That's kind of what happened

1695
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:25,344
What does r

1696
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,904
And his wife and their hemophiliac son

1697
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:30,976
When they found somebody who seem to be able to heal him

1698
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:34,560
That somebody was basically the equivalent of the vagrant

1699
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:36,608
In Down and Out in Beverly Hills

1700
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,656
They were bringing

1701
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:39,936
A peasant

1702
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:40,960
In

1703
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:43,264
To have a look at their six son

1704
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,336
Hasn't name is Gregorio

1705
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:53,504
And history has always been I mean he's a hardcore history personality if you've ever found one

1706
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:56,320
And the fact

1707
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:58,624
That this government was run

1708
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:02,464
99% by one guy and his wife

1709
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:04,256
Opens up the door

1710
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:08,352
Tua Grigori Rasputin being able to have the effect on his

1711
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:12,960
Historian Peter Hart does a good job of

1712
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:17,824
A framing all the various things that seem to be going on at once including what I just talked about

1713
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:20,384
The way Russia is sort of a giant

1714
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,664
Hamstrung by the

1715
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:23,712
Ancient system of theirs

1716
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:28,576
So the guy like Rasputin could make a difference in the idiosyncrasies of a single individual or two

1717
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:31,392
Could come to the fore he writes quote

1718
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:36,512
The Russian Homefront was gradually collapsing under the Intolerable strain of War

1719
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:42,144
The czarist government did not have the flexibility necessary to cope with the plague of economically

1720
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:45,472
Political and social problems that affected the land

1721
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:50,080
The Tsar himself received any form of democracy is a threat to his regime

1722
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:56,736
And rather than introducing an increase measure of liberalism with more attracted to the idea of a total disillusion

1723
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:58,784
I've even the tokenistic Duma

1724
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,856
Appointments to positions of considerable Authority

1725
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:08,256
We routinely assigned by the Tsar on the grounds of either naked favoritism or the authoritarian creden

1726
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:09,280
Angels of the candidate

1727
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:15,936
Spy scares rage through Society with particular suspicion falling on any Russian general unfortunate

1728
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:17,472
Enough to have a dramatic name

1729
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:21,568
Meanwhile incompetence and Corruption blossomed unfettered

1730
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:26,432
Wanted to Center the Czar was publicly embarrassed by the adherence of the tsarina Alexandra

1731
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:28,480
To the Ludacris Cult of Rasputin

1732
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:30,784
An unhinged religious Mystic

1733
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,088
With a penchant for irreligious Pursuit

1734
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,648
The whole despotic system of government

1735
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:38,464
Was resting on just a few weak individuals

1736
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:41,024
Russia was being hollowed out from within

1737
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:44,608
And the vacuum at the center with creating dangerous instability

1738
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:46,144
And quote

1739
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:49,728
Know everything that Peter heart says

1740
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:53,056
Could have applied to several other countries in this

1741
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:54,848
Everything except

1742
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:55,616
One thing

1743
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:57,920
Depart dealing with

1744
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,528
Grigori Rasputin's agrate wildcard

1745
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:04,832
The story in a quintessentially Russian figure

1746
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,416
I mean it's hard to imagine him anywhere else and he is

1747
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:10,464
Outrageous and Larger than Life

1748
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,072
Peter Hart is great historian as he sounds a little bit like

1749
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:16,608
He can't understand

1750
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:19,424
Another czarina the wife of the czar

1751
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:24,288
Kind of falling for this guy and he's stick he calls it the Ludacris Rasputin cult

1752
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:30,176
I mean if you two had her here to ask her she would probably said you but I saw him do it

1753
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:31,968
Multiple times

1754
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:33,248
Do what

1755
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,784
Save my son's life

1756
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:39,648
If you saw somebody save your kid's life multiple times

1757
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,976
Don't you think it would be hard to have your

1758
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:45,024
Logic override what you think you saw

1759
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:47,328
I've seen

1760
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:49,376
Cold-hearted

1761
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,656
Total real estate

1762
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:53,984
Turn into people seeking quack remedies

1763
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,264
These when they were dying of cancer

1764
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:57,568
They were looking for hope

1765
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:01,152
If your kid is dying you're looking for help what if somebody asks

1766
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:01,920
He comes through

1767
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:04,736
I mean what is that

1768
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:06,272
Quack treatment

1769
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:07,552
Fourier

1770
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:08,832
Relatives

1771
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,368
Terminal cancer

1772
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:11,648
Cure the cancer

1773
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,976
That's the weirdness in the

1774
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:15,744
Story

1775
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,048
The royal family the emperor and his wife

1776
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:21,376
Run into this guy Grigori Rasputin first

1777
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:22,400
A1905

1778
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:24,704
About 10 years

1779
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:26,240
Time.

1780
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,008
We are in the story

1781
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:30,848
And there's an entry by the Czar and his diary we met a man of God today

1782
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,176
And so starts this relationship

1783
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:34,944
Between

1784
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:39,552
This person who was born a poor peasant in Siberia

1785
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:41,600
An uneducated everything

1786
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:43,392
And his relationship

1787
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:45,952
With two of the most Royal figures in the world

1788
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:52,352
I mean the king and queen of England that's the level were talking about with the tsar and tsarina imagine today's queen of

1789
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:54,912
No power at all picking up some

1790
01:24:55,168 --> 01:25:01,312
Person off the street who's almost homeless and not even the London homeless person someone from the sticks up in the north of England somewhere some

1791
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:03,616
Small town bringing them in the palace

1792
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:06,688
And having them live with you for a while instead of questioning them

1793
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:07,968
On the state of things

1794
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,504
What are the people saying

1795
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:13,856
And oh yeah letting the minister medicinally to your child

1796
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:16,416
It's a crazy story

1797
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:20,512
And the only reason Rasputin becomes important you can hardly imagine important

1798
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:22,560
In most of the other systems of government

1799
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:24,864
Because Russia is so autocratic

1800
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,656
If you capture the czar

1801
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:28,448
You capture the country

1802
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:32,032
Rasputin made the Royal Family

1803
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:34,336
Emotional hostages

1804
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:40,992
Whether that was intentional or otherwise is debatable historians disagree

1805
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,552
There's some historians who think this is a person who stalks

1806
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:44,320
It was a blast

1807
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:47,392
Man of God with the special powers to do

1808
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:51,744
You know religious oriented things that other say he's a charlatan and he knew he had

1809
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:57,888
The royal couple sort of emotionally blackmail but there was nothing anyone can do about it there's a great quote from the Tsar

1810
01:25:58,656 --> 01:26:00,704
You're in the middle of the story with Rasputin wear

1811
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,776
One of his advisors says something to the effect that you got to get rid of this guy

1812
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:06,592
And the answer is there's nothing I can do about

1813
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:10,176
And a lot of historians have always interpreted that

1814
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:13,760
To mean that the Tsar is basically saying he can't stand up to his wife

1815
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:17,856
You know that she wants him and there's nothing that the zarkin do you won't stand up to his wife

1816
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:23,488
But you know some historians have come out recently and said you know it could easily mean there's nothing he can do about it

1817
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,584
Because there's only one person who can save their son's life the heir to the throne by the

1818
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:29,888
If you really believe that

1819
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,704
Disputing God got you in a weird position

1820
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:36,544
Between 1905 when the song Rasputin first meet

1821
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:39,104
And where we are in the story right now

1822
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,384
Late 19c

1823
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,152
16

1824
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:45,504
Rasputin has been worming his way into the czar's family

1825
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:46,784
Pretty consistent

1826
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:51,392
Not a circle of friends his family does Ry these get together sometimes we would

1827
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:52,928
His wife

1828
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:54,720
And his kids and Rasputin

1829
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:57,024
Now there are back step

1830
01:26:57,536 --> 01:27:02,912
Sometimes the relationship goes sour for a while usually cuz Rasputin who is a Serial misbehavior

1831
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:04,960
Does something particularly outrageous

1832
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:07,520
Either embarrassing is are so much that

1833
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:11,360
That that he does with his underlings are continually telling him to do and

1834
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:12,896
And sends Rasputin away

1835
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:15,200
Or legitimately upsetting him

1836
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:18,528
Nonetheless everytime he manages to break the relay break up

1837
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:20,064
I guess you could say with Rasputin

1838
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:23,648
Inevitably Alexi his son the heir to the throne

1839
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:24,672
Will get sick again

1840
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:27,232
Necessitating a return

1841
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:28,000
Rasputin

1842
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,536
He's like a cigarette habit

1843
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:30,304
You can't kick

1844
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,120
Now this Rasputin characters

1845
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:34,656
On so many levels

1846
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:38,752
You know you have to think you were dealt some interesting card by faith

1847
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,312
To be able to Parlay

1848
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:42,336
Your gifts

1849
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:44,384
From his upbringing as a

1850
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:48,224
As an uneducated peasant with no money in the middle of nowhere

1851
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:50,528
To where you are in

1852
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:51,552
The royal

1853
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:54,880
And when you see a picture of him

1854
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,672
You see a little bit

1855
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:59,232
I mean he was 5 foot 9 inches tall

1856
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:00,768
Pretty normal

1857
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,096
He had dark black oily

1858
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,120
Hair

1859
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:06,400
Parted in the middle

1860
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:13,056
Unkempt mustache unkempt beard interesting way of dressing I mean if you if you would Photoshop his picture

1861
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:14,848
Going to the back

1862
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:17,408
How many number of 1970s heavy metal album

1863
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:20,480
I don't think I would be able to look at the band's photo on the back

1864
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:24,576
And know that you did that he would have been perfectly as the basis of any number band

1865
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:25,600
Back then

1866
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:29,696
Heck if you were a lead singer and you named the band after him

1867
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:36,096
It would fit in on any lineup you could think of it as a heavy metal festival when did I mean you know this weekend only blacks

1868
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:38,656
Sabbath Iron Maiden Motorhead and Rescue

1869
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:41,472
Most amazing

1870
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:43,776
And you can tell because normally

1871
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:46,592
You can't tell from photos a hundred years ago

1872
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:49,664
In a certain qualities of individuals it just gets lost

1873
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:51,200
True the layers of

1874
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:55,552
Fuzziness in black and white and all that but if you catch the right photo arrest

1875
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:57,600
You need to be caught just the right time

1876
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:58,880
You can see

1877
01:28:59,136 --> 01:28:59,904
What the eyes were

1878
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:04,512
Cuz they jump out of the black and white photo from a hundred years ago at you even now

1879
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:08,096
The whites of his eyes were said by witnesses to be extra White

1880
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:10,144
And again it kind of looks that way in summer

1881
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:15,264
Is eye color Dazzle people to the point when we get multiple descriptions that all countries

1882
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:19,872
Some people say blue some people say brown some people say gray some people say multi

1883
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:22,944
When you read about his sort of

1884
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:25,248
Tick like weigh

1885
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:30,624
Of walking moving his nervous habits the way he wouldn't talk for a while then all of a sudden you get this

1886
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:31,392
This

1887
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:36,256
Stream of sometimes unrelated conversation spiced with sexual innuendos

1888
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:40,096
I mean there's a part of you think of an I just read a book on the late writer Hunter Thompson

1889
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:40,864
They sound like

1890
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,680
In a room together they would look like they were impersonating each other

1891
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,752
Rasputin is a combination

1892
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:50,592
A person who looks to be a very devout

1893
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:52,896
Religious figure

1894
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:53,664
From

1895
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,968
Russia's Christianity in orthodox

1896
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:56,736
Christian

1897
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:58,272
And a drunken hour

1898
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:01,088
Apparently that's not

1899
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:07,232
That unusual in in the Russian tradition especially in the Siberian tradition where Rasputin's from

1900
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:08,768
Directions

1901
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:10,304
Offshoot some sex

1902
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,072
Cults

1903
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:15,936
Who have these interesting beliefs and I don't understand him I wouldn't wouldn't try to explain them but apparently

1904
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:19,776
It involves needing to send sometimes in order to get the right kind of

1905
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:21,568
I repentance working for you

1906
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:22,592
And and

1907
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:28,480
There are rumors of orgies that take place as part of the rights for these religions an end some historians not mode

1908
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:29,504
But some have tied

1909
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,040
Rasputin some of those

1910
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,600
Strange sex in strange beliefs

1911
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:36,672
I would make sense in one in one sense. Because there's no

1912
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:37,696
Conversations

1913
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:40,768
That have been recorded with his wife and yes he was married

1914
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:47,168
You know when she would walk past him and in the middle of a town with other women and they would all see him having sex in the open with some towns

1915
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:47,936
Woman

1916
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:50,752
She would say something to the effect of well that's just his cross to bear

1917
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:52,544
He's got to do that you don't even like

1918
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,824
Piedmont to judge

1919
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:54,848
He has to do

1920
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:56,896
He's helping us

1921
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,504
I'm sure if I was Rasputin I would want to sell it.

1922
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,528
That way let's put it that way

1923
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:04,832
2

1924
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:05,600
Gossip

1925
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:06,880
Column type

1926
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:09,440
Offenses that he's always hard with

1927
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:11,744
RR extreme drunkenness

1928
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,792
And sexual outrageousness

1929
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:15,072
And usually

1930
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:16,096
In combination

1931
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:18,912
The rape charges

1932
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:25,312
That are brought to the tsar and tsarina is attention with a household staff is accusing him of going after them he's absolutely

1933
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:31,712
Brazen he will sit down next to a figure from the royal family and put his arm around her at a party with all the

1934
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:33,760
Aristocrats Erin start moving in honor

1935
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:40,416
There are stories that you have to know that the tsar and tsarina knew he was this way because had these family gatherings I mentioned earlier witherall

1936
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:46,048
All sitting there and it's just him in the family he'll sit next to the princesses were all adolescent girls during this time.

1937
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,352
And they will jump up like they've been

1938
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,888
In a product with a hot

1939
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,192
Needle because he's goosing them

1940
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:53,216
Feeling them

1941
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,776
In front of the Czar and czarina

1942
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:58,336
And yet at the same time

1943
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:04,992
Some of this stuff is passed off as just part of his rustic peasant charm isn't it cute

1944
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:07,040
But he doesn't know how inappropriate that is

1945
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:09,856
Like I said some of these people in Russian aristocracy

1946
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:10,624
Hated him

1947
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:12,416
But those who didn't

1948
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:14,976
Kind of had a reaction like he was some sort of exotic

1949
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:19,328
At the zoo brought in and you have to make allowances for what he doesn't understand

1950
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:25,728
He might not know you can't just walk up and touch some Noble woman's breast at dinner and how how funny and interesting it is at

1951
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:27,776
Is the outrageous you know that kind of an attitude

1952
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:31,872
But he was fun and historian Joseph Furman has written two books on recipe

1953
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:32,896
Eaton points that out

1954
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:33,920
Quote

1955
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:35,968
Rasputin was fun

1956
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:38,016
It was a pleasure to be in his company

1957
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:39,808
He gave people nicknames

1958
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:42,112
And they were often cutting and quite appropriate

1959
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:43,648
He might double woman

1960
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:44,672
Hotstar

1961
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:45,952
Boss lady

1962
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:48,256
Sexy girl or good looking

1963
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:50,560
What a man would be called Fancy Pants

1964
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:51,584
Big britches

1965
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,608
Long hair

1966
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:53,632
Poor fella

1967
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:56,448
People accepted this is a Charming characteristic

1968
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:59,520
The humor of a peasant who meant no disrespect

1969
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,288
And quote

1970
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:03,616
Tell the people that didn't hate recipe

1971
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:05,152
Would often

1972
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:08,992
Can Overlook his outrageousness and consider that part of

1973
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:10,016
You know his charm

1974
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:11,552
Is rustic peasant chart

1975
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:13,856
Nonetheless sometimes

1976
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:20,256
It was a little too much even for those are there famous into this and they all end up in the local media Believe It or Not Russia had

1977
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:22,816
A tabloid media during this time.

1978
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:24,608
And Rasputin was one of their

1979
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:25,376
Staple

1980
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:27,936
Minifigures I mean back in my day

1981
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:32,800
Every one of them had to have it Elizabeth Taylor story or Michael Jackson story or something like that

1982
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:35,360
Kim Kardashian probably today

1983
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:38,944
Back then in Russia if you didn't have a rescue the story

1984
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,480
You know every so often

1985
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:42,528
I mean you were worried about circulation drop

1986
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:46,112
I just when you think there be no new news to get roaring drunk in it

1987
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:52,512
You know highfalutin restaurant in the capital city starts yelling about how he knows the tsar and then pulls his pants down and

1988
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:54,304
In which his genitals out the restaurant

1989
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:56,352
Word like that gets around

1990
01:33:56,864 --> 01:34:01,728
Tabloids eat it up at one point the Tsar had to tell the Tabloid that they couldn't mention his name anymore

1991
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:03,776
So they just started referring to him

1992
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:07,616
At the guy who lives on so-and-so street whatever street he lived on

1993
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:10,176
And everyone in the public just knew who they meant

1994
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:14,272
There were cartoons

1995
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:16,320
That made the round

1996
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:21,952
Showing Rasputin with his hand on the naked breasts of the tsarina

1997
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:27,072
Implying what a lot of people wondered about this relationship although it's almost certainly not true

1998
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:32,192
If Rasputin's going around town sleeping with everything that moves from peasants to Royal

1999
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:33,472
Women as well

2000
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:35,264
What you doing with the czarina

2001
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:40,896
There are even whisperings and one public charge made

2002
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:42,432
That the

2003
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:45,248
Heir-to-the-throne the czar's son

2004
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,296
Is really Rasputin son

2005
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:53,696
Almost certainly not true but the more gossip circulating but that kind of talk the more it undermined

2006
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:56,256
In a people's trust in

2007
01:34:56,512 --> 01:35:00,352
The tsar and tsarina remember this arena is already German at a time when

2008
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:04,960
The Russian people are hounding Russian generals who just have German last names

2009
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:07,264
What happens if you are German

2010
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:12,896
And the czar's not around and this strange Russian peasant who seems like a spin golly is

2011
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:18,784
I mean there were protests in 1915 where the people were saying down with Rasputin down with

2012
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:19,808
Alexandra

2013
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:24,928
He's not an unknown quantity everyone realizes he's almost a public figure

2014
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:27,232
They debate him in the legislature

2015
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:29,792
And the powers-that-be want him gone

2016
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,584
There's a story during the

2017
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:32,352
Time.

2018
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:33,632
One of the ways they tried

2019
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:34,400
Did you get them out

2020
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,448
It's a famous story

2021
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:38,752
1 day rescue in here to knock on his door

2022
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:41,568
Go to the door in the man standing there with a pack

2023
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:45,152
Is Rasputin the packaging Rasputin open the pack

2024
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:46,688
And it's full of photo

2025
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:48,992
Rasputin looks at the photos and they are photos of

2026
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:49,760
Vim

2027
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:51,040
Unconscious

2028
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:53,600
Insensible do to drink

2029
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:56,416
And there are naked women all around

2030
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:57,952
Nice boat

2031
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:04,352
The man at the door gave the package says either you leave town and go back to where you

2032
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:05,376
You came from a stop

2033
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:06,912
Talking and influencing the czar

2034
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:08,448
We're going to get these pictures

2035
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:11,008
It was an extortionist

2036
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:13,312
And I'm one of the nights apparently that

2037
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:15,616
Rasputin and passed out from drink

2038
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:21,248
Is enemies have hired prostitutes and position them around him naked and started taking photos to Black

2039
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,600
In typical unexpected fashion Rasputin

2040
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:28,160
Took the photos straight to the Czar and sort of

2041
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:30,208
Throw himself on the mercy of the Court

2042
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,024
I know a lot of the time

2043
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:36,608
Rasputin's able to skate away with no real repercussions

2044
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,144
Sometimes he's not

2045
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:40,448
Wechat occasional wrists with

2046
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:41,728
Between his arm

2047
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:46,336
One of them for example that went on in 1912 is a perfect example of how

2048
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:47,616
How hard it was for this artist

2049
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:48,384
Stay away

2050
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:49,664
Rasputin

2051
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:56,320
The 1912 to have one of these disagreements on the Tsar sends Rasputin back to Siberia the royal family goes on

2052
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,088
Vacations

2053
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:59,648
September 1912 to their country Palace

2054
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:03,744
They're playing around in the young heir to the throne Lexi jumps in a boat

2055
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,280
About 7 or 8 years old

2056
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:10,144
Not Unusual Not Unusual for seven or eight-year-old to land wrong and hurt themselves

2057
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,936
But most of the seven or eight year olds

2058
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:18,080
Hemophiliac so it instantly becomes a problem there's a giant hematoma in his lower abdomen they take him back to

2059
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:19,872
The palace and I have a terrible

2060
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:21,920
It gets very ill

2061
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:23,200
Very bad

2062
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:26,016
Takes about a month for him to start to recover

2063
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:32,416
Genesis just starting to turn the corner and I've never understood this his mother does Arena think should be great to take him a little carriage

2064
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:38,816
Dried and it's a bumpy road and they hit some bump and he cries out in pain and Something's Happened inside him they take him back

2065
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:39,584
Back to the Palace

2066
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,864
And now they have

2067
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:44,448
One of the most horrific periods of their life starting

2068
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:46,752
Because this kid starts to die

2069
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:51,872
It takes a while it's very painful and the parents are watching

2070
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:55,712
The kids fever skyrockets

2071
01:37:56,224 --> 01:38:00,832
The pain become so terrible he's delirious and slipping in and out of Consciousness I read somewhere

2072
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:04,928
That are opium is used in the past sometimes your people in the

2073
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:07,488
Heir-to-the-throne condition but they didn't use it for him

2074
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,304
And the screens are so terrible that we're told

2075
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:14,144
Palace staff has to stuff cotton in their ears to walk around to deal with it

2076
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:16,448
The parents like I said loving

2077
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:17,728
Real Hands-On parents

2078
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:18,752
Their turn

2079
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,544
At his bedside

2080
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:22,848
And he's begging for help you

2081
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:25,152
He saying Lord have mercy on me

2082
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:29,504
Was one of the things recorded over and over and over again and my mom helped me the pain

2083
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:30,784
And

2084
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:31,552
We're told that

2085
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:34,880
When the parents shifted the bedside was over they would walk

2086
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:36,160
Out of the room just burst into two

2087
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:37,952
Zar said that

2088
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:44,352
A certain point the doctors run out of things

2089
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:45,120
To do

2090
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:51,008
They tell the parents there's nothing more they can do it becomes apparent to the parents and to the patient

2091
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:53,056
But he's dying and he starts

2092
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:54,336
Talking about those things

2093
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:56,384
That destroy Paris

2094
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,920
You never want to hear your little kid

2095
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:58,688
Kid saying he's

2096
01:38:58,944 --> 01:39:01,504
He sang When I die will the pain be gone to his mother

2097
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:02,528
Yasmin

2098
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:06,880
After he dies they build this little Shrine in the woods for milestones

2099
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:13,536
And then the reality of the situation sets in and they start putting together a public statement to tell the Russian people

2100
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:15,584
That the heir to the throne has died

2101
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:16,864
The last

2102
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:17,632
Rights

2103
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:18,656
Are performed

2104
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:19,680
And

2105
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:21,984
While at a meeting

2106
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:25,568
The Czar gets a hand scroll note from his wife saying

2107
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:27,360
Come quickly I think it's time

2108
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:28,896
The boys about to die

2109
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:30,944
At the last minute

2110
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:32,224
The czarina

2111
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:36,576
Pens note2 rasputin off in siberia essentially saying help

2112
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:38,880
And she get the cable the next morning

2113
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:40,160
Hit the famous cable

2114
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:43,744
And it lets a little air out of the tires that it's not as good a Cody.

2115
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,280
Historian Joseph Furman

2116
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:46,304
As we always thought it was

2117
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:49,376
The cable was always thought to say

2118
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,960
God has seen your tears and heard your prayers

2119
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:53,984
Do not grieve

2120
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,032
The little one will not die

2121
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:58,336
Do not allow the doctors to bother him too much

2122
01:39:58,592 --> 01:39:59,360
Watch & Co

2123
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:03,456
Russian store in Alexandria VA

2124
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:05,248
Apparently says there were

2125
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:08,832
There were two notes but the one that was Miss quoted really said quote

2126
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:12,672
Fear nothing the illness is not as dangerous as they're saying

2127
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:14,720
She's at the doctors do not bother him

2128
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:15,744
And quote

2129
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:18,048
By that afternoon

2130
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:22,912
The boy is out of pain and is able to sleep in the fever starts dropping

2131
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:24,704
The doctors are

2132
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,496
Done that it should be pointed out they

2133
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:27,264
8 respect

2134
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:30,336
But they were forced to move several of them quoted in that

2135
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:33,408
In Fuhrman's latest book He's written two books on Rasputin

2136
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:34,176
And they're just

2137
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:41,088
They don't know what to even make of it and it wasn't just this time they would be trying to stop the boy from bleeding and pass incident

2138
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:44,160
And in Rasputin would come up and they would watch him stop it

2139
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:46,464
And historians been trying to find

2140
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,232
Explanation

2141
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:48,256
Ever since

2142
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:50,560
I mean I've heard everything from

2143
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:51,584
Hypnosis

2144
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:55,936
To the power of suggestion to drugs to one theory is that

2145
01:40:56,192 --> 01:41:02,336
That they were giving the Young's are aspirin which was like the new wonder drug back then and that of course would have been the worst thing to give

2146
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:07,200
Rasputin says don't let the doctors bother him too much they stop giving him the aspirin

2147
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:09,248
Some people have suggested that there was some

2148
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:10,272
Ocean rescue

2149
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:12,320
Add disorder kept the boy

2150
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:14,624
You know in a bad state anytime he wanted to

2151
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:18,208
Can pressure on the royal family that's all kinds of theories

2152
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:20,000
Arena

2153
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:25,632
And you've already seen Rasputin save your son's life several times and he just pulled in back

2154
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:28,704
From the brink of death by Telegram

2155
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:31,264
Don't you think you'd stop caring

2156
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:36,384
About the wherefores in the what-ifs and just not want this guy to leave your side

2157
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:41,760
If the tsar of Russia was in the process of

2158
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:44,320
Kicking his Rasputin habit he fell off the wagon

2159
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:46,112
After that 1912

2160
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:48,672
Pull your son back from the brink of death

2161
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:51,744
Here's the thing

2162
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:54,048
Rasputin

2163
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,584
Wasn't the problem

2164
01:41:56,096 --> 01:41:57,120
Because he kept feeling

2165
01:41:57,888 --> 01:41:58,400
The Heirs

2166
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:00,704
If he had stuck to that

2167
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,496
Probably we don't even

2168
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:03,520
Talk about him very

2169
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:10,432
Of course the reason we do talk about in the reasons a famous figure the reason half of Russia wants him dead is because he's not stick

2170
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:12,480
Fixing the air he's meddling in Polish

2171
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:17,088
In a funny way to I can see how that have

2172
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:21,952
I'm not so appalled I mean if you if you if you look at this from the tsar and tsarina is bandage

2173
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,512
And you think this guy has some

2174
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:28,864
Does Ariana think he's a man of God and that God favors him and only

2175
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:29,632
Prophetic

2176
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:33,728
And if you'd seen what she's seen when you think so maybe two and if you thought that

2177
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:37,056
Wouldn't you want to use this guy like a Magic 8 Ball

2178
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:44,992
Especially with the stakes as high as they are for the Czar at this time I mean when the first world war breaks out when the Romanov

2179
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:46,016
Dynasty is threatened

2180
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:49,600
When millions of lives hinge on the decision is our makes

2181
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:51,136
How tempting would it be

2182
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:52,416
Now to just sort of

2183
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,976
Rasputin what he thought about

2184
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:57,024
Appointment through that idea

2185
01:42:57,792 --> 01:43:00,608
Should I go to the front end command from the Frontline source

2186
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:04,192
And that's the event by the way

2187
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:05,728
The Tsar going to commanded

2188
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:06,496
The frontlines

2189
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:09,312
Which opens up the door to turbocharge

2190
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:11,104
Rasputin's influence

2191
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:17,504
And really ushering Russia into the terminal phase of the end of the Romanov Dynasty cuz what happens is

2192
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,552
End of the terrible losses against the

2193
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:21,856
Central powers that the Russians had suffered

2194
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:23,648
Bizarre thought

2195
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:25,696
The people might need a scapegoat and he

2196
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:32,352
Altruistically offered himself up as a sacrificial lamb you think he's going to go to the front his advisers think this is a tear

2197
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:34,144
Terrible idea with lots of downsides

2198
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:35,936
But Rasputin likes the ID

2199
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:37,728
Therefore by the way those are real

2200
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:41,568
The idea that one points desires wavering and think maybe he shouldn't do in Rasputin

2201
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:44,128
In a bolster his confidence that it's a good idea

2202
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:47,456
Cancel the Tsar leaves the capital and goes to kind of clothes

2203
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:48,224
Frontline

2204
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:54,880
A little something is Irene is left in charge of the day-to-day activities and she is using Rasputin like a match

2205
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:56,672
She gave ball like you wouldn't believe

2206
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:01,792
You can read it in the letters back and forth between the Czar and his wife

2207
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:05,376
Because she'll inform him what's going on she calls Rasputin our friend

2208
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:06,656
Code name

2209
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:11,776
And she'll say to those are our friend thinks we should do this our friend doesn't like that legislator

2210
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:14,080
Heartburn things that appointment job to go to this person

2211
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:16,128
Until debated back and forth and

2212
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:17,664
Rasputin is

2213
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:24,064
Making huge decisions for Russia's future in Wartime when things are deteriorating bad

2214
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:25,856
Italian bread riots are happening in

2215
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:32,256
Satisfaction is is palpably on the rise and demonstrations are occurring and he's drinking 12 bottles of

2216
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:33,792
Wine a day at Waco

2217
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:38,144
Don't think the belligerent powers

2218
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:42,752
Of the other countries aren't aware of it either the British secret service is monitoring according to

2219
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:44,800
A story like Joseph Furman

2220
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:45,824
Is monitoring

2221
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:46,592
Rescue

2222
01:44:46,848 --> 01:44:49,152
I have a nickname for him a code name they call him.

2223
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:49,920
Forces

2224
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:50,944
And

2225
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:54,784
Many things about Rasputin trouble than they're not sure he's not a German agent

2226
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,832
They think he's unstable certainly

2227
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:58,112
They think he is

2228
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:03,744
In favor of some sort of peace deal to get Russia out of the war the whole lot of reasons they don't kind of like him

2229
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:06,560
But this problem is becoming acute

2230
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:07,584
And

2231
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:09,376
Some noblemen apparently

2232
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:10,912
We take it upon themselves

2233
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,472
To rid Russia of this

2234
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:14,240
Cancer

2235
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:15,776
Which is the way they see Rasputin

2236
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:17,056
They decide to kill him

2237
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:20,384
When we reach this point

2238
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:22,176
We're actually caught up

2239
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:23,456
With the storytime

2240
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:24,224
Find again

2241
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:26,272
December 1916

2242
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:29,344
Where we left off before our little Russian digression

2243
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,112
You know that

2244
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:31,392
Time with the submarine

2245
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:36,000
Turn the peace deals on the table in the questions about the US getting into the war or not

2246
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:38,816
In December 1960

2247
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:40,864
Rumors are flying

2248
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:41,888
The capital

2249
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:44,448
That Rasputin's going to be killed

2250
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:47,264
And they're so pervasive

2251
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:48,800
Rasputin here's the

2252
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:53,408
Allegedly his children hear them doing they hide his clothes so he can't go out

2253
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:55,200
Nonetheless

2254
01:45:55,712 --> 01:46:01,344
Even with those rumors flying he can't resist and this is the traditional stories Kennedy assassination

2255
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:06,720
And good luck finding the truth I'm just giving you the the most common story here

2256
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:09,792
Apparently a nobleman

2257
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:11,840
Offers his wife

2258
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:13,120
To rest butan

2259
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:16,192
You know a nice little clandestine Arrangement o after party

2260
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:17,216
Or something like that

2261
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:21,568
Rasputin takes the guy up on the offer he's a nobleman Felix yusupov

2262
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:25,152
What is his name I think he's so rich he has more money than the ruling Dynasty

2263
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:31,552
And working with a bunch of other men it's a true conspiracy nobody knows how deeply there are some who think the British secret service

2264
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:32,832
Was even in on it

2265
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:34,368
The majority don't

2266
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:35,392
Yusupov

2267
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:36,416
Meet

2268
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:40,000
Rasputin kind of his door bring him down into the basement

2269
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:42,304
Yankee Doodle to Titus

2270
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,072
Story together

2271
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:43,840
Wonderful

2272
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:47,168
Is playing on the phonograph upstairs that they can hear

2273
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:51,008
So you got this little American Tune playing in the story as a Russia

2274
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:55,360
It reaches the terminal phase here in the Romanov Dynasty

2275
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:58,176
There food on the table there's wine

2276
01:46:58,432 --> 01:47:04,576
The Rendezvous is a little pushback you stop off says they sit there and they eat the food they drink the wine

2277
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:08,160
And after a while you sup off begins to freak out

2278
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:12,512
Because he's laced all these things with cyanide

2279
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:14,560
And this guy is not dying

2280
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:16,864
He says he's a

2281
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:21,216
What's bothering me a little stomach bothering him a little but he's he's sitting there

2282
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:25,824
Drinking more eating more and asking you some pop to sing for him I like your singing voice

2283
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:31,456
Yusupov excuses himself goes upstairs to where the other conspirators are and freaks out what are we going to do

2284
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:33,504
Finally one of them decides

2285
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:38,368
They should shoot him and do some pumps got a pistol. Of goes down there tells

2286
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:44,768
Refuting look at something on the wall over there and then when Rasputin turns around the pistols pointed at him you sell pops

2287
01:47:45,024 --> 01:47:49,632
Says he said you don't say your prayers or something like that shot him in the chest he Springs me falls down on the

2288
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:52,192
Rod frothing-at-the-mouth convulsions dies

2289
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:58,336
The assassins all come downstairs have a look at the body the blood everything

2290
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:04,224
Go upstairs to commiserate about it for a while and then we're told that the Assassin yourself off

2291
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:06,272
Wants to have another look at the body

2292
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:08,064
And so he goes downstairs

2293
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:12,672
Anne. Joseph Roman historian quoting some original sources in his quote

2294
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:16,768
Talks about what happened when you step off went down there to just make sure

2295
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,816
That nothing was amiss

2296
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:20,352
Women rights quotes

2297
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:24,192
He found Rasputin lying in the same position on the floor

2298
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:26,752
Overcome with a terrible inner rage

2299
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:30,080
Usafa grabbed Rasputin by the shoulders and shook him

2300
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:32,128
As he stared into Rasputin space

2301
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:35,456
First one eye and then the other suddenly opened

2302
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:38,528
In the story she's quoting his green Asian snake eyes

2303
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:42,112
They fix the prince with an expression of satanic hatred

2304
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:44,160
Rasputin stumble to his feet

2305
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:45,440
Foaming at the mouth

2306
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:50,304
Roaring and angrily wildly clawing at the air as you rushed towards yourself off

2307
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:54,144
Blood dripping from his mouth he grabbed the prince by the shoulder

2308
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,192
Weeping in a pallet from his uniform

2309
01:48:56,448 --> 01:49:01,312
Rasputin was reportedly growling his tormentors name in a low guttural voice

2310
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:02,592
And quote

2311
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:04,640
It's like a zombie

2312
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:06,432
And Usopp office

2313
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:12,576
Screaming everybody runs downstairs when they hear the struggle going on and you stop at the screaming about the time everybody gets downstairs

2314
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:18,464
Mutant have lurched into the snowbound courtyard in his running away and he's yelling

2315
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:20,512
Yusupov first name who's also

2316
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:21,792
Spruce yourself up

2317
01:49:22,048 --> 01:49:25,376
Felix Felix Hotel the Sarita everything

2318
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:26,912
Annie's going to tattle

2319
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:29,472
On the prince for trying to kill him

2320
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:32,544
And people open fire the prince among others

2321
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:36,640
At Rasputin as he flees misses him a couple times then hits them somewhere in the back

2322
01:49:36,896 --> 01:49:38,432
And then they run up to the

2323
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:41,760
Anybody that's on the ground and they put a bullet through his forehead

2324
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:49,440
Then were told they wrap them up and tie them up then wrap them up in a carpet then go to a nearby River where there's ice and

2325
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:51,232
Controlling through a hole on the icing

2326
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:52,768
In a Hopi

2327
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:54,304
Flights to Finland

2328
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:55,328
Of course he does

2329
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:57,632
They find him in a few days

2330
01:49:57,888 --> 01:50:02,752
They dragged the body out and end the myth of this story and again so much better with the myth

2331
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:05,056
Is that during the autopsy

2332
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:09,664
They found water in his lungs and his body untied is ohia freedom self

2333
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:16,064
And only at the end round so they Cyanide and imaging work they shot him multiple times it didn't work they threw them in the river

2334
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,344
Turn it almost didn't work

2335
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:20,672
Historians say that

2336
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:21,952
Shop to his forehead

2337
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:22,720
Almost certainly

2338
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:24,000
We killed him it's right in the middle of

2339
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:29,888
And it's possible that the cyanide was old or the Never

2340
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:30,912
Forgot put in his drinks

2341
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:34,496
Or who knows but it adds to the legend of Rasputin

2342
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:39,872
There's a warning before he dies that he gives to the royal family supposed

2343
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:41,408
That also add

2344
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:42,432
Add to his Legend

2345
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:48,064
You know another one of these prophecies that are sometimes uncannily correctly supposed to have said

2346
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,600
To the royal couple quotes

2347
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:52,160
If I die or you desert me

2348
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:55,232
You will lose your son and your crown in 6 months

2349
01:50:57,536 --> 01:50:58,304
Rasputin is

2350
01:50:59,072 --> 01:50:59,840
Write again

2351
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:01,632
From Beyond the Grave

2352
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:07,776
This. In the first World War

2353
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:08,544
Timeline

2354
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:11,616
About the time. Rasputin die

2355
01:51:12,384 --> 01:51:15,712
You take a couple of months before he was assassinated a couple of months afterwards

2356
01:51:16,224 --> 01:51:18,784
That really is the first world wars crowded hour

2357
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:22,112
Roosevelt called his combat

2358
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:23,392
In the Spanish-American War

2359
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:24,928
He was trying to describe these

2360
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:26,976
Large number of events.

2361
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:30,048
Crammed into a short period of time he said it was his crowded hour

2362
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:31,840
If you're referring about

2363
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:36,448
November 1916 to April 1917 is the first world war was crowded

2364
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:40,800
Huge number of events compressed in a short period Of time

2365
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:46,944
These events are all connected though to the various teams we've examined individually so far

2366
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:47,968
The United States

2367
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:49,760
And United States involvement

2368
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:50,784
In Mexico

2369
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:53,344
The submarine

2370
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:56,928
The high-level diplomatic activity in maneuvering

2371
01:51:57,696 --> 01:51:58,208
And the

2372
01:51:58,464 --> 01:52:00,512
Trainwreck that's about to happen with Russia

2373
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:03,584
This all comes to a head as we said

2374
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:04,608
January

2375
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:08,960
Late January 1917 Woodrow Wilson gives his peace without victory

2376
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:11,520
While he's doing that

2377
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:13,824
The Germans are already

2378
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:15,104
Behind the scenes

2379
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:16,128
Prepping

2380
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:19,456
For their February 1st resumption

2381
01:52:19,712 --> 01:52:23,296
Of unrestricted Warfare they pulled the trigger on that because they had given

2382
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:25,600
The high-level politicians in Germany

2383
01:52:25,856 --> 01:52:26,368
The

2384
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:28,928
Go ahead to try some peace maneuvering

2385
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:33,280
Of course they were told at the peace maneuvering doesn't win we let the submarines go

2386
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:35,328
The submarines are slated to go

2387
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:36,608
February 1st

2388
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:38,400
1917

2389
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:45,312
Now because Germany was reasonably sure as was everyone else

2390
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:46,336
Pretty much that

2391
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:49,664
If they started shooting at every ship on the high seas

2392
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:51,456
The United States was going to get Dragged In

2393
01:52:51,712 --> 01:52:52,992
End of the war the Americans with diet

2394
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:58,112
American ships would go down it was pretty much inevitable so the Germans started working on some contingency

2395
01:52:59,136 --> 01:52:59,904
In January

2396
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:06,560
1917 you know again right around the same time Wilson's proposing peace for all men and all the time minded sentiments

2397
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:08,608
The Germans are sending

2398
01:53:08,864 --> 01:53:10,144
A telegram

2399
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:12,448
To their Ambassador in Mecca

2400
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:13,216
Chicago

2401
01:53:13,472 --> 01:53:16,544
Giving their Ambassador in Mexico some instructions

2402
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,080
On what to do

2403
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:20,896
Just in case the United States comes into the war

2404
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:22,432
It starts fighting Germany

2405
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:24,480
The telegram

2406
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:26,016
From the German

2407
01:53:26,528 --> 01:53:27,040
Foreign

2408
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:29,344
Secretary a guy name

2409
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:30,624
Arthur Zimmermann

2410
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:33,440
To the ambassador of Mexico

2411
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:34,720
Says this

2412
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:35,744
Quote

2413
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:40,864
We intend to begin on the first of February unrestricted submarine warfare

2414
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:45,216
We shall Endeavor in spite of this to keep the United States of America neutral

2415
01:53:45,472 --> 01:53:47,520
Any event of this not succeeding

2416
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:50,080
We make Mexico a proposal of Alliance

2417
01:53:50,592 --> 01:53:51,616
On the following basis

2418
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:53,152
Make war together

2419
01:53:53,408 --> 01:53:54,432
Make peace together

2420
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:58,016
Generous financial support and understanding on our part

2421
01:53:58,272 --> 01:54:03,904
That Mexico is to reconquer the Lost territory in Texas New Mexico and Arizona

2422
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:06,464
The settlement in detail is left to you

2423
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:08,768
You will inform the president of the above

2424
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:13,632
Most secretly as soon as the outbreak of war with the United States of America is certain

2425
01:54:13,888 --> 01:54:16,960
And at the suggestion that he should on his own initiative

2426
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:19,264
Invite Japan to immediate adherence

2427
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:22,592
And at the same time mediate between Japan and ourselves

2428
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:29,248
Please call the president's attention to the fact that the ruthless employment of our submarines now offers the prospect

2429
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:31,808
Compelling England in a few months

2430
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:32,832
To make peace

2431
01:54:33,088 --> 01:54:33,600
And quote

2432
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:37,184
So there's a note

2433
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:40,000
Suggesting that Mexico go to war

2434
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:44,352
As part of the Central Powers against the United States if United States gets into the war

2435
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:45,376
What's more

2436
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:51,776
They talked about getting Japan on board to that was one of the United States is great worries by the way the Japanese have to

2437
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:58,176
Are the Americas all these theories from American planner that maybe they could either go take the Panama Canal and come up through Mexico mean

2438
01:54:58,432 --> 01:55:00,480
When is All This Is War playing kind of fantasies

2439
01:55:00,992 --> 01:55:02,016
But the idea that

2440
01:55:02,272 --> 01:55:03,808
Japan to be brought in

2441
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:10,208
And flipped cuz they're on the Allied side the Germans are talk about flipping the Japanese making them on the Central Powers to having a

2442
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:12,768
Japanese attacked the Americans the Mexicans attack the Americans

2443
01:55:13,024 --> 01:55:14,304
If nothing else

2444
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:18,912
That keeps the Americans busy so they're not over there fighting Germans in Europe

2445
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:26,848
If you're playing a board game here of risk or something that's not a bad idea going to the game called The Plum

2446
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:29,920
If you're playing the game called diplomacy

2447
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:32,736
There's all kinds of variables in real life

2448
01:55:32,992 --> 01:55:36,576
Not taking into account in the game of diplomacy one of them is

2449
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:43,232
But your enemies might be tapping into the cable that you use to send a secret message like that

2450
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:45,280
From Germany to Mexico

2451
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:47,328
The British got it

2452
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:51,424
Snatched it right off of the American

2453
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:53,216
Atlantic Cable

2454
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:54,752
Which they were tapping

2455
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:57,824
I think we mentioned in an earlier episode

2456
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:01,664
The British may be the the best Espionage codebreaker

2457
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:03,200
People of all time

2458
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:06,528
When the war starts they cut the German

2459
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:10,368
Transatlantic cable to Germany can't send Telegraph messages across the Atlantic

2460
01:56:10,624 --> 01:56:14,464
So they work out deals to borrow other people's cable sometimes

2461
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:16,512
Do United States let them use

2462
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:20,352
The US cable for just messages Woodrow Wilson thought with

2463
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:21,376
Would maybe

2464
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:24,960
Masterpiece Riley wants to the Germans have an open channel to him

2465
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:30,080
Did the Germans use the American cable to send a message to Mexico offering some

2466
01:56:30,336 --> 01:56:32,640
American states to them if they come in the war

2467
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:34,944
By attacking United States little Iraq

2468
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:38,272
The British have a problem

2469
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:42,880
They can't tell the Americans about this cable right away

2470
01:56:43,392 --> 01:56:46,976
Because then you're going to get all these embarrassing questions like how do you get the cable

2471
01:56:47,488 --> 01:56:53,632
And then the British would have to say if they were going to be truthful well we tapped into your cable and we've been reading your message

2472
01:56:53,888 --> 01:56:54,656
I just for the whole War

2473
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:55,936
Can't quite

2474
01:56:56,192 --> 01:56:57,728
Say that too easily

2475
01:56:57,984 --> 01:57:01,824
So by hooker by crook it's a great story Barbara tuchman wrote a whole book on it

2476
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:04,128
The British figure out a way

2477
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:06,944
To sort of hide the source of

2478
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:08,736
You know how they got this cable

2479
01:57:09,248 --> 01:57:10,528
They give it to the Americans

2480
01:57:11,296 --> 01:57:14,112
Woodrow Wilson in Stockton

2481
01:57:14,624 --> 01:57:16,160
And understand the contact right

2482
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:19,488
This is the very month January 1917

2483
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:23,328
Did American military forces are finally withdrawing

2484
01:57:23,584 --> 01:57:27,424
From the Pancho Villa Expedition right this attempt to go get this

2485
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:28,448
Terrorist

2486
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:30,752
Us settlers in Arizona New Mexico

2487
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:32,032
Texas would have called him

2488
01:57:32,288 --> 01:57:37,920
Mnusports kind of comes back with their tail between their legs it didn't get Pancho via that killed a bunch of his man but

2489
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:40,224
Despite you know

2490
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:41,248
Hi public

2491
01:57:42,016 --> 01:57:47,904
Praising of everything involved General John Blackjack Pershing says it wasn't a very memorable. In American history

2492
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:50,208
Nonetheless it made the Mexicans

2493
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:55,072
Mad as hell and in the US almost went to war with Mexico twice in two years

2494
01:57:55,584 --> 01:58:01,728
In 1914 US troops occupy the city of Veracruz in about 200 people died in that little Endeavor may be closer to 300

2495
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:03,264
Nearly

2496
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:06,080
Call the war between the US and Mexico the end

2497
01:58:06,336 --> 01:58:12,480
And then in this Pancho Villa expedition to us crosses the Border goes after a guy who is also the enemy

2498
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:13,760
Mexico's leader

2499
01:58:14,272 --> 01:58:19,136
But it's so upset the Mexicans to have US troops in their country for any reason at that almost led to war

2500
01:58:19,648 --> 01:58:23,744
And so just as you're getting your troops the very month you're getting your troops out of Mexico

2501
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:26,560
The Germans are sending him a telegram saying hey

2502
01:58:27,328 --> 01:58:29,376
Want to go to war against United States I'll give you three Fates

2503
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:30,912
Will help you

2504
01:58:31,936 --> 01:58:33,472
It struck a nerve

2505
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:34,752
For Americans

2506
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:37,568
When Woodrow Wilson release that letter

2507
01:58:37,824 --> 01:58:38,336
Publicly

2508
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:42,432
When the American public first heard about

2509
01:58:42,688 --> 01:58:43,712
Germany's offer to Mex

2510
01:58:45,248 --> 01:58:51,392
The reaction was one that I think would Woodmere the reaction of the American public in a similar situation today

2511
01:58:51,648 --> 01:58:52,928
A large number of them thought that

2512
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:54,720
The telegram was a forgery

2513
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,536
The British intelligence was behind

2514
01:58:58,048 --> 01:59:00,864
Did this was an attempt to trick the American government

2515
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:05,472
And to affect American public opinion and make them more Angry Germany more pro-war

2516
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:08,544
Speculate how much

2517
01:59:09,056 --> 01:59:13,408
You know that's what a perception would have stayed that way if the German foreign secretary Arthur Zimmermann

2518
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:16,736
Haven't done something in early March 1917 that looks

2519
01:59:17,248 --> 01:59:18,272
Inexplicable

2520
01:59:19,296 --> 01:59:20,064
He admit it

2521
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:23,136
That the telegram had been sent and that it was genuine

2522
01:59:23,904 --> 01:59:24,416
Twice

2523
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:27,232
The second time

2524
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:30,816
He said he hoped the American people would understand that this was only

2525
01:59:31,072 --> 01:59:34,912
To come into effect if war broke out between Germany and United States

2526
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:37,472
As a way of saying you know you understand that right

2527
01:59:37,728 --> 01:59:39,008
American people wouldn't

2528
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:43,616
The confirmation that the Zimmerman Telegram was indeed an official

2529
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:46,688
Secret proposal from the German government to the Mexican Government

2530
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:48,480
Outside of town of America

2531
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:53,344
An undercut the cause of german-americans and irish-americans were hoping to keep the United States neutral

2532
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:55,392
Was another

2533
01:59:55,648 --> 01:59:59,744
Nail in the coffin of neutrality and a huge German missed appt

2534
02:00:02,816 --> 02:00:03,328
In fact

2535
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:04,864
The whole decision

2536
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:06,144
To unleash the sub

2537
02:00:07,424 --> 02:00:08,960
When they did was a bad decision by

2538
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:09,728
Germany

2539
02:00:09,984 --> 02:00:12,544
If they had only waited a little while longer

2540
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:14,336
Longer events would have

2541
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:15,104
Happened

2542
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:17,408
That would have made that move unless

2543
02:00:17,664 --> 02:00:18,176
Terry

2544
02:00:18,688 --> 02:00:23,808
And if that's the move that gets the United States into the war that it would have made that event unnecessary

2545
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:26,112
Winston Churchill points out

2546
02:00:27,392 --> 02:00:28,160
That the

2547
02:00:28,928 --> 02:00:29,952
Timing of the event

2548
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:30,976
What happened in

2549
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:32,256
March and April

2550
02:00:33,024 --> 02:00:34,304
1917

2551
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:37,376
In his mind show the hand of Destiny at

2552
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:38,656
Here's how he framed

2553
02:00:39,168 --> 02:00:42,752
What's about to happen what's about to happen latest in German that will screw up everything

2554
02:00:43,008 --> 02:00:43,776
In here

2555
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:50,176
You know set the stage for our modern world as much as the United States getting into this conflict will set the stage for the modern world

2556
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:51,712
Russia has its Revel

2557
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:55,040
Churchill says

2558
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:58,368
The beginning of 1917

2559
02:00:58,624 --> 02:01:00,928
Was marked by three stupendous events

2560
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:06,560
The German Declaration of unlimited U-Boat War the intervention of the United States

2561
02:01:06,816 --> 02:01:08,096
And the Russian Revolution

2562
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:12,704
Taken together these events constitute the Second Great climax of the war

2563
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:15,520
The order in which they were placed was decisive

2564
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:18,592
Hit the Russian Revolution that occurred in January

2565
02:01:18,848 --> 02:01:19,872
Instead of in March

2566
02:01:20,128 --> 02:01:26,272
Wharf alternatively that the Germans had waited to declare unlimited U-Boat War until the summer they would have been no one

2567
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:27,296
Limited U-Boat War

2568
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:30,112
And consequently no intervention of the United States

2569
02:01:30,624 --> 02:01:33,440
Hit the Allies have been left to face the collapse of Russia

2570
02:01:33,696 --> 02:01:36,512
Without being sustained by the intervention of the United States

2571
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:39,840
It seems certain that France could not have survived the year

2572
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:42,656
And the war would have ended in the Peace by negotiation

2573
02:01:42,912 --> 02:01:45,216
Or in other words a German victory

2574
02:01:45,472 --> 02:01:47,520
Did Russia lasted two months less

2575
02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:50,080
Germany refrained for 2 months more

2576
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:52,896
The whole course of events would have been revolutionized

2577
02:01:53,408 --> 02:01:54,176
In this sequence

2578
02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:56,480
We discern the footprints of Destiny

2579
02:01:56,992 --> 02:01:58,272
Either Russian endurance

2580
02:01:58,528 --> 02:02:02,368
Or German impatience was required to secure the entry of the United States

2581
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:03,648
And both were 4th

2582
02:02:04,672 --> 02:02:05,184
And quote

2583
02:02:06,976 --> 02:02:10,816
As we mentioned already the situation in Russia had been seething and simmering

2584
02:02:11,328 --> 02:02:12,096
For quite some time

2585
02:02:12,864 --> 02:02:14,656
The straw that broke the camel's back

2586
02:02:15,168 --> 02:02:16,960
Was an almost complete break

2587
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:18,240
Brushes transfer

2588
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:22,080
Which has been withering since the war started

2589
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:23,616
And that had suffered

2590
02:02:23,872 --> 02:02:25,664
Terribly in the winter that just happened

2591
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:26,688
Russia almost

2592
02:02:26,944 --> 02:02:29,760
Couldn't handle is transportation needs in peacetime

2593
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:31,296
After several years of war

2594
02:02:31,552 --> 02:02:32,576
They were whole cities

2595
02:02:32,832 --> 02:02:34,112
We're not receiving enough food

2596
02:02:34,624 --> 02:02:35,648
One of them was the Kappa

2597
02:02:35,904 --> 02:02:36,416
Metrograph

2598
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:39,232
Petrograd used to be called Saint Peters

2599
02:02:39,488 --> 02:02:40,768
But when the war started that's

2600
02:02:41,024 --> 02:02:42,816
Sounds a little to German

2601
02:02:43,328 --> 02:02:44,096
So they changed it

2602
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:45,632
To petrograd this is a city that we

2603
02:02:45,888 --> 02:02:46,656
Will change its name all the

2604
02:02:47,424 --> 02:02:51,008
During the Communist years it will be known as Leningrad now St Petersburg

2605
02:02:51,264 --> 02:02:51,776
Broke again

2606
02:02:52,288 --> 02:02:54,080
Nonetheless it's the big Metropolis

2607
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:56,384
And it doesn't have enough food

2608
02:02:56,640 --> 02:03:01,248
You take a bunch of people who were angry already add the War Admiral food

2609
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:05,600
It's not surprising they were marching they've been doing it all throughout 19-7

2610
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:07,648
Irish historian William Mullen

2611
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:08,672
Points out

2612
02:03:09,184 --> 02:03:12,256
From the beginning of 1917 there was a wave of strikes

2613
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:14,304
Concentrated in petrograd

2614
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:15,840
On the 7th of March

2615
02:03:16,096 --> 02:03:20,448
30000 workers were locked out of the feudal of armaments plants in the city

2616
02:03:20,704 --> 02:03:26,848
The following day international women's day women gathered in the vyborg working-class district

2617
02:03:27,104 --> 02:03:28,640
Protest against hybrid prices

2618
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:31,200
They marched past Finland station

2619
02:03:31,456 --> 02:03:35,040
Nevsky prospekt by which time the strikers number 200000

2620
02:03:35,552 --> 02:03:36,832
Down with the war

2621
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:43,232
Down with the High Cost of Living down with Hunger bread for the workers they cried as they marched through the city

2622
02:03:43,744 --> 02:03:48,352
The protesters connected their experience of war with much broader political claims

2623
02:03:48,864 --> 02:03:51,936
Although the Crux of their complaints was the food supply crisis

2624
02:03:52,192 --> 02:03:58,336
This material experience of War had political implications including the overthrow of the czarist regime and then.

2625
02:03:58,592 --> 02:04:00,896
The war it was possible in theory

2626
02:04:01,152 --> 02:04:03,456
That the food supply system could be reformed

2627
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:07,552
But the Striker's new the czarist regime could no longer reform itself

2628
02:04:08,064 --> 02:04:08,576
And quote

2629
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:11,904
British General Sir Henry Wilson

2630
02:04:12,416 --> 02:04:13,952
Went to Russia during this time.

2631
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:15,744
And came back and

2632
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:16,768
42

2633
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:18,048
Is Piers

2634
02:04:19,328 --> 02:04:22,656
You know concerning how the people in Russia felt towards the tsar and tsarina

2635
02:04:22,912 --> 02:04:23,424
And told them quote

2636
02:04:24,192 --> 02:04:29,312
It seems a certain there's anything can be that the emperor and Empress are riding for a fall

2637
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:30,080
Everyone

2638
02:04:30,336 --> 02:04:35,200
Officers Merchants ladies talk openly of the absolute necessity of doing away with them

2639
02:04:35,712 --> 02:04:40,064
They lost their people their nobles and now their army and I see no hope for them

2640
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:42,112
There will be terrible trouble one day

2641
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:46,208
There are open to

2642
02:04:46,464 --> 02:04:47,232
Discussions amongst

2643
02:04:47,744 --> 02:04:50,048
Some of the higher levels of Russian Society

2644
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:52,608
The terror attack should be made against

2645
02:04:52,864 --> 02:04:55,680
Someone stands up at the Duma and important person

2646
02:04:55,936 --> 02:04:56,960
Later in the story

2647
02:04:57,216 --> 02:05:01,568
And says that the Tsar needs to be removed by terrorist means if necessary

2648
02:05:03,872 --> 02:05:04,384
Now

2649
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:06,176
It would be foolish to say that the

2650
02:05:06,688 --> 02:05:08,480
Uniroyal Court did not have their so

2651
02:05:09,248 --> 02:05:09,760
They did

2652
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:12,832
And they had people who didn't have a problem with

2653
02:05:13,344 --> 02:05:16,416
You know when Emperor but they had a problem with Nicholas II

2654
02:05:16,672 --> 02:05:18,976
So they were all stripes in this idea

2655
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:20,768
That the Czar needed to go

2656
02:05:21,024 --> 02:05:25,376
And no consensus at all about what would take its place or how to get from here to there

2657
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:29,216
Russian knew how to have protest

2658
02:05:29,472 --> 02:05:29,984
To revolt

2659
02:05:30,752 --> 02:05:34,336
About a dozen years before this time. They had the famous 1905 rap

2660
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,384
We could also come

2661
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:37,152
After

2662
02:05:37,408 --> 02:05:38,176
In a Russian

2663
02:05:38,432 --> 02:05:39,968
Problems in a war

2664
02:05:40,992 --> 02:05:42,016
That Revolution broke out

2665
02:05:42,272 --> 02:05:44,064
It got so serious the Tsar

2666
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:45,088
Supposedly

2667
02:05:45,344 --> 02:05:48,928
Rode out his application letter he didn't deliver it but it was ready to go

2668
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:56,096
In that particular Revolution the crowd marched on The Winter Palace with Hazard was to a line of troops to open fire

2669
02:05:56,352 --> 02:05:57,632
Fire on them killing hundreds of them

2670
02:05:57,888 --> 02:05:59,168
It's always Bloody Sunday

2671
02:06:00,448 --> 02:06:03,520
Bizarre had received intelligence reports a few months

2672
02:06:04,032 --> 02:06:05,568
Before this event

2673
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:06,592
Saying that

2674
02:06:07,104 --> 02:06:07,616
Quote

2675
02:06:07,872 --> 02:06:14,016
Recently the conviction has been expressed without exception that we are on the eve of great events and comparison

2676
02:06:14,272 --> 02:06:16,320
Which 1905 was but a toy

2677
02:06:17,344 --> 02:06:17,856
And quote

2678
02:06:18,368 --> 02:06:19,648
That was for my police report

2679
02:06:19,904 --> 02:06:20,672
Bizarre received

2680
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:23,744
Months before these demonstrations in March Breakout

2681
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:26,048
But here's the thing

2682
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:28,608
You know as with many historical events

2683
02:06:28,864 --> 02:06:34,496
They can be seemingly inevitable for the longest time and still come as a surprise when they actually show up

2684
02:06:35,008 --> 02:06:41,152
The people who are out in the streets March 7th March 8th which was International women's day they didn't know that this is

2685
02:06:41,408 --> 02:06:42,176
Is the revolution

2686
02:06:42,432 --> 02:06:48,576
In fact the people on the scene point out that that's one of the Tipping moments in this situation when people understand wait a minute

2687
02:06:48,832 --> 02:06:50,624
This just isn't another demonstration

2688
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:51,648
We've been having

2689
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:56,000
This is the chance to topple the government that's the big Turning Point

2690
02:06:56,512 --> 02:06:59,072
And the actual moment of the turning point

2691
02:06:59,328 --> 02:07:04,704
He's one of those really interesting almost turning point in history moments revolutionaries like Leon Trotsky

2692
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:09,824
Who certainly see it that we spend a lot of time talking about that moment the Tipping Point in the revolution

2693
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:11,104
This is seven days

2694
02:07:11,616 --> 02:07:12,896
7 days

2695
02:07:13,152 --> 02:07:16,224
For a 300 year-old Dynasty to fall

2696
02:07:18,016 --> 02:07:20,320
Then it starts off with some Factory Strikers

2697
02:07:20,576 --> 02:07:21,344
On March 7th

2698
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:27,744
By the way this is our calendar these events in Russia happening on on the old calendar in February so it's often called the

2699
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,536
Very Revolution and it makes the dating

2700
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:30,304
Confusing as hell

2701
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:31,072
For someone like

2702
02:07:31,328 --> 02:07:31,840
Me

2703
02:07:32,096 --> 02:07:33,120
None the last March

2704
02:07:33,376 --> 02:07:35,680
7th by our calendar 1917

2705
02:07:35,936 --> 02:07:37,216
There's an industrial strike

2706
02:07:37,728 --> 02:07:40,800
March 8th is international women's day the women go out

2707
02:07:41,056 --> 02:07:43,872
And strike and protest about the lack of bread in all this

2708
02:07:44,128 --> 02:07:47,200
Seems to be key and so many people talk about it

2709
02:07:47,456 --> 02:07:48,480
Write the fact that the women

2710
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:52,064
Are doing this a lot of these women of the wives of soldiers at the front

2711
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:55,392
Which gives them a huge amount of credibility as you might imagine

2712
02:07:55,648 --> 02:07:56,928
Without their soldiers

2713
02:07:57,184 --> 02:08:00,256
And they're out on International women's day on the 8th

2714
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:04,864
On the 9th the women come back out bring more people

2715
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:11,264
And go to factories and shops and businesses and grab the workers out and have them join the strike of the crowd swelled with

2716
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:13,056
At least twice what it was the day before

2717
02:08:13,824 --> 02:08:15,360
By the next day

2718
02:08:15,616 --> 02:08:18,176
The industry of Russia's capital is

2719
02:08:18,432 --> 02:08:18,944
Paralyzed

2720
02:08:19,968 --> 02:08:23,552
And to show you how out-of-touch the tsarina is with all this

2721
02:08:24,064 --> 02:08:25,856
She writes in her diary on March

2722
02:08:26,112 --> 02:08:26,624
Tent

2723
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:27,392
About

2724
02:08:27,648 --> 02:08:32,256
The troubles in the capital and she's basically in charge of the capital quote

2725
02:08:33,792 --> 02:08:35,328
This is a hooligan movement

2726
02:08:35,584 --> 02:08:39,936
Young people run and Shout that there is no bread simply to create excitement

2727
02:08:40,192 --> 02:08:43,008
How long would the workers who prevent others from working

2728
02:08:43,264 --> 02:08:46,336
If the weather was very cold they would probably all stay at home

2729
02:08:46,592 --> 02:08:50,432
But all this will pass and become, if only the Duma will behave itself

2730
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:51,712
And quote

2731
02:08:52,224 --> 02:08:54,272
The Duma is a Russian legislature which

2732
02:08:54,528 --> 02:09:00,672
I think I said earlier had about 1% of the power in this system in the Tsar has about 99% and the tsarina is complaining that the

2733
02:09:00,928 --> 02:09:02,976
Misusing at 1% sort of

2734
02:09:04,512 --> 02:09:06,560
Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky

2735
02:09:06,816 --> 02:09:09,888
Compares her pretty convincingly to Marie Antoinette

2736
02:09:10,144 --> 02:09:12,704
Before the French Revolution that said let them eat cake state

2737
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:19,104
And she and the Czar and before he died Rasputin like this one Russian Minister a guy

2738
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:20,640
Guy named protopapa

2739
02:09:20,896 --> 02:09:21,408
And so

2740
02:09:21,664 --> 02:09:25,504
He begins to sort of act as the tsarina's minister in all this

2741
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:29,088
Situation and according to some of the scene it's anger at him

2742
02:09:29,344 --> 02:09:31,136
That prompts a lot of this activity

2743
02:09:31,904 --> 02:09:33,696
The events that are happening

2744
02:09:33,952 --> 02:09:38,560
Starting really on March 8th and then March 9th are large enough to be a big news story

2745
02:09:38,816 --> 02:09:40,608
Any International media is there

2746
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:44,448
There are magazine journalists there a newspaper reporters for

2747
02:09:44,704 --> 02:09:48,032
Brittany France places like that telling the folks back home what's going on

2748
02:09:48,288 --> 02:09:49,568
In the Russian capital

2749
02:09:49,824 --> 02:09:51,616
One is a British newspaper man

2750
02:09:51,872 --> 02:09:52,640
Name John Paul

2751
02:09:53,408 --> 02:09:55,456
And he writes about the women

2752
02:09:55,968 --> 02:09:57,248
Protest

2753
02:09:58,528 --> 02:10:00,832
He writes in this is about March 8th

2754
02:10:01,088 --> 02:10:01,856
And my apology

2755
02:10:02,112 --> 02:10:03,392
She's for my Russian pronunciation

2756
02:10:03,648 --> 02:10:04,160
Quote

2757
02:10:04,416 --> 02:10:07,232
The rioting was so far confined to the viberg size

2758
02:10:07,488 --> 02:10:09,792
The cheap workman's quarter of petrograd

2759
02:10:10,304 --> 02:10:13,376
Put in the center of the Tramway service had already become a regular

2760
02:10:13,888 --> 02:10:16,960
On the 9th the rioters stop the trams across the river

2761
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:20,544
Terrorizing the drivers and throwing parts of the mechanism away

2762
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:23,104
So that the service crew still more intermittent

2763
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:29,248
Visits were paid to all the factories in the hands were called out in sympathetic strike against the sudden food shortage

2764
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:33,856
On this day to a prefect of police who threatened the crowd was killed

2765
02:10:34,368 --> 02:10:38,720
Strong Cossack squadrons Patrol petrograd and there was a collision on the nevsky

2766
02:10:38,976 --> 02:10:40,512
In which the Cossacks use their whips

2767
02:10:41,024 --> 02:10:43,072
But they told the crowd that they would not shoot

2768
02:10:43,328 --> 02:10:45,120
So long as they only asked for bread

2769
02:10:45,376 --> 02:10:48,704
Alarm that the attitude of the Cossacks the authorities on the 10th

2770
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:51,776
Brought troops of the line into the streets to support the police

2771
02:10:52,032 --> 02:10:56,128
Posted machine guns on the nevsky and stop traffic across it at many point

2772
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:57,152
And quote

2773
02:10:58,944 --> 02:11:00,480
John Pollock then points out

2774
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:06,880
It sounds like a rumor but what what the Russian Minister working for the tsarina is supposed to have said

2775
02:11:07,136 --> 02:11:13,024
When his methods for dealing with this Uprising are being questioned here's what Pollock rights he says quote

2776
02:11:13,792 --> 02:11:19,424
Protopopov approached by one who endeavored to convince him of The Madness of his methods only answered

2777
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:22,752
Do you know how splendidly machine guns work from the roof

2778
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:24,288
And quote

2779
02:11:27,104 --> 02:11:28,128
Pollock says

2780
02:11:28,384 --> 02:11:32,480
That the first serious Bloodshed happens on March 10th when police open fire

2781
02:11:32,736 --> 02:11:35,040
On a group of protesters and killer wound V

2782
02:11:36,576 --> 02:11:38,880
The Tsar is now told about problems

2783
02:11:39,392 --> 02:11:41,696
At the Capitol remember he's off kind of at the front

2784
02:11:42,208 --> 02:11:43,232
Not in this

2785
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:47,840
Capitol Hill he's letting his wife so to run the show with the spreader Popoff guy

2786
02:11:48,096 --> 02:11:50,656
How does our finds out about it they tell him things are bad

2787
02:11:50,912 --> 02:11:53,984
He issues an order that basically says make it stop

2788
02:11:56,032 --> 02:12:02,176
That order appears on lampposts and all over the city the next morning when the riot

2789
02:12:02,432 --> 02:12:03,456
Sanders and protesters

2790
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:05,760
Master 2

2791
02:12:06,528 --> 02:12:09,344
Protest for the day they see this message from the head

2792
02:12:10,368 --> 02:12:11,136
Petrograd

2793
02:12:11,392 --> 02:12:12,416

2795
02:12:13,952 --> 02:12:15,232
During the last days

2796
02:12:15,488 --> 02:12:17,536
Disorders have taken place in petrograd

2797
02:12:18,048 --> 02:12:21,888
Followed by force and assaults on the lives of soldiers and members of the police

2798
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:24,960
I forbid every kind of assembly in the streets

2799
02:12:25,216 --> 02:12:30,080
I won the population of petrograd the commands have been issued and repeated to the Troops

2800
02:12:30,336 --> 02:12:31,360
To use their arms

2801
02:12:31,616 --> 02:12:35,968
And not to stop short of anything in order to assure Tranquility in the capital

2802

NT Wright quote

2805
02:12:43,648 --> 02:12:45,952
Sunday March 11th began nervously

2806
02:12:46,464 --> 02:12:51,072
There Were Soldiers everywhere in the streets and strong bodies held in reserve in Port yards

2807
02:12:51,328 --> 02:12:54,912
By now the trams at all. It was hardly possible to find a car

2808
02:12:55,424 --> 02:12:56,704
No newspapers appeared

2809
02:12:56,960 --> 02:13:01,824
About 3:30 p.m. the troops begin to clear the streets around the nevsky at the Bayonet Point

2810
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:03,104
And soon afterwards

2811
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:07,712
The police turn their machine guns onto a crowd at the same place as the day before

2812
02:13:07,968 --> 02:13:09,248
But with more deadly effect

2813
02:13:09,504 --> 02:13:11,808
A Caucasian officer who is nearby

2814
02:13:12,064 --> 02:13:14,112
Estimating the number of dead at 300

2815
02:13:14,368 --> 02:13:17,696
At the same time heavy firing took place further down the nevsky

2816
02:13:17,952 --> 02:13:19,488
An opposite the Kazan Cathedral

2817
02:13:19,744 --> 02:13:21,792
Several score more people were killed

2818
02:13:22,048 --> 02:13:24,352
The crowd here retaliated with pistol shots

2819
02:13:24,608 --> 02:13:30,496
Another prefix in a kernel of the police besides policeman the various innocent passers-by being killed

2820
02:13:31,008 --> 02:13:32,288
It was significant he right

2821
02:13:32,544 --> 02:13:35,360
It's soldiers were seen among the crowd firing on the police

2822
02:13:35,872 --> 02:13:38,944
And the number of man in some 14 officers are different attachments

2823
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:42,016
Were arrested for refusing to support the police with arm

2824
02:13:42,528 --> 02:13:46,880
Almost same afternoon a drunken officer of the volume ski regiment named loss cabbage

2825
02:13:47,136 --> 02:13:48,928
Ordered his men to fire on the crowd

2826
02:13:49,184 --> 02:13:49,952
They refuse

2827
02:13:50,208 --> 02:13:52,768
Polish cabbage Sports one of the soldiers to obey

2828
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:54,560
His shot killed a woman

2829
02:13:55,072 --> 02:13:55,840
And quote

2830
02:13:57,632 --> 02:13:58,912
The hurting of women

2831
02:13:59,424 --> 02:14:03,520
As I said seems to be an important part of this affair cuz it's mentioned by everyone

2832
02:14:04,544 --> 02:14:06,848
Trotsky says the rumor that was going around

2833
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:10,176
Was that a police officer struck a woman

2834
02:14:10,432 --> 02:14:11,200
With a clock

2835
02:14:11,456 --> 02:14:14,272
And that this was witnessed by the Cossacks who were sort of

2836
02:14:14,528 --> 02:14:15,808
Sitting by neutral

2837
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:17,856
Are there two kind of

2838
02:14:18,112 --> 02:14:22,464
Add some muscle to the mick but the armies kind of standing by while the hated police

2839
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:24,000
And the public face off

2840
02:14:24,256 --> 02:14:24,768
And

2841
02:14:25,024 --> 02:14:31,168
Trotsky's is whether or not it really happened everybody believed that a woman had been assaulted in front of the Cossacks in the car

2842
02:14:31,424 --> 02:14:33,216
Call Saks drove the police away who did it

2843
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:36,288
Now one of the things that if you watched

2844
02:14:36,544 --> 02:14:38,592
Recent revolutions you'll notice that

2845
02:14:38,848 --> 02:14:40,640
Often times some incident will happen

2846
02:14:41,152 --> 02:14:41,664
That the

2847
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:45,248
Demonstrators and protesters and rioters will sort of

2848
02:14:46,016 --> 02:14:47,552
Clean to some sort of symbol

2849
02:14:47,808 --> 02:14:49,088
Generally from the event

2850
02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:54,976
It becomes almost like a high sign that protesters use and that they rally around

2851
02:14:55,232 --> 02:14:56,512
According to Trotsky

2852
02:14:57,024 --> 02:14:59,840
What it was in this Revolution was a Cossack

2853
02:15:00,608 --> 02:15:01,632
Calvarymen

2854
02:15:01,888 --> 02:15:03,168
Lincoln to the crowd

2855
02:15:04,192 --> 02:15:06,240
And that this wink became sort of a

2856
02:15:06,496 --> 02:15:07,008
Symbol

2857
02:15:07,264 --> 02:15:09,056
Of what was going on here's the way

2858
02:15:09,312 --> 02:15:15,456
Trotsky explained it and remember trotsky's a revolutionary for him this is a hugely heroic tale and that's the way he

2859
02:15:15,712 --> 02:15:16,224
He tells it

2860
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:17,760
And I think we're all colored

2861
02:15:18,016 --> 02:15:19,808
At least those of us who know what's coming

2862
02:15:20,064 --> 02:15:21,600
Buy what's coming

2863
02:15:22,368 --> 02:15:25,184
This revolution is going to devolve into something very terrible

2864
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:25,952
And

2865
02:15:26,208 --> 02:15:30,560
A lot of us look back on this event thinking that that's how we should View

2866
02:15:30,816 --> 02:15:33,888
Bee removal of what came before communism

2867
02:15:34,144 --> 02:15:36,448
And yet there was a. After this revolution

2868
02:15:36,704 --> 02:15:40,544
Where Russia was on the road to becoming something more like the United States

2869
02:15:41,056 --> 02:15:42,592
And so getting rid

2870
02:15:43,104 --> 02:15:47,456
Of a czarist regime that these people seem to hate like a Saddam Hussein

2871
02:15:47,712 --> 02:15:48,992
Was initially viewed

2872
02:15:49,504 --> 02:15:50,016
As a plus

2873
02:15:50,272 --> 02:15:52,832
And the reporter on the scene for example for the British press

2874
02:15:53,088 --> 02:15:54,368
He's thoroughly in favor

2875
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:56,672
Oh something replacing this regime

2876
02:15:58,208 --> 02:16:04,352
The United States is too by the way one of the problems the United States has with joining the Allies are being

2877
02:16:04,608 --> 02:16:08,448
Associated with the Allies is not Britain and France would they feel very close to in a lot of ways

2878
02:16:08,704 --> 02:16:09,728
It's Russia

2879
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:12,288
To them Russia is the same kind of

2880
02:16:12,544 --> 02:16:14,080
Militant autocracy that

2881
02:16:14,592 --> 02:16:17,408
Do us propaganda paint the Germans ass

2882
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:23,040
The ideas are going away to be replaced by some sort of constitutional government

2883
02:16:23,296 --> 02:16:25,856
Makes a lot of people in the Allied camps it up and

2884
02:16:26,368 --> 02:16:27,904
Cheer for the protesters

2885
02:16:29,952 --> 02:16:32,768
Now in the story by Trotsky of the Winking Cossack

2886
02:16:33,024 --> 02:16:37,888
He explains that the officers of the Cossacks kind of force them to charge into the crowd at one point

2887
02:16:38,144 --> 02:16:40,704
But as soon as the officers pass by in Scatter the crowd

2888
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:45,824
The regular Cossacks are very careful moving through with their horses not to hurt anyone

2889
02:16:46,592 --> 02:16:47,104
And

2890
02:16:47,360 --> 02:16:47,872
Trotsky right

2891
02:16:48,128 --> 02:16:48,640
It's quote

2892
02:16:49,152 --> 02:16:52,992
Behind them filling the whole width of the prospect Gallop the Cossack

2893
02:16:53,248 --> 02:16:54,272
Decisive moment

2894
02:16:54,528 --> 02:16:55,552
What's a Horseman

2895
02:16:55,808 --> 02:17:00,160
Cautiously in a long ribbon Road through the corridor just made by the officers

2896
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:01,696
Some of them smile

2897
02:17:02,208 --> 02:17:02,720
E-courts app

2898
02:17:02,976 --> 02:17:03,488
Protester

2899
02:17:03,744 --> 02:17:04,768
Caillou referee calls

2900
02:17:05,024 --> 02:17:07,328
And one of them gave the workers a good wing

2901
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:08,352
This wink

2902
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:09,376
Karate size

2903
02:17:09,632 --> 02:17:10,912
Was not without meaning

2904
02:17:11,168 --> 02:17:14,752
The workers wearing Bolden with a friendly not hostile kind of assurance

2905
02:17:15,008 --> 02:17:17,312
And slightly infected the contacts with it

2906
02:17:17,568 --> 02:17:19,616
The one who went found imitators

2907
02:17:19,872 --> 02:17:22,176
In spite of renewed efforts from the officers

2908
02:17:22,432 --> 02:17:27,552
The Cossacks without openly breaking discipline failed to force the crowd to disperse

2909
02:17:28,064 --> 02:17:29,856
Flowed through it in the Stream

2910
02:17:30,112 --> 02:17:36,256
This was repeated three or four times and brought the two sides even closer together individual cost X began to

2911
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:37,792
Reply to the workers question

2912
02:17:38,048 --> 02:17:41,120
And even to enter into momentary conversations with them

2913
02:17:41,376 --> 02:17:46,496
I'm disciplined there remained but a thin transparent shelf that threatened to break through any second

2914
02:17:47,008 --> 02:17:52,128
The officers hasten to separate their patrol from the workers and abandon the idea of dispersing them

2915
02:17:52,384 --> 02:17:57,760
Lines the Cossacks out across the street as a barrier to prevent the demonstrators from getting to the center

2916
02:17:58,272 --> 02:17:58,784
And quote

2917
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:03,648
He then told the story about how these Concepts will allow themselves to be used as a mounted barrier

2918
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:04,672
But they don't stop

2919
02:18:04,928 --> 02:18:07,488
The protesters from diving under the horses bellies

2920
02:18:09,536 --> 02:18:12,864
The fact that the Cossacks traditionally thesaurus

2921
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:14,656
Crowd control mechanism

2922
02:18:15,168 --> 02:18:15,936
Appear

2923
02:18:16,192 --> 02:18:19,520
Less than enthusiastic about carrying out their traditional role

2924
02:18:19,776 --> 02:18:21,568
Convinces the government that they have to bring in the

2925
02:18:22,592 --> 02:18:25,664
The Garrison of petrograd is like a hundred 50 hundred six

2926
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:26,688
Thousand men

2927
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:28,224
They've got the people

2928
02:18:28,736 --> 02:18:34,880
And they call the man in March 11th is the key day because that's the day that elements of one famous unit of training Squad

2929
02:18:35,392 --> 02:18:39,232
It's called open fire and kill those people that the British reporter was talking

2930
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:41,792
Now

2931
02:18:42,304 --> 02:18:43,840
The people of petrograd

2932
02:18:44,096 --> 02:18:44,864
Are appealing

2933
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:50,752
To the Troops as you heard earlier mingling with them talking to them they are walking up to the line of Bayonetta troops

2934
02:18:51,264 --> 02:18:56,896
You know in in ones and twos and saying Brothers you're not really going to side with the police and kill us are you

2935
02:18:57,152 --> 02:19:03,296
The women again taking the lead in this whole thing are walking right up the line of banded troops and

2936
02:19:03,552 --> 02:19:07,136
Grabbing their rifles with the band that's on them in wrestling with them and saying join us

2937
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:11,488
I did a lot of that going on

2938
02:19:13,792 --> 02:19:14,816
After the

2939
02:19:15,584 --> 02:19:17,376
Shootings in the street on March 11th

2940
02:19:17,888 --> 02:19:20,960
Citizens were told workers go up to

2941
02:19:21,216 --> 02:19:23,264
Members of one of these storage units

2942
02:19:25,056 --> 02:19:25,824
And tell them

2943
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:31,456
The people in your unit open fire yesterday against the people of the city and told him what happened

2944
02:19:31,712 --> 02:19:35,296
And then those troops went back to their barracks and on the evening of March 11th

2945
02:19:35,552 --> 02:19:36,576
Morning of March 12th

2946
02:19:37,088 --> 02:19:37,856
They had one of those

2947
02:19:38,624 --> 02:19:40,160
Moral crisis moments

2948
02:19:41,696 --> 02:19:43,744
He instant in any Revolution a guy like

2949
02:19:44,256 --> 02:19:45,792
Leon Trotsky would say

2950
02:19:46,048 --> 02:19:47,840
And he describes it with almost

2951
02:19:48,352 --> 02:19:49,120
Heroic

2952
02:19:49,888 --> 02:19:50,912
Mattones

2953
02:19:51,168 --> 02:19:52,704
This this moment where this

2954
02:19:53,216 --> 02:19:54,240
Storage unit

2955
02:19:54,752 --> 02:19:59,872
Confront the reality that they shot a bunch of those poor people that have been besieging them not to shoot

2956
02:20:00,384 --> 02:20:00,896
The day

2957
02:20:01,152 --> 02:20:03,712
Before and they were going to have to go out and do it again

2958
02:20:04,224 --> 02:20:05,504
Today yours with Trotsky

2959
02:20:06,016 --> 02:20:06,528
Quote

2960
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:09,600
The soldiers had no more time for hesitation

2961
02:20:10,112 --> 02:20:11,904
They were compelled to shoot yesterday

2962
02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:13,696
And they would be again today

2963
02:20:13,952 --> 02:20:16,256
The workers will not surrender or retreat

2964
02:20:16,512 --> 02:20:18,560
Under-fire they're still holding their own

2965
02:20:18,816 --> 02:20:20,096
I'm with them their wives

2966
02:20:20,352 --> 02:20:21,888
Mother's sister sweetheart

2967
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:25,472
Yes and this is the very hour that they had so whispered about

2968
02:20:25,728 --> 02:20:27,520
If only we could all get together

2969
02:20:29,568 --> 02:20:30,848
Chucky saying that all these people

2970
02:20:32,384 --> 02:20:32,896
Thought about

2971
02:20:33,408 --> 02:20:37,504
Could these are be overthrown if only we could all get together that would happen and now these soldiers

2972
02:20:38,016 --> 02:20:41,088
We're not taking part in that they were taking part in crushing that

2973
02:20:42,368 --> 02:20:44,672
If only we could all get together trustee rights

2974
02:20:45,184 --> 02:20:47,232
And then at that moment of supreme agony

2975
02:20:47,488 --> 02:20:53,632
Indian bearable fear of the coming day the choking hatred of those were imposing upon than the X

2976
02:20:53,888 --> 02:20:54,912
Schnur's roll

2977
02:20:55,168 --> 02:20:58,752
The ring out in the Barrack room the first voices of open indignation

2978
02:20:59,008 --> 02:21:00,032
And in those voices

2979
02:21:00,288 --> 02:21:01,568
To be forever nameless

2980
02:21:01,824 --> 02:21:05,408
The whole army with relief and Rapture recognizes itself

2981
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:07,200
Bust down upon the Earth

2982
02:21:07,456 --> 02:21:09,760
The day of destruction of the Romanov monarchy

2983
02:21:10,784 --> 02:21:11,296
And quote

2984
02:21:12,832 --> 02:21:14,624
The soldier shot their officer

2985
02:21:15,648 --> 02:21:18,208
Ran out into the streets cheering enjoined

2986
02:21:18,464 --> 02:21:19,744
The people of petrograd

2987
02:21:20,512 --> 02:21:22,048
Trying to overthrow the czar

2988
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:24,608
Encourage other military units

2989
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:25,888
To follow

2990
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:28,192
Most of which by the end of March

2991
02:21:28,448 --> 02:21:29,472
12th and done so

2992
02:21:29,728 --> 02:21:32,800
The Garrison was melting away in joining

2993
02:21:33,056 --> 02:21:34,336
The antivirus

2994
02:21:34,848 --> 02:21:35,360
Rioters

2995
02:21:36,384 --> 02:21:37,408
They ransacked

2996
02:21:37,664 --> 02:21:42,016
The artillery Depot then they go to the Arsenal and break into it and take all the weapons

2997
02:21:42,272 --> 02:21:45,600
Then they burn down the court of justice and a bunch of other government buildings

2998
02:21:45,856 --> 02:21:50,976
And for March 12th on you have open battles in the Streets between the people in the army

2999
02:21:51,488 --> 02:21:54,048
And the very large police forces

3000
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:59,680
And we would call them today the secret police and all these police agencies that have set up machine guns

3001
02:22:00,192 --> 02:22:00,960
At intersection

3002
02:22:03,008 --> 02:22:04,032
At this point

3003
02:22:04,544 --> 02:22:07,104
The big question is what the heck is the Czar doing

3004
02:22:09,664 --> 02:22:11,968
The first thing is our try to do is just get rid of the Duma

3005
02:22:12,736 --> 02:22:14,016
And when the head of this

3006
02:22:14,272 --> 02:22:20,416
Powerless for all intents and purposes Russian legislature received the order that the Duma is to disband he says

3007
02:22:21,696 --> 02:22:24,000
And most of the Duma joins him in the street

3008
02:22:24,256 --> 02:22:25,280
Joining the rebels

3009
02:22:27,328 --> 02:22:29,376
Next bizarre gets on a train

3010
02:22:29,888 --> 02:22:34,240
On the 13th of March and heads back toward the capitol from the fighting friend where he is

3011
02:22:34,752 --> 02:22:36,800
In one of his typically strange moves

3012
02:22:37,312 --> 02:22:41,920
He takes a lot longer to get there than he should have because he says he doesn't want to disrupt any of the

3013
02:22:42,176 --> 02:22:46,528
War traffic heading to the front so his train takes over the long way around

3014
02:22:46,784 --> 02:22:52,160
And it ends up getting stopped on the way to petrograd because the revolution is spreading to other cities now

3015
02:22:52,672 --> 02:22:56,000
And one of these train stops the revolutionaries are stopping the train

3016
02:22:58,304 --> 02:23:00,352
We are told that the czar's advisors

3017
02:23:00,608 --> 02:23:01,888
Are bringing him telegrams

3018
02:23:02,144 --> 02:23:03,424
Power Brokers including

3019
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:04,448
For example

3020
02:23:04,960 --> 02:23:05,472
His cousin

3021
02:23:05,728 --> 02:23:06,496
And others that he

3022
02:23:06,752 --> 02:23:07,520
He needs to give up

3023
02:23:07,776 --> 02:23:08,288
The crown

3024
02:23:09,312 --> 02:23:10,592
And what sort of interesting

3025
02:23:11,104 --> 02:23:13,664
About Nicholas is that he almost seems willing

3026
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:15,968
Going to do it there's a whole line of thinking

3027
02:23:16,224 --> 02:23:20,832
You know if you read a lot of the primary sources he sometimes portrayed as this drunken tyrant

3028
02:23:21,088 --> 02:23:21,600
You know when

3029
02:23:21,856 --> 02:23:25,184
But when you read more modern-day history he's a much more pitiable figure

3030
02:23:25,696 --> 02:23:26,720
Churchill likes

3031
02:23:26,976 --> 02:23:28,000
Patricia would like

3032
02:23:28,512 --> 02:23:34,656
What does great things about in this poor misunderstood person of course he wasn't a great man just a good man and he talks about him like that

3033
02:23:35,424 --> 02:23:36,192
What does orange soda

3034
02:23:37,728 --> 02:23:38,752
Seems to be relieved

3035
02:23:39,008 --> 02:23:39,776
How to prospect

3036
02:23:40,032 --> 02:23:40,544
Giving up the car

3037
02:23:41,312 --> 02:23:46,944
At first there's like five minutes of talk about giving it to his hemophiliac son but the Tsar doesn't want that

3038
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:50,272
Any interesting neatly enough in the application note

3039
02:23:50,528 --> 02:23:51,552
To his people

3040
02:23:51,808 --> 02:23:54,880
The Tsar specifically mentions not wanting to be parted

3041
02:23:55,392 --> 02:23:55,904
From

3042
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:57,440
In the Sun at your door

3043
02:23:57,952 --> 02:24:01,024
Once again you get that feeling of Nicholas and Alexandra at these kind of

3044
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:01,792
Your parents were just

3045
02:24:02,048 --> 02:24:02,816
Adore their children

3046
02:24:03,328 --> 02:24:08,448
Whether or not this is some sort of smokescreen to cover something all the evidence seems to point out to a guy

3047
02:24:08,704 --> 02:24:12,288
Who cared more about his family in some ways than beings are

3048
02:24:14,080 --> 02:24:15,616
There was a quote to the guy

3049
02:24:16,128 --> 02:24:17,408
Who will take over

3050
02:24:17,664 --> 02:24:19,968
The What's called the provisional government

3051
02:24:22,528 --> 02:24:24,832
The country in the near future his name is Alexander

3052
02:24:25,088 --> 02:24:25,600
The kerensky

3053
02:24:26,112 --> 02:24:29,440
And he met the Tsar after the Czar been taken into sort of custody

3054
02:24:30,208 --> 02:24:31,232
And he said quote

3055
02:24:31,488 --> 02:24:33,024
As I studied his face

3056
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:36,352
I seem to see behind a smile and Charming eyes

3057
02:24:36,608 --> 02:24:37,120
A stiff

3058
02:24:37,376 --> 02:24:40,448
Proper mask of utter loneliness and desolation

3059
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:45,824
When I began to know this living mask I understood why it has been so easy to overthrow his power

3060
02:24:46,336 --> 02:24:47,616
He did not wish to fight

3061
02:24:48,128 --> 02:24:49,664
And it's simply fell from his hand

3062
02:24:51,456 --> 02:24:51,968
And quote

3063
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:56,832
The things that this is are we going to have to do to keep power

3064
02:24:57,344 --> 02:24:58,112
He seemed

3065
02:24:58,368 --> 02:24:59,136
Unwilling

3066
02:24:59,904 --> 02:25:02,976
To do his wife may have wanted him to She Wrote letters

3067
02:25:03,232 --> 02:25:05,280
Telling him he needs to be tougher and stronger

3068
02:25:05,792 --> 02:25:10,144
He seemed to care more about the fact that all his children while all this is going on

3069
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:12,192
Have a bad case of the measles which

3070
02:25:12,448 --> 02:25:12,960
Are you serious

3071
02:25:13,216 --> 02:25:13,728
Back then

3072
02:25:13,984 --> 02:25:17,824
And is as concerned seemingly for them as he is of giving up

3073
02:25:18,336 --> 02:25:19,104
In his power

3074
02:25:20,896 --> 02:25:22,176
All over Russia

3075
02:25:22,944 --> 02:25:24,992
Begin to break into government buildings

3076
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:26,528
And teardown

3077
02:25:27,296 --> 02:25:28,320
Paintings of bizarre

3078
02:25:30,624 --> 02:25:34,208
And the aftermath of this revolution sounds like the aftermath

3079
02:25:34,464 --> 02:25:36,512
The fall of Saddam Hussein again when

3080
02:25:36,768 --> 02:25:37,280
All these

3081
02:25:37,536 --> 02:25:43,680
Figures that were part of the government that work for the Tsar are being arrested and held in custody by people in armed

3082
02:25:43,936 --> 02:25:44,448
Weapons

3083
02:25:44,960 --> 02:25:46,240
2 PowerBlock

3084

Forum

3085
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:53,664
In the wake of all this cuz remember there is no plan the real revolutionaries have been working for this for years what kind of caught off guard

3086
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:54,432
Guard-one It app

3087
02:25:55,200 --> 02:26:00,320
So there's no competing groups for power one group is the people that used to be the almost powerless

3088
02:26:00,832 --> 02:26:01,600
Duma

3089
02:26:01,856 --> 02:26:08,000
All of a sudden they have power and they're mostly liberals and and Miles socialist and people who want to cry

3090
02:26:08,256 --> 02:26:14,400
Create they end up writing United States by the way in June saying that they want to create a constitutional government they want to use maybe they do not

3091
02:26:16,704 --> 02:26:17,472
But competing

3092
02:26:17,728 --> 02:26:18,496
With that

3093
02:26:18,752 --> 02:26:20,288
Particular entity for power

3094
02:26:20,544 --> 02:26:22,848
Is power too much lower-level groups that

3095
02:26:23,104 --> 02:26:24,384
Especially revolutionaries

3096
02:26:24,896 --> 02:26:25,408
Forming

3097
02:26:25,664 --> 02:26:26,176
Council

3098
02:26:26,432 --> 02:26:27,200
Rules of workers

3099
02:26:27,456 --> 02:26:28,480
Send soldiers together

3100
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:30,272
And

3101
02:26:30,528 --> 02:26:32,576
They form this rough weird

3102
02:26:33,088 --> 02:26:34,368
Partnership with the

3103
02:26:34,624 --> 02:26:35,648
Provisional government is to

3104
02:26:35,904 --> 02:26:37,184
It's called the former Duma

3105
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:40,512
And they kind of work with each other sometimes but they come to

3106
02:26:41,024 --> 02:26:42,560
Disagreements over other things

3107
02:26:43,328 --> 02:26:44,608
But when push comes to shove

3108
02:26:45,376 --> 02:26:46,144
The Soviet

3109
02:26:46,656 --> 02:26:47,680
As they're called these

3110
02:26:48,704 --> 02:26:50,496
You elected groups of people

3111
02:26:51,008 --> 02:26:52,544
Soldiers and workers councils

3112
02:26:53,568 --> 02:26:54,336
Seems to win

3113
02:26:55,360 --> 02:26:56,640
The first thing that they win

3114
02:26:56,896 --> 02:26:59,968
Is a rule that says that anything involving the military

3115
02:27:00,736 --> 02:27:01,760
Is under the control

3116
02:27:02,016 --> 02:27:02,528
The Sobe

3117
02:27:04,832 --> 02:27:07,392
And this is the key issue for the other

3118
02:27:07,648 --> 02:27:08,928
Countries in the war

3119
02:27:09,440 --> 02:27:11,744
Germany wants Russia out of the war

3120
02:27:12,768 --> 02:27:14,048
They've been paying

3121
02:27:14,304 --> 02:27:20,448
Agitators for a long time to hopefully make that happen now you have this situation with his arms gone what are they

3122
02:27:20,704 --> 02:27:21,984
The Russians going to do militarily

3123
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:24,288
The British and the French feel the same way

3124
02:27:24,544 --> 02:27:30,688
Along with the Americans they're not that upset that the czar's gone but they're very concerned that Russia is going to pull out of the war

3125
02:27:32,736 --> 02:27:33,248
This

3126
02:27:33,504 --> 02:27:36,320
Provisional government will be known as the kerensky government

3127
02:27:36,576 --> 02:27:37,088
At a certain point

3128
02:27:37,344 --> 02:27:43,232
They tell the Allies that they're going to continue fighting a committed to continue fighting the Allies start pouring

3129
02:27:43,488 --> 02:27:47,328
Money and stuff into Russia even at a greater pace and they were before

3130
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:52,960
How do you continue to hold off Germany in the Central Powers with your army

3131
02:27:53,728 --> 02:27:56,032
While you're 300 year old

3132
02:27:56,800 --> 02:27:59,872
Monarchy is busy collapsing all the structures

3133
02:28:00,384 --> 02:28:02,688
That have been you know hanging by a string

3134
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:04,224
Start falling apart

3135
02:28:06,016 --> 02:28:09,088
What are the soldiers at the front going to do this became the key question

3136
02:28:09,344 --> 02:28:11,136
And it's not answered right away

3137
02:28:12,672 --> 02:28:14,464
Churchill as only he can

3138
02:28:14,976 --> 02:28:21,120
Saw the whole thing is an unmitigated disaster looking back on it from the late 1920s again now he can see

3139
02:28:21,376 --> 02:28:22,656
Where all this is going to go

3140
02:28:22,912 --> 02:28:25,216
Communism in the future so his ideas are probably

3141
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:31,360
He said the tragedy of Russia was and I'm quoting here that her ship went down within sight of

3142
02:28:31,616 --> 02:28:32,128
Port

3143
02:28:32,384 --> 02:28:34,688
Meaning we were just going to win this war

3144
02:28:34,944 --> 02:28:36,992
And then Russia doesn't get to share in the spoils

3145
02:28:37,248 --> 02:28:38,784
And he says of Russia quote

3146
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:40,576
With victory in her grasp

3147
02:28:40,832 --> 02:28:42,112
She fell upon the Earth

3148
02:28:42,368 --> 02:28:45,440
Devoured alive like Herod of old by worm

3149
02:28:45,952 --> 02:28:48,256
But not in vain her Valiant Deeds

3150
02:28:48,512 --> 02:28:54,656
The giant mortally stricken had just time with her dying strength to pass the torch Eastwood

3151
02:28:54,912 --> 02:28:56,704
Across the ocean to a new Titan

3152
02:28:56,960 --> 02:28:58,240
Long sunken doubt

3153
02:28:58,496 --> 02:29:01,312
Hunan l'rose and began ponderously the arm

3154
02:29:01,824 --> 02:29:03,872
The Russian Empire fell on March 16th

3155
02:29:04,128 --> 02:29:05,152
On April 6th

3156
02:29:05,408 --> 02:29:06,944
The United States enter the war

3157
02:29:07,968 --> 02:29:08,480
And quote

3158
02:29:10,272 --> 02:29:12,576
It's been an interesting two months for the United States

3159
02:29:13,344 --> 02:29:13,856
Since Germany

3160
02:29:14,112 --> 02:29:15,648
Decided to unleash the submarines

3161
02:29:16,672 --> 02:29:18,208
In the first 20 days

3162
02:29:18,464 --> 02:29:20,512
Is Robin Leach into submarines the Germans sink

3163
02:29:20,768 --> 02:29:22,048

40 Newton

3166

Amongst

3167
02:29:26,144 --> 02:29:27,936
There are us shipping companies

3168
02:29:28,192 --> 02:29:34,336
In the month of February when this all starts that start losing a million dollars 1917 value money by the way

3169
02:29:34,592 --> 02:29:35,104
A week

3170
02:29:36,640 --> 02:29:39,456
The next month March 1917 those numbers will double

3171
02:29:40,480 --> 02:29:41,248
And all of a sudden

3172
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:43,808
We begin to see what the first

3173
02:29:44,064 --> 02:29:44,832
Real

3174
02:29:45,344 --> 02:29:46,112
Competent

3175
02:29:46,368 --> 02:29:46,880
Use

3176
02:29:47,136 --> 02:29:47,904
Involving

3177
02:29:48,160 --> 02:29:51,488
At least a minimum number of submarines is liking world has

3178
02:29:52,512 --> 02:29:55,328
The Germans have been perfecting that you do with these new

3179
02:29:55,584 --> 02:30:01,472
Weapon systems like submarines the science fiction type weapons what do you how do you use them at the beginning of the war they're kind of going after

3180
02:30:01,984 --> 02:30:08,128
Warships and whatnot and then they they work on short little bursts going after neutrals and Merchant ships and now by 19

3181
02:30:08,384 --> 02:30:10,944
1017 the Germans know what they want to do with these things

3182
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:12,736
And they have enough ships to make

3183
02:30:12,992 --> 02:30:15,296
Their plan work minimum number but enough

3184
02:30:15,808 --> 02:30:21,696
They Unleashed them to go after everything which is what their strategy has told them you have to do to really maximize this weapon system

3185
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:23,744
And there

3186
02:30:24,256 --> 02:30:25,792
Thinking enough ships

3187
02:30:26,304 --> 02:30:31,936
So that Britain is for the first time in the war in real danger itself of going under

3188
02:30:32,704 --> 02:30:36,800
What are the advantages of being an island nation is it you got the strongest Navy

3189
02:30:37,056 --> 02:30:39,616
You don't have to have the same kind of fears that are Russia have

3190
02:30:40,128 --> 02:30:41,152
Auray France

3191
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:45,760
The Germans aren't going to be able to break you directly cuz they can't reach you

3192
02:30:46,272 --> 02:30:49,344
This is the first time in the war that the British faced any serious threat

3193
02:30:49,856 --> 02:30:54,208
Of the Germans in one way or another reaching them affecting them personally

3194
02:30:54,464 --> 02:30:55,744
Forcing them perhaps

3195
02:30:56,256 --> 02:30:57,280
To knuckle under

3196
02:30:58,048 --> 02:30:59,072
Just some sort of peace deal

3197
02:31:00,352 --> 02:31:01,120
In April

3198
02:31:01,632 --> 02:31:02,144
The month

3199
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:04,192
The United States gets into the war

3200
02:31:04,960 --> 02:31:06,496
The Germans sink 400

3201
02:31:06,752 --> 02:31:07,264
23

3202
02:31:09,056 --> 02:31:10,080
Almost 805

3203
02:31:10,592 --> 02:31:11,616
1000 tons of ship

3204
02:31:13,664 --> 02:31:14,432
The British Empire

3205
02:31:14,688 --> 02:31:15,200
I cannot stay

3206
02:31:16,224 --> 02:31:16,992
Those kind of losses

3207
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:19,808
The submarine war

3208
02:31:20,320 --> 02:31:21,600
It eventually brings the United

3209
02:31:21,856 --> 02:31:22,368
States in

3210
02:31:22,624 --> 02:31:24,160
If for no other reason

3211
02:31:24,416 --> 02:31:24,928
Venice

3212
02:31:25,184 --> 02:31:26,208
Disrupting

3213
02:31:26,464 --> 02:31:28,000
Operations in the country

3214
02:31:29,024 --> 02:31:35,168
The president is under a lot of pressure on a day-to-day increasing basis because once he starts thinking all these ships US ship stop leak

3215
02:31:36,704 --> 02:31:37,984
They begin to congregate

3216
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:42,848
And clogged up and cause traffic jams outside the major ports on the Eastern seaboard

3217
02:31:43,104 --> 02:31:48,992
And then all of the Commodities and food and perishables that we're going to be loaded onto those ships begin backing up

3218
02:31:49,504 --> 02:31:50,016
You got this

3219
02:31:50,272 --> 02:31:50,784
Terrible

3220
02:31:51,296 --> 02:31:57,440
Clogged all the ports on the eastern coast of material this rotting and degrading because the ships won't cross the Atlantic

3221
02:31:57,696 --> 02:31:58,720
Because they are afraid of the submarine

3222
02:32:01,792 --> 02:32:02,304
At one point

3223
02:32:02,560 --> 02:32:03,840
Wilson wants the army ships

3224
02:32:04,096 --> 02:32:05,376
Change the situation

3225
02:32:06,656 --> 02:32:08,448
Watch provide Assurance of the taken

3226
02:32:08,704 --> 02:32:09,216
Norcross

3227
02:32:09,984 --> 02:32:15,360
But this is like a ticking Time Bomb for Wilson he's got to do something this situation is only going to get worse

3228
02:32:16,896 --> 02:32:19,712
The Zimmerman Telegram happens in late February to a mean

3229
02:32:19,968 --> 02:32:23,040
All these things that just increase a situation that's bad

3230
02:32:23,296 --> 02:32:24,064
And make it worse

3231
02:32:24,320 --> 02:32:25,344
But there's no

3232
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:28,160
Instant moment where the line has been crossed

3233
02:32:29,184 --> 02:32:30,208
And there never will be

3234
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:34,048
At some point

3235
02:32:34,816 --> 02:32:39,680
By March 1917 at the latest then probably around the same time the Russian Revolution is happening

3236
02:32:39,936 --> 02:32:41,728
The Wilson Administration decides

3237
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:43,008
They've had enough

3238
02:32:44,288 --> 02:32:47,360
5 us ships go down in March 1917

3239
02:32:47,616 --> 02:32:51,968
Twosome in the Wilson Administration this is confirmation that the US is already at War

3240
02:32:52,224 --> 02:32:52,736
War with Germany

3241
02:32:53,248 --> 02:32:56,832
It doesn't have to be some big Lusitania 911 moment

3242
02:32:57,088 --> 02:33:02,464
To cross over this invisible line it's happening every day and on April 2nd Wilson Gibbs

3243
02:33:02,720 --> 02:33:06,048
Is most famous beach one of the most important speeches in American history

3244
02:33:06,816 --> 02:33:07,584
Concerning

3245
02:33:08,096 --> 02:33:09,120
The situation

3246
02:33:09,632 --> 02:33:10,400
That he see

3247
02:33:11,168 --> 02:33:12,704
The United States is at war with

3248
02:33:13,216 --> 02:33:13,728
Germany

3249
02:33:13,984 --> 02:33:16,544
The interesting part about the speech if you dissected it

3250
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:18,336
Monumental on so many levels

3251
02:33:19,104 --> 02:33:22,176
He's so crappy way it's put together he never says that the Congress

3252
02:33:22,432 --> 02:33:28,576
Declare war on Germany you know so that we'll be at war with Germany he says we are at war with Germany and I invite you to

3253
02:33:28,832 --> 02:33:29,600
To confirm that fact

3254
02:33:30,112 --> 02:33:32,160
He had no time gives Congress

3255
02:33:32,416 --> 02:33:35,488
The impression that they have any control over this decision at all

3256
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,048
Luckily for him they went along with him big

3257
02:33:38,304 --> 02:33:39,840
Time but what if they hadn't

3258
02:33:41,632 --> 02:33:47,520
Part of Wilson's speech focuses on the specific reason we're at this point talked about the submarine warfare Compares Germans

3259
02:33:47,776 --> 02:33:49,568
Do pirates and all these kinds of things

3260
02:33:49,824 --> 02:33:51,872
Take some time out of the speech to say

3261
02:33:52,384 --> 02:33:55,712
That we're not at war with the German people we have no quarrel with

3262
02:33:55,968 --> 02:33:57,760
It's their government we don't

3263
02:33:58,016 --> 02:33:59,808
Liking this is a big change by the way

3264
02:34:00,064 --> 02:34:01,344
In in the way

3265
02:34:01,600 --> 02:34:04,672
That much of the United States government will

3266
02:34:04,928 --> 02:34:05,440
Craft

3267
02:34:05,952 --> 02:34:09,280
Another way that they frame relationships with other countries to

3268
02:34:09,536 --> 02:34:10,816
Got nothing against the people

3269
02:34:11,072 --> 02:34:12,864
It's the government of Wilson point of view is

3270
02:34:13,120 --> 02:34:16,448
Is the people aren't running the government like in a democracy or Republic

3271
02:34:16,704 --> 02:34:18,240
Within the people aren't responsible

3272
02:34:18,496 --> 02:34:22,592
For what their government decisions are they may be the victims of it and we might have to hurt you

3273
02:34:22,848 --> 02:34:25,408
In order to overthrow your government but we're not mad at you

3274
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:31,552
Is really high-minded sentiments

3275
02:34:32,064 --> 02:34:35,392
Forever known afterwards as wilsonian principles

3276
02:34:35,648 --> 02:34:41,792
The talk about things like the need to make the world safe for democracy I'll give you a taste of that in the second

3277
02:34:42,048 --> 02:34:43,072
But more interesting

3278
02:34:43,328 --> 02:34:47,680
And again one of the more groundbreaking parts of the speech is that Wilson takes on the US

3279
02:34:48,448 --> 02:34:49,216
Tradition

3280
02:34:49,728 --> 02:34:52,032
Of non-involvement in European affairs

3281
02:34:52,288 --> 02:34:52,800
Head on

3282
02:34:53,568 --> 02:34:55,104
And he basically said

3283
02:34:55,616 --> 02:34:56,896
That was the way it was

3284
02:34:57,408 --> 02:34:57,920
Times of change

3285
02:34:58,944 --> 02:35:00,224
Here's the exact phrasing

3286
02:35:00,480 --> 02:35:00,992
Nikki Gibbs

3287
02:35:01,248 --> 02:35:02,528
What is a sea change

3288
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:04,064
In American

3289
02:35:04,320 --> 02:35:07,392
Foreign policy in the way the government of the United States approaches

3290
02:35:07,648 --> 02:35:13,536
The conflict involvement with the rest of the world and that course changes one we are still living with today

3291
02:35:13,792 --> 02:35:14,816
In the modern world

3292
02:35:15,072 --> 02:35:16,352
In the middle of his speech

3293
02:35:16,608 --> 02:35:21,216
Telling Congress that a war exists right now with Germany Wilson says quote

3294
02:35:23,264 --> 02:35:29,408
Our object now as then is to vindicate the principles of peace and Justice in the life of the world

3295
02:35:29,664 --> 02:35:31,712
As against selfish and autocratic power

3296
02:35:31,968 --> 02:35:36,064
And a set up amongst the really free and self-governed peoples of the world

3297
02:35:36,320 --> 02:35:41,696
Such a concert of purpose and of action as will henceforth ensure the observance of those principles

3298
02:35:42,208 --> 02:35:45,792
Neutrality is no longer feasible or desirable

3299
02:35:46,048 --> 02:35:47,840
Where the Peace of the world is involved

3300
02:35:48,096 --> 02:35:49,376
And the freedom of its people

3301
02:35:49,632 --> 02:35:54,240
And the Menace to that Peace and Freedom lies in the existence of autocratic governments

3302
02:35:54,496 --> 02:35:55,776
Back by organized Force

3303
02:35:56,032 --> 02:35:59,872
Which is controlled Holy by there will not by the will of their people

3304
02:36:00,384 --> 02:36:02,176
We have seen the last of neutrality

3305
02:36:02,432 --> 02:36:08,576
In such circumstances we're at the beginning of an age where it will be insisted that the same standards of Conduct in a person

3306
02:36:08,832 --> 02:36:10,368
Possibility for wrong done

3307
02:36:10,624 --> 02:36:12,928
She'll be observed among nations and their governments

3308
02:36:13,184 --> 02:36:16,512
That are observed among the individual citizens of civilized States

3309
02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:17,792
And quote

3310
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:21,376
Having a national policy

3311
02:36:21,632 --> 02:36:24,960
Connected to the idea of not going abroad in search of monsters

3312
02:36:25,216 --> 02:36:25,984
Display

3313
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:27,776
Just started to sound really low

3314
02:36:28,032 --> 02:36:28,544
Old fashioned

3315
02:36:30,336 --> 02:36:31,104
But at least

3316
02:36:31,616 --> 02:36:32,128
Wilson's

3317
02:36:32,640 --> 02:36:34,176
Got some really good

3318
02:36:34,688 --> 02:36:36,736
Arguments to justify the historic

3319
02:36:38,272 --> 02:36:39,552
These are the ideas

3320
02:36:40,064 --> 02:36:40,832
I'm wilsonia

3321
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:42,112
And here's

3322
02:36:42,368 --> 02:36:43,392
How Wilson enunciate

3323
02:36:43,648 --> 02:36:44,672
Just some of them

3324
02:36:45,184 --> 02:36:45,696
Quote

3325
02:36:45,952 --> 02:36:49,280
It is a distressing and oppressive Duty Gentlemen of the Congress

3326
02:36:49,536 --> 02:36:51,584
Which I have performed in this addressing you

3327
02:36:51,840 --> 02:36:56,448
There are it may be many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us

3328
02:36:56,960 --> 02:37:03,104
It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war into the most terrible and disastrous of all

3329
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:06,176
Towards civilization itself seeming to be in the ballet

3330
02:37:06,688 --> 02:37:08,736
But the right is more precious than peace

3331
02:37:09,248 --> 02:37:13,088
And we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts

3332
02:37:13,344 --> 02:37:14,112
For democracy

3333
02:37:14,368 --> 02:37:17,952
For the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own government

3334
02:37:18,464 --> 02:37:20,512
Are the rights and Liberties of small Nations

3335
02:37:20,768 --> 02:37:22,816
Universal Dominion of right

3336
02:37:23,072 --> 02:37:27,680
Why such a concert of free peoples I shall bring peace and safety to All Nations

3337
02:37:27,936 --> 02:37:30,240
And make the world itself at last free

3338
02:37:30,752 --> 02:37:36,896
Just such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes everything that we are and everything that we have

3339
02:37:37,408 --> 02:37:41,504
With the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged

3340
02:37:42,016 --> 02:37:46,112
To spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth

3341
02:37:46,368 --> 02:37:48,928
And happiness and the peace which she is treasured

3342
02:37:49,184 --> 02:37:50,976
God helping her she can do no other

3343
02:37:51,744 --> 02:37:52,256
And quote

3344
02:37:53,536 --> 02:37:55,840
One wonders what John Quincy Adams

3345
02:37:56,608 --> 02:37:57,888
Would reply to that

3346
02:37:58,656 --> 02:37:59,424
Nonetheless

3347
02:37:59,936 --> 02:38:02,752
Guys like Theodore Roosevelt who been saying he was going to

3348
02:38:03,008 --> 02:38:06,592
Skin Wilson alive if Wilson didn't go to war

3349
02:38:06,848 --> 02:38:07,872
Like the speech a lot

3350
02:38:10,176 --> 02:38:11,456
It's interesting to note by the way

3351
02:38:12,480 --> 02:38:16,320
That the one American political figure that the Europeans

3352
02:38:16,832 --> 02:38:19,648
Really respect in this whole question is Theodore Roosevelt

3353
02:38:20,160 --> 02:38:23,744
Because Theodore Roosevelt is really one of the early what will be called Atlantis

3354
02:38:24,768 --> 02:38:25,280
People who believe

3355
02:38:25,536 --> 02:38:29,632
For example in locking arms with country like Great Britain in and doing great things with them

3356
02:38:29,888 --> 02:38:31,680
TR was an interventionist

3357
02:38:32,192 --> 02:38:32,960
Before his time

3358
02:38:33,216 --> 02:38:39,360
And in the United States he's thought of as an extremist the Republican candidate for

3359
02:38:39,616 --> 02:38:45,760
Tell him to stop campaigning for him because he's so bellicose it's working against the Republican Party write your

3360
02:38:46,016 --> 02:38:48,576
Letting Wilson in the opposition for traces warmongers

3361
02:38:49,344 --> 02:38:51,904
That's the guy though that appeared to be ahead of

3362
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:54,720
The curve when it came to figuring out

3363
02:38:54,976 --> 02:38:56,512
The Germany needed to be dealt with

3364
02:38:57,024 --> 02:38:58,560
Again from the British point of view

3365
02:38:58,816 --> 02:39:02,144
There's a lot of this that you can look at and say the very things the Germans are being

3366
02:39:02,400 --> 02:39:03,936
In Slam for doing

3367
02:39:04,192 --> 02:39:08,288
Are things that they were kind of forced into doing by what their opponents were up

3368
02:39:08,544 --> 02:39:09,056
Up to

3369
02:39:09,824 --> 02:39:11,104
The first world war is not the

3370
02:39:11,360 --> 02:39:13,152
The clear-cut Good and Evil

3371
02:39:13,408 --> 02:39:15,200
Separation at the Second World War

3372
02:39:16,224 --> 02:39:16,992
He mentioned that

3373
02:39:17,248 --> 02:39:17,760
4

3374
02:39:18,016 --> 02:39:21,344
Nonetheless if you're on one side of it it certainly is

3375
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:26,464
The Prime Minister of Great Britain for about a couple of months when Wilson makes his

3376
02:39:26,976 --> 02:39:28,512
Historic speeches Lloyd George

3377
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:33,632
In his Memoirs Lloyd George writing after the war can't help

3378
02:39:33,888 --> 02:39:35,168
Take a shot

3379
02:39:35,424 --> 02:39:36,192
At Wilson

3380
02:39:36,704 --> 02:39:39,776
Not because of what he did but because of how long it took him

3381
02:39:41,056 --> 02:39:42,336
Speaking about Wilson speech now

3382
02:39:43,104 --> 02:39:44,128
George writes quote

3383
02:39:45,152 --> 02:39:48,480
These principles were excellent and excellently expressed

3384
02:39:48,736 --> 02:39:51,808
DIY democracies of France in the British Commonwealth

3385
02:39:52,064 --> 02:39:56,160
Penn already borne the burden they've been scorched by the heat of a thousand days

3386
02:39:56,416 --> 02:39:58,976
In the battle with this natural photo to Liberty

3387
02:39:59,744 --> 02:40:00,512
Stealing water wheel

3388
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:01,792
Blind from his

3389
02:40:02,048 --> 02:40:04,352
Speech they rejoiced George does

3390
02:40:04,608 --> 02:40:10,240
At the Advent of this powerful help from the greatest democracy in the world at a time when troubles were multiplying

3391
02:40:10,752 --> 02:40:16,896
They perhaps might be excused for thinking that issues so clear now to President Wilson ought to have been apparent early

3392
02:40:17,152 --> 02:40:17,920
Clear to his eyes

3393
02:40:18,176 --> 02:40:20,480
They felt grateful in their hearts to the Great America

3394
02:40:20,736 --> 02:40:22,016
Theodore Roosevelt

3395
02:40:22,272 --> 02:40:24,064
Whose Vision was so undimmed

3396
02:40:24,320 --> 02:40:28,672
And whose sympathies were so sure from the outset of this Grim struggle for international right

3397
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:29,952
And quote

3398
02:40:30,976 --> 02:40:33,280
Winston Churchill sounded almost the exact

3399
02:40:33,792 --> 02:40:35,328
Same way what took you so long

3400
02:40:36,096 --> 02:40:37,120
Speaking of Wilson

3401
02:40:37,632 --> 02:40:38,144
Peace out

3402
02:40:39,168 --> 02:40:39,680
Quote

3403
02:40:39,936 --> 02:40:44,288
He had behind his policy a reasoned explanation and massive

3404
02:40:44,544 --> 02:40:50,688
And all must respect the motives of a Statesman who seeks to spare his country the waste in horrors of War

3405
02:40:50,944 --> 02:40:52,480
But nothing Churchill rights

3406
02:40:52,736 --> 02:40:56,064
Can reconcile what he said after March 1917

3407
02:40:56,320 --> 02:40:58,112
With the guidance he had given before

3408
02:40:58,368 --> 02:41:02,464
What he did in April 1917 could have been done in May 1950

3409
02:41:02,976 --> 02:41:04,000
And if done then

3410
02:41:04,256 --> 02:41:05,792
What abridgment of the slaughter

3411
02:41:06,048 --> 02:41:10,144
What's pairing of the agony what ruined what catastrophes would have been prevented

3412
02:41:10,656 --> 02:41:14,496
And how many million homes would an empty chair be occupied today

3413
02:41:14,752 --> 02:41:19,360
How different would be the shattered World in which Victors and vanquished alike are condemned to live

3414
02:41:20,128 --> 02:41:20,640
And quote

3415
02:41:21,408 --> 02:41:23,456
Writing from the late 1920

3416
02:41:23,712 --> 02:41:24,480
And seeing

3417
02:41:24,736 --> 02:41:28,064
The mortally wounded and terribly scarred

3418
02:41:28,576 --> 02:41:29,344
Continent

3419
02:41:29,856 --> 02:41:33,952
Which Winston Churchill remembers as being the height of World Civilization

3420
02:41:34,464 --> 02:41:37,792
To him the US taking this long to get into the war

3421
02:41:38,304 --> 02:41:39,328
Looks like something that

3422
02:41:39,584 --> 02:41:41,376
Cost you the world you knew

3423
02:41:45,216 --> 02:41:46,752
A couple days after the president

3424
02:41:47,008 --> 02:41:48,032
Gives his famous speech

3425
02:41:48,800 --> 02:41:50,592
The Congress vote to support him

3426
02:41:50,848 --> 02:41:52,384
And take the nation to war

3427
02:41:52,896 --> 02:41:56,992
Don't wasn't close by the way in the House of Representatives it was something like 374

3428
02:41:57,248 --> 02:41:58,272
375 2

3429
02:41:58,528 --> 02:41:59,040
50

3430
02:41:59,808 --> 02:42:01,856
And as much as a Wipeout is that sounds

3431
02:42:02,368 --> 02:42:03,392
I read somewhere that that's the

3432
02:42:03,648 --> 02:42:09,280
The second most opposition the Congress has ever shown the president in a war vote the War of 1812 being the

3433
02:42:09,792 --> 02:42:10,304
The most

3434
02:42:11,584 --> 02:42:12,096
Nonetheless

3435
02:42:12,352 --> 02:42:15,680
Seems pretty clear that most of those people voting

3436
02:42:15,936 --> 02:42:16,960
Punisher about

3437
02:42:17,216 --> 02:42:19,776
What voting for going to war was going to mean

3438
02:42:20,288 --> 02:42:22,336
The future mayor of New York.

3439
02:42:22,592 --> 02:42:23,104
LaGuardia was

3440
02:42:23,616 --> 02:42:24,640
Congressman win this vote

3441
02:42:25,664 --> 02:42:31,808
He said that 60% is a 30 years after the war that 60% of his Brethren were pretty sure this wasn't going to mean troops

3442
02:42:33,344 --> 02:42:35,648
The Westin send armies overseas

3443
02:42:35,904 --> 02:42:40,768
The fight in on Europeans way they thought it was going to be like financial aid and Naval help

3444
02:42:43,072 --> 02:42:45,632
Mabel help is the one thing that us can do right away

3445
02:42:45,888 --> 02:42:47,680
Military help in an army

3446
02:42:47,936 --> 02:42:48,448
That's a problem

3447
02:42:48,704 --> 02:42:49,728
Because the US really doesn't

3448
02:42:52,032 --> 02:42:54,080
In April 1917 the US Army's rank

3449
02:42:54,336 --> 02:42:55,104
17

3450
02:42:55,360 --> 02:42:55,872
Largest

3451
02:42:56,128 --> 02:42:56,640
In the world

3452
02:42:58,944 --> 02:43:03,552
Doesn't have any flamethrowers or any tanks or any gas masks or mortars

3453
02:43:04,576 --> 02:43:05,600
No grenades

3454
02:43:06,624 --> 02:43:09,440
Aircraft are these rickety strange

3455
02:43:09,696 --> 02:43:10,208
Beast

3456
02:43:10,464 --> 02:43:11,232
The dino

3457
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:15,328
The right look like the planes the Wright brothers kind of

3458
02:43:15,840 --> 02:43:17,888
Put together they don't look modern at all

3459
02:43:19,168 --> 02:43:20,448
There's not enough artillery

3460
02:43:20,960 --> 02:43:24,288
Shells for the guns to shoot more than a few minutes by Western Front

3461
02:43:24,800 --> 02:43:25,568
In a standard

3462
02:43:27,360 --> 02:43:27,872
Astoria

3463
02:43:28,384 --> 02:43:29,664
Justice don'key says

3464
02:43:30,176 --> 02:43:33,760
That the US relatively speaking have been better prepared

3465
02:43:34,016 --> 02:43:37,088
For the American Revolution in the War of 1812

3466
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:38,112
Then they were

3467
02:43:38,368 --> 02:43:39,136
Pairing for the first word

3468
02:43:39,392 --> 02:43:39,904
World War

3469
02:43:40,672 --> 02:43:44,000
I disagree with him about that but his point is well taken

3470
02:43:44,256 --> 02:43:46,816
The United States if it's going to be any help to Europe

3471
02:43:47,072 --> 02:43:52,192
You're just going to have to survive while it waits for this help to be accumulated the only place the US

3472
02:43:52,448 --> 02:43:58,080
Can help right away as with money which they were kind of doing already going to lower interest rates and give better deals but

3473
02:43:58,336 --> 02:44:00,384
It's a continuation of what was already happening

3474
02:44:00,640 --> 02:44:01,920
And the use of the Navy

3475
02:44:02,432 --> 02:44:04,224
The thing the Navy can do right away

3476
02:44:04,992 --> 02:44:11,136
Is help against the submarines cuz we said in April 1917 the submarines take more than 400

3477
02:44:11,648 --> 02:44:12,416
Merchant ships

3478
02:44:13,696 --> 02:44:19,840
Britain's problem isn't it doesn't have to stop all the sinking have to stop the rate which is so much more than what it can reveal

3479
02:44:20,352 --> 02:44:25,728
If it loses less ships and it can build a month it's doing well if it loses more ships than they can build a month it's in trouble

3480
02:44:27,008 --> 02:44:28,544
Height of the submarine war will be

3481
02:44:28,800 --> 02:44:31,872
February 1917 when unrestricted Warfare is declared

3482
02:44:32,128 --> 02:44:32,640
And the next date

3483
02:44:33,664 --> 02:44:34,688
This is when Britain

3484
02:44:34,944 --> 02:44:35,712
Lives or dies

3485
02:44:35,968 --> 02:44:42,112
I thought of the steaks and Lloyd George and Churchill them all these guys go out of their way to talk about the almost a lot

3486
02:44:42,368 --> 02:44:44,672
Farm is the word Lloyd George Lloyd George says

3487
02:44:44,928 --> 02:44:45,952
But there are some of the most

3488
02:44:46,208 --> 02:44:51,840
Cautious people in his cabinet that are starting to Muse out loud about maybe we better make peace while we still have some ships afloat

3489
02:44:54,144 --> 02:44:55,936
He says the Germans were getting gleeful

3490
02:44:56,448 --> 02:45:02,592
But at times they just had these reports coming and it made all the pro submarine people seem to be perfectly

3491
02:45:02,848 --> 02:45:08,992
They were all of a sudden going to win the war Churchill said we went from being you know the side that had time on our side

3492
02:45:09,248 --> 02:45:15,392
Why do we can just wait this out and everyday the Germans were losing the war little bit more to having the tables flipping out I'm was on the German side

3493
02:45:15,648 --> 02:45:17,696
And the British had to come up with countermeasures

3494
02:45:17,952 --> 02:45:19,744
Or lose the war fast

3495
02:45:20,768 --> 02:45:21,536
They not only did

3496
02:45:22,304 --> 02:45:24,096
But it was the civilian leadership

3497
02:45:24,352 --> 02:45:26,400
The pushed for the answer that turned out to make the biggest

3498
02:45:27,936 --> 02:45:30,752
This is sort of one of these early indications of something is changing

3499
02:45:32,032 --> 02:45:36,384
For years the military men have had almost unquestioned Authority

3500
02:45:36,896 --> 02:45:40,480
To choose whatever path for Fighting the War they wanted to know matter what happened

3501
02:45:40,992 --> 02:45:41,504
But now

3502
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:45,856
How many people have died in so many disasters in so much of the same tactic seeming to

3503
02:45:46,112 --> 02:45:52,256
You know equal the same results except more body stacking higher and higher that there was push back now from civilian leaders

3504
02:45:52,512 --> 02:45:54,560
Lloyd George and Britain is one of these guys who

3505
02:45:54,816 --> 02:45:57,632
Who says openly that my job is to protect the soldier in the field

3506
02:45:58,144 --> 02:46:01,216
And to the soldier in the field of General his biggest enemy sometime

3507
02:46:01,728 --> 02:46:07,871
And you could hear all this talk about the stupidity of the military leaders even Churchill kind of goes out of his way to say that the

3508
02:46:08,127 --> 02:46:09,663
Military experts were all against

3509
02:46:09,919 --> 02:46:11,967
The solution that ended up solving the subproblem

3510
02:46:12,479 --> 02:46:16,831
It was a civilian leaders for the most part that pushed the idea that one the day

3511
02:46:17,343 --> 02:46:19,647
The idea was both breathtakingly simple

3512
02:46:19,903 --> 02:46:21,439
And Incredibly complex

3513
02:46:22,207 --> 02:46:23,231
The idea was Convoy

3514
02:46:25,279 --> 02:46:27,583
The grouping of ships into large

3515
02:46:28,607 --> 02:46:29,375
Formation

3516
02:46:29,887 --> 02:46:35,263
Surrounding them with warships and escorts and sending these large bodies of ships across

3517
02:46:35,775 --> 02:46:37,823
Organize times and schedules

3518
02:46:39,359 --> 02:46:42,687
The military man off and believe that this was just going to group your targets

3519
02:46:42,943 --> 02:46:43,455
For the submarine

3520
02:46:43,967 --> 02:46:47,295
Make it even easier to line ships up like in the shooting gallery

3521
02:46:47,807 --> 02:46:52,671
When it was experimented on again the civilian leaders pushing to experiment with this

3522
02:46:52,927 --> 02:46:54,463
The results were fantastic

3523
02:46:54,719 --> 02:46:55,743
Almost right away

3524
02:46:57,791 --> 02:47:00,863
But you about that approach these kinds of formations often got sunk

3525
02:47:01,375 --> 02:47:03,423
The idea that it was going to be easier to spot

3526
02:47:03,679 --> 02:47:09,823
Fifty or sixty ships on the water rather than a single ship turned out to not be true in the in the vast spaces of the Ocean Beach

3527
02:47:10,079 --> 02:47:11,103
Eagle convoys got

3528
02:47:11,359 --> 02:47:13,151
Swallowed up to and is Churchill said

3529
02:47:13,407 --> 02:47:19,551
When these convoys made it across the water and slipped through the blockade instead of having one ship make it through the German blockade you had 40

3530
02:47:19,807 --> 02:47:20,831
5460 ships do

3531
02:47:23,135 --> 02:47:27,999
By October 1917 of 99 convoys heading to Great Britain

3532
02:47:28,255 --> 02:47:30,815
With more than 1500 ships in them

3533
02:47:31,327 --> 02:47:32,095
Only 10

3534
02:47:32,863 --> 02:47:34,655
We're still part of the Convoy we're song

3535
02:47:35,935 --> 02:47:36,703
14 more

3536
02:47:36,959 --> 02:47:37,983
It's training.

3537
02:47:38,239 --> 02:47:38,751
Lottery

3538
02:47:39,775 --> 02:47:40,799
Those are

3539
02:47:41,311 --> 02:47:43,103
Easily replaceable losses

3540
02:47:43,615 --> 02:47:46,175
And by October 1917 it was clear

3541
02:47:46,687 --> 02:47:48,479
The Germans were no longer going to be able

3542
02:47:48,735 --> 02:47:49,247
The sink

3543
02:47:49,503 --> 02:47:50,527
More shipping

3544
02:47:50,783 --> 02:47:51,551
The new British

3545
02:47:51,807 --> 02:47:52,319
Could replace

3546
02:47:52,575 --> 02:47:53,087
What's more

3547
02:47:53,343 --> 02:47:54,623
They now have us ship

3548
02:47:54,879 --> 02:47:55,903
We aren't helping to replace the

3549
02:47:58,463 --> 02:47:59,487
As you might imagine

3550
02:47:59,743 --> 02:48:00,767
The whole decision on

3551
02:48:01,023 --> 02:48:01,535
Germany

3552
02:48:02,559 --> 02:48:03,327
To engage in this

3553
02:48:03,583 --> 02:48:04,095
Can a submarine

3554
02:48:04,351 --> 02:48:07,679
Walker is one of the most if not the most criticized

3555
02:48:07,935 --> 02:48:08,703
Decision

3556
02:48:08,959 --> 02:48:09,727
The German leadership ever

3557
02:48:12,031 --> 02:48:12,799
Understandable

3558
02:48:13,055 --> 02:48:15,103
You know what kind of once again puts the lie to

3559
02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:16,127
The stereotype

3560
02:48:16,383 --> 02:48:17,663
Have the Germans as sort of a

3561
02:48:17,919 --> 02:48:20,223
Applauding methodical sort of

3562
02:48:21,503 --> 02:48:23,551
Conservative sort of leadership style

3563
02:48:24,063 --> 02:48:25,343
Because in both world wars

3564
02:48:25,599 --> 02:48:27,135
The Germans would prove to be great

3565
02:48:27,391 --> 02:48:27,903
Creek Camp

3566
02:48:28,927 --> 02:48:29,695
They just weren't lucky

3567
02:48:30,975 --> 02:48:34,815
But they were willing many times or so to throw caution to the wind and try these things

3568
02:48:35,071 --> 02:48:38,911
Innocence though it's a defense mechanism when you are the weaker party

3569
02:48:40,191 --> 02:48:43,519
Mean to me the analogy that works best in that in the war

3570
02:48:44,031 --> 02:48:46,335
That that we have going right now is to weight-lift

3571
02:48:46,847 --> 02:48:51,199
Are competing against each other and one of these weightlifters is bigger and stronger than the other

3572
02:48:51,455 --> 02:48:54,015
One which is obviously a huge advantage in weight lifting

3573
02:48:54,527 --> 02:48:55,551
But it isn't everything

3574
02:48:56,831 --> 02:48:58,367
And the weaker weightlifter has to

3575
02:48:58,623 --> 02:48:59,135
Try

3576
02:48:59,647 --> 02:49:01,439
You need to make up for it with technique

3577
02:49:01,695 --> 02:49:02,463
And training

3578
02:49:02,719 --> 02:49:03,743
And will to win

3579
02:49:05,279 --> 02:49:05,791
And maybe

3580
02:49:06,303 --> 02:49:06,815
Give me some chances

3581
02:49:07,839 --> 02:49:09,119
That's Germany strategy for the

3582
02:49:09,631 --> 02:49:10,143
This war

3583
02:49:10,399 --> 02:49:12,959
And you know you're seeing so many aspects

3584
02:49:13,215 --> 02:49:13,983
I've changed

3585
02:49:14,495 --> 02:49:16,799
From the 19th century to the 20th century that you

3586
02:49:17,055 --> 02:49:19,615
Can point you in the story because that's really the theme when you look at

3587
02:49:20,639 --> 02:49:21,663
You in a big picture

3588
02:49:22,687 --> 02:49:23,967
Germany has transformed

3589
02:49:24,223 --> 02:49:24,991
In the recent

3590
02:49:25,247 --> 02:49:27,295
1916 the year before this time we're in now

3591
02:49:27,551 --> 02:49:29,087
I'm really in a old style

3592
02:49:29,343 --> 02:49:35,487
Monarchy with legislative in a balancing out to something that looks much more like a 20th century military dick

3593
02:49:36,511 --> 02:49:40,095
That doesn't happen overnight and it almost kind of happens because it needs to

3594
02:49:40,351 --> 02:49:43,423
The only way Germany has a chance in this war is to be

3595
02:49:44,191 --> 02:49:44,959
The technique man

3596
02:49:45,471 --> 02:49:48,799
And have the greater will to win all those things I said about the smaller weightlifter

3597
02:49:49,055 --> 02:49:50,591
Germany has to organize it

3598
02:49:50,847 --> 02:49:51,359
It's Society

3599
02:49:51,615 --> 02:49:52,127
More efficiently

3600
02:49:52,639 --> 02:49:53,407
Then the more powerful

3601
02:49:53,663 --> 02:49:54,175
Allied temp

3602
02:49:54,687 --> 02:49:56,735
If it's going to stand a chance in one of the things that happens is

3603
02:49:56,991 --> 02:50:00,575
When you get Hindenburg and ludendorff in there remember the 2 German Commanders

3604
02:50:00,831 --> 02:50:01,343
We talked about

3605
02:50:01,599 --> 02:50:02,879
This military team but

3606
02:50:03,135 --> 02:50:03,903
It's really only one day

3607
02:50:04,415 --> 02:50:04,927
Ludendorff

3608
02:50:05,951 --> 02:50:10,047
He takes on more and more the powers that in the twentieth century we see over and over again

3609
02:50:10,303 --> 02:50:16,447
In regions where you have one strong man who started his dictatorial control in the German start to try to organize their society

3610
02:50:16,703 --> 02:50:17,727
To make it more efficient

3611
02:50:17,983 --> 02:50:18,495
Like

3612
02:50:18,751 --> 02:50:21,055
You're being able to tell workers where they're going to work

3613
02:50:21,567 --> 02:50:23,871
In a controlling people down to that level because

3614
02:50:24,127 --> 02:50:24,895
As one

3615
02:50:25,151 --> 02:50:26,175
The German leader said

3616
02:50:26,431 --> 02:50:30,015
The goal is to turn Germany into one vast Munitions fact

3617
02:50:31,039 --> 02:50:33,343
To do that requires a sort of single-minded

3618
02:50:33,599 --> 02:50:35,903
Fitness and in a lot of power concentrated in one person

3619
02:50:36,671 --> 02:50:38,463
At this stage in the war that person is ludent

3620
02:50:38,975 --> 02:50:41,023
Hindenburg took over 1916

3621
02:50:41,279 --> 02:50:43,583
And the first thing they did was sort of doing an audit

3622
02:50:43,839 --> 02:50:46,911
Of how the war is going and what we're doing to fight it in the condition

3623
02:50:47,423 --> 02:50:50,751
And the first condition you notice when you take over the entire War

3624
02:50:51,007 --> 02:50:52,287
Is on the Western Front

3625
02:50:52,799 --> 02:50:55,359
You have about two and a half million men

3626
02:50:55,615 --> 02:50:56,895
Manning the barricades

3627
02:50:57,151 --> 02:50:58,431
The other side has a mouth

3628
02:50:58,687 --> 02:50:59,455
4 million man

3629
02:50:59,711 --> 02:51:02,271
And their numbers are increasing every month how do those trends

3630
02:51:03,807 --> 02:51:05,087
You have food riot

3631
02:51:05,343 --> 02:51:06,623
It's at home women

3632
02:51:06,879 --> 02:51:08,927
Fighting with police officers in the streets

3633
02:51:09,183 --> 02:51:11,231
Because they can't get the food they need you have

3634
02:51:11,999 --> 02:51:18,143
Strikes in a bunch of the major firms in a bunch of the cities and they get so bad sometimes the Army has to be called in

3635
02:51:18,655 --> 02:51:19,935
To disperse the strikers

3636
02:51:20,703 --> 02:51:26,847
So the government is now going in and sending strike leaders to the front to get him out of the way mean the society is under

3637
02:51:27,103 --> 02:51:28,895
Severe stress and we already talked about the food

3638
02:51:29,407 --> 02:51:30,175
I mean there's a quote

3639
02:51:30,687 --> 02:51:31,967
From Ice glaciers

3640
02:51:32,479 --> 02:51:34,015
Sums it up when he talks about this

3641
02:51:34,271 --> 02:51:35,807
Is Pure Eatery now he quit he says quote

3642
02:51:36,319 --> 02:51:41,439
Soon alluded ham thrilled us more than the fall of Bucharest or some apparent success elsewhere

3643
02:51:42,463 --> 02:51:42,975
And quote

3644
02:51:43,999 --> 02:51:47,327
These people's knees are shrunk down to the most basic human survival level

3645
02:51:48,095 --> 02:51:52,447
Yeah great we took Bucharest but did you see that ham we have in the cellar that we found I mean you know

3646
02:51:53,727 --> 02:51:55,007
Something any of us could understand

3647
02:51:55,775 --> 02:51:56,287
The star

3648
02:51:57,311 --> 02:51:59,359
The pressure is on Germany's military leaders

3649
02:51:59,615 --> 02:52:05,759
Get to do something you can't very well launch an offensive on the Western Front when you're outnumbered the way you are you going to be lucky to survive at all

3650
02:52:06,015 --> 02:52:08,575
1916 was terrible for the Germans on the Western Front

3651
02:52:08,831 --> 02:52:10,111
So you launch the submarines

3652
02:52:10,623 --> 02:52:11,391
That becomes

3653
02:52:11,647 --> 02:52:13,951
Your chance to win the war without having to

3654
02:52:14,207 --> 02:52:14,975
Do the Imposter

3655
02:52:15,231 --> 02:52:15,999
On the Western Front

3656
02:52:17,791 --> 02:52:18,815
Now ludendorff

3657
02:52:19,327 --> 02:52:20,351
Is a very strange

3658
02:52:21,631 --> 02:52:24,191
Is Commander Germany you'll sort of in more everyday

3659
02:52:24,447 --> 02:52:24,959
In the story

3660
02:52:25,215 --> 02:52:27,519
Hindenburg is partner with the Charisma guy

3661
02:52:27,775 --> 02:52:31,359
He's a old man he really if he have been great at one time in his life

3662
02:52:31,615 --> 02:52:32,895
He's in his dotage now

3663
02:52:33,151 --> 02:52:37,503
He's he's the revered public-facing is governed by ludendorff the guy behind the scenes

3664
02:52:38,015 --> 02:52:43,391
And we talked about him and he's the one who way back in 1914 got that City in Belgium

3665
02:52:43,903 --> 02:52:47,999
To surrender by banging on the front doors with the hilt of his sword

3666
02:52:48,255 --> 02:52:51,327
You know when he easily could have been killed walk right up to the front door

3667
02:52:51,583 --> 02:52:54,143
Loan guide I mean that he's an interesting guy

3668
02:52:54,655 --> 02:52:56,191
He's flawed in a lot of ways and

3669
02:52:56,447 --> 02:52:58,751
Depending on what your story and you grab you're going to hear that

3670
02:52:59,007 --> 02:53:05,151
The bumbling psychologically fragile ludendorff or you're going to see this this great Gambler who

3671
02:53:05,407 --> 02:53:10,015
Who was who was fantastic at certain things and remember all these generals are 19th century man

3672
02:53:10,783 --> 02:53:12,575
They're adapting Under Fire

3673
02:53:12,831 --> 02:53:15,391
At a quick Pace to all these new conditions

3674
02:53:15,903 --> 02:53:17,439
And just when you think they're getting it

3675
02:53:17,695 --> 02:53:18,463
Some new develop

3676
02:53:18,719 --> 02:53:24,095
And comes around maybe you're starting to understand the physics of land Warfare a year or two into the first world war of your general

3677
02:53:24,351 --> 02:53:29,727
And then tanks appear and then gas appears every what do you do with all this airplane start having a real impact

3678
02:53:29,983 --> 02:53:34,847
You don't just have to learn you have to be flexible to continue to evolve as these generals

3679
02:53:35,359 --> 02:53:36,383
Nobody's greater

3680
02:53:37,151 --> 02:53:38,175
Endorse not bad

3681
02:53:40,223 --> 02:53:41,247
Ludendorff changes

3682
02:53:41,759 --> 02:53:42,527
The basic strategy

3683
02:53:42,783 --> 02:53:43,295
The guy

3684
02:53:43,807 --> 02:53:44,575
Who came before

3685
02:53:44,831 --> 02:53:46,367
Von falkenhayn strategy was

3686
02:53:46,623 --> 02:53:48,927
Basically defend every inch of territory

3687
02:53:49,183 --> 02:53:52,767
Ludendorff is perfectly willing to give up territory in exchange for killing

3688
02:53:54,559 --> 02:53:57,119
He'll pull off things like operation Albury

3689
02:53:57,375 --> 02:54:00,447
Right about this time period start in late February 1917

3690
02:54:00,703 --> 02:54:01,215
Or he will

3691
02:54:01,471 --> 02:54:02,239
Holdback

3692
02:54:02,751 --> 02:54:04,287
Troops that are that are in an egg

3693
02:54:04,543 --> 02:54:10,687
Bose Lupin the line the line is a straight because of fighting here in there it's bulging out in some places lyrics

3694
02:54:10,943 --> 02:54:11,455
Kingston

3695
02:54:11,711 --> 02:54:15,039
And he begins in early 1917 to pull troops back there

3696
02:54:15,295 --> 02:54:20,415
Their way out there in no man's land and straighten up his line he'll cut off like 25 miles

3697
02:54:20,671 --> 02:54:21,951
From the Western Front by doing this

3698
02:54:22,975 --> 02:54:26,559
Freeing up 13 or 14 division is basically a German army

3699
02:54:27,327 --> 02:54:28,095
To be used elsewhere

3700
02:54:29,375 --> 02:54:30,911
Not too complicated maneuver

3701
02:54:31,423 --> 02:54:35,007
But his strategy in 1917 as far as he's concerned is going to be defense

3702
02:54:35,775 --> 02:54:40,383
So he's going to line things up and prepare for that and it gives him all kinds of advantage of this

3703
02:54:40,639 --> 02:54:41,407
Is one area

3704
02:54:42,175 --> 02:54:43,711
It'll be called the Hindenburg line

3705
02:54:43,967 --> 02:54:44,735
He puts together

3706
02:54:45,759 --> 02:54:51,647
It is hard to imagine making the defenses of 1916 deeper and stronger and more

3707
02:54:52,159 --> 02:54:54,463
Impenetrable but that's what they do in 90

3708
02:54:54,719 --> 02:54:57,535
June 17th the Hindenburg line is an example of

3709
02:54:57,791 --> 02:54:59,583
Who endorsed idea of Defense in depth

3710
02:54:59,839 --> 02:55:02,655
And what that means is it the German defenses go back

3711
02:55:02,911 --> 02:55:03,423
Jack Ma

3712
02:55:04,703 --> 02:55:08,543
And they're designed to act like a rubber band so that when something runs into them

3713
02:55:08,799 --> 02:55:13,407
He just stretches and stretches and stretches in the farther it stretches the more resistance you find

3714
02:55:13,663 --> 02:55:15,199
And then eventually just snaps back

3715
02:55:16,991 --> 02:55:17,503
Devious

3716
02:55:18,015 --> 02:55:24,159
The way it's designed and I don't need to get into all the details it's the machine guns on the barbed wire and the pill boxes and all these things but they

3717
02:55:24,415 --> 02:55:28,767
Just go far back into the distance and there's no more trenches anywhere near the front line

3718
02:55:29,023 --> 02:55:35,167
Because those are too easy to pick out and and she'll everybody just sort of sits in holes in the ground in a sort of a random Pat

3719
02:55:35,423 --> 02:55:36,447
There's no lie

3720
02:55:37,727 --> 02:55:40,287
In fact there's hardly any Germans when you first get to it

3721
02:55:40,543 --> 02:55:46,687
It's just a few Germans holding you up and taking casualties and then as soon as they can't keep you at Bay anymore they were three facts

3722
02:55:46,943 --> 02:55:48,735
The next line and then to the next line

3723
02:55:48,991 --> 02:55:54,367
And every step of the way the defenses are a little bit stronger and the Germans are a little bit more numerous

3724
02:55:54,623 --> 02:55:57,439
As the British or the French were attacking them are getting less

3725
02:55:57,695 --> 02:55:58,719
And less numerous

3726
02:55:58,975 --> 02:56:01,535
And then is there getting more tired of me I thought to myself

3727
02:56:01,791 --> 02:56:02,303
Some of these

3728
02:56:02,559 --> 02:56:06,655
Defenses go back 9:10 Mi it would kill me without any resistance

3729
02:56:07,167 --> 02:56:08,191
Imagine trying to do it

3730
02:56:08,959 --> 02:56:09,983
With machine guns

3731
02:56:10,239 --> 02:56:11,263
And rifle fire at

3732
02:56:12,031 --> 02:56:12,799
Grenades

3733
02:56:13,055 --> 02:56:14,079
Artillery I may just

3734
02:56:15,103 --> 02:56:16,383
You just can't imagine

3735
02:56:16,639 --> 02:56:22,783
Having much left if you even get the nine or ten miles to the end of the defenses and then waiting for you there

3736
02:56:23,551 --> 02:56:24,319
Are German army

3737
02:56:25,343 --> 02:56:28,159
We're going to counter attack anything that the last

3738
02:56:28,415 --> 02:56:30,463
That makes it all the way through these defenses

3739
02:56:31,231 --> 02:56:37,375
It is absolutely almost impenetrable and devious if you only have 2 and 1/2 2.8 million men

3740
02:56:37,887 --> 02:56:40,959
To fight four or four and a half million men on the other side

3741
02:56:41,215 --> 02:56:43,519
This is a good way to equalize the odd

3742
02:56:43,775 --> 02:56:46,847
This is a weightlifter who figured out a way to lift more

3743
02:56:47,103 --> 02:56:47,615
Denny's

3744
02:56:47,871 --> 02:56:48,639
Bigger opponent

3745
02:56:49,663 --> 02:56:50,175
My favorite

3746
02:56:50,431 --> 02:56:51,199
Part of the Hindenburg

3747
02:56:51,455 --> 02:56:51,967
Red line defense

3748
02:56:52,223 --> 02:56:53,247
Military history

3749
02:56:54,271 --> 02:56:56,831
Is that they build a giant

3750
02:56:57,087 --> 02:56:57,599
Moat

3751
02:56:58,111 --> 02:56:59,903
In front of it I mean there's no other way to

3752
02:57:00,159 --> 02:57:02,975
Pray that it's an absolutely perpendicular walls

3753
02:57:03,231 --> 02:57:03,743
Trench

3754
02:57:04,255 --> 02:57:06,815
That is between 9 and 10 ft deep

3755
02:57:07,583 --> 02:57:08,863
And 12 feet across

3756
02:57:09,631 --> 02:57:11,167
It's meant to stop every

3757
02:57:11,423 --> 02:57:15,775
Define tanks especially Amino fall into the air and won't be able to climb up the perpendicular side

3758
02:57:16,031 --> 02:57:17,311
But it's not an easy job

3759
02:57:17,823 --> 02:57:19,871
4 troops either end behind this

3760
02:57:20,127 --> 02:57:20,895
Giant

3761
02:57:21,407 --> 02:57:27,295
Mold as you might imagine our machine gun positions and all kinds of defenses and more wire and all these sorts of things

3762
02:57:27,807 --> 02:57:30,623
It is crazy to think about having to attack something like

3763
02:57:31,391 --> 02:57:34,207
And what's more when ludendorff has

3764
02:57:34,463 --> 02:57:34,975
People

3765
02:57:35,231 --> 02:57:35,743
Retreat

3766
02:57:35,999 --> 02:57:38,815
SWTOR the Hindenburg line and give up these positions

3767
02:57:39,071 --> 02:57:39,839
The hundreds

3768
02:57:40,095 --> 02:57:41,887
Thousands of Germans who died

3769
02:57:42,143 --> 02:57:44,191
Contesting over the last couple of years

3770
02:57:44,703 --> 02:57:46,495
He has soldiers destroyed

3771
02:57:46,751 --> 02:57:47,263
Everything

3772
02:57:48,031 --> 02:57:49,055
You know as they go

3773
02:57:49,567 --> 02:57:52,639
Creating a dead zone from the old front line to the new one

3774
02:57:53,663 --> 02:57:54,431
Scorched-earth policy

3775
02:57:54,943 --> 02:57:56,735
Something which by the way upset

3776
02:57:56,991 --> 02:57:58,271
Crown Prince Rupert

3777
02:57:58,527 --> 02:58:01,855
Who was the field-marshal commanding some of the troops you had to do this destruction

3778
02:58:02,111 --> 02:58:04,159
He was so upset he almost resigned over it

3779
02:58:04,415 --> 02:58:10,559
And complained about it how this was Germany's reputation and in that discussion you basically ca19

3780
02:58:10,815 --> 02:58:14,143
18th century a figure with 19 century standard Crown Prince Rupert

3781
02:58:14,399 --> 02:58:15,423
Break the member of the Bavarian

3782
02:58:15,935 --> 02:58:17,215
Royalty and

3783
02:58:17,727 --> 02:58:19,007
Ludendorff a thoroughly

3784
02:58:19,263 --> 02:58:21,311
20th century Total War kind of guy

3785
02:58:21,823 --> 02:58:23,103
It's a clash of cultures

3786
02:58:23,359 --> 02:58:26,175
The 20th century 1 ludendorff got his way

3787
02:58:26,431 --> 02:58:28,991
And the troops of the German Army in a very old

3788
02:58:29,247 --> 02:58:30,527
School style

3789
02:58:30,783 --> 02:58:33,343
Began creating a dead zone

3790
02:58:33,855 --> 02:58:39,231
In this part of France in front of the Hindenburg line and a dead zone that extended in some places 20 mi

3791
02:58:41,279 --> 02:58:42,815
German Soldier Ernst Junger

3792
02:58:43,071 --> 02:58:46,143
Was there watching the destruction take place

3793
02:58:46,911 --> 02:58:48,959
And he Compares it to a kind of lunacy

3794
02:58:49,727 --> 02:58:50,239
Image

3795
02:58:50,495 --> 02:58:56,639
It's funny because if you think about people doing this in the second world war you think about them using mostly explosives and there were explosives used

3796
02:58:57,151 --> 02:58:59,199
To create this dead zone but Germany needed her

3797
02:58:59,711 --> 02:59:02,783
And so a lot of this stuff was done by hand

3798
02:59:03,807 --> 02:59:08,415
And younger says it had a bad effect on the troops and he also blame some of it on

3799
02:59:08,671 --> 02:59:09,183
What he calls

3800
02:59:09,439 --> 02:59:11,743
Economic Times we live in

3801
02:59:11,999 --> 02:59:14,815
Or something like that and what he really means by that is this

3802
02:59:15,327 --> 02:59:17,631
Total War 20th century sort of mentality

3803
02:59:18,143 --> 02:59:18,911
Younger rights

3804
02:59:19,167 --> 02:59:20,959
About passing through this dead zone

3805
02:59:21,983 --> 02:59:24,287
Being created by the German Army as it moved

3806
02:59:24,543 --> 02:59:25,055
Backwards

3807
02:59:25,311 --> 02:59:26,335
Towards its main line

3808
02:59:26,591 --> 02:59:27,103
And quote

3809
02:59:27,359 --> 02:59:31,711
The villages we passed through on our way had to look a vast lunatic asylum

3810
02:59:32,223 --> 02:59:35,295
Whole companies were set to Knocking or pulling down walls

3811
02:59:35,551 --> 02:59:36,831
We're sitting on rooftop

3812
02:59:37,087 --> 02:59:38,111
Uprooting the tiles

3813
02:59:38,367 --> 02:59:39,391
Trees were cut down

3814
02:59:39,647 --> 02:59:40,927
Windows smashed

3815
02:59:41,183 --> 02:59:45,535
Wherever you looked clouds of smoke and dust Rose from Bath piles of debris

3816
02:59:45,791 --> 02:59:50,399
We saw men dashing about wearing suits and dresses left behind by the inhabit

3817
02:59:50,911 --> 02:59:52,191
With top hats on their head

3818
02:59:52,703 --> 02:59:56,543
With destructive cunning they found the roof trees of the houses

3819
02:59:56,799 --> 02:59:59,615
Fixed ropes to them and then with concerted shouts

3820
02:59:59,871 --> 03:00:02,175
Hold until they all came tumbling down

3821
03:00:02,431 --> 03:00:04,991
Others were swinging pile driving hammers

3822
03:00:05,247 --> 03:00:08,063
And went around smashing everything that got in their way

3823
03:00:08,319 --> 03:00:12,159
From the flower pots on the window sills two-hole ornate Conservatory

3824
03:00:12,415 --> 03:00:15,999
As far back as the siegfried line that's what the Germans called the Hindenburg

3825
03:00:17,023 --> 03:00:19,071
Every village was reduced to Rubble

3826
03:00:19,327 --> 03:00:25,471
Every tree chopped down every road undermine every well poisoned every basement blown up orb

3827
03:00:25,727 --> 03:00:26,239
Booby-trapped

3828
03:00:26,495 --> 03:00:32,639
Every rail unscrewed every telephone wire rolled up everything burnable burned in a word

3829
03:00:32,895 --> 03:00:35,967
We were turning the country that are advancing opponents would occupy

3830
03:00:36,223 --> 03:00:37,247
Into a wasteland

3831
03:00:37,503 --> 03:00:38,783
As I said he writes

3832
03:00:39,039 --> 03:00:41,087
The scenes were reminiscent of a madhouse

3833
03:00:41,343 --> 03:00:43,391
And the effect on the men with similar

3834
03:00:43,647 --> 03:00:45,695
Half bunny half repellent

3835
03:00:45,951 --> 03:00:47,743
They were all so we can see right away

3836
03:00:47,999 --> 03:00:50,047
Bad for the men's morale and honor

3837
03:00:50,303 --> 03:00:55,167
Here for the first time I witnessed wanton destruction that I was later in life to see 2xs

3838
03:00:55,423 --> 03:00:59,519
This is something that is unhealthily bound up with the economic thinking of our age

3839
03:01:00,031 --> 03:01:03,871
But it does more harm than good to the destroyer and dishonors the soldier

3840
03:01:04,383 --> 03:01:04,895
And quote

3841
03:01:06,431 --> 03:01:09,503
And it should be remembered that this isn't a war damage

3842
03:01:09,759 --> 03:01:15,903
Country this this area that they're pulling apart now in creating a dead zone was an idyllic part of France it wasn't touched

3843
03:01:16,159 --> 03:01:19,999
By The Wharf you weren't right on the front in the first world war especially in the Western Front

3844
03:01:20,255 --> 03:01:21,535
Things were great behind

3845
03:01:22,047 --> 03:01:24,863
One of the complaints French soldiers on leave happy as you can get

3846
03:01:25,119 --> 03:01:29,983
20 or 30 miles behind the front line and everything is like there's not even a war going on

3847
03:01:30,751 --> 03:01:34,591
You know they see men with their sweethearts prowling around going to restaurants for dinner

3848
03:01:34,847 --> 03:01:38,175
In a town 30 miles from the front and it's like it's another world

3849
03:01:39,199 --> 03:01:41,503
So they're tearing down these beautiful

3850
03:01:41,759 --> 03:01:42,527
Parts of France

3851
03:01:42,783 --> 03:01:45,343
To create this dead zone they're destroying every

3852
03:01:46,623 --> 03:01:47,135
And then

3853
03:01:47,903 --> 03:01:49,439
They're leaving booby traps

3854
03:01:49,951 --> 03:01:51,743
Because when the Germans give up their position

3855
03:01:52,255 --> 03:01:55,583
They're going to retreat as I said sometimes 20 miles in this one area

3856
03:01:55,839 --> 03:01:57,375
All the way back to the main line

3857
03:01:58,143 --> 03:01:58,655
The

3858
03:01:59,423 --> 03:02:04,543
Allies are going to follow them when they follow them they're going to run into these town when they run into these towns

3859
03:02:04,799 --> 03:02:07,871
They're going to run into and younger talked about it earlier booby

3860
03:02:08,127 --> 03:02:09,151
Traps here's what he said quote

3861
03:02:09,919 --> 03:02:12,735
Among the surprises we prepared for our successors

3862
03:02:12,991 --> 03:02:14,783
Horsham truly malicious inventions

3863
03:02:15,295 --> 03:02:17,599
Very fine wires almost invisible

3864
03:02:17,855 --> 03:02:20,671
We're stretched across the entrance of buildings and shelters

3865
03:02:20,927 --> 03:02:23,999
Which set off explosive charges at the faintest touch

3866
03:02:24,511 --> 03:02:27,839
In some places near Road ditches were dug across roads

3867
03:02:28,095 --> 03:02:29,375
And shells hidden in them

3868
03:02:29,631 --> 03:02:31,167
They were then covered over by a large

3869
03:02:31,423 --> 03:02:32,447
Plank and Earth

3870
03:02:32,703 --> 03:02:33,471
Screen over them

3871
03:02:33,727 --> 03:02:37,311
A nail has been driven into the plank only just above the shelf

3872
03:02:37,823 --> 03:02:41,663
The space was measured so that marching troops could pass over the spot safely

3873
03:02:41,919 --> 03:02:47,551
But the moment the first trucker field gun rumbled up the board would give in the nail which off the shell

3874
03:02:47,807 --> 03:02:49,599
Where there were spiteful Timebomb

3875
03:02:49,855 --> 03:02:52,415
They were buried in the basements of undamaged building

3876
03:02:52,927 --> 03:02:58,047
They consisted of two sections with a metal partition going down the middle in one part was explosive

3877
03:02:58,303 --> 03:02:59,071
Any other asset

3878
03:02:59,583 --> 03:03:00,863
After these Devils eggs

3879
03:03:01,119 --> 03:03:04,959
He called them have been primed in Hidden the acid slowly over weeks

3880
03:03:05,215 --> 03:03:08,031
Eroded the metal partition and then set off the bomb

3881
03:03:08,799 --> 03:03:09,311
And quote

3882
03:03:10,335 --> 03:03:11,103
British reporter Phil

3883
03:03:12,127 --> 03:03:15,455
Untrue some of these towns right after younger and his men and vacated them

3884
03:03:15,711 --> 03:03:17,247
And Allied Forces moved in

3885
03:03:17,503 --> 03:03:20,063
And give talks about all those same kinds of

3886
03:03:20,319 --> 03:03:20,831
Booby trap

3887
03:03:21,343 --> 03:03:22,623
And then says this quote

3888
03:03:23,391 --> 03:03:26,975
Only a few of our men were killed or blinded by these monkey tricks

3889
03:03:27,231 --> 03:03:30,047
Are Engineers found most of them before they were touched off

3890
03:03:30,303 --> 03:03:34,911
But one went down dugouts are into ruin houses with a sense of imminent danger

3891
03:03:35,167 --> 03:03:41,311
All through the devastated region one walked with an uncanny feeling of an evil spirit left behind by the

3892
03:03:41,567 --> 03:03:43,615
The masses of men whose bodies have gone away

3893
03:03:44,127 --> 03:03:46,431
Exuded from scraps of old clothing

3894
03:03:46,687 --> 03:03:50,015
He was in the stench of the dugouts and in the ruins that they have made

3895
03:03:50,271 --> 03:03:50,783
And quote

3896
03:03:52,831 --> 03:03:53,855
Booby-trapped

3897
03:03:54,111 --> 03:03:54,879
Dead zone

3898
03:03:56,159 --> 03:03:57,439
Ludendorff is a fully

3899
03:03:57,695 --> 03:03:58,463
20th century

3900
03:03:59,231 --> 03:03:59,743
Total War

3901
03:03:59,999 --> 03:04:00,511
Commander

3902
03:04:03,583 --> 03:04:06,911
And this is a big mood this is pulling a big rabbit out of a hat and it's

3903
03:04:07,167 --> 03:04:09,727
You know if you were military history fan like I am

3904
03:04:10,239 --> 03:04:12,031
What makes ludendorff so interesting

3905
03:04:12,287 --> 03:04:13,823
Not a lot of generals would pull disc

3906
03:04:14,079 --> 03:04:14,591
Kind of stunt

3907
03:04:15,359 --> 03:04:19,455
It was a game-changer in many respects I mean that hold dead zone for example

3908
03:04:19,711 --> 03:04:21,503
Proved to be a huge problem

3909
03:04:21,759 --> 03:04:24,063
For British and French forces to try to overcome

3910
03:04:24,575 --> 03:04:25,599
They move into this

3911
03:04:26,111 --> 03:04:26,879
Cratered

3912
03:04:27,135 --> 03:04:31,743
Destroy denuded area where even the wells have been poisoned how do you even

3913
03:04:31,999 --> 03:04:32,511
Supply that

3914
03:04:33,791 --> 03:04:36,607
The Germans on the other hand and move to sites they been working on

3915
03:04:36,863 --> 03:04:37,631
4 months

3916
03:04:37,887 --> 03:04:42,495
Some parts of the Hindenburg line of had a half a million workers working on it for months and months and months

3917
03:04:42,751 --> 03:04:48,895
And building a new Frontline from scratch like building a new home it was now move in ready they move back

3918
03:04:49,151 --> 03:04:52,479
I can do it and there are railroads bringing supplies up to the back

3919
03:04:53,247 --> 03:04:54,015
What ludendorff

3920
03:04:55,295 --> 03:04:56,319
Was wrong foot

3921
03:04:56,831 --> 03:04:59,135
The Allies he stole the night Marchi

3922
03:05:00,159 --> 03:05:01,951
Seize the initiative he changed

3923
03:05:02,207 --> 03:05:02,975
Their plans

3924
03:05:03,231 --> 03:05:06,047
It's for 1917 without knowing what their plans were

3925
03:05:06,559 --> 03:05:10,143
Assembly figured if I do this all the planning they've been doing for months

3926
03:05:11,423 --> 03:05:12,191
Will be obsolete

3927
03:05:12,959 --> 03:05:14,239
They're planning to have mito

3928
03:05:14,495 --> 03:05:15,263
20 miles

3929
03:05:16,031 --> 03:05:17,567
Closer to Paris than I am

3930
03:05:20,383 --> 03:05:22,175
If you were an Allied General how would you deal with it

3931
03:05:23,967 --> 03:05:30,111
And if you said you don't want to deal with this problem at this looks like an impenetrable nightmare that just puts you in League

3932
03:05:30,367 --> 03:05:33,695
With those military thinkers at the time who were known as Eastern

3933
03:05:34,463 --> 03:05:35,743
These people who thought

3934
03:05:36,255 --> 03:05:38,559
Hacking on the Western Front was insane

3935
03:05:39,327 --> 03:05:41,631
Look at the defenses who would do that

3936
03:05:42,655 --> 03:05:45,471
Prime minister Britain Lloyd George is one of these guys

3937
03:05:47,007 --> 03:05:47,775
Here's the thing though

3938
03:05:48,799 --> 03:05:52,383
You can always find generals and Military Commanders

3939
03:05:52,639 --> 03:05:54,175
Who no matter how

3940
03:05:54,943 --> 03:05:56,991
Impossible the military task looks

3941
03:05:57,759 --> 03:06:00,831
Will be optimistic about explaining to you how their play

3942
03:06:01,087 --> 03:06:02,111
Plan will overcome

3943
03:06:03,135 --> 03:06:03,903
After all

3944
03:06:04,415 --> 03:06:06,975
People don't get those jobs by explaining how they

3945
03:06:07,231 --> 03:06:07,743
Hantover

3946
03:06:07,999 --> 03:06:08,767
Here come the enemies

3947
03:06:09,023 --> 03:06:09,535
Defenses

3948
03:06:10,815 --> 03:06:11,583
We told you earlier that

3949
03:06:11,839 --> 03:06:12,607
The French soccer

3950
03:06:13,119 --> 03:06:16,447
Their military leader that they've had since the beginning of the war Joseph chakra

3951
03:06:16,959 --> 03:06:18,495
Any sort of going to kick him upstairs

3952
03:06:19,007 --> 03:06:22,847
And before they do they have another one of those yearly meetings were all the allies

3953
03:06:23,103 --> 03:06:27,455
Russians in the British in the French and all the other allies they get together they have this meeting and they try to coordinate next

3954
03:06:27,711 --> 03:06:28,735
Deers military plan

3955
03:06:29,503 --> 03:06:30,271
So that when

3956
03:06:30,527 --> 03:06:36,671
The British in the French attack on the Western Front the Russians at the same time attack on the east in the Italians attack in the South and everybody's pushing in

3957
03:06:36,927 --> 03:06:39,487
Multiple directions all at once portion the Germans to

3958
03:06:39,743 --> 03:06:40,255
You know

3959
03:06:40,767 --> 03:06:41,791
Maybe break some

3960
03:06:42,047 --> 03:06:43,839
I mean the Central Powers at this point of liking

3961
03:06:44,095 --> 03:06:44,607
Eggs

3962
03:06:44,863 --> 03:06:51,007
And as soon as you can break into any one of their sides east west north south I mean you feel like the war

3963
03:06:51,263 --> 03:06:51,775
Will be over

3964
03:06:52,031 --> 03:06:53,567
But they're all holding steady

3965
03:06:53,823 --> 03:06:57,663
The most commanders are looking at the Western Front and say but nothing is a steady is that

3966
03:07:00,223 --> 03:07:00,991
Must we attack it

3967
03:07:02,015 --> 03:07:04,063
The friend should always believe yes you must

3968
03:07:04,319 --> 03:07:07,135
Course they're a little biased because the Germans are on their soil and they would like to

3969
03:07:07,391 --> 03:07:08,159
Does he even pushed off

3970
03:07:08,671 --> 03:07:10,207
When Joseph jafra

3971
03:07:10,719 --> 03:07:13,535
Is Aspen Lake 1916 at the big meeting

3972
03:07:13,791 --> 03:07:19,935
What are we going to do in 1917 what's the plan Jennifer tells him his plan is a repetition of the song the battle that was

3973
03:07:20,191 --> 03:07:24,287
Just wrapping up the battle that was so horrible for British and even for French forces

3974
03:07:26,079 --> 03:07:31,967
Going to wear the Germans down in in in a several months long battle that forces them to throw in the last of their resources

3975
03:07:32,479 --> 03:07:33,759
French politicians were horrified

3976
03:07:35,039 --> 03:07:38,879
The last thing they wanted is about a like that because as far as they were concerned

3977
03:07:39,135 --> 03:07:41,439
How did anybody know that it wouldn't be the French Nation

3978
03:07:41,695 --> 03:07:43,743
The true in all their resources in men

3979
03:07:46,303 --> 03:07:47,839
This is part of the reason is I forgot

3980
03:07:48,095 --> 03:07:48,607
Kicked upstairs

3981
03:07:49,375 --> 03:07:50,143
Different politicians

3982
03:07:51,679 --> 03:07:52,959
Just like British politician

3983
03:07:53,471 --> 03:07:55,263
They were starting to do the unthinkable

3984
03:07:55,775 --> 03:07:57,823
In terms of 19th century attitude

3985
03:07:58,591 --> 03:08:02,943
They were starting to interfere with military decisions because they were losing faith that

3986
03:08:03,199 --> 03:08:04,991
The people making the military decisions

3987
03:08:05,247 --> 03:08:06,271
How to write priority

3988
03:08:07,807 --> 03:08:08,575
The politicians

3989
03:08:09,087 --> 03:08:09,599
Wer

3990
03:08:10,367 --> 03:08:10,879
Worried

3991
03:08:11,391 --> 03:08:12,159
About the casualty

3992
03:08:13,183 --> 03:08:16,511
One of the big criticisms especially from the soldiers in the field

3993
03:08:17,023 --> 03:08:18,047
Is it the generals weren't

3994
03:08:20,095 --> 03:08:24,191
The guy who gets the job is the main allied military commander 1970 we mentioned earlier

3995
03:08:24,703 --> 03:08:25,727
Is a guy named Robert nivelle

3996
03:08:26,239 --> 03:08:29,567
Annabelle gets this job because he's the guy out there

3997
03:08:30,079 --> 03:08:31,615
Optimistic about victory

3998
03:08:32,383 --> 03:08:34,175
Remember generals do not get hired

3999
03:08:35,199 --> 03:08:37,247
Promising to not overcome the enemies

4000
03:08:37,759 --> 03:08:41,087
Fences so there's an ingrown bias in the whole process

4001
03:08:42,111 --> 03:08:42,879
The Robyn Adele

4002
03:08:43,647 --> 03:08:45,183
Tells the French leadership

4003
03:08:45,951 --> 03:08:51,583
When he takes over that you don't have to have another bottle of the song you don't have to have a grinding months-long battle

4004
03:08:51,839 --> 03:08:54,143
You can have a lightning bolt

4005
03:08:55,935 --> 03:08:56,703
Hammer stroke

4006
03:08:56,959 --> 03:08:58,239
It just ends the war

4007
03:08:58,751 --> 03:08:59,263
In

4008
03:08:59,519 --> 03:09:00,287
48 hours

4009
03:09:01,823 --> 03:09:04,127
Now it sounds crazy doesn't know where a bunch of French

4010
03:09:04,383 --> 03:09:05,919
General some of whom

4011
03:09:06,175 --> 03:09:08,479
Nouvelle leapfrogged over

4012
03:09:08,735 --> 03:09:12,575
How they were guys who probably deserve the job at least 3 maybe 4

4013
03:09:12,831 --> 03:09:14,879
More than development eval was this

4014
03:09:15,647 --> 03:09:16,159
He's a

4015
03:09:16,415 --> 03:09:16,927
Charmer

4016
03:09:17,183 --> 03:09:19,999
He's he's one of these people that can win anyone over

4017
03:09:20,511 --> 03:09:26,143
He's not winning over these jealous General he leapfrogged but there's a lot of politicians that are sold

4018
03:09:26,399 --> 03:09:26,911
When your bowel

4019
03:09:27,679 --> 03:09:28,959
And some of them aren't even French

4020
03:09:29,727 --> 03:09:32,543
Novelle has this great advantage over the other French

4021
03:09:33,311 --> 03:09:34,335
Military leaders

4022
03:09:34,847 --> 03:09:35,615
He speaks English

4023
03:09:36,895 --> 03:09:38,943
Repeat perfectly speak sit without an accent

4024
03:09:39,199 --> 03:09:39,711
Is Mother's Day

4025
03:09:41,503 --> 03:09:43,039
So he's a charmer to begin with

4026
03:09:43,295 --> 03:09:47,135
Kind of a Salesman but people like him he doesn't feel slimy or sleazy

4027
03:09:48,415 --> 03:09:49,439
He sort of an optimist

4028
03:09:49,695 --> 03:09:52,511
And he goes over to Brittany wins over even the

4029
03:09:52,767 --> 03:09:54,303
Archie Sterner

4030
03:09:54,559 --> 03:09:55,583
Lloyd George

4031
03:09:57,631 --> 03:09:59,423
It was in there and explain to the British exactly how this

4032
03:09:59,679 --> 03:10:01,727
Plan to rupture the Enemy Lines will work

4033
03:10:02,239 --> 03:10:04,287
And it involves creating a reserve

4034
03:10:04,799 --> 03:10:08,639
2728 divisions that are going to be like the spider in the web

4035
03:10:08,895 --> 03:10:14,527
And as soon as the Germans are held in certain places and weekend and then this 27 divisions will go get him and it's going to take

4036
03:10:15,039 --> 03:10:15,807
48 hours

4037
03:10:17,343 --> 03:10:17,855
And

4038
03:10:18,111 --> 03:10:21,183
Like any good salesman offering some of the money back guarantee

4039
03:10:21,439 --> 03:10:25,023
There's a guarantee guarantee that nibbled tells everybody

4040
03:10:25,535 --> 03:10:28,095
Is if it doesn't work in 48 hours will call it off.

4041
03:10:30,143 --> 03:10:36,287
Now that's a promise to get rid of the part of these battles that's most troubling to people who care about dead people

4042
03:10:36,799 --> 03:10:37,567
A lot of the Dead

4043
03:10:39,103 --> 03:10:43,455
Unless you have just tragic first day is like the battle of the Somme fought in the battle of the Frontiers

4044
03:10:43,711 --> 03:10:44,735
A lot of the deaths

4045
03:10:44,991 --> 03:10:51,135
Happened because he's battled one for months and you could end up after 48 hours if you had a chance to see is it working or not working call it off it's now

4046
03:10:51,391 --> 03:10:57,535
Not working that takes a lot of the risk out of it and you can see why politicians would like that plan a lot more than Joseph opera singer

4047
03:10:57,791 --> 03:10:58,303
Let's have another

4048
03:10:58,559 --> 03:11:00,607
For 5 months long battle

4049
03:11:03,679 --> 03:11:04,191
The problem is

4050
03:11:04,703 --> 03:11:06,495
In hindsight is everyone knows

4051
03:11:06,751 --> 03:11:09,311
Nouvel was working on a on an idea

4052
03:11:09,567 --> 03:11:10,591
It might not have been tenable

4053
03:11:12,639 --> 03:11:15,967
Annabelle made his name at the Battle of Verdun at the very last stages of

4054
03:11:16,223 --> 03:11:18,271
When the Germans were being pushed back in the other direction

4055
03:11:18,783 --> 03:11:21,599
There's a lot of historical debate over whether or not anything

4056
03:11:21,855 --> 03:11:22,879
Novelle did

4057
03:11:23,135 --> 03:11:23,903
Was effective

4058
03:11:24,159 --> 03:11:30,303
But even if it was affected it was effective at a very very low-level to all the sudden be the military leader in charge of not yet

4059
03:11:30,559 --> 03:11:31,839
All of France's forces

4060
03:11:32,095 --> 03:11:37,215
What kind of Britain's forces to who he will Clash developer clash with Britain's Commander Douglas Haig

4061
03:11:37,471 --> 03:11:41,311
They do not like each other the egos of generals are proverbial anyway

4062
03:11:41,567 --> 03:11:42,847
At least you guys were fighting about

4063
03:11:43,103 --> 03:11:45,407
Will create problems between Britain and France's allies

4064
03:11:45,663 --> 03:11:47,711
MLS novellas the most powerful

4065
03:11:47,967 --> 03:11:50,527
Military commander on the Western Front he's never come in at 4

4066
03:11:52,831 --> 03:11:54,367
Is first real problem happens

4067
03:11:55,647 --> 03:11:57,183
When the Germans pull this

4068
03:11:57,695 --> 03:11:59,487
Operation outbreak end

4069
03:11:59,743 --> 03:12:00,511
Disappear

4070
03:12:02,559 --> 03:12:05,119
Remind me a little of the British getting away at Gallipoli

4071
03:12:05,375 --> 03:12:08,191
And fooling the Turks at the Turks didn't know that they'd laugh

4072
03:12:09,471 --> 03:12:10,239
David Yurman

4073
03:12:10,495 --> 03:12:11,263
Is kind of pulled back

4074
03:12:11,519 --> 03:12:13,055
From this Giants aliens and wait for

4075
03:12:13,311 --> 03:12:14,591
For the British to find out they're gone

4076
03:12:16,895 --> 03:12:18,687
And I love the way it starts by the way starts with

4077
03:12:18,943 --> 03:12:22,527
With the British looking out over there trenches and seeing the German trenches

4078
03:12:22,783 --> 03:12:23,551
Beanshell

4079
03:12:24,063 --> 03:12:27,647
And then coming to the realization that the German trenches and that they'd get there

4080
03:12:27,903 --> 03:12:30,207
Facing off against there being shelled by German

4081
03:12:30,975 --> 03:12:32,511
And it's a German artillery

4082
03:12:32,767 --> 03:12:38,911
Blowing up the trenches in destroying everything of value in it and then destroying the trenches so the British can't move up into the menus

4083
03:12:40,703 --> 03:12:41,215
And then of course

4084
03:12:41,471 --> 03:12:41,983
Probing

4085
03:12:42,239 --> 03:12:43,263
It must have been Erie

4086
03:12:43,519 --> 03:12:49,663
There were like single Germans left behind a shooter rifle off every now and then it just keep the Allied armies from pursuing to claw

4087
03:12:49,919 --> 03:12:50,431
Mostly

4088
03:12:50,687 --> 03:12:51,967
But once it was

4089
03:12:52,223 --> 03:12:58,111
What year that the Germans were pulling back into miles an miles church I said like 50 miles every place I rented more like 20 at the

4090
03:12:58,367 --> 03:12:58,879
The farthest

4091
03:12:59,135 --> 03:12:59,903
But nonetheless

4092
03:13:00,159 --> 03:13:03,487
To pull back that far means your military maps are all different

4093
03:13:03,743 --> 03:13:04,511
The place

4094
03:13:05,023 --> 03:13:08,095
Let the hammer blow in nipples offensive was going to fall

4095
03:13:08,351 --> 03:13:10,399
Is the place ludendorff just make hate it

4096
03:13:10,911 --> 03:13:13,215
Okay so as ludendorff probably intended

4097
03:13:13,471 --> 03:13:15,007
You got to change your plans don't you

4098
03:13:15,263 --> 03:13:16,799
You mean conditions on the ground a chain

4099
03:13:17,567 --> 03:13:21,407
Ennavale said I don't have to change my plans this all helps

4100
03:13:21,663 --> 03:13:22,175
What's my goal

4101
03:13:23,199 --> 03:13:25,503
And this is where everything starts to fall apart in this

4102
03:13:25,759 --> 03:13:28,319
Plan and yet at the same time you can see

4103
03:13:28,575 --> 03:13:29,343
How

4104
03:13:29,855 --> 03:13:30,623
These are such

4105
03:13:30,879 --> 03:13:35,231
Huge Affairs involving so many months of preparation so much momentum

4106
03:13:35,743 --> 03:13:37,279
But even if you find out

4107
03:13:37,535 --> 03:13:41,119
Near the beginning of the of the battle that things have changed

4108
03:13:41,631 --> 03:13:43,423
There's a momentum that you can't really even

4109
03:13:43,679 --> 03:13:47,007
Stop in this case everything starts going wrong for me Bell before the whole Battle Star

4110
03:13:48,799 --> 03:13:50,335
None of us before Nemo part of the battle

4111
03:13:50,591 --> 03:13:51,103
Starts

4112
03:13:51,359 --> 03:13:52,639
The campaign

4113
03:13:52,895 --> 03:13:56,223
It's sort of a diversionary campaign designed to

4114
03:13:56,479 --> 03:14:00,063
Make the Germans move away from where niveles going to attack

4115
03:14:00,319 --> 03:14:03,135
Start that's the part of this campaign

4116
03:14:03,391 --> 03:14:04,159
It involves

4117
03:14:04,415 --> 03:14:04,927
The British

4118
03:14:05,183 --> 03:14:06,207
And the Dominion Force

4119
03:14:06,719 --> 03:14:07,487
It happens

4120
03:14:07,743 --> 03:14:10,047
I'm next to the French position at a place called

4121
03:14:10,303 --> 03:14:10,815
Iris

4122
03:14:13,119 --> 03:14:15,423
And at this battle for at least

4123
03:14:15,679 --> 03:14:16,447
A few days

4124
03:14:16,959 --> 03:14:18,239
Everyone gets a chance to

4125
03:14:18,495 --> 03:14:19,007
Sissy

4126
03:14:19,775 --> 03:14:21,823
Exactly how you would go about

4127
03:14:22,079 --> 03:14:25,407
Striking defenses as Invincible as the Germans

4128
03:14:26,175 --> 03:14:26,943
And it looks a lot

4129
03:14:27,455 --> 03:14:28,223
Like world

4130
03:14:28,479 --> 03:14:29,247
World War II

4131
03:14:31,807 --> 03:14:34,623
And you know several history is it pointed out that by the end of the first

4132
03:14:35,391 --> 03:14:36,415
For the armies are Proto

4133
03:14:36,671 --> 03:14:37,183
Second world

4134
03:14:37,439 --> 03:14:37,951
War armies

4135
03:14:38,719 --> 03:14:41,791
There are certain battles know during the war where you can say aha

4136
03:14:42,303 --> 03:14:43,583
There is a big step for

4137
03:14:43,839 --> 03:14:45,631
Forward towards that second World War

4138
03:14:45,887 --> 03:14:46,911
20th century

4139
03:14:47,935 --> 03:14:48,703
In a style of fighting

4140
03:14:49,215 --> 03:14:50,751
That's what the Battle of arras is known

4141
03:14:51,775 --> 03:14:53,823
In the grand scheme of things as we said

4142
03:14:54,079 --> 03:14:59,711
This is the spring offensive this is what the Allies do every year right the weather gets good in Spring we launch an offensive

4143
03:15:00,223 --> 03:15:06,367
The British and the French launched one together with a launch one in tandem the Italians do as we said many launching everywhere the Russians

4144
03:15:06,623 --> 03:15:07,647
This is the Big Spring offensive

4145
03:15:07,903 --> 03:15:13,023
The British part is the sort of diversion as we said and yet they're going to pull this off

4146
03:15:13,279 --> 03:15:14,047
Initially

4147
03:15:15,071 --> 03:15:15,839
So well

4148
03:15:16,095 --> 03:15:17,631
They're going to show everyone

4149
03:15:18,143 --> 03:15:20,447
What 20th century combined arms

4150
03:15:20,703 --> 03:15:21,983
Warfare looks like including Eric

4151
03:15:22,751 --> 03:15:23,263
The amount of

4152
03:15:23,519 --> 03:15:24,543
Coordination no

4153
03:15:24,799 --> 03:15:25,311
Have to come off

4154
03:15:25,567 --> 03:15:26,591
Correctly to make this work

4155
03:15:28,127 --> 03:15:29,407
And it can't be maintained

4156
03:15:29,663 --> 03:15:32,479
But for the short period of time they're able to make it work

4157
03:15:32,735 --> 03:15:34,015
The British show you that

4158
03:15:35,295 --> 03:15:37,343
Modern combined-arms Warfare

4159
03:15:37,599 --> 03:15:39,391
Can devastate the static

4160
03:15:39,647 --> 03:15:40,159
Defenses

4161
03:15:41,951 --> 03:15:42,975
Here's a way historian Peter

4162
03:15:43,487 --> 03:15:43,999
Describes

4163
03:15:44,511 --> 03:15:50,655
The many things that were starting to come together that could be Unleashed at at rosson house scientific and modern 20th century

4164
03:15:51,167 --> 03:15:53,727
This profession of arms is really becoming

4165
03:15:54,239 --> 03:15:55,007
He writes quote

4166
03:15:57,055 --> 03:15:59,103
Many lessons have been learned from the song

4167
03:15:59,359 --> 03:16:01,407
An artillery was at the heart of the plan

4168
03:16:01,663 --> 03:16:04,991
And the Royal artillery and come a long way since 1915

4169
03:16:05,247 --> 03:16:09,087
The thousands upon thousands of new recruit to learn their trade well

4170
03:16:09,343 --> 03:16:10,367
The gun detached

4171
03:16:10,623 --> 03:16:15,231
The layers the NCO the officers were all now wedded into efficient batteries

4172
03:16:15,743 --> 03:16:19,327
They were capable of increasingly sophisticated and complex bombardment

4173
03:16:19,839 --> 03:16:21,631
The guns themselves without plaintiff

4174
03:16:21,887 --> 03:16:28,031
Anywhere vast numbers of medium and heavy artillery pieces joining the masses of ordinary 18-pounder and

4175
03:16:28,287 --> 03:16:30,079
4 1/2 inch Howitzer field artillery

4176
03:16:30,591 --> 03:16:32,383
Advances in technology and science

4177
03:16:32,639 --> 03:16:36,735
Also combined to give a greater understanding of the mechanics of a shell in flight

4178
03:16:36,991 --> 03:16:40,831
And the measurable adjustments caused by different meteorological conditions

4179
03:16:41,343 --> 03:16:42,623
Accuracy was improved

4180
03:16:42,879 --> 03:16:44,927
And the Advent of the 106 fuse

4181
03:16:45,183 --> 03:16:48,767
Mented shells would burst instantaneously on the slightest contact

4182
03:16:49,023 --> 03:16:51,583
Switchmate clearing barbed wire in great deal simpler

4183
03:16:52,095 --> 03:16:58,239
Smoke shells were also now routinely incorporated into the barrages to try to mass be attacking infantry from

4184
03:16:58,495 --> 03:16:59,007
German Defenders

4185
03:16:59,263 --> 03:17:01,567
Gas shells were a key part of the garage

4186
03:17:02,079 --> 03:17:05,663
And they were less visually dramatic than the clouds of gas released from cylinders

4187
03:17:05,919 --> 03:17:07,711
But they were far easier to deploy

4188
03:17:07,967 --> 03:17:09,759
And much more predictable in their effects

4189
03:17:10,015 --> 03:17:16,159
Progress in the linked tasks of photographic reconnaissance and artillery observation allowed targets to be

4190
03:17:16,415 --> 03:17:18,975
He identified and then destroyed by indirect fire

4191
03:17:19,231 --> 03:17:25,375
New techniques are flash spotting and sound ranging also assisted in locating the exact positions of German

4192
03:17:25,631 --> 03:17:26,143
Batteries

4193
03:17:26,655 --> 03:17:27,167
And quote

4194
03:17:28,191 --> 03:17:29,471
Demond coordination of

4195
03:17:29,727 --> 03:17:31,775
Come off correctly to make the stop work

4196
03:17:32,031 --> 03:17:34,847
Is astounding and it shouldn't be surprising that it usually does

4197
03:17:35,615 --> 03:17:38,431
What makes a Roth difference is that in some cases it did

4198
03:17:39,967 --> 03:17:40,991
Paper example

4199
03:17:41,247 --> 03:17:42,271
The creeping barrage

4200
03:17:43,295 --> 03:17:45,087
The creeping barrage is a fantastic

4201
03:17:45,599 --> 03:17:48,927
Military Innovation and they've been trying to make it work before

4202
03:17:49,183 --> 03:17:49,695
Dispatch

4203
03:17:50,207 --> 03:17:51,743
In this battle they got it right

4204
03:17:52,255 --> 03:17:55,071
In this battle they were able for a while to create

4205
03:17:55,327 --> 03:17:56,863
Protective

4206
03:17:57,119 --> 03:17:58,399
Explosive force field

4207
03:17:58,911 --> 03:17:59,935
Around British troops

4208
03:18:01,215 --> 03:18:02,239
The way it work as you would get

4209
03:18:02,495 --> 03:18:05,823
Town of guns anywhere from several hundred to more than a thousand

4210
03:18:06,079 --> 03:18:06,847
Firing

4211
03:18:07,103 --> 03:18:07,871
Giant

4212
03:18:08,127 --> 03:18:09,151
Cannonades

4213
03:18:09,407 --> 03:18:11,711
In front of your advancing forces

4214
03:18:12,223 --> 03:18:15,039
Creating a wall of explosions in front of them

4215
03:18:15,807 --> 03:18:17,855
And you have it coordinated everybody would have their

4216
03:18:18,367 --> 03:18:21,439
Winner watches synchronized in the troops will be told okay in the first

4217
03:18:21,695 --> 03:18:23,231
20 minutes you are to move

4218
03:18:23,487 --> 03:18:24,767
You know a hundred yards forward

4219
03:18:25,279 --> 03:18:30,655
And at this time the barrage will shift another hundred yards in front of you so this is all worked out so that

4220
03:18:30,911 --> 03:18:36,031
You know the protective barrage supposed to keep the troops safely and as they Advance toward the enemy

4221
03:18:36,287 --> 03:18:40,127
And the very last step of course is the barrage will land right on the enemy

4222
03:18:40,383 --> 03:18:45,503
And then it will lift at the last second in the enemy will look up in the British forces will be right there standing in front of them

4223
03:18:45,759 --> 03:18:47,295
Having March the whole way

4224
03:18:47,551 --> 03:18:49,599
With a giant explosive force field protecting

4225
03:18:50,623 --> 03:18:51,647
As you might imagine

4226
03:18:51,903 --> 03:18:53,183
Coordination is critical

4227
03:18:53,439 --> 03:18:55,743
You screw this up in one of two things happen

4228
03:18:56,511 --> 03:18:57,535
The better thing

4229
03:18:57,791 --> 03:19:03,679
Is that the garage gets way ahead of the troops and they're exposed to all the machine-gun fire and all the stuff the garage was supposed to protect them

4230
03:19:04,191 --> 03:19:06,239
That's the good part that's the best outcome

4231
03:19:06,495 --> 03:19:08,799
The worst outcome is that the garage is short

4232
03:19:09,311 --> 03:19:13,151
And that giant explosive wall That's supposed to protect you from the enemy instead

4233
03:19:13,407 --> 03:19:13,919
Decimate

4234
03:19:15,711 --> 03:19:16,479
When it works

4235
03:19:16,735 --> 03:19:17,759
It's fantastic

4236
03:19:18,527 --> 03:19:19,807
The Battle of arras it works

4237
03:19:20,063 --> 03:19:20,575
Initially

4238
03:19:22,879 --> 03:19:24,159
Tell me a bunch of Innovations

4239
03:19:25,183 --> 03:19:26,207
Another one again

4240
03:19:26,463 --> 03:19:29,535
It's been tried before but never quite like this is whole batteries

4241
03:19:30,047 --> 03:19:30,815
Submachine gun

4242
03:19:31,071 --> 03:19:31,583
Will be used

4243
03:19:31,839 --> 03:19:32,863
What's called indirect

4244
03:19:33,119 --> 03:19:35,167
Fire meaning they Point them up to the sky

4245
03:19:35,679 --> 03:19:37,727
So that the bullet end up falling

4246
03:19:37,983 --> 03:19:41,055
You know right straight down on targets you can shoot over Hills

4247
03:19:41,823 --> 03:19:44,895
Not even seeing what you're shooting at is one historian

4248
03:19:45,151 --> 03:19:46,943
Explain it apply hosing down

4249
03:19:47,455 --> 03:19:48,223
An important piece of

4250
03:19:48,479 --> 03:19:48,991
In ground they would have

4251
03:19:49,247 --> 03:19:50,783
Thousands of machine gun bullets

4252
03:19:51,039 --> 03:19:52,575
Falling every second on some of these

4253
03:19:52,831 --> 03:19:53,599
Important Road

4254
03:19:53,855 --> 03:19:55,135
Crossings and whatnot

4255
03:19:55,391 --> 03:19:55,903
All through this

4256
03:19:57,951 --> 03:19:59,999
What are the important elements at the start of the battle

4257
03:20:00,255 --> 03:20:00,767
Is that

4258
03:20:01,023 --> 03:20:03,839
So many of the troops that are going to initially rushed

4259
03:20:04,095 --> 03:20:05,887
The German side are underground

4260
03:20:06,143 --> 03:20:06,655
At the start of the

4261
03:20:07,167 --> 03:20:10,495
There's a lot of Chucky ground in this part of France and like a lot of these battles

4262
03:20:11,007 --> 03:20:12,543
There will be a ton of digging

4263
03:20:13,055 --> 03:20:16,639
In fact for months the Germans and the British on both sides of had sort of a

4264
03:20:16,895 --> 03:20:17,663
Tunneling War

4265
03:20:17,919 --> 03:20:21,503
And occasionally in a British tunnels toward the German front

4266
03:20:21,759 --> 03:20:27,135
Run into German tunnelers going the other way and they had these terrible gunfights in the dark underground you know like

4267
03:20:27,391 --> 03:20:27,903
Troglodyte

4268
03:20:30,719 --> 03:20:33,535
Some sources say that the moment the actual Ground Battle

4269
03:20:33,791 --> 03:20:34,815
Adam Ross started

4270
03:20:35,071 --> 03:20:37,887
Some of these tunnels have gone up all the way to the German lines but just

4271
03:20:38,143 --> 03:20:38,911
Couple of feet

4272
03:20:39,167 --> 03:20:40,191
Separated them

4273
03:20:40,447 --> 03:20:42,495
From the German trench lines and that

4274
03:20:42,751 --> 03:20:44,543
At the Second Battle started exploded

4275
03:20:44,799 --> 03:20:46,079
Charges in those those

4276
03:20:46,335 --> 03:20:48,639
Little walls of dirt blew down in the Canadiens

4277
03:20:48,895 --> 03:20:51,711
Storm32 breaches it doesn't matter what

4278
03:20:51,967 --> 03:20:52,991
Exactly happened

4279
03:20:53,247 --> 03:20:56,063
The Canadian storm. Vimy Ridge now and took it

4280
03:20:56,831 --> 03:20:57,599
On the first day

4281
03:20:58,111 --> 03:20:58,879
Arrange that

4282
03:20:59,135 --> 03:21:02,207
Untold numbers are Frenchmen had died trying to take

4283
03:21:02,719 --> 03:21:03,487
Back in 1950

4284
03:21:04,511 --> 03:21:06,047
It's a huge Canadian

4285
03:21:06,815 --> 03:21:10,143
And the Germans were in terrible trouble for a short while

4286
03:21:10,655 --> 03:21:15,519
At the Battle of arras by the way it's not you they get a lot of credit and deservedly so

4287
03:21:15,775 --> 03:21:18,591
But there were Scotsman for example up on the same Hill

4288
03:21:18,847 --> 03:21:20,895
Dealing with all kinds of problems

4289
03:21:21,919 --> 03:21:22,431
And yet

4290
03:21:23,199 --> 03:21:25,247
For the first 24 hours

4291
03:21:25,503 --> 03:21:28,063
It looked like Douglas hang the British commander

4292
03:21:28,575 --> 03:21:31,391
Was going to have on his hands the long-awaited much

4293
03:21:31,647 --> 03:21:33,951
Fantasized about in his head breakthrough

4294
03:21:37,279 --> 03:21:39,583
Ludendorff writes in his diaries that it was a

4295
03:21:39,839 --> 03:21:42,655
A dangerous moment and then and then lamented the fact

4296
03:21:42,911 --> 03:21:48,543
The here this brand-new defense-in-depth system he come up with with all this working all this money spent was apparently useful

4297
03:21:48,799 --> 03:21:51,615
Against these new British combined arms tactics

4298
03:21:52,127 --> 03:21:53,407
That was until he figured out

4299
03:21:53,663 --> 03:21:56,223
His commander on the scene a guy named Falcon housing

4300
03:21:56,479 --> 03:21:58,271
70 something year old guy

4301
03:21:58,527 --> 03:22:00,319
Hadn't quite figured out

4302
03:22:00,575 --> 03:22:02,111
What he was supposed to do

4303
03:22:02,367 --> 03:22:03,135
With these new tax

4304
03:22:03,391 --> 03:22:04,927
If they were still way too new

4305
03:22:05,183 --> 03:22:10,303
And he had done a bunch of things that were part of the old tactics he put all his guys for the most part way up front

4306
03:22:10,559 --> 03:22:11,583
Where they could be

4307
03:22:11,839 --> 03:22:17,983
You're taken by the artillery more than two and a half million British shells by the way if fired

4308
03:22:18,239 --> 03:22:20,543
In a shorter time than the battle of the Somme

4309
03:22:21,567 --> 03:22:24,895
And then he put his reserve That was supposed to be there to plug any holes

4310
03:22:25,151 --> 03:22:31,295
15 miles back too far to do anything in for a short. Of time it look like the British were going to break through at this battle

4311
03:22:32,575 --> 03:22:34,111
And then just like

4312
03:22:34,367 --> 03:22:35,903
All these other battles

4313
03:22:36,415 --> 03:22:37,439
It slows down

4314
03:22:37,951 --> 03:22:41,791
Once the troops Advance Beyond where their gunfire can help them

4315
03:22:42,047 --> 03:22:44,351
Then the guns behind them have to move to

4316
03:22:44,863 --> 03:22:45,631
And that takes

4317
03:22:45,887 --> 03:22:46,911
Time and everybody gets

4318
03:22:47,167 --> 03:22:53,311
Tired and I begin to wear out and while they're resting and rejuvenating cells for the next pushed the Germans arbre

4319
03:22:53,567 --> 03:22:54,335
Bringing up their Reserves

4320
03:22:54,847 --> 03:22:58,687
And the Battle of arras with this wonderful first day in his capture this important

4321
03:22:58,943 --> 03:22:59,967
Vimy Ridge

4322
03:23:00,479 --> 03:23:02,783
Turned into just another one of these battles

4323
03:23:03,039 --> 03:23:06,367
By the time it's over more than a month later

4324
03:23:06,879 --> 03:23:13,023
You have like a hundred and fifty thousand British casualties at like a hundred and thirty thousand German ones and by the way I found it

4325
03:23:13,279 --> 03:23:18,399
Interesting that the newer histories numbers of the casualties these battles is significantly higher than the older

4326
03:23:19,423 --> 03:23:21,727
I have some that say that 75000 British

4327
03:23:21,983 --> 03:23:22,751
Died at this battle

4328
03:23:23,007 --> 03:23:24,799
That's a big discrepancy in the number

4329
03:23:25,823 --> 03:23:26,847
The traditional numbers

4330
03:23:27,103 --> 03:23:28,895
Turn out today are well over a hundred thousand

4331
03:23:29,407 --> 03:23:29,919
All sides

4332
03:23:31,455 --> 03:23:32,479
The Joy over

4333
03:23:33,247 --> 03:23:34,527
Beanie was short-lived

4334
03:23:35,807 --> 03:23:37,599
And what happened at this battle what happened

4335
03:23:37,855 --> 03:23:38,623
And a bunch of other

4336
03:23:38,879 --> 03:23:39,391
First World War

4337
03:23:39,903 --> 03:23:42,975
It shows the difference between how well the first

4338
03:23:43,231 --> 03:23:46,303
Stay usually the first 24 maybe 36 hours of these

4339
03:23:46,559 --> 03:23:49,375
Minutely exquisitely planned encounters go

4340
03:23:49,631 --> 03:23:51,679
The part that's all been rehearsed

4341
03:23:52,191 --> 03:23:57,055
And trained for 4 months and months and months goes great and you're able to make the coordination work

4342
03:23:57,567 --> 03:23:58,847
But then the next jump

4343
03:23:59,103 --> 03:24:03,199
And wherever you are in these battles is a part that becomes much more improvisational

4344
03:24:03,455 --> 03:24:04,735
Much more ad hoc

4345
03:24:04,991 --> 03:24:06,527
You can't have a plan

4346
03:24:06,783 --> 03:24:12,927
In a month in advance for what you do on the second day of the battle cuz you're not really sure where you're going to be the second day

4347
03:24:13,439 --> 03:24:14,463
You may have some

4348
03:24:14,719 --> 03:24:18,815
But that doesn't mean that's what you're going to do when and as many historians point out when you look at the next

4349
03:24:19,071 --> 03:24:19,583
Jumps

4350
03:24:19,839 --> 03:24:24,447
In any of these offences they are so much more haphazard and all that coordination falls apart

4351
03:24:24,703 --> 03:24:30,847
But you don't see the wonderful results that that months of preparation gave you for 24 or 30

4352
03:24:31,103 --> 03:24:35,199
6 hours and yet you can't break through these kinds of deep defenses

4353
03:24:35,455 --> 03:24:38,015
In that short of a period of time you would have to have

4354
03:24:38,271 --> 03:24:43,391
The combined arms activity work as well as it did for the first 24 hours at a Ross

4355
03:24:43,647 --> 03:24:45,695
And be able to carry it through for a week or two

4356
03:24:47,231 --> 03:24:48,511
Nevertheless it was a near run thing

4357
03:24:49,279 --> 03:24:50,815
Gone down in history as a as a

4358
03:24:51,583 --> 03:24:56,703
Heroic encounter mostly for the Canadians the largest in Denver they participated in yet on the Western Front

4359
03:24:57,983 --> 03:24:59,519
And I always have to remind myself

4360
03:24:59,775 --> 03:25:01,567
You know you look at this in an almost

4361
03:25:01,823 --> 03:25:06,943
A field Marshal type fashion when you study this for military history you see it the way the General's office

4362
03:25:07,455 --> 03:25:12,575
These advancements on these Maps what worked and what didn't another coordination question that the technical side of War

4363
03:25:12,831 --> 03:25:15,391
Do we have to remember that when I was try to remind myself

4364
03:25:15,647 --> 03:25:17,695
Do the people on the ground this is not so technical

4365
03:25:18,719 --> 03:25:19,487
Philip Gibbs

4366
03:25:19,999 --> 03:25:20,767
Was there

4367
03:25:21,279 --> 03:25:23,071
He was in the tunnels

4368
03:25:23,583 --> 03:25:26,143
With the troops as they came back

4369
03:25:26,399 --> 03:25:29,215
From these encounters up on Vimy Ridge and places

4370
03:25:29,471 --> 03:25:29,983
Like that

4371
03:25:30,239 --> 03:25:31,263
Gives gives you a real

4372
03:25:31,519 --> 03:25:32,799
A feel for what it was like

4373
03:25:33,311 --> 03:25:34,079
He writes quote

4374
03:25:35,359 --> 03:25:39,199
There were tunnels beneath the roster which are men advance to the German lines

4375
03:25:39,711 --> 03:25:44,319
And I went along the one one line of men was going into battle and another was coming back

4376
03:25:44,575 --> 03:25:45,343
Wounded

4377
03:25:45,599 --> 03:25:46,623
Some of them blind

4378
03:25:46,879 --> 03:25:47,391
Bloody

4379
03:25:47,647 --> 03:25:50,207
Vomiting with the fumes of gas in their lungs

4380
03:25:50,719 --> 03:25:53,791
Their steel hats clinking as they grow past one another

4381
03:25:54,303 --> 03:26:00,447
Involves on each side of these passages Men played cards on Barrel to the light of candles stuck in bong

4382
03:26:00,959 --> 03:26:03,007
I slept until their turn to fight

4383
03:26:03,263 --> 03:26:04,799
With gas mask for their pillow

4384
03:26:06,847 --> 03:26:09,151
This is outside the Citadel meaning of the city

4385
03:26:09,663 --> 03:26:13,759
There were long queues of wounded men taking their turn to the surgeon

4386
03:26:14,015 --> 03:26:15,551
Who were working in a deep

4387
03:26:15,807 --> 03:26:17,599
Crypt with a high vaulted roof

4388
03:26:18,111 --> 03:26:19,903
One day there were three thousand of them

4389
03:26:20,415 --> 03:26:20,927
Silent

4390
03:26:21,183 --> 03:26:23,231
Patient muddy blood-stained

4391
03:26:23,743 --> 03:26:29,887
Blind Boys are men with smashed faces swapped and bloody Rags groped forward to the dark Passage

4392
03:26:30,143 --> 03:26:30,911
Just leading to the vault

4393
03:26:31,167 --> 03:26:32,191
Led by comrade

4394
03:26:32,703 --> 03:26:35,775
On the grass outside lay men with leg wounds and stomach wounds

4395
03:26:36,543 --> 03:26:37,055
And quote

4396
03:26:38,591 --> 03:26:39,615
Norman Collins

4397
03:26:39,871 --> 03:26:40,895
Is an officer with the

4398
03:26:41,151 --> 03:26:41,919
Scottish forth

4399
03:26:42,175 --> 03:26:43,199
Seaforth Highlanders

4400
03:26:43,455 --> 03:26:44,479
There they are two

4401
03:26:45,503 --> 03:26:47,039
And Collins just tells the

4402
03:26:47,295 --> 03:26:48,063
Stories that

4403
03:26:48,575 --> 03:26:50,111
Remind you of

4404
03:26:50,623 --> 03:26:52,927
The very strange moral position

4405
03:26:53,439 --> 03:26:54,207
These kinds of

4406
03:26:54,719 --> 03:26:55,231
Put you in

4407
03:26:55,999 --> 03:26:57,279
Collins talks about

4408
03:26:58,047 --> 03:27:00,351
The fact that they were actually shown

4409
03:27:00,607 --> 03:27:01,119
How to

4410
03:27:01,375 --> 03:27:01,887
Kill

4411
03:27:02,143 --> 03:27:04,191
One of their own men on the battlefield

4412
03:27:04,959 --> 03:27:05,727
Because of the

4413
03:27:05,983 --> 03:27:07,775
Pain and suffering that they were enduring

4414
03:27:08,799 --> 03:27:10,847
And this isn't specific to this battle

4415
03:27:11,103 --> 03:27:12,895
This happened on the battlefield

4416
03:27:13,151 --> 03:27:14,687
Throughout the first World War

4417
03:27:14,943 --> 03:27:16,479
In basically every Army

4418
03:27:16,735 --> 03:27:22,879
And I got caught in these conditions he's our human problems the physics of humankind on the 20th century battlefields

4419
03:27:23,391 --> 03:27:24,159
The results are

4420
03:27:24,415 --> 03:27:25,183
Predictable

4421
03:27:25,439 --> 03:27:26,463
Horrifying

4422
03:27:27,487 --> 03:27:27,999
And

4423
03:27:28,511 --> 03:27:29,023
Pitiable

4424
03:27:30,047 --> 03:27:31,327
Collins rights quote

4425
03:27:31,839 --> 03:27:35,935
After such an intense fighting you always had men lying out in no man's land

4426
03:27:36,447 --> 03:27:42,335
Probably with their testicles blown off and crying in agony and laying out there all night long in the dark in the rain

4427
03:27:42,591 --> 03:27:44,127
Most would never have survived

4428
03:27:44,639 --> 03:27:45,663
But you had a choice

4429
03:27:45,919 --> 03:27:48,479
They could die in agony or you could shoot them

4430
03:27:48,991 --> 03:27:51,039
You were showing how to do the thing very cleanly

4431
03:27:51,295 --> 03:27:54,623
You would take your 45 revolver and talk to the man

4432
03:27:54,879 --> 03:27:58,463
And you behind him and whilst you were talkin pull the trigger

4433
03:27:58,975 --> 03:28:03,839
Put a bullet through the back of his head and immediately the whole front skull came away and they were dead instantly

4434
03:28:04,351 --> 03:28:05,375
There was no pain about it

4435
03:28:05,631 --> 03:28:07,167
But I can honestly say this

4436
03:28:07,423 --> 03:28:09,727
But I never had the courage because that's what it took

4437
03:28:10,239 --> 03:28:12,799
I never had the courage myself to shoot a wounded soldier

4438
03:28:13,311 --> 03:28:16,383
I carried out the operation many times afterwards on animals

4439
03:28:16,895 --> 03:28:19,455
I could kill a pet dog far better than a vet could

4440
03:28:19,711 --> 03:28:21,759
But I was never able to shoot a wounded soldier

4441
03:28:22,271 --> 03:28:23,295
I probably should have

4442
03:28:23,807 --> 03:28:26,623
My friend Auto Marie Dixon was wounded in the stomach

4443
03:28:26,879 --> 03:28:30,719
Can the IRS attack in April he was in great Agony from what I was told

4444
03:28:30,975 --> 03:28:33,535
The kindest thing would have been to shoot him on the battlefield

4445
03:28:34,047 --> 03:28:37,375
Instead of that they took him back to the hospital when he died days later

4446
03:28:37,631 --> 03:28:39,679
It's a tremendous thing to shoot a friend

4447
03:28:39,935 --> 03:28:43,007
Even though he's in agony and I just didn't have the courage to do it

4448
03:28:43,519 --> 03:28:44,799
Most of them died overnight

4449
03:28:45,055 --> 03:28:46,847
And of course they didn't thank you for it I'm sure

4450
03:28:47,871 --> 03:28:48,383
And quote

4451
03:28:50,687 --> 03:28:51,967
There are battles coming up

4452
03:28:52,735 --> 03:28:53,503
Were the numbers of pi

4453
03:28:53,759 --> 03:28:54,271
People

4454
03:28:54,783 --> 03:28:57,087
Who are either shot by their own men

4455
03:28:57,599 --> 03:28:59,391
Or beg to be

4456
03:29:00,415 --> 03:29:00,927
Will Skyrim

4457
03:29:02,719 --> 03:29:03,231
Nonetheless

4458
03:29:03,999 --> 03:29:04,767
This battle

4459
03:29:05,023 --> 03:29:05,791
Was tough enough

4460
03:29:06,815 --> 03:29:09,119
The initial stage is a relation to take

4461
03:29:09,375 --> 03:29:10,399
Vimy Ridge

4462
03:29:11,423 --> 03:29:11,935
Became

4463
03:29:13,727 --> 03:29:15,775
Nightmarish as the month when Dawn

4464
03:29:16,287 --> 03:29:16,799
And

4465
03:29:17,055 --> 03:29:18,335
The casualties piled up

4466
03:29:19,615 --> 03:29:21,919
Before long the British were suffering 4000k

4467
03:29:22,175 --> 03:29:23,199
Please add a

4468
03:29:25,247 --> 03:29:26,271
I was getting to the morale

4469
03:29:26,783 --> 03:29:27,295
The troops

4470
03:29:27,807 --> 03:29:28,319
Games tales of

4471
03:29:28,575 --> 03:29:29,087
The story

4472
03:29:29,343 --> 03:29:30,623
About arriving on a scene

4473
03:29:30,879 --> 03:29:35,231
Right after a bunch of men just behind the front have been blown up in their bath together

4474
03:29:35,487 --> 03:29:36,255
Weather in the bathroom

4475
03:29:36,511 --> 03:29:38,815
Stream with body parts in Blood and he

4476
03:29:39,071 --> 03:29:41,887
And a soldier he knows sits down to talk about

4477
03:29:42,143 --> 03:29:43,167
You know how things are going

4478
03:29:43,423 --> 03:29:48,031
And the soldier is clearly at the end of his rope as far as what he's willing to put up with

4479
03:29:49,055 --> 03:29:49,823
He writes quote

4480
03:29:50,335 --> 03:29:56,223
A few minutes before our meeting a shell had crashed into a bath close to their Hut women were washing themselves

4481
03:29:56,735 --> 03:29:59,807
The explosion filled the bath with blood and bits of Flesh

4482
03:30:00,063 --> 03:30:05,439
The younger officers stared at me under the Tilt forward of his steel hat and said hello Gibbs

4483
03:30:05,695 --> 03:30:09,791
I play chess with him a groom's Cafe in Fleet Street in days before the war

4484
03:30:10,047 --> 03:30:12,095
I went back to his hot and had tea with him

4485
03:30:12,351 --> 03:30:13,375
Close to that back

4486
03:30:13,631 --> 03:30:15,679
Hoping we should not get cut up with the cake

4487
03:30:16,959 --> 03:30:17,471
And quote

4488
03:30:19,263 --> 03:30:19,775
Now

4489
03:30:20,031 --> 03:30:23,871
This battle is I said he's known for how wonderfully competent

4490
03:30:24,127 --> 03:30:28,223
The integration of all the different elements were to make this battle so effective

4491
03:30:28,735 --> 03:30:30,783
That's not how the guy on the ground sees it though

4492
03:30:32,063 --> 03:30:33,599
Gabe says that his friend he's

4493
03:30:34,111 --> 03:30:35,647
Having tea with says quote

4494
03:30:36,415 --> 03:30:39,999
I had heard before some harsh words about our generalship and staff work

4495
03:30:40,511 --> 03:30:42,047
But never anything so passionate

4496
03:30:42,303 --> 03:30:44,351
So violent is from that Gunner officer

4497
03:30:44,607 --> 03:30:47,935
His view of the business was summed up in the word murder

4498
03:30:48,191 --> 03:30:51,519
He raged Against The Impossible order sent down from headquarters

4499
03:30:51,775 --> 03:30:55,615
Against the brutality with which men were left in the line week after week

4500
03:30:55,871 --> 03:30:57,151
Head against the Monstrous

4501
03:30:57,407 --> 03:31:00,479
Abominable futility of all our so-called strategy

4502
03:31:00,991 --> 03:31:04,319
His nerves were in rags as I could see by the way in which his hands shook

4503
03:31:04,575 --> 03:31:06,623
When you lighted one cigarette after another

4504
03:31:06,879 --> 03:31:08,927
His Spirit was in a flame of revolt

4505
03:31:09,183 --> 03:31:10,975
Against the misery of his sleeplessness

4506
03:31:11,487 --> 03:31:13,279
Bill and imminent Peril of death

4507
03:31:15,327 --> 03:31:15,839
And quote

4508
03:31:18,399 --> 03:31:19,679
British reporter Philip Gibbs

4509
03:31:20,447 --> 03:31:22,239
Thinks that that's a high level of disc

4510
03:31:22,495 --> 03:31:25,055
Content and perhaps in the British army it is

4511
03:31:25,823 --> 03:31:26,847
You want to see what's going on

4512
03:31:27,103 --> 03:31:27,615
French army

4513
03:31:28,127 --> 03:31:29,151
At about the same time

4514
03:31:31,711 --> 03:31:33,247
In France a great drama

4515
03:31:33,503 --> 03:31:34,015
Is unfolding

4516
03:31:34,783 --> 03:31:35,295
During this time

4517
03:31:36,319 --> 03:31:39,391
Because right before these offences are scheduled to start

4518
03:31:39,903 --> 03:31:40,671
The French government

4519
03:31:42,207 --> 03:31:43,743
And new political leaders take

4520
03:31:43,999 --> 03:31:47,327
President a new war minister all the civilian leaders of change

4521
03:31:47,839 --> 03:31:52,447
Any civilian leaders have a very different attitude towards this offensive that's about to start

4522
03:31:52,703 --> 03:31:53,727
And the people they see

4523
03:31:53,983 --> 03:31:54,495
Succeeded

4524
03:31:55,007 --> 03:31:58,335
This causes huge problems the first thing is they're not big fans of nivelle

4525
03:31:59,103 --> 03:32:01,663
I joined the club there a lot of people have wonder why this

4526
03:32:01,919 --> 03:32:02,687
This guy got the top

4527
03:32:02,943 --> 03:32:04,223
Job when there were several

4528
03:32:04,479 --> 03:32:07,295
In a superior figures really August people

4529
03:32:07,551 --> 03:32:13,183
Who could have gotten a p'tan Falls people like that we're sitting in the wings and they gave it to a much more Junior

4530
03:32:13,695 --> 03:32:15,487
Person but but for political reasons

4531
03:32:15,743 --> 03:32:17,023
Keep it that last government

4532
03:32:17,535 --> 03:32:22,911
Anyways that we're good for that last government but now that last government was gone in the new one that comes into power

4533
03:32:23,167 --> 03:32:24,703
Would have rather had any one of those other

4534
03:32:26,495 --> 03:32:28,031
What's more they don't like is playing

4535
03:32:28,799 --> 03:32:34,687
Is ideal for this great Thunderbolt assault with all this artillery that's going to end the war in 48 hours they're not buying it

4536
03:32:35,455 --> 03:32:38,015
Lot of people are by the way a lot of people are drinking

4537
03:32:38,527 --> 03:32:40,063
The Robert nivelle Kool-Aid

4538
03:32:40,831 --> 03:32:44,415
And getting into this optimistic mood about this Thunderbolt ending the war

4539
03:32:45,695 --> 03:32:46,719
But the new government

4540
03:32:47,231 --> 03:32:49,535
Pretty sure that that's not what's going to happen

4541
03:32:50,047 --> 03:32:52,863
And they've got some people who Oughta Know sending the messages

4542
03:32:53,119 --> 03:32:53,631
Warning

4543
03:32:54,399 --> 03:32:58,239
There are other military commanders in France were saying call this thing off

4544
03:32:58,495 --> 03:32:59,519
Going to be a disaster

4545
03:33:00,031 --> 03:33:04,639
Some of them are people who are actually subordinate to Nevada and who have

4546
03:33:04,895 --> 03:33:05,919
Jobs to do

4547
03:33:06,175 --> 03:33:07,199
In this coming offensive

4548
03:33:08,479 --> 03:33:11,039
That's scaring the government as you might imagine

4549
03:33:13,343 --> 03:33:14,623
This is all part of this

4550
03:33:15,391 --> 03:33:16,159
Growing

4551
03:33:16,415 --> 03:33:17,183
Interference

4552
03:33:17,439 --> 03:33:20,767
Politicians in the Affairs of generals in this is one of those times

4553
03:33:21,279 --> 03:33:22,559
Were there sort of a Faceoff

4554
03:33:24,095 --> 03:33:25,119
The meeting is called

4555
03:33:25,375 --> 03:33:27,423
Between the new war minister and Novelle

4556
03:33:27,935 --> 03:33:32,287
In late March in the new war minister wants to convince the Bell to call this whole offensive off

4557
03:33:33,567 --> 03:33:36,127
Almost impossible thing to do is we said earlier about

4558
03:33:37,407 --> 03:33:38,687
The stages where you're just

4559
03:33:38,943 --> 03:33:40,223
Finishing the last touches

4560
03:33:40,735 --> 03:33:44,319
Ready to go it's taken months and months the training in the rehearsals in the money spent

4561
03:33:44,575 --> 03:33:48,927
And all this stuff and now the government the civilian leaders who don't know anything about war

4562
03:33:49,183 --> 03:33:49,695
Any general

4563
03:33:50,719 --> 03:33:51,743
Want to call it off

4564
03:33:51,999 --> 03:33:53,279
My reputation

4565
03:33:53,535 --> 03:33:55,327
Remind me to get a lot of personal motives

4566
03:33:55,839 --> 03:33:58,143
And the war minister has some good argue

4567
03:33:59,679 --> 03:34:00,959
He tried to tell him look

4568
03:34:01,471 --> 03:34:02,239
Everything's changed

4569
03:34:02,751 --> 03:34:03,775
Since you first formulated

4570
03:34:06,079 --> 03:34:07,359
To reevaluate

4571
03:34:09,407 --> 03:34:09,919
German

4572
03:34:10,175 --> 03:34:10,943
Hold back

4573
03:34:11,199 --> 03:34:11,711
From

4574
03:34:11,967 --> 03:34:15,807
Their old positions to be new position on the Siegfried line another place is right

4575
03:34:16,063 --> 03:34:17,087
There's one big change

4576
03:34:18,111 --> 03:34:18,879
But not just that

4577
03:34:19,135 --> 03:34:20,927
The war minister tries to make the case

4578
03:34:21,183 --> 03:34:21,951
All of these

4579
03:34:22,463 --> 03:34:26,303
Big events are happening right now these Trends coming together everything we talked about

4580
03:34:26,559 --> 03:34:27,071
On this day

4581
03:34:27,327 --> 03:34:28,351
Program up to date

4582
03:34:28,607 --> 03:34:29,631
Are coming

4583
03:34:29,887 --> 03:34:30,399
2

4584
03:34:30,655 --> 03:34:31,423
The four

4585
03:34:31,679 --> 03:34:32,703
At the same time

4586
03:34:33,983 --> 03:34:36,799
In late March when the war minister talking to the veil about this

4587
03:34:37,055 --> 03:34:39,871
The United States is just about to get in the war and everyone knows

4588
03:34:40,639 --> 03:34:42,687
The Russian Revolution has just happen

4589
03:34:43,711 --> 03:34:44,735
The submarines

4590
03:34:44,991 --> 03:34:45,759
Are about to

4591
03:34:46,015 --> 03:34:50,623
Enter into the month with a sink 840000 tons of Allied Shipping

4592
03:34:51,135 --> 03:34:52,415
There's alot going on

4593
03:34:52,671 --> 03:34:53,695
And Frances war minister

4594
03:34:53,951 --> 03:34:54,719
Surprise to tell

4595
03:34:56,255 --> 03:35:00,351
No one's going to hold you I mean Everything's changed maybe we should re-evaluate Annabelle says no

4596
03:35:02,143 --> 03:35:04,191
The government gets even more desperate as the

4597
03:35:04,447 --> 03:35:05,471
Offencive nears

4598
03:35:05,983 --> 03:35:06,495
And

4599
03:35:07,007 --> 03:35:08,543
Precious him and he

4600
03:35:09,311 --> 03:35:10,335
Polls to take away car

4601
03:35:11,359 --> 03:35:14,431
He says to the government either you back me on this ride resign

4602
03:35:16,223 --> 03:35:18,271
And everything I've read says that this is a crisis

4603
03:35:18,527 --> 03:35:19,039
The French

4604
03:35:19,295 --> 03:35:21,087
For all sorts of internal reasons

4605
03:35:21,599 --> 03:35:23,903
It was likely to bring the government down if they

4606
03:35:24,159 --> 03:35:26,975
They fired the veil right before his offensive was supposed to take hold

4607
03:35:27,231 --> 03:35:29,535
And everyone bought into the optimism and drank the Kool-Aid

4608
03:35:29,791 --> 03:35:31,327
That almost no choice in this confrontation

4609
03:35:31,583 --> 03:35:32,863
Politicians and Generals

4610
03:35:33,119 --> 03:35:34,399
And the government back down

4611
03:35:35,423 --> 03:35:37,215
But it was even worse than the government knew

4612
03:35:38,239 --> 03:35:39,519
Because the Germans knew

4613
03:35:39,775 --> 03:35:40,543
All about

4614
03:35:40,799 --> 03:35:41,311
Novella

4615
03:35:41,567 --> 03:35:43,103
Plans in detail

4616
03:35:44,127 --> 03:35:45,151
Two major incidents

4617
03:35:45,663 --> 03:35:51,295
I want involving captured documents that never should have been anywhere near the front lines that the Germans got their hands on it

4618
03:35:51,551 --> 03:35:52,319
Andrade

4619
03:35:52,575 --> 03:35:57,183
And the officer that they captured were able to find out more the Germans knew all about

4620
03:35:57,439 --> 03:35:57,951
The French plan

4621
03:35:58,207 --> 03:35:59,999
When they were going to take place and what was going to happen

4622
03:36:01,279 --> 03:36:03,583
And they had known in general 4 months

4623
03:36:04,095 --> 03:36:05,119
Air reconnaissance

4624
03:36:05,375 --> 03:36:11,519
And told him I mean these giant Affairs are like giant Supply dump that go on for miles and miles and miles it's very difficult to keep

4625
03:36:11,775 --> 03:36:13,055
Keep the enemy from finding out about it

4626
03:36:13,567 --> 03:36:17,151
And in January the Germans had about nine divisions opposite

4627
03:36:17,663 --> 03:36:18,431
Niveles

4628
03:36:18,687 --> 03:36:19,199
Armies

4629
03:36:19,711 --> 03:36:21,759
By the time the bells about to launch his attack

4630
03:36:22,015 --> 03:36:23,039
The Germans have 48

4631
03:36:24,319 --> 03:36:25,087
And they're waiting

4632
03:36:26,623 --> 03:36:27,135
And it's a disease

4633
03:36:29,183 --> 03:36:30,463
Storing hold you heard that right

4634
03:36:30,719 --> 03:36:31,231
Lights quote

4635
03:36:31,999 --> 03:36:38,143
After several delays due to foul-weather Novelle on 16th April unleashes artillery for 9 days

4636
03:36:38,655 --> 03:36:41,727
And then mounted is infantry charge in driving rain

4637
03:36:42,239 --> 03:36:44,799
Reports from agents in French pows

4638
03:36:45,055 --> 03:36:47,359
I chipped the Germans off to the coming offensive

4639
03:36:47,871 --> 03:36:50,687
Given the news of the offensive in the difficulty of the terrain

4640
03:36:50,943 --> 03:36:52,991
The Germans were able to Halt the main attack

4641
03:36:53,247 --> 03:36:55,039
Before Agape on their first line

4642
03:36:55,295 --> 03:37:01,439
Where is Novelle had forecast a penetration of seven or eight miles on the opening day the French rarely advance

4643
03:37:01,695 --> 03:37:02,719
More than one or two MI

4644
03:37:03,231 --> 03:37:04,511
Bosses were horrendous

4645
03:37:05,023 --> 03:37:10,911
Whereas navale head coldly predicted 10000 casualties for the first day the number was 10 x braids

4646
03:37:11,423 --> 03:37:17,567
After the war the historical service of the French general staff placed casualties for the first 4 days of the offense

4647
03:37:17,823 --> 03:37:19,871
At 30000 killed

4648
03:37:20,127 --> 03:37:21,663
100000 wounded

4649
03:37:21,919 --> 03:37:23,199
And 4000 missing

4650
03:37:23,967 --> 03:37:24,479
And quote

4651
03:37:26,015 --> 03:37:27,039
The story of what

4652
03:37:30,111 --> 03:37:31,391
Is a wonderful

4653
03:37:32,415 --> 03:37:33,439
Demonstration

4654
03:37:33,695 --> 03:37:38,047
How many things can go wrong when you're trying to synchronize everything so carefully

4655
03:37:38,559 --> 03:37:39,327
Start with the weather

4656
03:37:39,839 --> 03:37:42,399
Just like a Terraza week before the weather was bad

4657
03:37:43,167 --> 03:37:45,983
You know who has snow during a spring offense

4658
03:37:46,239 --> 03:37:48,799
But that's what the french face sleet snow rain

4659
03:37:49,055 --> 03:37:50,079
Creating mod

4660
03:37:50,335 --> 03:37:55,455
Slow the progress of the Infantry which has been calculated precisely to keep up with the

4661
03:37:55,967 --> 03:38:01,855
Explosive force field of the creeping barrage which this guy in the valid pioneered back in Verdun

4662
03:38:02,367 --> 03:38:05,183
But never on this kind of scale and in this case

4663
03:38:05,695 --> 03:38:06,207
The

4664
03:38:06,463 --> 03:38:09,023
Memorize the forcefield got way ahead of the troops

4665
03:38:09,279 --> 03:38:10,047
Exposing the truth

4666
03:38:10,303 --> 03:38:10,815
To just

4667
03:38:11,327 --> 03:38:13,119
Unbelievable amounts of machine gun

4668
03:38:13,375 --> 03:38:14,655
Fire there's one part of this front

4669
03:38:15,167 --> 03:38:16,191
Where the French have to

4670
03:38:16,447 --> 03:38:18,495
Travel forever

4671
03:38:19,263 --> 03:38:20,287
To take this

4672
03:38:21,823 --> 03:38:24,639
You know height in the distance in an in this Ridge they

4673
03:38:24,895 --> 03:38:25,407
Determined

4674
03:38:25,663 --> 03:38:27,711
Cut all these little holes into the side of it

4675
03:38:27,967 --> 03:38:34,111
To add to The Ravines and the gorgeous and everything that are already in it and stuff machine guns into every hole

4676
03:38:34,367 --> 03:38:36,159
Did you can fit into this Hillside

4677
03:38:36,415 --> 03:38:37,183
It got about 4

4678
03:38:37,439 --> 03:38:40,511
Thousand of them trained on this French infantry trying to

4679
03:38:41,279 --> 03:38:42,303
You crossed this space

4680
03:38:44,095 --> 03:38:45,887
At arras and here

4681
03:38:46,399 --> 03:38:47,935
You know when you read the history books

4682
03:38:48,703 --> 03:38:52,543
They sound like relatively productive First World War battles cuz

4683
03:38:52,799 --> 03:38:58,175
The soldiers actually take quite a bit more ground than they did in the earlier battles but that's sort of deceiving

4684
03:38:58,687 --> 03:39:00,991
Because this is all part of the new German strategy

4685
03:39:01,503 --> 03:39:07,647
This defense-in-depth where the Germans aren't supposed to fight to the death ball up on the front lines now and not giving into brownish supposed to fight

4686
03:39:08,159 --> 03:39:11,231
Two reasonable degree and then retire to the next line

4687
03:39:11,999 --> 03:39:16,607
So they're letting the enemy have more ground they're just killing more of them while they retreat

4688
03:39:18,399 --> 03:39:20,191
The French actually Stumble Inn

4689
03:39:20,447 --> 03:39:21,471
To these

4690
03:39:22,239 --> 03:39:26,591
First-line areas and think that they're winning cuz they're just not finding that many German

4691
03:39:27,103 --> 03:39:29,407
And then the Germans open up on them from the second

4692
03:39:31,967 --> 03:39:33,247
As you might imagine

4693
03:39:33,759 --> 03:39:35,807
A government that has been assured

4694
03:39:36,319 --> 03:39:39,135
That they'll call this thing off in 48 hours

4695
03:39:39,391 --> 03:39:40,927
And I was going to try to

4696
03:39:41,695 --> 03:39:43,231
Cash in on that guarantee

4697
03:39:43,487 --> 03:39:47,327
They actually gave Novelle an extra day on his 48-hour

4698
03:39:47,583 --> 03:39:49,375
Promise here's how writer Gigi Meyer

4699
03:39:49,631 --> 03:39:50,143
Scribes

4700
03:39:50,399 --> 03:39:51,423
A situation where the

4701
03:39:51,679 --> 03:39:53,471
Politicians come to the general

4702
03:39:53,727 --> 03:39:56,031
And tell him to call the whole thing off now

4703
03:39:56,287 --> 03:40:02,175
You guaranteed it wasn't going to be another song you guaranteed we're going to win the war with this Thunderbolt

4704
03:40:03,199 --> 03:40:04,479
And here's what my rights

4705
03:40:04,735 --> 03:40:05,247
Quote

4706
03:40:05,759 --> 03:40:07,039
On April 19th

4707
03:40:07,295 --> 03:40:07,807
3 days out

4708
03:40:09,087 --> 03:40:09,855
Attack starts

4709
03:40:10,623 --> 03:40:11,903
The war minister intervene

4710
03:40:12,415 --> 03:40:13,951
Trying to get nivelle to stop

4711
03:40:14,207 --> 03:40:20,351
The general who in demanding approval of his grand plan had promised to call it off if a breakthrough were not achieved Within

4712
03:40:20,607 --> 03:40:22,399
In 48 hours refuse

4713
03:40:22,911 --> 03:40:27,263
The very next day he found a histogram however that he had no choice but to pause

4714
03:40:27,775 --> 03:40:30,079
The divisions at the front we're breaking down

4715
03:40:30,591 --> 03:40:33,919
Both their morale and their supplies of ammunition dangerously low

4716
03:40:34,431 --> 03:40:37,759
Late on the day after that April 21st a new phenomenon appear

4717
03:40:38,527 --> 03:40:39,039
And quote

4718
03:40:41,855 --> 03:40:42,879
John Keegan among other

4719
03:40:43,647 --> 03:40:44,159
Historians

4720
03:40:44,415 --> 03:40:45,695
Going to Great Lengths to point out

4721
03:40:45,951 --> 03:40:47,743
How there's an accordion like backup

4722
03:40:48,255 --> 03:40:49,023
The begins

4723
03:40:49,535 --> 03:40:55,679
Once the timetable isn't held to strictly when the when the front elements of these French forces get bogged

4724
03:40:55,935 --> 03:40:58,239
Down everything behind it gets traffic jam

4725
03:40:59,519 --> 03:41:03,615
Recorded Louie Bartos of friendship Corporal in the story several times

4726
03:41:03,871 --> 03:41:10,015
And Bartos is at this battle but he never sees anything he gets stuck in one of these traffic jams and as far as

4727
03:41:10,271 --> 03:41:14,879
You know something's going on a mile or two in front of him but he doesn't ever get there to find out what it is

4728
03:41:15,135 --> 03:41:17,439
The soldiers who find out what it is though

4729
03:41:17,695 --> 03:41:18,975
Begin to

4730
03:41:19,231 --> 03:41:23,071
React as one might imagine from the horror and in this case the tip of the

4731
03:41:23,327 --> 03:41:24,863
Spear in one of these areas

4732
03:41:25,375 --> 03:41:26,655
Are French Colonial

4733
03:41:29,215 --> 03:41:29,983
The story of what hap

4734
03:41:31,007 --> 03:41:31,519
A2 British

4735
03:41:32,031 --> 03:41:32,543
Celeste Philip

4736
03:41:32,799 --> 03:41:33,567
Rights quote

4737
03:41:34,591 --> 03:41:35,359
Talking about the French

4738
03:41:36,383 --> 03:41:38,431
Gibbs talked about how the French were lured into

4739
03:41:38,687 --> 03:41:39,455
The lightly defended

4740
03:41:39,711 --> 03:41:40,223
First Zone

4741
03:41:40,735 --> 03:41:43,039
Only be attacked by the Germans in the second Zone

4742
03:41:43,807 --> 03:41:44,319
Rights quote

4743
03:41:45,087 --> 03:41:48,415
They were to be allowed an easy walk through to their death trap

4744
03:41:48,671 --> 03:41:49,439
That is what

4745
03:41:49,951 --> 03:41:56,095
The French infantry advancing with masses of black troops in the colonial core in the Frontline of assault

4746
03:41:56,351 --> 03:41:59,423
All exultant and inspired by a belief and Victory

4747
03:41:59,679 --> 03:42:01,983
Sweat through the forward zone of the German defenses

4748
03:42:02,495 --> 03:42:05,823
Astonished and then disconcerted by the scarcity of German

4749
03:42:06,079 --> 03:42:11,199
Until the Nile rating barrage fire dropped upon them and smash their human waves

4750
03:42:11,711 --> 03:42:15,551
From French officers and nurses I heard appalling Tales of this tragic

4751
03:42:16,063 --> 03:42:18,111
The death way of the black troops

4752
03:42:18,367 --> 03:42:20,415
Froze the blood of the Frenchman with horror

4753
03:42:20,927 --> 03:42:23,487
Their own losses were immense in a bloody shambles

4754
03:42:24,511 --> 03:42:25,023
And quote

4755
03:42:26,559 --> 03:42:27,839
The French Colonial Soldier

4756
03:42:28,863 --> 03:42:30,655
Which have been thrown into this

4757
03:42:30,911 --> 03:42:31,679
Disaster

4758
03:42:32,447 --> 03:42:34,239
Ran screaming back towards

4759
03:42:34,495 --> 03:42:35,263
Is there online

4760
03:42:35,519 --> 03:42:36,031
Yelling

4761
03:42:36,543 --> 03:42:37,055
Peace

4762
03:42:37,311 --> 03:42:38,591
Down with the war

4763
03:42:38,847 --> 03:42:41,151
Death to those who are responsible

4764
03:42:43,199 --> 03:42:44,223
And all of a sudden

4765
03:42:46,015 --> 03:42:46,527
The French army

4766
03:42:46,783 --> 03:42:47,295
Began to collapse

4767
03:42:49,855 --> 03:42:50,879
Traditionally

4768
03:42:51,135 --> 03:42:54,719
The nivelle offensive is seen as the straw that breaks the camel's back

4769
03:42:54,975 --> 03:42:55,487
French military

4770
03:42:56,511 --> 03:42:59,327
And it's ironic that it would be that way cuz if it's just judged

4771
03:42:59,583 --> 03:43:01,375
In relation to all the other French battles

4772
03:43:01,631 --> 03:43:02,911
NFL offensive is not terrible

4773
03:43:03,935 --> 03:43:10,079
The casualty bill is horrifying but pretty normal for these big battles and remember there's people being killed every day on

4774
03:43:10,335 --> 03:43:11,871
So-called quiet fronts

4775
03:43:12,127 --> 03:43:12,639
The British

4776
03:43:12,895 --> 03:43:15,711
Casualties every week to what they call wasted

4777
03:43:16,223 --> 03:43:19,551
Just living on the Western Front with snipers and bombs and

4778
03:43:19,807 --> 03:43:21,855
French braids and all that is 5000 people a week

4779
03:43:22,367 --> 03:43:28,511
So even between the big battles is horrible but in the big battle the numbers are astronomical by that standard

4780
03:43:28,767 --> 03:43:30,559
No sense is not that bad and they did gain

4781
03:43:30,815 --> 03:43:32,351
In a pretty decent amount of ground

4782
03:43:32,607 --> 03:43:34,143
3 miles and some places

4783
03:43:35,167 --> 03:43:36,703
But this was sold

4784
03:43:36,959 --> 03:43:39,263
In a completely different way the salesman Robert nivelle

4785
03:43:39,519 --> 03:43:45,663
So this is the Thunderbolt that wins the war everybody got to have this last push of optimism it and strength Andre

4786
03:43:45,919 --> 03:43:47,455
Resources in and gumption

4787
03:43:47,711 --> 03:43:50,527
To end the war and then we can all go home in the sufferings over

4788
03:43:50,783 --> 03:43:56,671
A lot of people drink the Kool-Aid and the crash after they drink the Kool-Aid was worse than if they never

4789
03:43:57,183 --> 03:43:57,951
Kool-Aid at all

4790
03:44:00,767 --> 03:44:04,095
All that optimism Boomerang back on the Val

4791
03:44:04,607 --> 03:44:10,751
Who started to try to recast the marketing just being 24 hours into the conflict was no longer talking about war winning

4792
03:44:11,007 --> 03:44:13,311
Thunderbolt he was talking about hey it's going very well

4793
03:44:13,567 --> 03:44:18,431
Modest gains in the sector in the sector and no one was buying the re-crafting of the marketing strategy

4794
03:44:21,503 --> 03:44:24,063
The French government now has a wonderful little drama on a tan

4795
03:44:24,319 --> 03:44:27,135
We're trying to get rid of novalis he won't go quietly

4796
03:44:28,415 --> 03:44:29,951
They put pathan

4797
03:44:30,207 --> 03:44:31,231
He was very competent

4798
03:44:31,487 --> 03:44:32,511
We talked about him earlier

4799
03:44:32,767 --> 03:44:38,143
In the Bells all job and they have a Face-Off and you see this wonderful again changing the guard between

4800
03:44:38,399 --> 03:44:40,191
Politicians kind of trying to

4801
03:44:40,447 --> 03:44:45,823
Assert their authority over the generals in this pushing tag on who's going to be the ultimate Authority

4802
03:44:48,127 --> 03:44:54,271
The one thing that the politicians have in their favor is that they're concerned about casualties and the generals appear to not be

4803
03:44:54,527 --> 03:44:58,111
He concerned about casualties and the people who are rising up in French units

4804
03:44:58,367 --> 03:44:59,903
Up and down the Western Front

4805
03:45:00,159 --> 03:45:01,695
Are very concerned about casual

4806
03:45:04,255 --> 03:45:05,279
NFL offensive

4807
03:45:06,047 --> 03:45:06,815
Traditionally

4808
03:45:07,583 --> 03:45:09,375
Is what kicks off water called

4809
03:45:09,887 --> 03:45:11,679
The 1917 mutinies with music

4810
03:45:11,935 --> 03:45:12,447
1917

4811
03:45:12,959 --> 03:45:15,263
That's a weird charm and it makes it sound

4812
03:45:15,519 --> 03:45:18,591
Like one unit rebelles and then the rebellions eunos

4813
03:45:18,847 --> 03:45:24,479
Transfers like wildfire up and down the front and all these units are acting simultaneously if that it happened the war would have been over

4814
03:45:27,039 --> 03:45:33,183
What do you do to stop a rebellion or revolution when it's the Army that's rebelling about it happened it would have been all over end

4815
03:45:33,439 --> 03:45:35,487
The French government knew it and acted accordingly

4816
03:45:35,999 --> 03:45:36,767
Instead

4817
03:45:37,023 --> 03:45:39,583
You have to imagine a burning roof with the Embers

4818
03:45:39,839 --> 03:45:44,959
Everywhere you know going off into the wind and Landing all over the dry grass on the lawn

4819
03:45:45,215 --> 03:45:51,359
And you you know the French government is running around stamping out fires as they catch hold I mean as many as six of these units a day

4820
03:45:52,383 --> 03:45:52,895
Wer

4821
03:45:53,151 --> 03:45:59,039
Involved in as I said what the French called acts of collective and discipline which meant the whole wide range of thing

4822
03:45:59,295 --> 03:46:03,647
Sometimes it meant getting drunk as an entire unit and that was the end of that we're not going anywhere

4823
03:46:03,903 --> 03:46:05,951
Other times they just refuse to go up to the front

4824
03:46:06,207 --> 03:46:11,071
1in 1/4 decided to march on Paris and was talked out of that at the last minute

4825
03:46:12,863 --> 03:46:14,399
And a lot of this was

4826
03:46:14,911 --> 03:46:19,007
Tied to the Russian Revolution going on simultaneously

4827
03:46:20,287 --> 03:46:21,567
The French in the field

4828
03:46:21,823 --> 03:46:27,967
Saw that all of a sudden Russian soldiers maybe we're going to get out of fighting this war cuz they've somehow with the people acted together

4829
03:46:28,479 --> 03:46:28,991
2

4830
03:46:29,247 --> 03:46:33,599
Go after the people that were as Louie Bartels explained it enslaving them

4831
03:46:34,623 --> 03:46:35,391
Polly Barton

4832
03:46:35,647 --> 03:46:39,743
Who's the Socialist who would have used these happenings in petrograd in Russia

4833
03:46:40,767 --> 03:46:41,791
With great

4834
03:46:42,047 --> 03:46:43,071
Enthusiasm

4835
03:46:43,583 --> 03:46:44,351
Wrote this

4836
03:46:44,863 --> 03:46:46,399
Right around the Times the

4837
03:46:46,655 --> 03:46:47,423
Outbreaks of

4838
03:46:47,935 --> 03:46:50,751
Collective in discipline are happening in his army

4839
03:46:51,007 --> 03:46:51,519
Quote

4840
03:46:52,799 --> 03:46:55,103
But this time the Russian Revolution broke out

4841
03:46:55,359 --> 03:47:00,991
Those Slavic soldiers Only Yesterday enslaved and bent double under the weight of iron discipline

4842
03:47:01,247 --> 03:47:06,367
Unknowingly marched off to massacres like resign slaves had thrown off their yoke

4843
03:47:06,879 --> 03:47:08,927
Proclaim their Liberty and imposed

4844
03:47:09,183 --> 03:47:10,975
Peace on their masters there hangman

4845
03:47:11,231 --> 03:47:13,023
The whole world was stupefied

4846
03:47:13,279 --> 03:47:15,839
Petrified by this revolution this collapse

4847
03:47:16,095 --> 03:47:17,887
I'll be immense Empire the czars

4848
03:47:18,399 --> 03:47:22,239
These events had repercussions on the Western Front into route the French ranks

4849
03:47:22,495 --> 03:47:25,567
A wind of Revolt blue across almost all the regimen

4850
03:47:26,335 --> 03:47:26,847
And quote

4851
03:47:28,383 --> 03:47:30,687
Because I said it was an uneven sort of an affair

4852
03:47:31,199 --> 03:47:32,479
Sometimes it involved

4853
03:47:32,991 --> 03:47:38,367
Whole units large numbers of troops other times it was a decision made by single individuals alone

4854
03:47:39,135 --> 03:47:42,975
That they just weren't going to have their lives thrown into a meat grinder anymore

4855
03:47:43,231 --> 03:47:44,767
Historian Eric Dorn brose

4856
03:47:45,279 --> 03:47:46,047
Tried to give you a sense

4857
03:47:46,303 --> 03:47:47,071
The feeling when he write

4858
03:47:47,327 --> 03:47:47,839
Lights quote

4859
03:47:48,351 --> 03:47:54,495
Already on day 2 of The novella offensive 17 soldiers of one regiment left their post and went to the

4860
03:47:54,751 --> 03:47:58,079
The rear and then in May 30,000 infantrymen abandon the line

4861
03:47:58,591 --> 03:48:03,711
A junior officer recorded the scene at 1 Train Station receiving man who'd been rotated out of the line

4862
03:48:04,223 --> 03:48:05,247
Not roses quoting

4863
03:48:05,503 --> 03:48:06,271
And I Witness

4864
03:48:06,783 --> 03:48:08,319
And the eyewitness to the Troops

4865
03:48:08,575 --> 03:48:09,855
Getting away from the front

4866
03:48:10,111 --> 03:48:12,159
During this rebellious times as quote

4867
03:48:12,671 --> 03:48:14,207
As soon as the train enters

4868
03:48:14,463 --> 03:48:20,607
With what you would say a horde of savages all the doors open on both sides and Men flood out on the platform

4869
03:48:21,375 --> 03:48:22,399
Shout insults

4870
03:48:22,655 --> 03:48:24,447
And threats fly in all directions

4871
03:48:24,703 --> 03:48:30,847
Death to the sugars at-home murderers and pigs that they are long live the revolution down with the

4872
03:48:31,103 --> 03:48:33,407
War is peace we want Etc

Quote

4875
03:48:36,223 --> 03:48:41,343
The trouble spread the 68 of 112 divisions in the French army in June

4876
03:48:41,599 --> 03:48:45,439
He's reporting 125 mutinous incidents but no killing of officers

4877
03:48:45,695 --> 03:48:48,767
The rank-and-file demanded an end to further attacks

4878
03:48:49,279 --> 03:48:50,815
Better pay and living conditions

4879
03:48:51,071 --> 03:48:52,095
And more furloughs

4880
03:48:52,607 --> 03:48:53,119
And quote

4881
03:48:55,167 --> 03:48:58,495
John Keegan and a couple of other historians have an interesting way

4882
03:48:58,751 --> 03:49:00,287
Of describing this

4883
03:49:00,543 --> 03:49:06,687
This act of rebellion that was breaking out almost spontaneously although influenced by other breakouts all across and

4884
03:49:06,943 --> 03:49:07,967
Up and down the Western Front

4885
03:49:08,223 --> 03:49:09,759
He said it's like a labor strike

4886
03:49:10,783 --> 03:49:12,831
But the soldiers had just decided

4887
03:49:13,087 --> 03:49:16,159
That they weren't going to do certain things anymore

4888
03:49:16,415 --> 03:49:19,487
He said it wasn't defeatism it was defense ism

4889
03:49:19,999 --> 03:49:26,143
Meaning these soldiers were not going to let the Germans coming invade France they weren't going to abandon the line and they wouldn't stop

4890
03:49:26,399 --> 03:49:29,983
Fighting but they weren't going to be involved in any more of these offensives

4891
03:49:30,239 --> 03:49:36,383
Where a hundred thirty hundred forty hundred fifty thousand of them we're going to become casualties in a hopeless cause

4892
03:49:37,151 --> 03:49:39,455
Let's also remember that it didn't get to this point

4893
03:49:40,223 --> 03:49:43,551
Until the French army had suffered in three and a half years

4894
03:49:44,063 --> 03:49:45,855
About his many killed at the United

4895
03:49:46,111 --> 03:49:48,415
States has suffered in all its Wars put together

4896
03:49:49,951 --> 03:49:50,975
How would the United States

4897
03:49:51,231 --> 03:49:51,743
Today

4898
03:49:52,255 --> 03:49:56,607
A nation of 300 million France at about 39 or 40

4899
03:49:57,119 --> 03:50:01,471
Deal with 1.5 or 1.7 Million Dead in 4 years

4900
03:50:03,007 --> 03:50:07,871
Adjusted for population size I be more like seven seven and a half million somewhere around there

4901
03:50:08,639 --> 03:50:09,407
Can you imagine

4902
03:50:10,687 --> 03:50:13,247
Would you expect us to be hangover

4903
03:50:13,503 --> 03:50:16,831
Free for the rest of the century in terms of military affairs

4904
03:50:17,343 --> 03:50:19,135
The French had some lingering damage

4905
03:50:19,391 --> 03:50:19,903
Because of this

4906
03:50:20,159 --> 03:50:20,927
First World War

4907
03:50:21,439 --> 03:50:22,463
Anyone else would

4908
03:50:22,719 --> 03:50:23,743
It's amazing they got

4909
03:50:23,999 --> 03:50:25,279
Back on their feet at all

4910
03:50:25,791 --> 03:50:30,399
It's also sort of a Wonder for the Allied cause that the Germans are unaware of the

4911
03:50:30,655 --> 03:50:36,799
That somehow it's it's funny you have been developments of that everybody in Germany like talking about in the streets it's so well-known and yet

4912
03:50:37,055 --> 03:50:40,639
The French army starts falling apart and rebelling in the Germans don't know

4913
03:50:42,431 --> 03:50:45,503
If you were the French High command and you got your army

4914
03:50:45,759 --> 03:50:48,575
You know starting to catch fire like a bunch of

4915
03:50:49,087 --> 03:50:52,671
Rooftop Amber's that are falling on dry grass what do you do to stop that

4916
03:50:53,183 --> 03:50:54,719
You got to be very careful don't you

4917
03:50:54,975 --> 03:50:59,327
You give up too much it becomes like what the Russians are dealing with where you can't even have the troops

4918
03:51:00,095 --> 03:51:06,239
In order to round when they start electing their own little governing groups and they do what they want can't have that but if you cry

4919
03:51:06,495 --> 03:51:07,775
Crackdown to get all tough on them

4920
03:51:08,031 --> 03:51:10,335
You might spread the revolution it's a Daft

4921
03:51:10,847 --> 03:51:11,359
And

4922
03:51:11,615 --> 03:51:13,919
Terrible tightrope for the French government to walk

4923
03:51:14,943 --> 03:51:20,063
This new military leader that takes over for nouvelle pathan is considered to be sort of a soldier General so that helps

4924
03:51:20,319 --> 03:51:22,367
And you famously go around all these units

4925
03:51:22,623 --> 03:51:26,975
Speaking to them and actually promising and delivering some of the reforms they want

4926
03:51:27,231 --> 03:51:29,535
For example reforms on home leave

4927
03:51:30,047 --> 03:51:32,863
Food drink I mean there's a bunch of things that he can manage to

4928
03:51:33,119 --> 03:51:34,911
Perk-up in and take care of that help the troops

4929
03:51:35,423 --> 03:51:36,703
Piping on the front

4930
03:51:36,959 --> 03:51:38,239
At the same time

4931
03:51:38,495 --> 03:51:41,311
He has to show who still in charge this is still the military

4932
03:51:41,567 --> 03:51:42,591
Laws are broken

4933
03:51:42,847 --> 03:51:44,383
Discipline must be maintained

4934
03:51:44,895 --> 03:51:45,407
The French

4935
03:51:45,919 --> 03:51:50,783
Start a Crackdown in July 1917 they will court-martial almost 24,000 sold

4936
03:51:52,063 --> 03:51:52,831
Collective

4937
03:51:54,111 --> 03:51:56,671
LSU about 500 death sentences

4938
03:51:56,927 --> 03:51:58,207
They will actually carry out

4939
03:52:00,767 --> 03:52:02,303
But there's one thing to Tomcat

4940
03:52:03,071 --> 03:52:06,655
He cannot make this Army capable or willing or trustworthy

4941
03:52:07,167 --> 03:52:08,959
To go on another major offense

4942
03:52:09,471 --> 03:52:11,007
This is an army that have to regroup

4943
03:52:11,263 --> 03:52:17,407
Be rebuilt refortified Vuitton's going to do a historically famous Java this but it's going to take time and in the meantime

4944
03:52:17,919 --> 03:52:22,527
The number one thing that he gives to his troops that they were asking for cuz he's got no choice

4945
03:52:22,783 --> 03:52:24,831
Is it they're not going to be thrown into

4946
03:52:25,087 --> 03:52:27,135
Murderous hopeless offensives

4947
03:52:27,647 --> 03:52:28,415
Anytime soon

4948
03:52:29,183 --> 03:52:30,207
This leaves

4949
03:52:30,719 --> 03:52:36,095
The Western Front in any sort of offensive activity on it for the rest of 1917

4950
03:52:36,607 --> 03:52:37,375
To the British alone

4951
03:52:39,167 --> 03:52:41,727
The British commander Douglas Haig is fine with that

4952
03:52:42,495 --> 03:52:43,775
Cuz he has a plan

4953
03:52:44,543 --> 03:52:48,895
And you wanted to carry it out for some time and now that the French are not in his way

4954
03:52:49,151 --> 03:52:49,919
He cast

4955
03:52:50,431 --> 03:52:50,943
His

4956
03:52:51,711 --> 03:52:52,479
How much is a

4957
03:52:53,503 --> 03:52:55,551
On Ypres and the Belgian port

4958
03:52:56,063 --> 03:52:56,575
Yet again

4959
03:52:59,391 --> 03:53:01,439
Douglas Haig the British military leader

4960
03:53:02,207 --> 03:53:05,535
Once the British to launch an attack on the German defenses

4961
03:53:06,047 --> 03:53:06,559
Indulge

4962
03:53:07,071 --> 03:53:07,583
A titre

4963
03:53:07,839 --> 03:53:09,375
Where there's already been two battles

4964
03:53:09,631 --> 03:53:10,399
Sleep right in this war

4965
03:53:10,655 --> 03:53:11,167
You're already

4966
03:53:12,703 --> 03:53:15,007
Now hague's got a great Army to do this

4967
03:53:15,775 --> 03:53:16,543
British Army

4968
03:53:16,799 --> 03:53:21,407
In late 1917 mid 1917 is maybe the best Army in the war at this

4969
03:53:21,919 --> 03:53:23,455
It's taken years for the British

4970
03:53:23,711 --> 03:53:26,271
In a traditionally a c power to build up a land power

4971
03:53:26,783 --> 03:53:31,903
Goodbye July August 1917 they've done a great job of doing just that and its Millions

4972
03:53:32,159 --> 03:53:32,671
Strong

4973
03:53:33,439 --> 03:53:34,207
Anybody try to boot

4974
03:53:34,463 --> 03:53:34,975
Teague Army

4975
03:53:35,231 --> 03:53:39,071
When this war started very very fine and professional and volunteers but

4976
03:53:39,327 --> 03:53:40,351
But the boutique

4977
03:53:41,119 --> 03:53:47,263
What they have in 1917 are a bunch of mostly conscripts unfollows you to mostly conscripts they don't

4978
03:53:47,519 --> 03:53:53,663
Sing on their way to and from Battle anymore like in 1914 after the song that all stop these are a bunch of Grimm

4979
03:53:54,175 --> 03:53:54,943
Professional

4980
03:53:55,967 --> 03:53:57,247
Cooperate when

4981
03:53:57,503 --> 03:53:58,783
Deadly efficiency

4982
03:53:59,295 --> 03:54:00,575
I have a sort of a

4983
03:54:00,831 --> 03:54:02,623
I'm a real that's hard to do

4984
03:54:02,879 --> 03:54:04,927
Describe and they suffered a terrible

4985
03:54:05,183 --> 03:54:11,327
An ordeal the year before the battle of the Somme terrible lost a lot of fantastic people but came back with even more are

4986
03:54:11,583 --> 03:54:14,399
Artillery pieces here in 1917

4987
03:54:14,655 --> 03:54:17,983
In the hands of Hague and Hayden wants to use it in Belgium against the Germans

4988
03:54:19,519 --> 03:54:21,567
But there are people that think that's a stupid idea

4989
03:54:22,335 --> 03:54:25,407
And after several years of war when you've watched

4990
03:54:25,919 --> 03:54:32,063
You know the same thing happened over and over again in all these battles there are people that are going to push back they're starting to see some of these for

4991
03:54:32,319 --> 03:54:33,087
Political leader start

4992
03:54:33,343 --> 03:54:35,135
Question what the military is doing open

4993
03:54:35,647 --> 03:54:36,159
To their face

4994
03:54:36,671 --> 03:54:42,303
You know when we mentioned this earlier I don't want to insinuate that this never happens I mean Abraham Lincoln for example

4995
03:54:42,559 --> 03:54:45,119
Famously would argue with a Civil War General

4996
03:54:45,887 --> 03:54:47,423
But in some countries like Germany

4997
03:54:47,935 --> 03:54:49,215
Politicians in Germany

4998
03:54:49,471 --> 03:54:51,007
Do not interfere in military strategy

4999
03:54:52,031 --> 03:54:53,311
I need only

5000
03:54:53,567 --> 03:54:55,359
Just started doing that in France

5001
03:54:55,615 --> 03:54:57,663
With the collapse of the novella fences

5002
03:54:57,919 --> 03:55:00,223
Right it was in development of this would have brought them into

5003
03:55:00,735 --> 03:55:02,527
Saying are you sure we want to do something like this

5004
03:55:03,039 --> 03:55:03,807
Again

5005
03:55:04,319 --> 03:55:05,343
In Britain

5006
03:55:05,599 --> 03:55:09,951
I would think as a modern person reading the story and I think many of you probably thought the same thing

5007
03:55:10,207 --> 03:55:14,815
You're wondering why it took this long how many times can you lose hundreds of thousands of people

5008
03:55:15,071 --> 03:55:19,167
In what appeared to the non-military I to be very similar kinds of attacks

5009
03:55:19,679 --> 03:55:23,775
Maybe a little strange if there were more people questioning this in Britain there are

5010
03:55:24,543 --> 03:55:26,079
Led by the prime minister

5011
03:55:26,335 --> 03:55:27,103
Lowell George

5012
03:55:28,639 --> 03:55:30,431
Now George to be fair

5013
03:55:30,943 --> 03:55:33,503
Is viewed by history very similarly to the way Woodrow Wilson

5014
03:55:34,271 --> 03:55:35,295
It's almost as though

5015
03:55:35,551 --> 03:55:36,575
There's a good Lord George

5016
03:55:36,831 --> 03:55:37,599
And there's an evil Lloyd

5017
03:55:38,111 --> 03:55:40,415
Different histories will portray him differently

5018
03:55:40,927 --> 03:55:42,975
But taken at face value

5019
03:55:43,231 --> 03:55:45,279
Lloyd George presents himself

5020
03:55:45,535 --> 03:55:48,095
As the person who defends the soldiers

5021
03:55:48,863 --> 03:55:49,887
From The General

5022
03:55:50,911 --> 03:55:53,215
He says during this whole lead in

5023
03:55:53,471 --> 03:55:56,799
To whether or not he gets to have his Belgian defensive quote

5024
03:55:58,847 --> 03:56:00,639
The cabinet must regard themselves

5025
03:56:00,895 --> 03:56:04,223
As Trustees for the fine fellows that constitute our army

5026
03:56:04,479 --> 03:56:06,015
They're willing to face any danger

5027
03:56:06,271 --> 03:56:08,063
And they do so without complaint

5028
03:56:08,319 --> 03:56:13,183
But they trusted the leaders of the nation to see that their lives are not needlessly thrown away

5029
03:56:13,439 --> 03:56:15,999
Another not sacrifice John Muir gambles

5030
03:56:16,255 --> 03:56:19,583
Witcher resorted to merely because those who are directing the war

5031
03:56:19,839 --> 03:56:22,655
Can think of nothing better to do with the men under their command

5032
03:56:22,911 --> 03:56:24,191
It is therefore imperative

5033
03:56:24,447 --> 03:56:27,519
Before we Embark upon a gigantic attack

5034
03:56:27,775 --> 03:56:33,919
Which must necessarily hentel the loss of scores of thousands of valuable lives and produce that sense of discovery

5035
03:56:34,175 --> 03:56:37,759
Which might very well Rush Nations into premature peace

5036
03:56:38,015 --> 03:56:39,807
That we should feel the fair confidence

5037
03:56:40,063 --> 03:56:42,879
But such an attack has a reasonable chance of succeeding

5038
03:56:43,135 --> 03:56:46,463
Amir gamble would be both a Folly and a crime

5039
03:56:47,487 --> 03:56:47,999
And quote

5040
03:56:49,535 --> 03:56:50,303
I must confess

5041
03:56:51,071 --> 03:56:55,423
The to the modern Observer having just witnessed the several years previous of this war

5042
03:56:55,935 --> 03:56:57,983
You think yourself when you hear something like that

5043
03:56:58,495 --> 03:56:59,519
About damn time

5044
03:57:01,567 --> 03:57:03,871
But many modern historians Wonder

5045
03:57:04,895 --> 03:57:06,175
They wonder if Hague

5046
03:57:06,431 --> 03:57:08,735
Didn't have a pretty good feel for this thing

5047
03:57:09,247 --> 03:57:13,855
And that these politicians were barking up the wrong tree maybe for their own political purposes

5048
03:57:15,135 --> 03:57:19,231
Hagstrom makes it look like Lloyd George doesn't know what he's talking about

5049
03:57:19,487 --> 03:57:20,255
When he

5050
03:57:20,511 --> 03:57:22,303
Opens up an operation

5051
03:57:22,559 --> 03:57:24,863
On June 7th 1917

5052
03:57:25,119 --> 03:57:25,887
To take this

5053
03:57:26,655 --> 03:57:27,167
High Ground

5054
03:57:27,423 --> 03:57:29,727
But you need to take before you can have his Ypres.

5055
03:57:30,495 --> 03:57:31,519
It's called Messina rich

5056
03:57:32,031 --> 03:57:35,359
And the British had since 1915

5057
03:57:35,615 --> 03:57:39,199
Been tunneling under this 8 miles of Ridgeline

5058
03:57:39,711 --> 03:57:42,015
And planting explosives underneath

5059
03:57:42,271 --> 03:57:47,135
The incredibly deep and complicated German defenses up there who they were impenetrable

5060
03:57:47,391 --> 03:57:48,671
The British went underneath them

5061
03:57:49,183 --> 03:57:51,999
And the Germans knew they were doing some of this cuz they found one of them

5062
03:57:52,767 --> 03:57:57,119
But on June 7th 1917 when he decides he's going to take this High Ground

5063
03:57:57,375 --> 03:57:58,911
He starts off his attack

5064
03:57:59,423 --> 03:58:00,447
By blowing up

5065
03:58:00,703 --> 03:58:04,031
That 8 miles of Ridge lines with these munitions

5066
03:58:04,799 --> 03:58:07,871
There's more than a million pounds of explosives underneath those Hills

5067
03:58:08,383 --> 03:58:11,455
And when they blow up all within 28 seconds of each other

5068
03:58:11,967 --> 03:58:13,247
Supposedly

5069
03:58:13,503 --> 03:58:14,527
You could hear it in London

5070
03:58:15,295 --> 03:58:17,343
I've heard some people say it was heard

5071
03:58:17,599 --> 03:58:18,111
In iron

5072
03:58:19,135 --> 03:58:23,231
Thought to be the biggest man-made explosion before nuclear weapon

5073
03:58:25,535 --> 03:58:26,559
A vaporizer

5074
03:58:26,815 --> 03:58:28,095
10000 Germans insta

5075
03:58:30,911 --> 03:58:31,935
The second those

5076
03:58:32,191 --> 03:58:33,471
Minds are blown up

5077
03:58:34,239 --> 03:58:39,359
Thousands of British artillery pieces on the horizon open fire on the same line of ridges

5078
03:58:39,871 --> 03:58:40,383
And

5079
03:58:40,639 --> 03:58:41,663
The British

5080
03:58:42,175 --> 03:58:48,319
80000 of them who come out of their trenches and end March toward that High Ground have a pretty darn easy.

5081
03:58:48,575 --> 03:58:49,087
Time taking it

5082
03:58:49,343 --> 03:58:50,879
I first world war standard

5083
03:58:51,391 --> 03:58:52,671
I got always throw that in because

5084
03:58:52,927 --> 03:58:55,231
To the naked eye it still looks like a lot of people died but

5085
03:58:55,743 --> 03:59:01,631
My first world war standards that's a pretty darn good attack and once again it seems to show that the British have found the secret sauce

5086
03:59:01,887 --> 03:59:08,031
The magic formula of how the tanks in the artillery the aircraft and all work together perfectly and boom Messina Ridge taken

5087
03:59:08,287 --> 03:59:08,799
4

5088
03:59:09,055 --> 03:59:10,335
Not that much loss of life

5089
03:59:11,359 --> 03:59:13,151
Seems like he knows what he's doing

5090
03:59:13,407 --> 03:59:17,503
But before he gets approval for this battle Ade prelims pulling up the guns he's getting ready

5091
03:59:17,759 --> 03:59:22,879
Boy George and Company take him into a back room and make him kind of do a PowerPoint presentation

5092
03:59:23,135 --> 03:59:26,719
Britain civilian leader in Hague sort of grits his teeth and does it

5093
03:59:26,975 --> 03:59:28,767
Explains why it'll be a good thing

5094
03:59:29,023 --> 03:59:34,911
Your wife why we should be doing this and why it should be a walkover did you see that wonderful battle we just bought and took Messina Ridge

5095
03:59:36,191 --> 03:59:38,239
Hague will end up getting other generals and

5096
03:59:38,495 --> 03:59:39,007
Admirals

5097
03:59:39,263 --> 03:59:45,407
Just want to side with him against the political leadership there were always politicians who sided with them

5098
03:59:45,663 --> 03:59:47,967
Military professionals who leave things to them

5099
03:59:48,223 --> 03:59:49,759
Four guys like Churchill

5100
03:59:50,015 --> 03:59:52,063
Or Lloyd George who were the ones

5101
03:59:52,319 --> 03:59:57,951
Questioning military leadership they were very tough position can you imagine what risk they would have run

5102
03:59:58,207 --> 04:00:03,071
If they had overruled all their military professionals and then 200,000 guys get killed

5103
04:00:03,327 --> 04:00:04,095
In a battle

5104
04:00:04,607 --> 04:00:07,935
Which by the way is almost the default result of a lot of these battles

5105
04:00:08,191 --> 04:00:14,335
So you could pretty much be assured that that would happen if it happened to the generals oh well it just happened again.

5106
04:00:14,591 --> 04:00:19,455
General but if Lloyd George overruled all their generals and it happened because of him you can be sure

5107
04:00:19,711 --> 04:00:20,991
He would have been roasted

5108
04:00:23,295 --> 04:00:24,831
So predictably

5109
04:00:25,343 --> 04:00:26,879
Douglas he gets his offencive

5110
04:00:27,391 --> 04:00:28,927
He starts by

5111
04:00:29,183 --> 04:00:33,791
Starting a military bombardment of the area right around July 15th July 20th

5112
04:00:34,303 --> 04:00:37,631
Before the ground attack starts the British will shoot almost

5113
04:00:37,887 --> 04:00:44,031
4 million shell to just show you how the progression is going a year ago with the psalm we were all

5114
04:00:44,287 --> 04:00:47,103
Call saucer-eyed and so was the rest of the world at the time

5115
04:00:47,359 --> 04:00:50,687
When the British shut off a million shells before they started

5116
04:00:50,943 --> 04:00:56,319
Bad battle for this when they're shooting off almost 4 million you can see why Germany is concerned

5117
04:00:56,831 --> 04:00:57,343
With

5118
04:00:57,599 --> 04:01:01,695
Finding a way to turn the entire country into a Munitions Factory

5119
04:01:02,719 --> 04:01:03,231
The goal

5120
04:01:04,511 --> 04:01:06,303
On July 31st

5121
04:01:07,327 --> 04:01:08,351
1917

5122
04:01:09,375 --> 04:01:10,399
The Ypres offensive

5123
04:01:12,703 --> 04:01:14,239
Very soon afterwards

5124
04:01:15,263 --> 04:01:15,775
So is the rain

5125
04:01:17,823 --> 04:01:20,127
It will be the rain that will give this battle

5126
04:01:20,639 --> 04:01:22,431
It's Unique standout Carey

5127
04:01:23,711 --> 04:01:25,759
And there are so many battles in the first World War

5128
04:01:26,015 --> 04:01:27,039
Sound the same

5129
04:01:27,295 --> 04:01:33,183
It only a few standout and it's always for some particular reason they become associated with something special you know an offer if

5130
04:01:33,439 --> 04:01:34,719
Take away the most casual

5131
04:01:34,975 --> 04:01:36,767
The most shells

5132
04:01:37,023 --> 04:01:37,791
I mean everyone knows

5133
04:01:38,047 --> 04:01:40,351
Verdun is the grade artillery meat grinder offense

5134
04:01:41,119 --> 04:01:42,143
The song is that

5135
04:01:42,399 --> 04:01:43,167
Horrible

5136
04:01:43,679 --> 04:01:44,191
Tragic

5137
04:01:44,447 --> 04:01:46,495
Situation would maybe tragic encompass

5138
04:01:46,751 --> 04:01:49,823
Brusilov offensive in the East is known for its scope

5139
04:01:50,335 --> 04:01:51,359
Passchendaele

5140
04:01:51,615 --> 04:01:54,431
Show me the British name for 30 / is known for its mod

5141
04:01:55,711 --> 04:02:00,575
And my doesn't sound like too terrible thing but when you think about living outdoors and fighting

5142
04:02:01,087 --> 04:02:01,855
Mud makeup

5143
04:02:02,111 --> 04:02:03,135
Terrible situation

5144
04:02:03,903 --> 04:02:09,791
And I don't want to suggest that just because this is probably the worst mud anyone has ever fought in the first World War

5145
04:02:10,303 --> 04:02:14,911
That mud has not been a problem for soldiers on other fronts and another battles

5146
04:02:15,167 --> 04:02:19,263
It's been sort of the bane of the existence for people especially in trenches

5147
04:02:19,775 --> 04:02:21,823
But nowhere is the mod like it is in flan

5148
04:02:22,591 --> 04:02:25,919
The soldiers fighting and it described it as having a consistency of porridge

5149
04:02:26,175 --> 04:02:26,687
Torchy's

5150
04:02:28,223 --> 04:02:29,247
There is no bottom

5151
04:02:30,015 --> 04:02:32,063
And you stink in it slowly

5152
04:02:32,319 --> 04:02:33,343
As you would in quicksand

5153
04:02:34,111 --> 04:02:35,391
There are a lot of people

5154
04:02:35,647 --> 04:02:39,231
Who died in the first two battles of Ypres by drowning

5155
04:02:41,023 --> 04:02:42,047
In addition

5156
04:02:42,303 --> 04:02:43,583
There is a complex

5157
04:02:44,095 --> 04:02:48,447
Very fragile system of dikes and other water and flood control measures

5158
04:02:48,703 --> 04:02:53,823
That have been implemented in that area over the centuries to keep the water from taking it over

5159
04:02:54,079 --> 04:02:57,919
The artillery has done great damage to that before 30 price

5160
04:02:58,175 --> 04:03:03,295
Now with this wonderful barrage of 4 million shells that the British launched into this area

5161
04:03:03,807 --> 04:03:06,111
Destroyed whatever was left in that sis

5162
04:03:07,647 --> 04:03:11,487
But it's when the rain starts that he gets horrifying because you taken already

5163
04:03:11,743 --> 04:03:17,887
Horrifying first world war Western Front Battlefield of the sort we've described with the giant trenches everywhere the veggie tray

5164
04:03:18,143 --> 04:03:21,727
Haitian all gone except for the little twigs and sticks that used to be giant trees

5165
04:03:21,983 --> 04:03:24,287
Is horrific hell Mordor like

5166
04:03:24,543 --> 04:03:26,079
A landscape and you flood it

5167
04:03:27,103 --> 04:03:31,967
Now we had battles like the song where there will be rain and you will have moments of flooding but it isn't like this

5168
04:03:32,223 --> 04:03:34,783
This battlefield will start the flood and it will stay that way

5169
04:03:36,319 --> 04:03:39,903
There will only be three dry days in the month of August

5170
04:03:41,695 --> 04:03:42,975
In fact they get double

5171
04:03:43,487 --> 04:03:44,255
The normal rainfall

5172
04:03:45,023 --> 04:03:46,559
And this turns the area

5173
04:03:47,071 --> 04:03:48,095
Into swamp

5174
04:03:49,887 --> 04:03:50,911
Swamp of quicksand

5175
04:03:52,191 --> 04:03:53,983
And very quickly with all of the

5176
04:03:54,239 --> 04:03:58,335
No casualties that start cropping up you get the same kind of situation we talked about at the Somme

5177
04:03:58,591 --> 04:04:04,735
Where if the shell holes with your everywhere filled with water become like toxic dumps with

5178
04:04:04,991 --> 04:04:07,039
Human bodies decaying in them in the remnants of

5179
04:04:07,295 --> 04:04:08,831
Poison gas and trash

5180
04:04:09,087 --> 04:04:09,599
And

5181
04:04:09,855 --> 04:04:15,999
The results of the music these things is latrines and it is being most sickening stuff you can think of as a matter of fact one of the problems can

5182
04:04:16,255 --> 04:04:17,023
Fronting the British

5183
04:04:17,279 --> 04:04:18,047
At this battle

5184
04:04:18,303 --> 04:04:18,815
Is

5185
04:04:19,071 --> 04:04:23,679
They don't have water for the truth they have water everywhere they have water coming out their ears but none to drink

5186
04:04:25,215 --> 04:04:27,263
Can you show holes in the mud

5187
04:04:27,519 --> 04:04:32,383
Will form as nasty and enemy to the soldiers fighting in this

5188
04:04:32,639 --> 04:04:33,407
As they are

5189
04:04:33,663 --> 04:04:39,807
You know opposition and I don't want to suggest it wasn't bad for the Germans either that maybe the Overlook side of passchendaele it's so

5190
04:04:40,063 --> 04:04:44,159
Horrible in this is seared into British Consciousness then it's so horrible for British troops

5191
04:04:44,415 --> 04:04:46,719
Which let's remember and not just English folks

5192
04:04:46,975 --> 04:04:47,743
And Welsh

5193
04:04:47,999 --> 04:04:53,887
Scotch Irish Newfoundland Indian Australia New Zealand Canadian and I'm leaving some out

5194
04:04:54,655 --> 04:04:56,447
They're all their suffering

5195
04:04:56,959 --> 04:04:58,495
But the Germans are suffering too

5196
04:05:00,287 --> 04:05:01,567
The rain is so bad

5197
04:05:01,823 --> 04:05:02,591
Dead Within

5198
04:05:02,847 --> 04:05:03,615
Just a few days

5199
04:05:04,127 --> 04:05:07,711
He has to call a halt to operations the guns are sinking

5200
04:05:07,967 --> 04:05:11,807
You know what's the horses are syncing up to their chip the people

5201
04:05:12,319 --> 04:05:15,903
Are sinking what makes this battle particularly horrifying

5202
04:05:16,159 --> 04:05:22,303
Is that in no other battle in the first world war do you routinely see the soldiers putting that unbelievable situation

5203
04:05:22,559 --> 04:05:24,607
Equation that we quoted Norman Cousins that

5204
04:05:25,119 --> 04:05:25,887
Scottish Soldier

5205
04:05:26,399 --> 04:05:28,959
He was saying he was given the tools to

5206
04:05:29,215 --> 04:05:32,287
Kill his fellow man if they were badly wounded on the battlefield

5207
04:05:32,543 --> 04:05:34,591
What if they're slowly sinking in mud

5208
04:05:35,615 --> 04:05:36,639
Because that's what was happening

5209
04:05:36,895 --> 04:05:39,199
When we talk about battles it's carnation

5210
04:05:39,711 --> 04:05:40,479
What do we mean by

5211
04:05:41,503 --> 04:05:43,039
Well in the first World War

5212
04:05:43,295 --> 04:05:47,647
Hundreds of thousands sometimes millions of men would go through these terrible places

5213
04:05:48,159 --> 04:05:49,183
Passchendaele one

5214
04:05:49,695 --> 04:05:51,999
You know we're done with another the song was another

5215
04:05:52,255 --> 04:05:55,839
The brusilov offensive I mean these people who go through these horrible experiences

5216
04:05:56,095 --> 04:06:01,215
Number in the hundreds of thousands or millions of those survivors then go home permanently changed

5217
04:06:01,727 --> 04:06:03,775
How many human beings have to go home

5218
04:06:04,031 --> 04:06:05,055
Permanently change

5219
04:06:05,567 --> 04:06:07,871
For that to Ripple across their entire Society

5220
04:06:08,639 --> 04:06:12,735
Passchendaele did just that and part of the reason why would because what these people saw

5221
04:06:13,247 --> 04:06:14,527
Troy Dam

5222
04:06:16,319 --> 04:06:17,599
I mean the most widely

5223
04:06:17,855 --> 04:06:19,903
You know lampooned poetic line

5224
04:06:20,415 --> 04:06:23,487
Is Wylie Lampoon because it became so associated with the

5225
04:06:23,743 --> 04:06:25,279
This battle Siegfried Sassoon wrote

5226
04:06:25,535 --> 04:06:26,559
I died in hell

5227
04:06:26,815 --> 04:06:28,095
They called it passchendaele

5228
04:06:30,399 --> 04:06:32,191
You can see pictures by the way of this battle

5229
04:06:32,703 --> 04:06:36,287
On the battlefield to try to keep soldiers from getting stuck in the mud

5230
04:06:36,543 --> 04:06:38,079
They laid down duct board

5231
04:06:38,591 --> 04:06:43,455
And so you have and you have to imagine go look at pictures it is amazing you have a battlefield that looks like

5232
04:06:43,711 --> 04:06:46,783
The moon if the moon had been turned too much

5233
04:06:47,551 --> 04:06:48,319
And then

5234
04:06:48,831 --> 04:06:54,975
On the mud to try to keep people from sinking into it as though it's quicksand they put these little teeny planks in

5235
04:06:55,231 --> 04:06:55,999
Nmama

5236
04:06:56,255 --> 04:06:57,279
Make them look like

5237
04:06:58,047 --> 04:07:04,191
Hats in for where people need to go but what this does it means that the soldiers have to actually walk on those a machine gun

5238
04:07:04,447 --> 04:07:05,471
Understand just Target them

5239
04:07:05,727 --> 04:07:11,871
And these duckboards are blown up every night by the artillery and every night to get Royal Engineers coming rebuilding for the

5240
04:07:12,127 --> 04:07:12,639
Next day

5241
04:07:12,895 --> 04:07:13,407
Under Fire

5242
04:07:15,455 --> 04:07:18,527
Peter Hart and his wonderful book on the first world war the Great War

5243
04:07:19,039 --> 04:07:22,367
Quote private Norman Cliff a British soldier in the first Grenadier guards

5244
04:07:23,135 --> 04:07:23,903
Describing

5245
04:07:24,415 --> 04:07:26,975
In what was happening and it happened to thousands of soldiers

5246
04:07:27,231 --> 04:07:27,743

5247
04:07:28,511 --> 04:07:31,071
The approach to the ridge was a desolate swamp

5248
04:07:31,327 --> 04:07:35,679
Over which brooded an evil menacing atmosphere that seem to defy encroachment

5249
04:07:36,191 --> 04:07:39,007
Far more treacherous than the visible surface defenses

5250
04:07:39,263 --> 04:07:41,567
With which we were familiar such as barbed wire

5251
04:07:41,823 --> 04:07:43,359
Deep devouring mud

5252
04:07:43,615 --> 04:07:45,663
Spread deadly traps in all directions

5253
04:07:45,919 --> 04:07:52,063
We splashed and slithered and dragged our feet from the pull of an invisible enemy determined to suck us into its death

5254
04:07:52,831 --> 04:07:57,695
Every few steps someone would slide and stumble and weighed down by rifle and equipment

5255
04:07:57,951 --> 04:07:59,999
Rapidly sink into the squelching mess

5256
04:08:00,511 --> 04:08:01,279
Those nearest

5257
04:08:01,535 --> 04:08:02,303
Grab his arms

5258
04:08:02,559 --> 04:08:06,911
Struggled against being themselves engulfed in a few Min Lee possible dragged him out

5259
04:08:07,167 --> 04:08:10,239
When helpers floundered in as well and doubled the task

5260
04:08:10,495 --> 04:08:11,263
It became hope

5261
04:08:12,031 --> 04:08:18,175
All this training efforts fail in the swamps swallowed it's screaming victims and we had to be ordered to plot on 2G

5262
04:08:18,431 --> 04:08:22,783
Dejectedly and fight this Relentless enemy has stubbornly as we did those we could see

5263
04:08:23,039 --> 04:08:25,855
It happened at one of those leading us was Lieutenant Chamberlain

5264
04:08:26,111 --> 04:08:29,695
And so distraught that he become at the spectacle of men drowning in mud

5265
04:08:29,951 --> 04:08:36,095
And the desperate attempts to rescue them that suddenly he began hysterically belaboring the shoulders of a sinking man

5266
04:08:36,351 --> 04:08:37,375
Swagger stick

5267
04:08:37,631 --> 04:08:38,911
We were horror-struck

5268
04:08:39,167 --> 04:08:43,775
Does he does most compassionate officer so one strong is to resort to brutality

5269
04:08:44,031 --> 04:08:46,591
Are allowed protest Fortune to desist

5270
04:08:46,847 --> 04:08:48,127
The man was rescued

5271
04:08:48,383 --> 04:08:49,407
But some could not be

5272
04:08:49,663 --> 04:08:51,967
And they sent shrieking with fear and agony

5273
04:08:52,223 --> 04:08:53,759
To be order to go ahead

5274
04:08:54,015 --> 04:08:59,135
And leave a comrade to such a fate was the hardest experience one could be asked to endure

5275
04:08:59,391 --> 04:09:00,927
What the objective had to be reached

5276
04:09:01,183 --> 04:09:02,463
And we plunge Dawn

5277
04:09:02,719 --> 04:09:07,327
Bitter anger against the evil forces prevailing piled on door exasperation

5278
04:09:07,583 --> 04:09:09,887
This was as near to hell as I ever want to be

5279
04:09:10,911 --> 04:09:11,423
And quote

5280
04:09:13,215 --> 04:09:15,775

Quotes of soldiers

5282
04:09:17,823 --> 04:09:18,847
Depressing quotes

5283
04:09:19,359 --> 04:09:22,175
One of our men was unfortunate enough to step out of line

5284
04:09:22,431 --> 04:09:24,223
And fell into one of these mud hole

5285
04:09:24,735 --> 04:09:27,295
We managed to Loop a rope securely under his armpit

5286
04:09:27,551 --> 04:09:28,575
But it was useless

5287
04:09:28,831 --> 04:09:32,927
The poor fellow now knew he was beyond all Aid and begged me to shoot him

5288
04:09:33,183 --> 04:09:36,255
Rather than leave him to die a miserable death by suffocation

5289
04:09:36,511 --> 04:09:38,303
I am not afraid to say therefore

5290
04:09:38,559 --> 04:09:41,119
That I shot this man at his own urgent request

5291
04:09:41,887 --> 04:09:42,399
And quote

5292
04:09:45,215 --> 04:09:46,495
Any account is clear

5293
04:09:46,751 --> 04:09:50,335
Did this particular mode of dying affected the soldiers

5294
04:09:50,591 --> 04:09:54,175
In a worse than most of the other ones this is the the true extra horror

5295
04:09:54,687 --> 04:09:56,223
Of passchendaele third Ypres

5296
04:09:58,527 --> 04:10:00,575
Writer Adam hochschild in his book

5297
04:10:00,831 --> 04:10:01,855
To end all wars

5298
04:10:02,111 --> 04:10:03,391
Coach of British major

5299
04:10:03,903 --> 04:10:04,671
At 34

5300
04:10:05,183 --> 04:10:05,951
Who says quote

5301
04:10:06,463 --> 04:10:09,535
A party of a company man passing up to the front line

5302
04:10:09,791 --> 04:10:11,071
Found a man bald

5303
04:10:11,327 --> 04:10:12,351
2 above the knees

5304
04:10:12,607 --> 04:10:13,375
Dog with mud

5305
04:10:13,631 --> 04:10:14,143
What he means

5306
04:10:14,399 --> 04:10:15,167
He says quote

5307
04:10:15,423 --> 04:10:17,215
The United efforts of four of them

5308
04:10:17,471 --> 04:10:19,263
With rifles beneath his armpits

5309
04:10:19,519 --> 04:10:25,663
Made not the slightest impression and to dig even if shovels had been available would be impossible for there was

5310
04:10:25,919 --> 04:10:26,431
No foothold

5311
04:10:26,687 --> 04:10:29,247
Judy compelled them to move on up to the line

5312
04:10:29,503 --> 04:10:33,855
And when two days later they passed down that way The Wretched fellow was still there

5313
04:10:34,111 --> 04:10:35,903
But only his head was now visible

5314
04:10:36,159 --> 04:10:37,183
He was raving mad

5315
04:10:38,463 --> 04:10:38,975
And quote

5316
04:10:40,767 --> 04:10:44,351
And just like most of the other bad World War 1 battles

5317
04:10:44,863 --> 04:10:47,423
The other people stuck out in no man's land

5318
04:10:47,679 --> 04:10:49,215
That you couldn't go get

5319
04:10:49,983 --> 04:10:52,287
Drove the men in the trenches their comrades

5320
04:10:52,543 --> 04:10:54,335
Just almost insane

5321
04:10:54,591 --> 04:10:55,871
With powerlessness

5322
04:10:57,663 --> 04:11:00,735
Historian John Keegan quotes pretty Soldier Edwin Vaughn

5323
04:11:01,247 --> 04:11:02,783
Who's at the third Ypres

5324
04:11:03,039 --> 04:11:03,807
And who described

5325
04:11:04,063 --> 04:11:10,207
How the rain takes a known horrific situation the people stuck in no man's land and the sufferer

5326
04:11:10,463 --> 04:11:15,583
The date went through and the suffering that they've been transmitted to they're powerless comrades in the trenches

5327
04:11:15,839 --> 04:11:16,607
And made it worse

5328
04:11:16,863 --> 04:11:17,887
By just adding water

5329
04:11:20,703 --> 04:11:22,239
Soldier Von talks about

5330
04:11:22,495 --> 04:11:24,543
Being in a shell hole and then says quote

5331
04:11:26,079 --> 04:11:27,359
From other shell holes

5332
04:11:27,615 --> 04:11:32,223
From the darkness on all sides came the groans and wails of wounded men

5333
04:11:32,479 --> 04:11:36,575
Faint long sobbing moans of Agony into sparing shriek

5334
04:11:37,087 --> 04:11:40,671
It was too horribly obvious that dozens of men with serious wounds

5335
04:11:40,927 --> 04:11:43,487
Must have crawled for safety into New Shell holes

5336
04:11:43,743 --> 04:11:48,863
And now the water was Rising about them and Powerless to move they were slowly drowning

5337
04:11:49,119 --> 04:11:51,679
Horrible Visions came to me with those cries

5338
04:11:51,935 --> 04:11:55,519
Of men lying meme doubt they're trusting that their Pals would find them

5339
04:11:55,775 --> 04:11:59,871
And now dying terribly alone amongst the dead in the inky Darkness

5340
04:12:00,127 --> 04:12:01,663
And we could do nothing to help them

5341
04:12:01,919 --> 04:12:06,783
Dunham was crying quietly beside me and all the men were affected by the piteous cry

5342
04:12:07,295 --> 04:12:07,807
And quote

5343
04:12:09,599 --> 04:12:12,927
Lieutenant Edwin Vaughn and his man are relieved a couple hours later

5344
04:12:13,951 --> 04:12:15,231
Is there walking back

5345
04:12:15,487 --> 04:12:16,511
Down the line

5346
04:12:16,767 --> 04:12:17,791
He notices quote

5347
04:12:18,303 --> 04:12:20,863
The cries of the Wounded have been much diminished now

5348
04:12:21,119 --> 04:12:24,703
And as we staggered down the road the reason was only too apparent

5349
04:12:24,959 --> 04:12:27,519
For the water was right over the tops of the shell holes

5350
04:12:28,031 --> 04:12:28,543
And grow

5351
04:12:30,335 --> 04:12:33,407
Now if you wanted to look at this battle which went on for months

5352
04:12:33,919 --> 04:12:37,247
In military terms and you wanted to look at it positively as some

5353
04:12:37,503 --> 04:12:38,783
Modern historians do

5354
04:12:39,039 --> 04:12:39,807
You could say

5355
04:12:40,319 --> 04:12:46,463
Very killed between 220 and 350000 more Germans nothing wrong with that in war

5356
04:12:46,719 --> 04:12:47,487
Depression right

5357
04:12:48,511 --> 04:12:51,839
Course if you're the British political command you you'll know that it killed

5358
04:12:52,095 --> 04:12:53,631
About the same number of

5359
04:12:53,887 --> 04:12:54,399
British soldier

5360
04:12:56,703 --> 04:12:57,471
Detained

5361
04:12:57,727 --> 04:13:01,567
A few miles and some places that Canadians heroically capture the

5362
04:13:01,823 --> 04:13:04,383
Town of passchendaele Against All Odds and through much

5363
04:13:04,639 --> 04:13:06,687
You're suffering and persevering

5364
04:13:06,943 --> 04:13:07,711
What again

5365
04:13:08,223 --> 04:13:08,735
It's not

5366
04:13:08,991 --> 04:13:10,015
Quite apparent

5367
04:13:10,527 --> 04:13:13,855
How this really pushed the end of the war any closer

5368
04:13:15,647 --> 04:13:18,207
It definitely pushed a lot of soldiers though

5369
04:13:18,719 --> 04:13:21,279
Closer to a transformation

5370
04:13:21,791 --> 04:13:23,839
That they would eventually if they lived

5371
04:13:24,095 --> 04:13:25,375
To make it home

5372
04:13:25,631 --> 04:13:27,679
Transfer to the entire Society

5373
04:13:28,191 --> 04:13:29,471
Pretty Soldier Ronald skirt

5374
04:13:29,727 --> 04:13:31,007
Forever transformed

5375
04:13:31,263 --> 04:13:32,287
His experiences

5376
04:13:33,055 --> 04:13:35,615
In Flanders 1917 Edward so many others

5377
04:13:35,871 --> 04:13:38,943
It crushed the underpinnings of so much of his worldview

5378
04:13:39,455 --> 04:13:40,479
He writes about

5379
04:13:40,735 --> 04:13:41,503
The battle quote

5380
04:13:42,015 --> 04:13:46,111
I said the men's morale was breaking I suppose I should have included myself

5381
04:13:46,367 --> 04:13:49,951
I had long since lost any desire to continue as a fighting Soldier

5382
04:13:50,463 --> 04:13:54,559
Idealists and coward art of much use on a battlefield and I was a bit of both

5383
04:13:55,071 --> 04:13:58,399
At nineteen I found my standards of conduct obsolete

5384
04:13:58,655 --> 04:14:00,191
My ideal shattered

5385
04:14:00,447 --> 04:14:03,007
I've lost all faith in institutional religion

5386
04:14:03,519 --> 04:14:07,615
My church at authorize me to break the 6th commandment in the name of patriotism

5387
04:14:08,127 --> 04:14:08,639
And quote

5388
04:14:10,175 --> 04:14:11,199
He continues quote

5389
04:14:11,711 --> 04:14:13,247
Eventually I worked it all out

5390
04:14:13,759 --> 04:14:14,783
At least for myself

5391
04:14:15,039 --> 04:14:16,319
God was all right

5392
04:14:16,575 --> 04:14:18,111
It was we who were wrong

5393
04:14:18,367 --> 04:14:21,183
Why the hell should he care what happened to us a lot

5394
04:14:21,439 --> 04:14:24,767
We had brought this war evil into existence not God

5395
04:14:25,023 --> 04:14:28,607
The reason evil and ugliness were triumphing over goodness and beauty

5396
04:14:28,863 --> 04:14:34,239
Why pity and compassion were considered weaknesses and ruthlessness and cruelty regarded as Noble

5397
04:14:34,495 --> 04:14:37,311
The reason for all this was the wickedness in ourselves

5398
04:14:37,567 --> 04:14:39,359
And not the indifference of God

5399
04:14:39,615 --> 04:14:43,455
That's why the more murders you committed the bigger the hero you became

5400
04:14:43,711 --> 04:14:47,295
That's what made your Superior officer slap you on the back and say

5401
04:14:47,551 --> 04:14:51,647
When did old chap jolly good shooting when your shells are destroyed in minutes

5402
04:14:51,903 --> 04:14:55,231
The beauty which Craftsmen had toiled lifetime to create

5403
04:14:55,487 --> 04:15:00,607
Disillusion is very very bitter when you're young thoughtful imaginative and sensitive

5404
04:15:01,375 --> 04:15:01,887
And quote

5405
04:15:03,935 --> 04:15:04,447

Head escape death by inches a dozen times

Had seen his comrades die in Dreadful agony

5414
04:15:22,367 --> 04:15:24,927
Had seen and heard man who should have been dead

5415

Screaming for anyone with a loaded rifle to end their unbearable suffering

5420
04:15:33,887 --> 04:15:35,935
And watched his friends and others

5421

Slowly choking froth is poison gas suffocated them

5422
04:15:40,031 --> 04:15:43,359
Could not believe it possible until his own eyes told him it was

5423
04:15:43,615 --> 04:15:44,639
But half a man

5424
04:15:45,151 --> 04:15:47,199
Could leave for what seemed to him hours

5425
04:15:47,455 --> 04:15:50,015
And by the time he was rendered unconscious himself

5426
04:15:50,271 --> 04:15:52,575
Had come to realize that every friend he'd made

5427
04:15:52,831 --> 04:15:55,903
Every man he'd worked with had become cannon fodder

5428
04:15:56,415 --> 04:15:57,695
For years afterwards

5429
04:15:57,951 --> 04:16:00,255
Memories of these Horrors haunted his dreams

5430
04:16:00,511 --> 04:16:01,791
I Disturbed your sleep

5431
04:16:02,047 --> 04:16:04,607
Yet awake he could never bring himself to talk of

5432
04:16:05,119 --> 04:16:11,263
Emily thought of those wounded man and the comrades he been with when they were killed he always came to the same conclusion

5433
04:16:11,775 --> 04:16:13,567
It must never happen again

5434
04:16:14,079 --> 04:16:14,591
Never

5435
04:16:15,615 --> 04:16:16,127
And quote

5436
04:16:17,663 --> 04:16:18,687
There were hundreds

5437
04:16:18,943 --> 04:16:19,711
Thousands

5438
04:16:20,223 --> 04:16:21,247
All survivors

5439
04:16:21,759 --> 04:16:22,271
Like

5440
04:16:22,527 --> 04:16:23,295
This young man

5441
04:16:23,807 --> 04:16:25,087
They went home

5442
04:16:26,367 --> 04:16:27,647
Greatly influence

5443
04:16:27,903 --> 04:16:28,927
Their home societies

5444
04:16:29,439 --> 04:16:31,487
Mean there are literary historians

5445
04:16:31,743 --> 04:16:36,095
It will point to the influence these people had in the writings of the 1920s

5446
04:16:36,351 --> 04:16:37,631
And 1930s

5447
04:16:37,887 --> 04:16:38,399
Everywhere

5448
04:16:40,959 --> 04:16:43,519
War artist Paul Nash with another one

5449
04:16:43,775 --> 04:16:45,567
Permanently affected by passchendaele

5450
04:16:46,335 --> 04:16:50,687
He'd been to other areas and thought the war quite nice and then went to passchendaele

5451
04:16:50,943 --> 04:16:53,759
And had his entire world turned upside down

5452
04:16:54,271 --> 04:16:55,551
This is as related by

5453
04:16:55,807 --> 04:16:58,367
David Reynolds in his spine history the long shadow

5454
04:16:59,647 --> 04:17:00,671
He starts off by saying

5455
04:17:01,183 --> 04:17:03,743
Nash enjoyed all these other areas of the war

5456
04:17:03,999 --> 04:17:04,767
And then rides quote

5457
04:17:05,023 --> 04:17:08,863
But when Nash returns in November to the rain and mud of passchendaele

5458
04:17:09,119 --> 04:17:13,215
He was transfixed by quote the most frightful nightmare of a country

5459
04:17:13,471 --> 04:17:19,615
Moore concede by Dante arpo than by Nature with no glimmer of God's hand to be seen

5460
04:17:19,871 --> 04:17:24,479
Anywhere sunrise and sunset are blasphemies Reynolds says he explained

5461
04:17:24,735 --> 04:17:25,247
Quote

5462
04:17:25,503 --> 04:17:27,039
They are mockeries to man

5463
04:17:28,063 --> 04:17:28,575
And quote

5464
04:17:30,623 --> 04:17:34,463
Reynolds writes that the scene he says was gilded with the colors of hell

5465
04:17:34,975 --> 04:17:36,255
Yellow stinking mud

5466
04:17:36,511 --> 04:17:42,655
Shell holes filled with green white water black dying trees and unceasing shells that

5467
04:17:42,911 --> 04:17:44,959
Churned up the land into a graveyard

5468
04:17:45,215 --> 04:17:45,727
Quote

5469
04:17:46,239 --> 04:17:47,263
Gordon Nash now

5470
04:17:47,519 --> 04:17:49,055
I am no longer an artist

5471
04:17:49,311 --> 04:17:50,335
Interested in curious

5472
04:17:50,591 --> 04:17:54,431
I am a messenger who will bring back word from the men who are fighting

5473
04:17:54,687 --> 04:17:56,991
Do those who want the war to go on forever

5474
04:17:57,247 --> 04:17:59,807
Beabull inarticulate will be my message

5475
04:18:00,063 --> 04:18:03,647
But it will have a bitter truth and make it burn their lousy Souls

5476
04:18:04,415 --> 04:18:04,927
And quote

5477
04:18:06,719 --> 04:18:08,767
British war correspondent Philip Gibbs was there

5478
04:18:09,023 --> 04:18:11,327
Is all over that Battlefield

5479
04:18:11,839 --> 04:18:12,351
And

5480
04:18:12,607 --> 04:18:15,167
He had a true admiration for

5481
04:18:15,423 --> 04:18:15,935
Not just

5482
04:18:16,191 --> 04:18:21,823
The English troops but all the Dominion troops to and what they accomplished their goal of a doomed heroism

5483
04:18:22,079 --> 04:18:23,871
And Gibbs was just blown away

5484
04:18:24,127 --> 04:18:27,967
By what human beings and in these Gallant soldiers were able to achieve

5485
04:18:28,223 --> 04:18:30,527
And nothing upsetting more than to hear later

5486
04:18:30,783 --> 04:18:33,087
Did Sir Douglas Haig the British commander

5487
04:18:33,343 --> 04:18:37,951
Had proclaimed reports of the battlefield at passchendaele as being

5488
04:18:38,207 --> 04:18:39,231
Exaggerating

5489
04:18:40,511 --> 04:18:43,071
This is how a very angry Gibbs respond

5490
04:18:43,327 --> 04:18:43,839
Quote

5491
04:18:44,863 --> 04:18:50,751
Sir Douglas Haig thinks that some of the descriptions of that six months horror were quote-unquote exaggerated

5492
04:18:51,263 --> 04:18:57,407
Has a man who knows something of the value of words and we saw many of those battle scenes in Flanders and went out from Egypt

5493
04:18:57,663 --> 04:19:01,503
When many times during those months and then you names all the places that he been

5494
04:19:01,759 --> 04:19:07,647
A ninja by saying and Beyond to polygon wood and passchendaele where his dad lay meaning

5495
04:19:07,903 --> 04:19:08,671
The dead that

5496
04:19:09,183 --> 04:19:10,975
Haig was responsible for

5497
04:19:11,231 --> 04:19:17,375
Where his dad lay in the swamps and round the pill boxes and where tanks that are followed into the mire were shot in Tucson

5498
04:19:17,631 --> 04:19:23,775
Scrap iron by German gunfire and where our own guns were being flung up by the harassing fire of heavy shells

5499
04:19:24,031 --> 04:19:26,079
I say now that nothing that has been written

5500
04:19:26,335 --> 04:19:29,919
He's more than a pale image of the abomination of those battlefields

5501
04:19:30,175 --> 04:19:35,807
And it no pain or brush has yet achieved the picture of that Armageddon in which so many of our men Parish

5502
04:19:36,319 --> 04:19:36,831
And quote

5503
04:19:38,879 --> 04:19:42,207
Many people began to doubt British military leadership

5504
04:19:42,463 --> 04:19:46,559
Just because they would think you should ever fighting conditions that were that bad

5505
04:19:47,071 --> 04:19:52,959
There's a story and some people doubt it ever happened at used to be something that was mentioned by almost everyone writing about passchendaele

5506
04:19:53,727 --> 04:19:56,031
His book in Flanders Fields Leon Wolff

5507
04:19:56,287 --> 04:19:57,823
Tell the story his way and says

5508
04:19:58,079 --> 04:19:58,591
Quote

5509
04:19:59,615 --> 04:20:00,127
The following day

5510
04:20:00,383 --> 04:20:02,175
Lieutenant general sir lancelot kiggell

5511
04:20:02,431 --> 04:20:04,223
Paid his first visit to the fighting Zone

5512
04:20:04,479 --> 04:20:10,367
As a staff car lurched through the swamp land and near the Battleground he became more and more agitated

5513
04:20:10,623 --> 04:20:12,927
Finally he burst into tears and muttered

5514
04:20:13,183 --> 04:20:15,999
Good god did we really send men to fight in that

5515
04:20:16,511 --> 04:20:20,607
The man beside him who had been through the campaign replied tonelessly

5516
04:20:20,863 --> 04:20:22,143
It's worse further on up

5517
04:20:22,911 --> 04:20:23,423
And quote

5518
04:20:24,703 --> 04:20:25,983
Some say it would be

5519
04:20:26,239 --> 04:20:31,615
She was to think that these military folks have not been out to the field and seeing the conditions are known what they were like

5520
04:20:31,871 --> 04:20:33,663
I'm not going to take a position on that

5521
04:20:33,919 --> 04:20:35,199
All I will suggest is

5522
04:20:35,455 --> 04:20:37,247
But there were a lot of people

5523
04:20:37,503 --> 04:20:39,551
Who look at the conditions of passchendaele

5524
04:20:40,063 --> 04:20:40,831
And wondered

5525
04:20:41,343 --> 04:20:45,183
And what was going on in the heads of Britain's military leaders

5526
04:20:46,719 --> 04:20:47,743
Passchendaele

5527
04:20:47,999 --> 04:20:51,071
Is one of the most often cited nightmares of this war

5528
04:20:52,095 --> 04:20:52,607
To Britain

5529
04:20:53,119 --> 04:20:53,887
Along with the song

5530
04:20:54,143 --> 04:20:55,423
And just like the song

5531
04:20:55,679 --> 04:20:56,959
It did terrible damage

5532
04:20:57,983 --> 04:20:58,495
Britain's Army

5533
04:21:00,287 --> 04:21:04,639
British military historian John Keegan who's definitely in the anti Hague

5534
04:21:04,895 --> 04:21:05,919
Camp Road quote

5535
04:21:06,431 --> 04:21:09,247
On the song he had sent the flower of British youth

5536
04:21:09,503 --> 04:21:11,039
To death or mutilation

5537
04:21:11,295 --> 04:21:15,135
At passchendaele he had tipped the survivors into the slough of despond

5538
04:21:15,903 --> 04:21:16,415
And quote

5539
04:21:17,183 --> 04:21:19,487
For those in Britain's political class

5540
04:21:19,999 --> 04:21:24,607
That wished the generals would pay more attention to casualties they would get their wish

5541
04:21:25,119 --> 04:21:26,911
But not for an entire generation

5542
04:21:27,935 --> 04:21:32,287
The junior officers at places like passchendaele would be permanently affected by the

5543
04:21:32,543 --> 04:21:33,055
That bottle

5544
04:21:33,567 --> 04:21:36,127
British military Rider Brigadier Peter Young Road

5545
04:21:36,383 --> 04:21:36,895
Quote

5546
04:21:37,407 --> 04:21:41,503
The memory of this battle affected British leadership in the Second World War

5547
04:21:42,015 --> 04:21:45,599
Causing many commanders to go to extreme to try to avoid casualty

5548
04:21:46,623 --> 04:21:47,135
And quote

5549
04:21:48,415 --> 04:21:49,695
This attitude will

5550
04:21:49,951 --> 04:21:51,743
Become a generation too late

5551
04:21:52,767 --> 04:21:53,791
For leaders like

5552
04:21:54,303 --> 04:21:55,071
Lloyd George

5553
04:21:56,607 --> 04:21:58,655
He and his allies had tried to call off

5554
04:21:58,911 --> 04:22:01,215
Passchendaele campaign after the first sort of

5555
04:22:02,239 --> 04:22:03,519
An impetus was spent

5556
04:22:04,031 --> 04:22:06,847
Only to fail once again up against the military leadership

5557
04:22:07,615 --> 04:22:08,639
It was hard to say

5558
04:22:09,151 --> 04:22:10,175
Lawton mod

5559
04:22:10,431 --> 04:22:12,735
Blood and mud they can think of nothing better

5560
04:22:15,807 --> 04:22:16,319
Should be sad

5561
04:22:17,855 --> 04:22:18,879
Even though the British

5562
04:22:19,135 --> 04:22:20,159
You're suffering he's kind of cash

5563
04:22:20,671 --> 04:22:21,439
Tissot with a German

5564
04:22:23,999 --> 04:22:25,279
And their soldiers are being

5565
04:22:26,559 --> 04:22:27,583
Tragically

5566
04:22:28,607 --> 04:22:29,375
Affected by this

5567
04:22:29,631 --> 04:22:30,143
Fighting

5568
04:22:30,911 --> 04:22:31,423
As the British soldier

5569
04:22:34,239 --> 04:22:36,031
The German general Hermann Von Kuhl

5570
04:22:36,543 --> 04:22:37,311
Wrote in his report

5571
04:22:38,335 --> 04:22:39,615
About the troops fighting in Flanders

5572
04:22:39,871 --> 04:22:40,383
Quote

5573
04:22:40,895 --> 04:22:44,991
The sufferings probation and exertions which the soldiers had to bear

5574
04:22:45,247 --> 04:22:46,271
Or indescribable

5575
04:22:47,039 --> 04:22:50,879
Terrible was the spiritual burden on the lonely man in the Shell hole

5576
04:22:51,135 --> 04:22:51,903
Sportwrench

5577
04:22:52,159 --> 04:22:55,487
And terrible The Strain on the nerves during the British bombardment

5578
04:22:55,999 --> 04:22:57,279
Which continue day and night

5579
04:22:58,047 --> 04:23:01,119
The hell of Verdun in the psalm was exceeded by flying

5580
04:23:01,631 --> 04:23:05,471
The battle to hold Flanders has been the greatest martyrdom of the war

5581
04:23:05,727 --> 04:23:06,495
And looking back

5582
04:23:06,751 --> 04:23:09,823
It seems that what was born here was superhuman

5583
04:23:10,335 --> 04:23:11,871
Stop perhaps it may still prove

5584
04:23:12,127 --> 04:23:13,151
To be too great

5585
04:23:13,407 --> 04:23:14,175
A courageous Act

5586
04:23:15,711 --> 04:23:16,223
And quote

5587
04:23:18,271 --> 04:23:18,783
Well what

5588
04:23:19,039 --> 04:23:21,599
General cool didn't know in December 19th 7

5589
04:23:21,855 --> 04:23:22,367
Canteen

5590
04:23:23,135 --> 04:23:23,647
Was that

5591
04:23:24,415 --> 04:23:25,951
Something was taking root

5592
04:23:27,231 --> 04:23:29,279
That would end up leading

5593
04:23:30,047 --> 04:23:35,423
To the German military commanders getting their hands on between 500000

5594
04:23:36,191 --> 04:23:36,959
And a million

5595
04:23:37,727 --> 04:23:38,239
Fresh

5596
04:23:38,751 --> 04:23:39,519
Veteran

5597
04:23:39,775 --> 04:23:40,543
Rested

5598
04:23:41,055 --> 04:23:41,567
Soldiers

5599
04:23:43,359 --> 04:23:45,151
Faith is about to put the dice

5600
04:23:45,663 --> 04:23:46,687
The iron dice

5601
04:23:46,943 --> 04:23:48,735
Back into the hands of Germany's

5602
04:23:48,991 --> 04:23:49,503
Leadership

5603
04:23:51,039 --> 04:23:52,063
It's well-known

5604
04:23:52,319 --> 04:23:54,623
They're already inveterate gamblers

5605
04:23:55,135 --> 04:23:56,159
And the chance

5606
04:23:56,671 --> 04:23:57,951
To try to throw

5607
04:23:58,207 --> 04:23:58,975
A knockout

5608
04:24:00,767 --> 04:24:06,143
In a war where both sides look like badly beat up and permanently damage Fighters

5609
04:24:06,911 --> 04:24:07,935
Be irresistible

5610
04:24:09,983 --> 04:24:11,007
Seems like no matter what

5611
04:24:11,263 --> 04:24:12,543
Floyd Joy does

5612
04:24:13,311 --> 04:24:14,591
There's more blood mod

5613
04:24:14,847 --> 04:24:15,615
What in the world's future

5614
04:24:17,663 --> 04:24:18,175
In 99

5615
04:24:18,431 --> 04:24:18,943
18

If you think the show you just heard is worth a dollar

5620
04:24:35,839 --> 04:24:37,375
Dan and Ben would love to have

5621
04:24:37,887 --> 04:24:38,655
Abacus

5622
04:24:38,911 --> 04:24:39,679
It's all we ask

5623
04:24:40,447 --> 04:24:44,287
Go to dancarlin.com for information on how to donate to the show

5624
04:24:45,055 --> 04:24:46,079
I'd like to apologize

5625
04:24:46,335 --> 04:24:47,359
A couple of things right off

5626
04:24:48,383 --> 04:24:49,407
The first thing is for

5627
04:24:49,919 --> 04:24:50,943
Silly little

5628
04:24:51,199 --> 04:24:52,735
Persnickety mistakes

5629
04:24:54,271 --> 04:24:57,855
You can probably tell special if you wait for these programs to be released as we make

5630
04:24:58,623 --> 04:24:59,391
But I'm a bit of a

5631
04:24:59,903 --> 04:25:01,439
Not when it comes to detail

5632
04:25:02,207 --> 04:25:08,351
And yet the people around me keep telling me that there's a certain failure rate that should be expected I'm not really good at accepting that is

5633
04:25:08,607 --> 04:25:11,167
Especially when I catch the errors before the show gets out

5634
04:25:11,679 --> 04:25:12,191
Nonetheless

5635
04:25:12,703 --> 04:25:16,287
This one will go out with me saying the word trenches

5636
04:25:16,799 --> 04:25:17,823
To describe

5637
04:25:18,079 --> 04:25:18,591
The

5638
04:25:19,103 --> 04:25:20,127
Kind of fortification

5639
04:25:20,383 --> 04:25:21,407
That the British Orion

5640
04:25:21,919 --> 04:25:22,943
Passchendaele end-of-course

5641
04:25:23,199 --> 04:25:23,967
NoHo

5642
04:25:24,223 --> 04:25:24,991
To be a much

5643
04:25:25,247 --> 04:25:28,831
Closer term I think trenches to those British soldiers would have been a luxury on

5644
04:25:30,111 --> 04:25:30,879
Nonetheless

5645
04:25:31,135 --> 04:25:33,183
Those are the piddly little things

5646
04:25:33,439 --> 04:25:39,583
It slipped through our strainer here even when we catch them so that these shows come out more than once a year which we are just

5647
04:25:39,839 --> 04:25:40,863
Barely beating that

5648
04:25:41,119 --> 04:25:43,935
Think right now heading toward once a year at this pace

5649
04:25:44,959 --> 04:25:49,567
So I apologize for the piddly little errors in the past the ones in this show any in the future

5650
04:25:50,079 --> 04:25:51,615
We try hard

5651
04:25:52,127 --> 04:25:52,639
We're not

5652
04:25:54,943 --> 04:25:59,039
The other thing I'd like to apologize for is for perhaps ignoring your favorite part of the story

5653
04:25:59,807 --> 04:26:00,831
Whatever that might be

5654
04:26:01,343 --> 04:26:03,647
Favorite region favorite Army a favor

5655
04:26:03,903 --> 04:26:05,183
People favorite event

5656
04:26:06,975 --> 04:26:08,511
Picking a topic like this

5657
04:26:08,767 --> 04:26:09,535
Is humbling

5658
04:26:10,559 --> 04:26:14,399
And you know it once again shows you some of the potential downsides with our leap

5659
04:26:14,911 --> 04:26:15,679
Before we look

5660
04:26:15,935 --> 04:26:17,983
Topic picking policy here on the program

5661
04:26:18,751 --> 04:26:23,103
Nonetheless I will forgive in advance from now on I promise I've learned my lesson

5662
04:26:23,359 --> 04:26:24,895
Every historian and author

5663
04:26:25,407 --> 04:26:28,479
Who talks too much about the Western Front at the

5664
04:26:28,735 --> 04:26:33,087
Expensive other areas of the first world war because you start to realize why that becomes important

5665
04:26:33,599 --> 04:26:34,623
This is a very confusing

5666
04:26:35,391 --> 04:26:36,415
There's alot going on

5667
04:26:36,927 --> 04:26:41,279
It would be so easy to go off in the weeds and lose everybody I have

5668
04:26:41,535 --> 04:26:46,655
But I'm worried about losing myself in the story you end up sticking to the Western Front and Russia and the United States

5669
04:26:46,911 --> 04:26:49,215
As a sort of an anchor to keep the story

5670
04:26:49,727 --> 04:26:50,239
You know

5671
04:26:51,263 --> 04:26:53,055
Clinging to some sort of structure

5672
04:26:54,335 --> 04:26:57,151
In some ways I think it's probably the week hosts

5673
04:26:57,407 --> 04:26:59,455
Answer to the problem on the other hand

5674
04:26:59,711 --> 04:27:01,503
Every time you introduce another theater

5675
04:27:02,015 --> 04:27:02,527
Another peep

5676
04:27:03,295 --> 04:27:03,807
And another

5677
04:27:04,319 --> 04:27:07,135
Norwegian and more names and individual

5678
04:27:07,647 --> 04:27:09,695
You make the story more and more confusing

5679
04:27:10,975 --> 04:27:12,767
The first world war is a giant

5680
04:27:13,791 --> 04:27:16,351
What's your getting here and I say this about all of our prayer

5681
04:27:16,607 --> 04:27:18,911
You're getting the Dan Carlin version

5682
04:27:19,423 --> 04:27:20,447
Of the first World War

5683
04:27:21,215 --> 04:27:24,543
And unfortunately that's leaving a lot of things out but I tell you what

5684
04:27:25,311 --> 04:27:25,823
As a

5685
04:27:26,079 --> 04:27:27,103
Friend of mine once said

5686
04:27:27,871 --> 04:27:29,151
Perhaps we should look at it as

5687
04:27:29,407 --> 04:27:30,175
Is just leaving

5688
04:27:30,431 --> 04:27:34,527
A lot more potential future Hardcore History topics available

5689
04:27:34,783 --> 04:27:35,551
Forest to handle

5690
04:27:36,319 --> 04:27:37,087
Down the road

5691
04:27:38,367 --> 04:27:39,135
Show

5692
04:27:39,647 --> 04:27:40,927
I'm going to make up some of the deaf

5693
04:27:41,439 --> 04:27:44,767
The things we haven't talked about and make up for some lost time in the Middle East

5694
04:27:46,047 --> 04:27:47,839
Are there are many things going on that

5695
04:27:48,095 --> 04:27:48,607
Create

5696
04:27:49,375 --> 04:27:51,423
In the beginnings of the modern world in the

5697
04:27:51,679 --> 04:27:54,495
Region including important foundational

5698
04:27:54,751 --> 04:27:55,263
Events

5699
04:27:55,775 --> 04:27:59,103
The lay the groundwork for the modern Recreation

5700
04:27:59,615 --> 04:28:00,895
The ancient state of Israel

5701
04:28:02,431 --> 04:28:04,223
In Russia we get to see

5702
04:28:04,991 --> 04:28:08,319
What an intellectual contagion that might be a good

5703
04:28:08,831 --> 04:28:09,343
How to describe it

5704
04:28:09,855 --> 04:28:15,999
Drop down into the middle of the very fertile petri dish that is provisional government Russia

5705
04:28:17,023 --> 04:28:23,167
Can do to a country like that is an answer to the question will perhaps arise as to whether or not an army can ask

5706
04:28:23,423 --> 04:28:24,447
Actually function

5707
04:28:24,703 --> 04:28:28,031
If the soldiers get to vote on whether they want to follow orders

5708
04:28:29,823 --> 04:28:30,847
And finally

5709
04:28:31,359 --> 04:28:32,383
Will get to see

5710
04:28:32,895 --> 04:28:33,663
The arrival of

5711
04:28:33,919 --> 04:28:35,967
US troops in large numbers

5712
04:28:36,479 --> 04:28:38,783
On the European continent for the first time ever

5713
04:28:39,295 --> 04:28:41,087
If I'm lucky and get what I want

5714
04:28:41,343 --> 04:28:41,855
We will get to

5715
04:28:42,111 --> 04:28:44,415
To delve a little bit into air power

5716
04:28:44,671 --> 04:28:45,183
How WeChat

5717
04:28:45,439 --> 04:28:47,743
Three-dimensional lysing battlefields in Al

5718
04:28:48,255 --> 04:28:50,047
That technological race

5719
04:28:50,303 --> 04:28:51,327
Is a little like

5720
04:28:51,583 --> 04:28:54,399
No Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and those guys were involved

5721
04:28:54,911 --> 04:29:01,055
And Technology back in 1960-1970 they might very well be in Airplane development

5722
04:29:01,823 --> 04:29:02,335
Geeks

5723
04:29:03,103 --> 04:29:03,615
These

5724
04:29:04,127 --> 04:29:05,663
Pilots in these planes are

5725
04:29:05,919 --> 04:29:06,431
You know

5726
04:29:06,687 --> 04:29:08,735
Have technological geek in half

5727
04:29:09,247 --> 04:29:10,271
Medieval Knight

5728
04:29:10,527 --> 04:29:12,319
We'll talk a bit about that if I get lucky and

5729
04:29:12,575 --> 04:29:13,855
I can make the time

5730
04:29:14,879 --> 04:29:15,647
And finally

5731
04:29:16,159 --> 04:29:17,183
We'll talk certainly

5732
04:29:18,207 --> 04:29:19,743
About the difference

5733
04:29:20,511 --> 04:29:24,351
When both sides are exhausted on the Western Front

5734
04:29:24,863 --> 04:29:29,983
That half a million to a million fresh troops can make and I'm not talking about American troops

5735
04:29:30,495 --> 04:29:32,543
I'm talking about the German soldiers

5736
04:29:33,055 --> 04:29:36,127
That arrived from the Eastern front to the Western Front

5737
04:29:36,639 --> 04:29:39,455
Can make on tired French and British armies

5738
04:29:39,711 --> 04:29:42,783
Before the Americans arrived in enough numbers

5739
04:29:43,551 --> 04:29:44,319
To make a difference

5740
04:29:45,855 --> 04:29:47,391
The last year of the war

5741
04:29:48,415 --> 04:29:49,183
Alyssa price

5742
04:29:50,719 --> 04:29:51,231
All that

5743
04:29:51,999 --> 04:29:52,511
And more

5744
04:29:53,791 --> 04:29:54,303
Compartes

5745
04:29:55,071 --> 04:29:55,583
A blueprint for a
