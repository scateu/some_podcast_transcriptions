Raging

I'm going to be in numeral

Heavily jungled Philippine Islands

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,368
And is told to do what he can to hamper Allied activities in the air

32
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,256
Continue fighting until he hears orders to the contrary by the commanding off

33
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,536
Officer who sent him on a mission

34
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,352
This Soldier

35
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,632
Kiro

36
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,168

Asian convention with switch that around that he'd be on the other hero

38
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:24,384
Will follow his orders until his commanding officer tells him he can lay down his weapon

39
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,968
He will eventually

40
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,784
Come out of the Jungle into a clearing

41
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,344
Hand over his sword

42
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:39,744
Standard attention while the guy who ordered him into that jungle in the first place formally dismisses him with honor

43
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,072
And this happened

44
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,608
On the 9th of March

45
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,912
1974

46

29 years out

49
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,592
After the second world

50
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,920
This guy had

51
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,200
Fighting

52
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,016
Shooting at being shot at

53
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,576
Killing and injuring the locals

54
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,112
30 years

55
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
29 to be exact

56
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,256
20 came out of the jungle

57
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,584
It came out with hundreds of rounds of ammunition

58
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,912
A well-maintained working rifle and Hand Grenades

59
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,496
The guy who

60
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,312
Dismissed him his commanding officer

61
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:29,664
I'm 29 years previously had to be flown in by the Japanese government

62
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,040
He was apparently a Bookseller or something in civilian life now imagine his surprise

63
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,696
When a government official shows up at his office isn't as yeah you know one of those soldiers you ordered into the Philippines 29 years ago

64
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,280
Yeah he's still in there and he won't come out unless you come and tell him it's okay

65
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,840
He was found

66
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:53,984
Officially by like a kid hippie kid is with the soldier called him or no to call him a hippie kid

67
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,056
Who said he was looking for a red summer city was looking for

68
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:00,640
Wild pandas meaning the existence of pandas in the wild

69
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,432
The Abominable Snowman

70
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
And lieutenant

71
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,736
Onoda

72
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,320
Lest you think

73
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:13,952
That this is a once-in-a-lifetime Robinson Crusoe shipwrecked kind of

74
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,232
Anomaly

75
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,791
Gyro on Northern

76
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:23,679
Is not the only Japanese World War II soldier that surrenders in 1974

77
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,727
There's another one

78
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,799
In 1972

79
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,823
There was one

80
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:35,455
There were two in the 1960s there were a bunch in the 1950s

81
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:41,087
And in the 1940s after the war ended sometimes whole units were still fighting

82
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:47,487
I believe it was almost three years after the war ended the unit of a couple of hundred of these Japanese soldiers

83
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,303
With their heavy weapons finally surrendered

84
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095
What the hell is that

85
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,655
Accounts for that

86
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:00,031
And it's not just the Philippines I mean it was happening on places like Guam for example

87
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:05,151
Saipan I mean there were people still running around the caves after the war and he will Jima

88
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,431
I mean it was

89
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,711
Fascinating

90
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,623
That what you saw here didn't happen in the other theaters of War because the other theaters of war did not in

91
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
Into the Japanese

92
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:17,951
One of the most

93
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,231
Fascinating

94
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,279
Interesting cultures on the planet

95
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:25,631
And what Japanese expert R Taggart Murphy calls

96
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:32,287
Unquestionably the most distinctive of all modern industrial societies culture-wise

97
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,127
I need is a fascinating example

98
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:40,735
Are we human beings can be molded and stretched and

99
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,295
Trimmed and shaped like a bonsai tree

100
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,111
Are the cultural influences into many different

101
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,903
Diverse versions of hours

102
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,927
Ourselves

103
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,767
Anyone who's a fan of National Geographic

104
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
Example

105
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:59,167
Seize the many different colorful cultures and subcultures all over the world write the extreme

106
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,959
Differences of humankind

107
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,263
And how wonderfully pliable we are

108
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,055
The cultural influences

109
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,103
Determine

110
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:11,711
How we like to dress what we think is attractive little marks of status all kinds of thing

111
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,527
Now magnify that

112
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:20,927
Buy all the eras humankind's ever been around right so not just a diversity of exotic different places all over the world

113
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,511
When was this place is all throughout history and you can see that we've

114
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,327
Well probably tried just about everything is this

115
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:32,959
BC's wouldn't you thinking and we seen all kinds of different extreme versions of what we can become a man take the physical version

116
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:38,335
I'm a fan of the people of the Eurasian steppe in those tribes as many of you know

117
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:42,175
Some of those tribes from time-to-time used to like to practice

118
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,711
Something on his head vine

119
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
It's one of the Counterpoint

120
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,527
Foot binding

121
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,295
China

122
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,087
Which was popular in some circle

123
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
Sometimes

124
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,671
To keep the feet small and to have them developed a certain way

125
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,207
Will same thing with head

126
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:59,839
You see this in other parts of the world to and sometimes cradles for example certain Native American tribes had cradles that we

127
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
Shape the head

128
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:07,007
A certain way to the point is is that when the skull is pliable when the person is Young you can shape that

129
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,311
And so like a bonsai tree if you will

130
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:13,407
And the Romans used to complain that the Huns look monstrous today

131
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,991
I remember growing up thinking while these Romans are really sensitive

132
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
Used to seeing some people who may be at

133
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,807
Slightly Asian feature

134
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,343
You're thinking about monsters

135
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:27,999
Well now we have skulls that have come out of the ground some of these tombs some of these kurgans were they buried some of these hands

136
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,303
And some of these ions have

137
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,071
Skulls

138
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,607
It look like they are

139
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,167
Taken right out of an alien movie

140
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:42,079
Big elongated skulls that go way far to the back you wonder what they must have look like with hair and skin

141
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:46,175
The point is is if you were a Roman looking at them you might have thought that they look

142
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,943
Monster

143
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,247
However if you were a young

144
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,295
Calmly Huntik noblewoman

145
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:55,391
You might have thought that guy looked hot so it's all a question right of

146
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
Are the cultural carrots

147
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
Dixon White

148
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,511
Sometimes it's not things

149
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,559
There are so visible on the outs

150
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
Side

151
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
I think we are ready

152
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,447
The vast majority of our makeup

153
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
In terms of our attitudes

154
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:15,359
And the way we think and the way we organize reality is probably going to be culturally

155
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
Determined

156
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,199
I am a fan of

157
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,503
Extreme situations in history

158
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
In the country

159
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,087
Mapreduce guys like hiroo onoda

160
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
Workstream

161
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,951
And the cultural carrots and sticks were designed

162
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,487
To take many

163
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
Of the

164
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:37,631
In a Civic attitudes that most societies considered to be positive

165
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
And

166
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
Turn them up

167
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,239
To such a high level on the dial of intensity

168
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,287
That they took a bunch of things

169
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,335
Might be considered good

170
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,639
In another context and made them dangerous

171
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,199
How can your culture

172
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,479
Impact things

173
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
Like

174
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,783
Duty

175
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
And honor

176
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
Patriots

177
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
And willingness

178
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,719
Sacrificing lay down

179
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
One life

180
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:07,327
For the greater good mean these are all things that most societies

181
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,863
You know what figure out

182
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,935
All sorts of cultural ways to encourage

183
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
How about just

184
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
Recognize

185
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,103
And take for example

186
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,383
A metal

187
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
Ceremony

188
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,247
It might happen in the United States written award citation

189
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:32,415
Somebody was extra Brave or extra heroic or did something out of the ordinary and maybe you get a medal and when you get the metal

190
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,487
The person giving the award will say something like you know for

191
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:41,119
Heroism or bravery or sacrifice above and beyond the Call of Duty

192
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,423
Above and beyond the Call of Duty

193
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,519
That right there was a recognition right that there are limits

194
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:52,895
To what normal people can be asked to do in normal times right

195
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,711
And if you exceed those expectations

196
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,015
Go above and beyond the Call of Duty you get a medal

197
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,087
What is the cultural heritage

198
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,623
Sticks in a given Society

199
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,671
Have evolved in such a way

200
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,231
So that there's almost

201
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:07,999
Nothing

202
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,303
That is above and beyond

203
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,327
Call of Duty

204
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,655
Where the culture expects

205
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,703
Encourages

206
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,007
And only approves

207
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:24,895
A level of sacrifice on the part of every man woman and child in that Society

208
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,711
The most other cultures Reserve

209
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,783
For their most elite military unit

210
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,183
Welcome to the world that famed Japanese holdout

211
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,743
Hiroo onoda was raised in

212
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,607
When another got back to Japan in 1974

213
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,655
Ghost written book of his

214
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
Remembrances

215
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,959
Was created

216
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,287
It's called No Surrender my thirty-year war and energy describes

217
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,103
The Japan he was raised in he says quote

218
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,943
At that time if a soldier who had been taken prisoner

219
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:05,087
Later managed to return to Japan he was subject to a court-martial in a possible death penalty

220
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,135
Even if a penalty was not carried out

221
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,439
He was so thoroughly ostracized by others

222
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,231
Then you might as well have been dead

223
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,303
Soldiers were supposed to give their lives for the cause

224
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,607
Not groveling enemy prison camps

225
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,703
General Hideki tojo's instructions for the military CID explicitly

226
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
He's not quoting

227
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
The instructions quote

228
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,383
He who would not disgrace himself must be strong

229
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,967
You must remember always the honor of his family and his community

230
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:35,039
Animas dry fervently to live up to their trust in him

231
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,599
Do not live in shame as a prisoner

232
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,927
Die and leave no ignominious crime behind you

233
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
And quote

234
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:48,607
When he leaves to go off to war one of the things he takes with him as a family dagger that his mother says

235
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,167
If your capture use this to kill yourself with

236
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,239
And I tried to think of any other

237
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,263
Mother

238
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:00,383
Sending her son off to war in any other major power in the Second World War

239
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,919
With that kind of advice

240
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,479
Interesting is a very distinctive different culture

241
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
Got some might have a counter on

242
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,855
I meant to this point

243
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:16,255
That the reason these Japanese holdouts were continuing to hold out was her duty honor country the emperor that sort of thing by pointing out

244
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,583
A bunch of these people said they didn't know the war was over

245
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:23,935
So maybe it's more of a sense of being isolated and not getting the news

246
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,263
But the counter argument to that has to do

247
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,543
With the fact that

248
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,407
These people were often told explicitly in many different ways that the war was over

249
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:37,503
And he chose not to believe it and they chose not to believe it because it clot with their

250
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,087
Elemental indoctrination into all this I mean for example

251
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,623
Hiroo onoda

252
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:47,487
He had family members flown in at high expense to the Japanese government because

253
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,023
Hiro Nakamura still chilling

254
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,071
In the Philippines

255
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:56,959
After the war right he's not just sitting up there in the mountains by himself not bothering anybody killed 20 to 30 Filipinos

256
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,775
So that makes you want to tell this

257
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,847
This person in no uncertain terms and spend a little money to make it happen

258
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,151
Hey you're killing people in the war is over

259
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,735
Believe that they left the newspapers here's how he puts it

260
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,527
In the book written

261
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
With him

262
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
Quote

263
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,415
The search party Left Behind newspapers and magazines

264
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,487
Most of them were recent and a lot of them contained articles

265
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,279
About the crown Prince's marriage

266
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,607
The newspapers which covered a period of about four months

267
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,911
Made a stack nearly 2 feet high

268
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,727
We we need to two other holdouts with him

269
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:35,615
We thought they were reprints of real Japanese newspapers doctored up by the American Secret Service

270
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,711
In such a way as to eliminate any news that the Americans did not want us to

271
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,479
Sissy

272
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,039
This was all we could think so long as we believe

273
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,855
The greater East Asia war was still going on

274
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,647
And in the way he writes

275
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:51,231
The newspaper has confirmed that the war was still going on

276
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,047
Because they told a lot about life in Japan

277
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,655
If Japan is really lost the war there should not be any life in Japan

278
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,447
Everybody should be dead

279
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,311
When I arrived in the Philippines in 1944 the war was going badly for Japan he writes

280
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:12,223
And in the Homeland the phrase 100 million Souls dying for Honor was on everybody

281
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,527
These lips this phrase meant literally

282
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:18,111
That the population of Japan would die to a man before surrendering

283
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:22,975
I took this at face value and I am sure many other young Japanese men my age did

284
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:29,375
He says I sincerely believed that Japan would not surrender so long as anyone Japanese remained alive

285
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,703
Conversely if one Japanese were left alive

286
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,495
Japan would not have surrendered

287
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,543
He continues

288
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:40,639
After all this is what we Japanese at all vowed to each other

289
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:46,527
We had sworn that we would resist the American and English Devil's until the last single one of us was dead

290
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:50,367
If necessary the women and children would resist with bamboo sticks

291
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,231
Trying to kill as many enemy troops as they could before being killed themselves

292
00:14:55,743 --> 00:15:00,351
The wartime newspapers all played this idea up in the strongest possible language

293
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,887
According some of the slogan

294
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
One was

295
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,471
Another was

296
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,775
The Empire must be protected at any cost

297
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,055
Another one was

298
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,871
100 million dying for the cause

299
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
He says quote

300
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,223
I was virtually brought up on this kind of talk

301
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
And quote

302
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,855
When another got back to Japan

303
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,695
Some of the things that I read in some of his later actions indicate

304
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,999
But he was less than happy

305
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,279
With

306
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:35,167
What had become of Japan after the war was over in terms of their National values their intensity level in what

307
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,495
Now I can

308
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,799
Speaker experience but in the 1970s

309
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,359
The rest of the world thought the Japan

310
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,663
Was still a very distinctive culture

311
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,455
And very committed to

312
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:51,295
Shall we call it the above and beyond the Call of Duty ethics

313
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,599
They seem very intense about that always

314
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,671
Something that they took very seriously they were known for in fact

315
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,695
Other people really

316
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:02,047
Like things like Japanese products because you knew that they were going to be intense about

317
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,167
You're getting it done right but to a guy raised by the standards of all known Azera

318
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:14,079
This was not good at they lost something and let me tell you what they probably lost and the rest of the world would consider this to be a good thing and I think

319
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,895
Modern Japanese wood for the most part 2

320
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,199
They weren't all prepared

321
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,503
Every man woman and child

322
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:26,111
To sacrifice themselves anymore to the level of your the world's greatest

323
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,903
Military units right

324
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:33,535
Act like Spartan hoplite die on command of the emperor like Spartan hoplites these people in the

325
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,351
Modern Japanese war were much more sensible

326
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,655
But in here all notice world

327
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,215
There's a level of insanity the

328
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,751
It's starting to happen in it

329
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,847
It's really complicated but it kind of explains why

330
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:51,711
The Japanese are this very distinctive different major power in the SEC

331
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
The world war

332
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:58,367
And why they're certain unique elements to the Pacific War against Japan that just wasn't present in the other theaters

333
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,903
Because I reset the Japanese word

334
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,463
Quick little run-down mighty

335
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,511
Explain some important things and by the way

336
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,535
Japanese cult

337
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:10,655
Culture is much debated as you would expect extremely complicated and definitely a place to be left

338
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,471
But let's just say

339
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,799
It was some pretty obvious things that we should take note of

340
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,615
That might help explain how you get such a

341
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
Distinctive

342
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,223
People and let me use the word here that I like I like the wording.

343
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,343
I will point out my stepfather's generation and he fought in the Second World War

344
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,927
He believed that this regime and this

345
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:38,303
Government in the society that turned out a guy like he wrote on Lota with turning out fanatic

346
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,607
Another word that was much used amongst

347
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:43,935
They are

348
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,983
Automatize near robot

349
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
And I should point out that

350
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,567
Wartime propaganda played into this but

351
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,639
Americans kind of had this image of both the

352
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:57,247
German opponent in the second world war and the Japanese opponent as robot

353
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,039
But different kind of robot

354
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,343
The German robot was like

355
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,391
The vision in The Avengers

356
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:07,743
Cold robotic mathematical deficient precise and deadly because

357
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,839
There's a coldness in a logical nature there

358
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:15,167
The Japanese is the other side of the robot specs

359
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,983
They're like foaming at the mouth crazy robot

360
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,263
They don't stop you have to

361
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:25,663
Did Littlefinger will come after you if you leave that alone and ready to die for the emperor excited to die for the emperor

362
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,991
Dora cartoon character that's extremely dangerous

363
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,551
The word fanatic is a wonderful way

364
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:38,207
To avoid having to look beneath the surface at any of the human motivations that might be bald red fanatic is just an A to B

365
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
Sony jerk

366
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,023
In terms of

367
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,327
You know the depth that they need to be examined

368
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,863
Real people

369
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,447
That might be extremely motivated or

370
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:54,591
Feel extreme pressure in societal and cultural coercion to do something for example fly

371
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:59,199
An aircraft piloted by then suicidally into an enemy ship

372
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,247
Those people might have

373
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,807
Some really interesting motivations to see

374
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575
Interesting

375
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,855
Points of view

376
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,135
Where they think they're doing

377
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,743
What sort of a range of options and choices do they think they have

378
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:16,095
This becomes a much more human story when we realize two things one

379
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,399
Any of us could have been born there

380
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,191
Is a certain randomness

381
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,471
Even if you believe

382
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:27,359
In Uno a DD selecting everything about you they could have selected that you end up in Japan in the 1920s

383
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,919
Go to school with Heroin OD

384
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,223
Besides that

385
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,039
There's a certain understanding

386
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,087
At what happened in Japan

387
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,927
Can happen again it will happen differently it never looks the same

388
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,231
But look at the elements involved

389
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:49,631
And wonder if you can't imagine them being filtered instead of three Japanese cultural filter the cultural filter of

390
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,911
Of your Society

391
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,751
But use the same way and turn to the same kind of uses

392
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,055
And maybe turning out the same kind of

393
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,359
Intensity

394
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:05,759
Did the Japanese really seem to exude all throughout the story telling me point out there's a wonderful phrase

395
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,575
That was used by a rabbi to describe

396
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,855
The Jewish people

397
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,135
Once but I love it

398
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:17,535
Because I think it's a wonderful shorthand phrase that applies to a bunch of different very distinctive people on the planet and the shopping

399
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,815
These are certainly one of those

400
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,863
Substitute the word

401
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
Choose

402
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,911
Would Japanese

403
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,703
The rabbi said

404
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,007
The Japanese are like anyone else

405
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,799
Only more so

406
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:33,407
Don't know if I got the exact wording correct with its but the line is perfect because it did notes

407
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,783
A level of intensity right they have all the same human qualities as you do they just have them at a higher intensity

408
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:45,183
You think you are a good Gardener and your garden looks down when you're done in a raking and taking care of it will go look at a Japanese

409
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,719
He's guarding you feel like you didn't do anything

410
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,767
Intensity with which state

411
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:52,095
They pay attention even to the little lines in the dirt I mean

412
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,167
What happens if you take this in

413
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,447
Density too far

414
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,007
Dial it up to high

415
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:03,871
Even if we're talking about being intense about are things that you normally

416
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,919
Considered to be positive today

417
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:12,063
Unless intense level mean your patriotism you got Duty. Love of country sacrifice for the Statham

418
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,391
All these things that so many people today we consider positives

419
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,672
How high do you have to

420
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,976
Turn the dial up on the intensity level though

421
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:22,816
I know we already have

422
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,840
I Want superhero run

423
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,424
They should have just happened in it but I got another one only cuz

424
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,240
The Japanese holdouts to me

425
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:35,104
Isn't that sort of like a Japanese version of the Captain America backstory

426
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:40,992
Right he goes he's a second world war person from the 40s gets put to sleep essentially get awakened

427
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:47,392
In the modern world and is continually contrasting in the last thing he should have remembered what in his mind

428
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:52,000
Like last week he was in the forties with the whirly finds now in the values and all these modern different thing

429
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:57,376
All these holdouts were like gone for decades aren't they all like Captain Japan's in that sense

430
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,960
I need the Japan of the 1970s.

431
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,496
Despite the rock music

432
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,544
The blue jeans in the longer hair

433
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,824
It would have been

434
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,384
On display for this Japanese war veteran

435
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,456
But the Japanese of the 1970s were still

436
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,528
Like everyone else only more so

437
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,392
But in the eyes of someone like oh nah that seems his attitude was not more so enough

438
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:25,536
Boston College a few things right away the first thing is it's one of the oldest

439
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,072
Tropes

440
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,096
In history

441
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,632
The people look back in

442
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:35,776
And pine away for golden age that they missed the really never existed and old people do this anyway

443
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,312
She probably got some of that go

444
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
Going on

445
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:42,688
Let me also say that I know from personal experience cuz it's the era I grew up in

446
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,344
But in 1974 there were a lot of World War II veterans from the United States of America that didn't look too fondly of

447
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,136
The direction American culture was going

448
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,160
Or think

449
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:58,048
The intensity level of Devotion to ideals like Duty and honor and patriotism self-sacrifice

450
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:01,376
Was strong enough in the American culture of those days

451
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,912
So in a funny way

452
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:06,752
These bitter opponents in the second world war the Japanese Imperial Army

453
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,776
And the US

454
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,056
In the military

455
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,896
We had something in common if they were reminiscing about the kids today

456
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,176
Give me the early

457
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,712
Timmy 1970s

458
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,552
And you're on the surface there does seem to be a little something different

459
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,576
Doesn't there

460
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:26,720
From the Japanese to the Allied perspective if you're pining away for the Golden Age

461
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,000
On the Allied side

462
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:32,096
You're pining away for the things that brought you victory

463
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,376
Right at the kids today

464
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,400
Mi amor

465
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:40,800
Honor patriotism Love & Country let you know what we could do great things remember we did in the war we won the war but the Japanese didn't win the war

466
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,384
The war was a tragedy for them on so many levels

467
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,200
So why would you look back on the values

468
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:51,552
The kind of made you the kind of country you were that you can fight a war like that

469
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,392
If that's what it led to

470
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,720
Well perhaps the devil's

471
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,256
Counter argument here

472
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,048
Is it yes while

473
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:08,704
These specific values and the intensity of the era on a scale of one to ten ten being most intense the

474
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,848
I need during the era hero another growing up in our a1011 and yes that got them into trouble eventually and led to

475
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,664
Japan's downfall is a great power

476
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:21,248
The counter argument that can be made is Japan never would have been a great

477
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,808
Had it not been for

478
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,624
The very specific

479
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,440
Active nature of the Japanese and let's understand

480
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,976
This is a people

481
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:35,328
Not quite unique but darn near unique in the.

482
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:39,936
Of colonial Domination by the colonial powers of the western world

483
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,472
It managed to avoid that

484
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,360
They did not avoid it because anybody was going soft on anyone else or because Japan wasn't day

485
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,640
Tempting targets

486
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,664
Snap up

487
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,504
They avoided it because they created the kind of society and Military

488
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,064
It made it impossible for somebody to snap

489
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,368
And they did this

490
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,208
Well coming from way behind in the technological race

491
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,816
You know most Miracle like fashion that I think and remember you are getting my little toe

492
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,632
For good or ill

493
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,704
The intensity of the Japanese character

494
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,752
Is in large part I think

495
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,032
A factor in this

496
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:23,200
You start talking about like National characteristics it gets very easily bleeds are usually in a weird

497
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,248
Racism

498
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,528
Stop but it's not

499
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,320
A Japanese

500
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,136
Racial thing that accounts for the way they are to cultural

501
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,464
Carrots and sticks but by the way full disclaimer here

502
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,000
It's going to be a lot of Race 2

503
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:40,608
Not because it matters to me or because I think it's important

504
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:44,960
Because it matters to the people in this story and they think it's important

505
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:48,544
The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries one of the high water

506
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,872
What's College Global racism

507
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,664
And the pseudoscience

508
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:59,040
Stop it and it will impact this story to give you just one example without going to depleted when they will be cases where

509
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
I will just take

510
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,832
White

511
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:04,928
Western Society don't use the terms that are popular with the time. Because that's going to keep

512
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,976
We use the terms of use

513
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,768
Contemporaneously

514
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,792
But they will be white

515
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,328
Military powers

516
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,352
That will get

517
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,888
Badly hurt

518
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:20,544
From Miss judging the capabilities of a non-white power simply because in racial terms they considered them

519
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,336
Kind of subhuman we don't have to worry about

520
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
About those people because

521
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,896
I mean listen we're White

522
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,664
In there

523
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,688
I think the word that you

524
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,968
Used for monkeys

525
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,040
And the payback for that car make lie

526
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,576
Is to get your rear end

527
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,624
Handed to you by a bunch of people

528
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,696
And we that you underrated because of some weird

529
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,976
Construct

530
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,768
A racial superiority

531
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,536
It warm

532
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,328
Your perception of reality

533
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,376
Of course you know what perception of real

534
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,144
Eventually

535
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,192
Meets the real reality in

536
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,008
There was some payback there more on that in a little bit

537
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:55,360
My point is we'll get to the racism thing and we'll talk about race cuz it matters in the story

538
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,896
It's very multi-racial

539
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,944
In an era that's very race

540
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,016
In this case though

541
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
How do you

542
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:09,184
Figure out you know who the Japanese are and why they are the way they are well first of all this is a subject for expert job

543
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,000
Obviously Japanese culture has been much debated even in the United

544
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
State

545
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,816
I remember the kid when they started

546
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,608
I'm selling a so much on cars

547
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,912
A fascination with this Japanese

548
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,728
Corporate culture in the way they did things

549
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,776
This is a much-talked-about thing

550
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,848
Per person like yours truly

551
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:31,712
I can only hit the big boys there are some obvious things that you can look at and go wow that must have effect

552
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,480
Did the story

553
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:37,344
I don't know how I don't know to what degree I don't know what mixes with the other factors but boy you can't ignore

554
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,416
Is a couple of those I want to get into

555
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,976
You're going to help explain how we get to where we are

556
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,560
Every society in the world right is a blend

557
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,096
I'm old and new

558
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,400
In the case of Japan

559
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:55,520
The proportion of old to new includes a lot more old than most places

560
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,824
This is by Design

561
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:01,152
And their history kind of consciously shows not just

562
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:01,920
Ave

563
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,736
Preserve this distinctive way of life

564
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:08,064
But how trying to preserve their distinctive

565
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,088
Culture

566
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:15,488
Can get them in trouble where they then need those qualities of intensity and everything we were talking about before 2.

567
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:19,072
Dig them out of a hole of their own creation is this interesting dynamic between

568
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:23,936
Are the Japanese wanted to remain distinctive that that causes problems that then their distinct tivity

569
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,728
Require them to help them get out of

570
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,032
Without going too depleted

571
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:28,800
Let me explain

572
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:29,824
A little of

573
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,592
The background

574
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,872
Big events

575
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:32,896
Raven

576
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,664
Reading

577
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,688
Japan for dummies

578
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,760
Hope you understand first of all we all get the idea

579
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:40,064
The geographically speaking

580
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,648
Japan has the opportunity to be different just because

581
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,696
There an island nation or in

582
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,464
Series about

583
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,024
Having that

584
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:55,168
Little bit of water that cuts you off from the mainland allows you at times sometimes depending on the situation

585
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,960
In a long time to keep

586
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:03,616
The Ebbs and flows and tides and sometimes the storms raging on the big continent away from your shirt

587
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:07,456
Now the fact that you are an island does not

588
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,736
Determine

589
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:14,880
In any way shape and form how you develop their lots of different ways you could go for lots of different reason to me take a look at something on a map

590
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,184
Theoretically should be pretty simple

591
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:21,024
Take a look at Japan on the map of them take a look at the British Isles

592
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,120
Theoretically these places should be somewhat

593
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,656
Now I guess your name

594
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,704
And yet

595
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,496
The Japanese will have

596
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:36,128
Periods in their history where they as much as possible try to limit contact with the outside world.

597
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,432
That's just the way they wanted to go for reasons that are

598
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,712
Understandable once we get in

599
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,760
And the

600
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,296
English and British

601
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:48,672
In a larger sense or just the opposite I would going country might be a good way to put it so outgoing

602
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,696
Dubai the time

603
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,768
And we're setting up the story we're getting into now

604
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:57,376
They directly or indirectly control a huge chunk of the globe

605
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,448
The Japanese culture is a

606
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,984
Of course ancient

607
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,520
Dates back to

608
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,056
Really early time

609
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,640
And the relationship

610
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,944
That probably has meant the most

611
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,576
In Japanese history to the development of that island nation is the one that they've had long-term

612
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,856
With China

613
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,904
Jupiter

614
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,232
Review stage if you ask a Chinese person they might say it's the Sun

615
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:28,608
Not a necessarily impossible to justify point of view either if you think about

616
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,448
In a China basically being the superpower of East Asia

617
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,264
Throughout most of human history except for

618
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,544
Certain period of time when it

619
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,824
Reaches certain low

620
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,432
Boynton power when does the civilization stock market dips for the Chinese stock

621
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,504
But most of the time in China

622
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,112
Of the world is at least as powerful as today's modern day China is

623
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,648
Things so stable

624
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,208
I had a Chinese history professor

625
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:54,976
Sad

626
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,024
But if you wanted to make an argue

627
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,328
You could perhaps a

628
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,608
The entire

629
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:04,192
Second world war and the Dupree second world war in Asia

630
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:08,288
Is a result of China's historic weakness

631
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,312
During that time

632
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,872
And it's interesting because if you think about

633
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,896
Modern-day China

634
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,432
Find a plugged into that era

635
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,736
You can't imagine any of that happening at all

636
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,272
Instead

637
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:23,904
The normal Powerhouse of the region the Jupiter is eclipsed in the time. Leading up to the Second World War

638
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,696
Which creates a vacuum

639
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:29,536
It like my professor said if you wanted to you could probably get a Beat

640
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,328
House on the paper where you try to

641
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,864
Tie that together with

642
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,912
The reason everything was happening

643
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,216
Right you have a vacuum in China

644
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,288
Very well

645
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,848
Territory that seems to be available

646
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,200
An era where the great powers of the world probably could be compared to a

647
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,992
Bunch of ravenous shark

648
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:54,112
Text looking to snap up an increasingly small and dwindling supply of yummy territories

649
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,184
Dark Horse

650
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,232
Later on in our story

651
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,024
In the case of the

652
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,304
Japanese

653
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,120
And a relationship to China

654
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,680
I had a buddy that compared it once

655
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:10,496
To a big brother little brother relationship

656
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,824
Which I thought was kind of compelling and he was just thinking he said

657
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,712
That China courses big brother in there for most of their early relationship little brother tags along

658
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:25,088
Learning from Big Brother pretending to be Big Brother emulating Big Brother

659
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:28,416
What are the certain point along the way they both

660
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,952
Mature

661
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:36,096
There Comes A Time in their relationship where little brother can reliably kick Big Brother's ass

662
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:41,216
And that changes the nature of the relationship somewhat

663
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,032
If you're looking at this though

664
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:50,176
To the wide-angle Longview length I think you have to save the relationship despite the occasional sibling spats

665
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,968
And pirate activity

666
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,504
Lesbian peaceful

667
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:58,368
A mutually beneficial especially beneficial if you're looking at this from the Japanese point of view

668
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:01,184
Because like all of China's neighbors they will benefit

669
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,976
It continually

670
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:07,584
Ending an ongoing fashion over the centuries from Chinese Innovations

671
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,400
Turn off the top of my head of me think about writing

672
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:15,264
That the Japanese taking convert to Japanese style but it's from China originally

673
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,824
Town of philosophical ideas

674
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:22,176
Governmental organizational chart template

675
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:28,832
Religious Concepts till the cows come home my goodness how about the most Japanese as I think about it insta

676
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:34,976
Tatoosh of all the emperor itself might be in Innovation taken from China may be as far back as like

677
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,280
7th Century ad

678
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:44,960
It's funny that was like all foreign Innovations the Japanese managed to take these things and turn them Japanese somehow

679
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:49,568
And waited instead of changing Japan's distinctive culture somehow is just

680
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,104
Woven into it

681
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:56,736
That would have been opportunities in history we shall call them historical close calls

682
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,296
In Japan could have fallen victim

683
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,832
To the same

684
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:06,208
Outcome that many wonderful distinctive cultures all over you raise your fell to it one time or another

685
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,000
Occasionally you get these great

686
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,816
Historical blending opportunities

687
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,352
Sometimes that occur against

688
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,656
The will of the people being Blended

689
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:18,496
And this will take those wonderful distinctive cultures and sort of homogenized

690
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,264
Anthem

691
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:23,872
Are you talkin about whiskey it's a blended sort of thing where the place like Japan is a wonderful

692
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,152
Distinctive single malt

693
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,432
Most of the times

694
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:32,576
A little bit of water separating Japan as we said earlier from being part of these great blending opportunities

695
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,880
But in the late 1200 you have a

696
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,672
Couple of close calls

697
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,952
The

698
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,744
Mongol conquest

699
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,048
Are going on in their blending

700
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:45,120
Cultures all over your razor with each other

701
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,656
Against their will

702
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:53,824
They will run out of room to conquer anymore in East Asia they run up against water eventually but you know the Mongo manifest

703
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,360
Best Destiny being what it is

704
00:34:55,616 --> 00:35:00,992
By the time chinggis Khan's grandson the great Kublai Khan is on the throne of China

705
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,296
The launch to amphibious

706
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,064
Assault

707
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,600
Over the waves

708
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,136
On Japanese Islands

709
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,184
Personal imagine that

710
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,232
Permanent light 1200

711
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:17,632
Tens of thousands of troops over the way then you don't just have to get him there he have to supply them the whole time they are

712
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,656
Are there

713
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:22,496
And for a significant amount of time and we were talking

714
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,776
Many weeks

715
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:30,688
The Japanese will fight these armies to a standstill with an absolutely ferocious defense

716
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,760
Now in the defense of Mongolia

717
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:38,368
Admire is everywhere this is not a Mongol Army as you would normally think of it most of it is

718
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:41,440
A bunch of Korean and Chinese auxiliary's were

719
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:47,328
Unscripted don't want to be there because after all their countries have been conquered by the same Mongols nonetheless

720
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:50,144
A ferocious defense to provides time

721
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,448
From Mother Nature to intervene

722
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,216
Twice

723
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,776
Let me tell you what your military history nut

724
00:35:56,288 --> 00:36:02,432
Looking at this battle shaping up I'm like a boxing fan who's bought the pay-per-view and it's very excited about this

725
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,456
Conflict only to have it

726
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:08,832
End in a Japanese Victory by disqualification due to kamikaze

727
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,600
Twice

728
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:13,696
The Kamikaze 4th famous divine wind wind of the Gods

729
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:18,560
Is wind that comes up and so badly damaged is this Mongo Chinese Fleet

730
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,584
Twice

731
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,656
Will have to call off the engagement go back home

732
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:27,008
When you think about what would have happened to this distinctive

733
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,104
Japanese culture and how it would have been strangled in the Cradle

734
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:37,504
Are the Mongols conquered Japan and homogenized and governed it with officials that might be from

735
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,112
45 different peoples I mean bringing a good old Russian governor

736
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:47,232
Took control Japan for a while to see what happens to that distinctive Japanese single malt whiskey

737
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:50,048
You know when you start adding all these other elements

738
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,352
So that's why it's an important historic

739
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:55,680
Does kamikazes of course the deciding factor

740
00:36:56,192 --> 00:37:02,336
But if the Japanese military can't hold off these mongeau forces as long as they did they never have time

741
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,872
Time for the weather to intervene

742
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:07,200
The key to the whole thing at Ground Zero

743
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:10,016
What's the Japanese organization in military

744
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,624
It was a cultural system one might call it

745
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,672
What inorganic system

746
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:17,696
That was

747
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,744
Similar and is often compared to the

748
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,560
Broad contemporary system in Europe

749
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:27,680
The Japanese during the Mongol Chinese invasion

750
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,752
At the same time when Europe was in a feudal stage

751
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:34,336
It's a really dicey subject I mean

752
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,384
A lot of people complain about

753
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:39,712
Trying to fit the square peg Japanese

754
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:43,808
Culture into the round hole of the European historic

755
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,832
Circle template Amin

756
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:45,856
The context

757
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:49,184
Two things like Knights and feudalism in European context

758
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,864
The problem is it's the best analogy for Europeans understand the situation in shorthand even with all the problems attached to

759
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,960
You could say both Europe and Japan

760
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,776
Starting to explore the early ideas

761
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,080
Statehood in that kind of thing

762
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,872
Both cultures

763
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:11,456
With a hereditary warrior class that made up

764
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,248
An aristocracy

765
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:17,088
That had a bunch of Fighters who has individuals

766
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,904
Compete for the title of most

767
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,208
Dangerous Warrior of all time

768
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:22,976
Right

769
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:26,304
If you are military historian buff where would you place

770
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,328
Samurai

771
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,656
For the Japanese Army

772
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,192
For hundreds of years

773
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,752
Cutting Edge the same way that Knights were in Europe

774
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:38,336
Hard to not play Samurai in the top 10

775
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,872
Lot of people make an argument

776
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,152
The top five

777
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,944
I think you have to put

778
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:47,040
Samurai on the top 10 list based on a real alone

779
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,600
I don't think he's ever been in army

780
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:54,976
It's had higher morale than what Samurai bring to the table me even Knights who I love

781
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:58,816
And who will fight to the death mean happens all the time

782
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,096
But not usually

783
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:03,168
Usually when you kill enough nights they route

784
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,240
That's an unusual thing to happen to Samurai

785
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,824
They are more willing to die

786
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,848
Then perhaps

787
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,152
Any other troop type you can think of

788
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:18,272
And if you find truth that are as willing to die usually it's a small group of special Elite

789
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:23,648
Run usual fanatical people in the beserker is over in the old Scandinavian armies or what have you

790
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:26,720
This is a huge chunk of any Japanese Army

791
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:30,048
Now one of the best comparisons I think

792
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:30,816
The Dust

793
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:34,144
Fat when you start saying okay what's similar about Knights and Samurai

794
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,704
Is that the real

795
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,472
Thing 1

796
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,752
Comes to these kind of warriors

797
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,312
Where's the real deal as they were in history

798
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,592
Is

799
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,360
Different

800
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,384
Then the way

801
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,248
They were romanticise later and we all get this I mean think about King Arthur for a min

802
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,296
And courtly love

803
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:57,952
Ingesting and the Holy Grail I'm in think of that kind of The Sword in the Stone think of the romanticizing

804
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,816
What was certainly I mean if you're comparing the Knights of the Round Table

805
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,840
You don't even in the

806
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:06,400
Late 19th century Works to something like

807
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,936
Real Knights

808
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,008
Will think about how much the reality differs from the

809
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,800
Romantic

810
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:17,408
The samurai had the same situation going in the 1400 and 1500

811
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:21,248
This is the Golden Age of Samurai War

812
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,040
Not the Golden Age of Samurai

813
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,856
The Golden Age of the real thing Warfare

814
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,392
The greedy

815
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,672
Bloody

816
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,208
Grimy

817
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,256
Horrible

818
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,280
And what lies Beyond it

819
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,328
Venal sometimes

820
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,888
Warfare that is the real thing

821
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:43,520
Can you have Samurai who fight all the time during this. Because there's a lot of War sometimes you're

822
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:46,848
Fighting the Chinese like we said but most of the war with other Japanese

823
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,640
Armies and with other Samurai

824
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,200
There were hundreds of thousands of these guys

825
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,992
And they fought a lot

826
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,624
The late 1500s there will be a lot of

827
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:01,440
Japan is in the process of some very big Wars

828
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,000
It will lead up to a big bottle

829
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,280
Famous II

830
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,304
ARA battle

831
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,864
In 1600

832
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,888
I think it was like a hundred

833
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:12,192
70000 people supposed to be there

834
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,752
And when one side beat the other

835
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,360
It it was the big pushover capsize moment when Japan

836
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,384
Kind of gets yunnan

837
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,992
That's a very quick sounding process the way I said it

838
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:29,344
But that battle tips things over to a point where you get a new government that

839
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,624
Unites Japan

840
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,440
The government is called

841
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,976
Tokugawa shogunate

842
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,536
Sometimes referred to as the

843
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,560
Bakufu

844
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,608
Hope I mispronounce that name properly I'm leaving

845
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,376
I did

846
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,936
Not as the name implies the

847
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:47,520
Country is nominally run by something called a Shogun

848
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,848
Translate it off and then when generalissimo

849
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,919
Military dictator a hereditary usually

850
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,199
Military dictator

851
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,015
Japan's history look at a timeline

852
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:00,063
Glittered with the shogunate

853
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:04,671
And when the Shogun is running the show The Emperor as a figurehead

854
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,463
Now

855
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,511
Dictionary may say that the

856
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:14,655
Shogun runs things but in reality he's dealing with a bunch of local Lords people called I'm Yours

857
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,959
Japan during this time.

858
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,727
What happened

859
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:21,055
About roughly two hundred separate little areas

860
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:27,711
And eat one of these areas has its local Lord and they raise their own taxes they raise their own military forces they owe Allegiance

861
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:31,295
To the central government but they have broad ranges of power

862
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,599
Deal with everything in their own domain the wrong way

863
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,647
You can see why maybe people can be forgiven

864
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:41,023
For applying the feudalism tag to that because on a Surface my blood kind of looks that way doesn't it

865
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:45,375
The entire. Is sometimes known as the Edo.

866
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,679
Heat up in the old name for Tokyo

867
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:50,495
And that are relaxed nearly 1600 still like

868
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,031
1868

869
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,335
SM 250 years

870
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,639
Going to leave a mark

871
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,943
Culturally speaking wouldn't you think

872
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,527
And the fact that it's going to go on until the time

873
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:07,903
Of Hebrew on noda's parents or grandparents means it's going to leave a mark

874
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,439
It persists

875
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,487
Even on the soldiers fighting

876
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:15,583
For Japan in second world war influential.

877
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,935
I'm part of the reason so influential is it's a Time

878
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:23,007
Where the cultural head binding is

879
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,799
Particularly tight

880
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,591
And the

881
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,383
Edo period Is known

882
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:32,735
As I would suggest a double-edged sword a good and bad kind of thing

883
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:38,879
On the good side in the early 1600 I'm not sure there's a cleaner place to live than Ito Japan

884
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:41,183
Entering mild germaphobe like myself

885
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:46,559
Probably the only place I could go back to in the time machine if I had to run away from the present and take refuge in the past

886
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,607
Or wouldn't be totally freaked out

887
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,655
Pretty safe

888
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,191
Very safe

889
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:56,287
Compared to most other cities of its size around the world at that time.

890
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,359
Pretty darn literate

891
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,455
Very artistic population flourishing

892
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:08,575
But it also has a level of cultural repression

893
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:14,207
That it would be difficult for modern people living in the Free World anyway

894
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,743
To put up with

895
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,559
In one story and I was reading

896
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,583
I said that

897
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,119
Edo Japan has

898
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:24,447
Most of the features in embryo

899
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,263
Of a totalitarian type state

900
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:31,359
Can we nearly 1,600 including things like thought police

901
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:35,455
One of the things they cracked down on his people who

902
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:41,855
Aren't particularly happy staying in their place they will lock in a system that keeps people in their place

903
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:44,415
They're all about the status quo

904
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,975
And if you violate that

905
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:50,303
The repression can be particularly harsh they will

906
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,119
Innocence weed-out malcontents

907
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,935
People that cause trouble and particularly

908
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:58,495
Nonconformist types

909
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,311
I should point out

910
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:04,383
If we are comparing early Tokugawa Japan

911
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:08,223
Two other countries in a free sample go to the west and see what they're doing

912
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:14,367
Are totally up in your intellectual business day or two

913
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:19,487
Heresy trial and you don't have freedom of speech, freedom of thought

914
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,047
So not that different

915
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,095
Nearly 1600 but

916
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:28,191
Over the entire course of the Tokugawa shogunate

917
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,007
Things are going to change on the other side of the world

918
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:33,055
And by Design

919
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:36,127
They're not going to change anywhere near as much in Japan

920
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:44,063
Now the reason that this. Is particularly harsh on internal dissent and free thought and all that

921
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,903
Have to do with the priorities of the bakufu

922
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:53,791
Because they are less concerned about some foreign Invasion coming from Eurasia like a bunch of Mongols or something

923
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:57,631
Then they are about somebody domestically overthrowing them

924
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,703
They're kind of afraid of the Common People

925
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:04,287
You're getting weird foreign ideas in their head that make them uppity

926
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:08,639
They're also afraid of people like themselves other

927
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:12,479
Samurai because history shows that they're the most dangerous

928
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,503
Class 2

929
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:16,063
Fear if you are the ruling Elite

930
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,879
And your own people at the most likely to kill you

931
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:23,231
Some peaceful Society with no outside threat

932
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:28,095
Patoka gallons are worried about something happening domestic

933
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,679
The Japanese are worried

934
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:38,591
About dangerous for an ID is undermining their society interrupting their population

935
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,359
Meaning of astray

936
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,151
Might be the way they would put it

937
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,455
And they're answer to this

938
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:47,295
Is to close Japan to the rest of the world

939
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,855
That's what the Tokugawa

940
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,647
Are famous for

941
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,671
Of course

942
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:57,535
That's not really what they did but when I was growing up that's the way the history books put it in

943
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,583
Astoria Mary's B Jensen points out that

944
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,863
It's a sign of the

945
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,935
UF ethnocentricity of that error

946
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:09,567
But you would think that closing trade with the West is the equivalent of cutting yourself off in the entire world

947
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,687
Did the Japanese still most of the time trade with China and Korean places like that but in an attempt

948
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,503
To keep Japanese Society

949
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:21,087
I'm being polluted with these outside intellectual contagions

950
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,183
They will shut down trade with most of the rest of Europe

951
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,975
Overtime

952
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,511
Image should be pointed out

953
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:31,583
But nonetheless that's how they're going to try to address some of their

954
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,863
Worried about

955
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,167
Population getting uppity in agitated

956
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:40,031
The other thing the Tokugawa have to get a handle on and that they're known for

957
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:43,871
Is solving the samurai problem that they inherit

958
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,407
After all

959
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:51,807
If you are famous is the Tokugawa are for bringing peace to Japan maybe for the first time in a sustained way

960
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,087
In hundreds of years

961
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,903
What do you do with all the professional Warriors

962
00:47:56,415 --> 00:48:01,279
Better part of the hereditary aristocratic warrior class whose entire

963
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,583
Role in society

964
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,375
Is to be the fighters

965
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:09,215
You know any time of widespread sustained

966
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,495
Peace

967
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,823
It's actually a big problem

968
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,615
And there's a lot of economic

969
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,151
Points that are brought into the

970
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:19,711
Say something like

971
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:24,831
Well this is an economic class now that have nothing to do but they suck up an enormous amount of resources

972
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,855
Blah blah blah

973
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,415
Are Jack Murphy had the best thing I ever saw

974
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,951
When he was discussing

975
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,743
Let's call it the Human Side

976
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,023
You think about you

977
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,303
I can totally see that

978
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:38,143
It's the problem of having a bunch of people

979
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,423
To grow up

980
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:44,287
Emulating the great warrior Deeds of their Samurai ancestors

981
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:47,359
Who trained for war all the time

982
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:50,687
Whose whole point in the society is as a warrior

983
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,991
Never get to use their skills

984
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,015
Anybody who spent

985
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,039
5 minutes

986
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,599
In a martial art knows the feeling

987
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:01,695
I'm wondering as you sit there and practice even the most basic rudimentary moves

988
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,231
I wonder what this would be like

989
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,255
Real situation

990
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,559
Imagine what these young

991
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:09,119
Murphy doesn't use the term but it's implied

992
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,167
Testosterone-fueled

993
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,447
Ambitious

994
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:14,495
Young Japanese people

995
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:17,823
Only want to achieve what their ancestors have achieved

996
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:22,431
Their ancestors lived in a wartime environment they live in a peacetime environment

997
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:24,735
Imagine how well the idea of

998
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:28,575
Idle Hands Are The Devil's tools works for them

999
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:32,415
So they had to have and one of my history had a great way of putting it

1000
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,207
They had had their energies

1001
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,231
Redirect

1002
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:42,143
Into another part of society what were you going to do with all these Samurai how are you going to justify the cost to society get them another job

1003
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,471
And the tokugawa's take this warrior class

1004
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,519
Any put them in the bureaucracy

1005
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:51,615
And they start having them do management job they become the

1006
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,663
So the organs of the state

1007
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:58,527
And the part is kind of interesting to our story is

1008
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,599
They kind of do it in a way

1009
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:05,439
The implies or mandates I don't know what the right term is

1010
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:08,767
Did they take their Samurai values

1011
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:11,071
With them into their new job

1012
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,167
Weirder than that though because

1013
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:17,727
It's during this. Now that the samurai don't

1014
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,007
Fight anymore

1015
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:23,871
Did they actually kind of double down on the ethical standard they get more concerned

1016
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,151
Moron

1017
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,687
More militaristic

1018
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,527
Part of it is because they're romanticizing the early

1019
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,551
Yourpassnow

1020
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:37,183
They actually think that these Samurai they Admire from the warrior. Had higher ethical standards and they really did

1021
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,975
And I'm going to try to live up to those

1022
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,047
Qatar tiger Murphy

1023
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:42,815
He says about

1024
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:45,631
That Paradox in the fact that Hey listen

1025
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:46,655
The warrior at the

1026
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:50,239
That worked well on the battlefield will work well in the bureaucracy

1027
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,519
He writes in his book

1028
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,055
Japan and the shackles of the past

1029
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,127
There was in fact

1030
00:50:56,383 --> 00:51:00,479
Hardly any occasion for Samurai to put their martial training into practice

1031
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:05,599
Are the actual experience of battle receded Into The Mists of History

1032
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:10,719
The ethos of the Samurai became paradoxically Evermore rigida militaristic

1033
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:14,047
With stress on absolute loyalty to the superior

1034
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,631
Preparedness to carry out any order even at the risk of death

1035
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:20,703
And it just staying for softness and physical comfort

1036
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:21,727
And quote

1037
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:23,775
He continues

1038
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,311
Later quote

1039
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:29,407
But it was not just the austerity the whole Samurai ethic

1040
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:32,479
The disciplined unquestioning response to any order

1041
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:36,831
The personal rectitude in contempt for moral or physical laxity

1042
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:43,231
Just as well to shape a compliant bureaucracy as it had originally done to form of vigorous military

1043
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,511
And quote

1044
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,071
Obviously

1045
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:51,679
There's an incongruity here though over the stakes involved in different environment

1046
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:55,775
And if you're right. Opting an intensity level that seemed apropos to

1047
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:58,847
A battlefield environment situation where people could die

1048
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:01,919
Is life-or-death here if you don't follow your honour duty loyal traditional

1049
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:02,943
Stop

1050
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:09,087
And now expect those same kinds of standards of intensity to apply to a situation that is not life or death

1051
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,879
You can recreate a little

1052
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,903
Incongruity there

1053
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:17,535
And if those were never even really the standards in the days that you were admiring anyway

1054
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:19,071
That makes it even more unreal

1055
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:19,839
Doesn't it

1056
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,423
Are we sending the 14th

1057
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,727
The Golden Age of Samurai

1058
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:26,495
Fighting

1059
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:30,591
But the 1600 in the 1700 of the golden age of creating the

1060
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,359
Fleshed-out

1061
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,127
Samurai

1062
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:32,895
Eye of mythal

1063
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,455
He's not just a warrior he's a

1064
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,479
Confucian scholar

1065
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:41,343
Literate ethical judge of the rest of the Common People

1066
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,623
He's a poet

1067
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,927
A flower arranger a calligraphy

1068
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,463
And many other things

1069
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,279
If you want to look at this from

1070
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:51,071
Class perspective Mary's B

1071
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:55,679
Jensen has an interesting line suggesting that some of the non Samurai people living in Japan

1072
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:57,215
Might have seen them more like an

1073
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,495
Occupying

1074
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,519
Army

1075
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:02,591
Let's stay generation after generation

1076
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,895
Counterweight look at it

1077
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,479
Is worth pointing out the other

1078
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:11,295
The samurai had many different grade

1079
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,319
Ranks

1080
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:15,903
And at the top ranks these are the guys were like running the country the big Power

1081
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:16,671
Samurai

1082
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,207
We're never going to have to worry

1083
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,743
Society

1084
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,791
What is the Bottom Rung of Samurai

1085
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,583
Those people can be practically

1086
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:28,703
Or just keeping their head above water now you put them into the Japanese version of the DMV job

1087
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,727
And

1088
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,519
Life is tough with these people

1089
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:36,639
Squeezing them and it doesn't feel so special to some of them to be samurai anymore they certainly off and don't remember

1090
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:38,943
Too much how to fight I read a quote from somebody

1091
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,223
Writing in the yard

1092
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:44,575
18 out of 10 the samurai Aurora's wicked women now they just sit around and do nothing

1093
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,367
Internal martial training at all

1094
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:51,487
The expectation level on conduct could be

1095
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,767
Life or death

1096
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:55,583
Are you one of the things that we maybe should do with real quickly here is the

1097
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,351
The Japanese

1098
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:58,655
Propensity and you'll see it on display in the Second World War

1099
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,423
All the time

1100
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,447
For suicide

1101
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,751
This also can probably

1102
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,031
Be traced back in large

1103
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:06,591
Hard especially the military version of this to the samurai

1104
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:09,919
Where a battlefield ethic might

1105
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:10,687
Acquire you

1106
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:13,759
To do something. Extreme in some situations

1107
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,575
It gets looking a little fanatical wanted

1108
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,599
It's applied to situations

1109
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,391
Nowhere near that extreme

1110
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:23,999
What started as a ritual sounds to me more like an alternative

1111
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:27,839
If you happen to be a samurai to having a much more terrible

1112
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:31,167
An execution carried out on you cuz you broke some big rule

1113
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:33,983
So you could kill yourself instead what started out like that

1114
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:39,615
Overtime blended into more and more the society especially the military but even civilians Society

1115
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,407
How intense is that

1116
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,711
As we said here or not his mother

1117
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,735
When he takes us

1118
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:45,503
A dagger

1119
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:47,039
I promised houses

1120
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:47,807
Kill yourself

1121
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:48,575
With this if you can

1122
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,343
Get captured

1123
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,391
How extreme is that

1124
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,415
How does that

1125
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,207
Factoring the society

1126
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:56,767
Are tiger Murphy points out that for a lot of the history of

1127
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:57,535
Japan

1128
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:00,095
The average Japanese farmers were thought that was nuts

1129
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:02,143
It's a samurai thing weird nuts

1130
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,679
Somehow it goes from

1131
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:08,543
That place where it's only Samurai who do this to a place in the second world war where you see it quite a bit

1132
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,103
Seppuku is the official

1133
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,383
I think name of the ritual

1134
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:14,175
Harry Caray

1135
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,455
Vulgar

1136
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:16,991
Stomach sleeve

1137
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,783
Oh that's what the Allied

1138
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,343
You'll see this in the Second World War

1139
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,879
Commonly enough

1140
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:25,695
That it once again remind you okay

1141
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:29,023
This Japanese great power anime in the second world war is different

1142
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,047
From all the other

1143
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,327
In combat

1144
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,375
Who else does this

1145
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:34,655
Regularly

1146
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:39,263
Now in terms of what the Tokugawa unsworth

1147
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,287
Afraid of

1148
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,847
From other countries cuz they ever said will be known

1149
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:43,615
Closing

1150
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:46,175
They don't really close that they begin to choke off

1151
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:46,943
Trade with the

1152
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,991
Eventually they will get to the point

1153
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:53,087
Weather down to trading with one Western power the Dutch

1154
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:56,671
And it got the Dutch isolated in one port Nagasaki

1155
00:55:57,183 --> 00:56:00,767
And eventually they build a little man made Island right off the coast

1156
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:07,423
And it connected to the mainland with a little ramp and a samurai guarding the ramp it's basically you have to show your papers if you want to enter

1157
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,447
Raku Japanese

1158
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,727
On the mainland

1159
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:15,871
Any kind of thing but like the number one intellectual contagion the Tokugawa rulers are worried about his Christianity

1160
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,175
And there will be a big

1161
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,199
Purge

1162
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,223
Christians

1163
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:21,503
Really bloody

1164
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:24,575
That will go on early on in the Tokugawa era

1165
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:27,647
The problem with the Japanese had with Christianity

1166
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:29,951
Is the same problem that a lot of other

1167
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,999
Places of had with it I mean look at how

1168
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:35,583
The problem with it free sample before Rome went Christian

1169
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:38,399
It says just like Judaism

1170
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,191
By the way that there is a

1171
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:43,263
Lord that is Supreme Over the

1172
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,799
Earthly Authority

1173
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:49,663
Certain kinds of Emperors have problems with that right

1174
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,223
In Japan

1175
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:58,111
Problem that the Tokugawa and saw his listen your loyalty is to your daimyo your lord

1176
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:03,487
Or to the Shogun or your parents Army there's a whole confusion hierarchy here people

1177
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,535
They're going to be part of the

1178
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,583
List of people you all your

1179
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,423
Allegiance to and your loyalty to and your Devotion to

1180
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:16,799
And there's no place for some Christian God at the top of the food chain here so it's a threat

1181
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:23,967
It's hardly the only one but it's the most visibly obvious one and it's something that bothers

1182
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:26,271
The Shogun and his

1183
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:29,087
Can Patriots about the Europeans entirely

1184
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:35,743
You think they would get confused too they would ask a lot of questions about Protestants and Catholics and try to understand the enemy just eventually they were so

1185
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:38,303
Usually just basically said a pox on both your houses you're all out

1186
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:42,655
But think of all the stuff Japan misses

1187
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,191
Because it's not

1188
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:48,031
Not engaging fully with the rest of the world in the European powers

1189
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,359
I mean just off the top of my head there missing the enlightenment

1190
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:52,639
The

1191
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:59,039
French and American Revolutions Industrial Revolution Napoleon the Revolutions of 1848 Marx all this stuff

1192
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,343
And remember

1193
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,135
These things are tsunami

1194
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,671
In places like

1195
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:08,255
Social Revolution up Keeble's Big War

1196
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,327
The only thing you can say

1197
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:14,655
For the way the people experience them at the time that they happened

1198
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:18,495
Is that at least they got them one at a time usually

1199
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:20,031
And in the right order

1200
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:23,615
So sometimes you have time to recover from one tsunami bomb

1201
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,895
For the next one hits you

1202
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:25,663
Time disorder

1203
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:30,271
Incorporating absorb the lessons or what have you from that era

1204
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:34,367
But when Japan eventually will have to join the rest of the world

1205
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:37,183
They're going to get all that stuff at once

1206
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,231
Out of order

1207
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:41,791
And they're not going to have build up

1208
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:45,119
Any intellectual immunity or resist is there going to be like the

1209
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:49,727
People in the Americas it first Contact were with actual contagions

1210
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:54,079
But was intellectual ones at least that's how the Tokugawa bakufu

1211
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,103
Would see it

1212
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:59,967
This is a theoretical problem the Japanese writers and what not erect

1213
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:00,991
Talking about

1214
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,295
In the 1800's

1215
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:09,951
As the bakufu in the Shogun night gets a little rickety it's getting to be a kind of an old system of government it's not really doing the greatest

1216
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,487
Job a lot of people maybe think

1217
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:16,095
But in the middle 1850s would have been theoretical happen

1218
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,631
Western Fleet

1219
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:18,911
Shows up in

1220
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:21,215
Japan's Harbours and basically says

1221
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:22,751
You don't get to stay

1222
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:23,775
Closed anymore

1223
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,823
Stories by the way like

1224
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,103
Call Vista policies.

1225
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:27,871
Occlusion

1226
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:34,271
Because it doesn't really mean close but basically to the people who showed up in Japan in the 1850s this is an American Fleet

1227
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,039
By the way

1228
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,319
Commodore Matthew

1229
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,087
Q Perry

1230
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,647
And as far as he's concerned they're closed

1231
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,927
And it's going to stop

1232
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,207
So they will be

1233
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:45,535
Two visits by Matthew Perry over like a year or two

1234
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:53,727
During this time Japan will be open to the so-called they were never really close so they can never really be open but those are the terms

1235
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:54,751
How many of us grew up with

1236
00:59:55,519 --> 01:00:00,127
And this is a an act that is sometimes thrown into the gunboat diplomacy

1237
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,431
By the way to Japan didn't necessarily want to do

1238
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,199
Do this

1239
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:07,551
Just as an aside one of my favorite historical Twilight Zone moments

1240
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:10,879
Is the one that military storing windeyer

1241
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:11,647
Your paints

1242
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:13,183
When he talks about you know

1243
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,231
Matthew Perry's Fleet from

1244
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:19,583
What is just a few years before the US Civil War showing up in finding

1245
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:25,727
A completely medieval kind of people and Military awaiting him sort of on the shoreline

1246
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:29,055
Dyer says there were no guns

1247
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:32,895
Mary's B Jensen says they were guns but makes it sound like they were

1248
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,687
It taken out of a museum

1249
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,735
And so when Perry shows up

1250
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:41,087
He sees a society where they all have like swords and Spears and body armor in that kind of

1251
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,927
That's a pretty cool contrast right

1252
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:47,999
Unless of course you're looking at it from the Japanese

1253
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,279
Decide because when

1254
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:53,631
The rest of the world west shows up in forcibly opens Japan

1255
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,655
Open linear quote

1256
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,447
Japan finds out how

1257
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,727
Outgunned it is

1258
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,775
So outgunned

1259
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:06,175
But it can't stop these I mean if your japanese's foreign barbarians from imposing their will on Japan

1260
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:11,039
And they will quickly it won't you be the United States everybody kind of comes in.

1261
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:16,159
I didn't realize you Pam was open for business. Let's throw some unequal treaties their way of the same kind

1262
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:18,463
Recently foisted on China

1263
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:22,559
And I think it's safe to say that by

1264
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,607
1860

1265
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,655
You see in Japan that is

1266
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:28,703
Potentially on the road to being

1267
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:30,495
A colonial victim

1268
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:36,639
This inability to resist one of the great powers

1269
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:37,663
Great power during this time

1270
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,431
Call Emma

1271
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:40,479
Aceq higher second-tier power

1272
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,247
Find this time.

1273
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,551
The inability of Japan to resist

1274
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:45,599
That was almost like the straw that breaks the

1275
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,367
The camel's back

1276
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,391
For the show tonight

1277
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:50,207
They were already kind of rickety certainly

1278
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:52,767
Finding it tough to evolve its 200

1279
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:53,535
50 year old

1280
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,815
I'm basically if

1281
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,631
An old human being

1282
01:01:57,887 --> 01:02:01,215
And so not being able to defend Japan's interests with sooner

1283
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:04,799
Over a period of years the end of the line for them

1284
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,639
The next government in Japanese history

1285
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:15,039
Is never going to forget the job one is make sure you can defend Japan's territory and entry

1286
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,319
Stan culture

1287
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:22,719
What happens after the Tokugawa shogunate are in Japanese history is known as the Meiji restoration

1288
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:27,071
Meiji by the way the name of the emperor during this time.

1289
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:30,399
Restoration refers to the way this whole thing is going to be build

1290
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,423
It's a

1291
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:36,799
In a story that is akin to Tokens The Return of the King but this is the return of the emperor

1292
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:38,335
In effect

1293
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:43,711
Acknowledging the fact that under this military dictatorship the emperor really hasn't been in charge

1294
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,759
This explains why everything's going to hell

1295
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:52,159
Handbasket so we will return things to the way that they're supposed to be in harmony with the universe back to the gold

1296
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:55,231
The emperor runs things again which the emperor may not have

1297
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:56,255
I've ever done

1298
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:57,535
And certainly

1299
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,839
During the trees with the emperor didn't do this they were

1300
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:04,959
Unusual in in the distant past but nonetheless sounds good to everybody right put the emperor in charge

1301
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:09,567
How much the emperor's actually running things versus how much these new

1302
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:13,919
Mostly Samurai class oligarchs are running things is unclear

1303
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:15,967
But they were powerful dynamic

1304
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:16,735
Individual

1305
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:23,135
Who are part of this new wave of Japanese reformers who take over the government

1306
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,183
And try to

1307
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:26,975
Do a crash course

1308
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:28,511
In modernization

1309
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,559
In order to survive

1310
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,631
And this is part of

1311
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,423
The miracle side of

1312
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:36,959
He went to

1313
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,239
Hiroo onoda

1314
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:39,519
Instead

1315
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,799
Why would you want

1316
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,335
To bring back

1317
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:44,127
The values

1318
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,175
And intensity

1319
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:50,527
From the time. That led to such a disastrous

1320
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:53,087
And result as the end of the second World War

1321
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,391
He might come back with the line

1322
01:03:55,647 --> 01:04:00,255
That's a sure but if we don't have those values in that intensity we never get to Meiji restoration

1323
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,559
Are the really great

1324
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,583
Clear-eyed

1325
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:05,119
Long range

1326
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,143
Visions of you

1327
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,167
These people who will

1328
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:12,031
Take control of Japan in the Meiji restoration is the fact that they clearly understand

1329
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:15,615
This adapt or die dilemma that Japan is in

1330
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,407
I would make the case that

1331
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,687
The same dilemma

1332
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:19,455
Most

1333
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:23,039
Victims of colonial ization have faced at one time or another

1334
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:23,807
Weather

1335
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,855
Because what ends up happening is

1336
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,391
When the

1337
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:29,695
Potential colonizers show up

1338
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,975
And meet you

1339
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,255
Is a clock tick

1340
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,047
At some point

1341
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:36,863
You have to be able to resist encroachment

1342
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,655
Or you will get taken over

1343
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:43,007
During this time. In Japanese by the way when they wake up for the rest of the world This Is How They view it

1344
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,823
But this is a total doggy dog world

1345
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:48,383
There are predators and their prey

1346
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:50,687
And they desperately need to move from the

1347
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:51,967
Pray

1348
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:54,271
Situation that they find themselves in

1349
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:56,319
To the Predator one quickly

1350
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,879
And you don't know how long you have

1351
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:05,535
Most of these countries that turned out to be Colonial victims art Murphy said there were only

1352
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:07,071
Three places that avoided

1353
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:11,167
Sounds like a pretty low estimate to me but even if I added

1354
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:11,935
If you do the lip

1355
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:14,495
It's instructive he said the only three places that

1356
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:19,359
Avoided direct or indirect western or European colonialism

1357
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:21,663
Ethiopia

1358
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:22,943
Siam

1359
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,479
Thailand now

1360
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:25,759
In Japan

1361
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,343
And the reason why

1362
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,623
Is because

1363
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:32,927
This adapt or die dilemma

1364
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,719
Is almost impossible to over

1365
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:39,071
Most of these countries that fell to Colonial powers

1366
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:42,143
Could have overcome them given time but you don't have time

1367
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:48,031
Because you have stuff you have to do to wrap yourself up to a level so that you could compete and resist these kinds of great powers

1368
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:49,567
Takes too long

1369
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:52,383
Because you know that easy to forget this

1370
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,943
In the later part of the 19th century

1371
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:58,527
In order to maintain a first-class military

1372
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:01,087
By the great power standards of the time

1373
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:03,647
Your entire Society has to be devoted

1374
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:06,207
An organized in a way

1375
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:09,535
To gerd it as a foundation I mean it doesn't seem like

1376
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:10,815
But that's the way it is

1377
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:17,727
And so when you find out way we got to catch up real fast or somebody's going to eat I forgot to be able to resist anybody that would land on

1378
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,567
That takes longer than most places have

1379
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:24,383
The Meiji restoration rulers

1380
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,407
Clearly see

1381
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:26,431
But they've got the

1382
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:27,455
Is clock ticking

1383
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:30,271
And so they need a mammoth amount of change

1384
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:32,063
And they needed as quickly as possible

1385
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:33,855
That's what makes this whole thing mirror

1386
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:36,671
The Meiji

1387
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:38,975
Government which is usually called

1388
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:40,255
The Meiji oligarchs

1389
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,279
Later that we called a

1390
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,047
Cabal

1391
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:46,655
Working in conjunction with the emperor by the way we've not spoken much about the emperor but we

1392
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,423
We will in a minute

1393
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:53,055
They're trying to ride the tiger here in terms

1394
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:54,591
Of about

1395
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:57,919
Yeah they understand that I said the adapt or die

1396
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:58,943
Situation

1397
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,735
The only want to adopt

1398
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:02,527
As much as they have to

1399
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,807
To not die

1400
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:08,671
They still want to preserve Japanese culture as much as they can

1401
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:12,511
Right so they're not the Tokugawa ones with the cultural head binding to that level

1402
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:14,559
But they still are

1403
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,583
The oligarch

1404
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,351
Mikey and

1405
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,911
Even though they want to promote more minute marriage

1406
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:25,311
And they feel like that necessary they don't want to get crazy here and they're a little afraid of the masses if you look at their writing

1407
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:29,407
Until they want to go as far as they have to to compete but no farther

1408
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:33,503
But what happens when you have the society now

1409
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:38,879
It's modernizing with you the Meiji restoration rulers will accomplish so much

1410
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:41,695
They're basically governmental decisions

1411
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:45,791
That are hard enough to imagine I'm going to imagine my country doing any of the top five

1412
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:48,095
Considering the amount of resistance

1413
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:49,631
There would have been to the ideas

1414
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,423
But forget that

1415
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:57,567
It's one thing to with the stroke of a pen or a calligraphy brush say we're going to start doing this now

1416
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,359
It's another thing

1417
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,383
Have

1418
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:04,991
A culture and not just a culture a traditional culture and not just a traditional culture

1419
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:08,319
A culture that the government has

1420
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:11,135
Encouraging even more unnaturally

1421
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,159
Traditional

1422
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,439
Element to it

1423
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:16,255
And saying okay guess what we're modernizing

1424
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,535
Now and we're doing it

1425
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,559
Quickly

1426
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:20,095
For our own Survival

1427
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:23,935
There's an account from a British Observer

1428
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:28,031
That lived in Japan during the period where this transformation have

1429
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,055
The Meiji restoration

1430
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:35,455
In addition to all the governmental changes he talks about what it's like to just see

1431
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,479
See how Japan

1432
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:39,295
Changed in charge of its culture in like a decade

1433
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,855
Any talks about the samurai

1434
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,415
Guy who taught him the Japanese language

1435
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,975
And he says the guy had a sword

1436
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:48,767
Anna ponytail

1437
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:53,887
And I mean that's what your plan was like when he when he first got there he says I distinctly remember

1438
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:56,959
This is his words the Middle Ages

1439
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:57,727
Azle

1440
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:58,751
Chamberlain

1441
01:08:59,263 --> 01:08:59,775
Does Ultra

1442
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:02,591
Because I distinctly remember the Middle Ages

1443
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:08,991
And then he says you no less than 10 years later he says now they all look like Europeans they speak with pretty fluent English

1444
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:12,831
And all the talking and it's all modern stuff in the late 19th century is of

1445
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:13,855
Bicycles

1446
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:16,159
Bacilli and spheres of influence

1447
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:20,255
Think about what that does to a culture

1448
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:24,095
Because you can transform a society

1449
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:26,655
Inwood New constitutions which the Meiji

1450
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:27,679
Provide

1451
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:29,983
With a parliament which the Meiji provide

1452
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:31,775
With new court

1453
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:32,543
Deutsche Bank

1454
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:38,687
And finances to let me this is amazing stuff right they will they will intentionally launch an industrial revolution

1455
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:41,247
All that

1456
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,015
Stop

1457
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:44,831
Is hard on any society

1458
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:50,207
Think about how hard it was on the ones that got to have all these historical moments happen to them

1459
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,999
One of the time

1460
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:53,535
In the right order

1461
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,071
The Japanese

1462
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:57,375
Extra traditional culture

1463
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:59,679
Get to have all this stuff happened

1464
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:00,959
In my ten years

1465
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:07,615
This isn't a story about the Meiji restoration which is good because I be over my head

1466
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:08,639
Already

1467
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:09,919
But

1468
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:14,527
We should point out that if it's such an amazing time. There are very sober historians

1469
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,575
Compare some of these Meiji oligarchy

1470
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:19,135
Some of these really dynamic

1471
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,159
People

1472
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:22,463
Two figures like George Washington

1473
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:23,743
Or the

1474
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,791
Roll that The Young Turks

1475
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:29,375
Played in the ottoman state that laid the foundation for the modern Turkish state

1476
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:33,215
This is a big deal on these people are August figures

1477
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:36,287
There are formidable and some of them will live on

1478
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,311
Azan

1479
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,359
Advisors is an Advisory Group

1480
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,895
It will be built into this new governor

1481
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:44,735
These guys will still be in advising Japan on the course of action is

1482
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,271
Take into the 1930

1483
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:47,807
Which puts

1484
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,855
Squarely on course

1485
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,903
Indigo right into our story

1486
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:54,975
Think about

1487
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:58,047
How they would handle their task though if it were you or tasks

1488
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:59,583
So if I said to you listen

1489
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:03,935
You're in an adapter die situation you have to modernize your Society

1490
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,471
Fastest possible

1491
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:07,007
What's Job 1

1492
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,031
What do you do first

1493
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:11,615
What the Japanese did in smart when you think about it

1494
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:14,431
Is they looked around and they sent out

1495
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:15,455
Observer

1496
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:21,599
People to go all of the Tokugawa regime has been very insolent this is like a hundred eighty degree turn cuz they have to

1497
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:25,183
The new government sends out observers of students all over the world

1498
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:29,279
And they haven't come back and report on what all the different countries do well

1499
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:33,375
Write this country does industrial production while this other one does agriculture well

1500
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:36,703
Military stop while whatever it might be

1501
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:38,495
And the Japanese copy of them

1502
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:41,055
As I said smart right

1503
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:44,383
They'll do the same thing

1504
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:49,503
With their government meaning in the way the Japanese are looking at this Murphy makes this clear what's that other writers

1505
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:55,135
Did a predator or prey law of the Jungle thing going on in the later 19th century

1506
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:59,231
And the job the Japanese see for themselves is to convert themselves from

1507
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:03,071
Something that has potential prey into something that scene is obvious predator

1508
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:08,447
So the Japanese want to be taken seriously by the other great powers

1509
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:10,239
They have to also copy

1510
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:16,895
In some form of government that the great Powers had what what is the template that they're going to build this new modern Japanese government

1511
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:18,943
Conscious effort to create a modern state

1512
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,503
And you have lots of choices if you're looking at

1513
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:23,551
European examples don't you

1514
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:25,599
And they should have run the gamut

1515
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:27,903
The entire Spectrum jingle all the way over to one side

1516
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:31,231
You have like a British or French system got forbidden America

1517
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:34,047
Rights of Man a parliament

1518
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:36,863
Representative to some degree government all these kinds of

1519
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:40,447
Or in the case of the Japanese who were

1520
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:44,031
In the process can we say that the Meiji restoration rulers were

1521
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,823
We're giving Japan's of the soft

1522
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:46,591
Landing 4

1523
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:49,407
Feudalism if you will that's one of the things they're known for

1524
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:53,247
Probably a little too new

1525
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,271
To maybe go off

1526
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,295
Paul Frandsen

1527
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:58,367
Britton so maybe you go to something with a little bit more

1528
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:00,415
Military muscle built into the

1529
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:02,207
The Constitutional design

1530
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:07,071
This is the. We're Prussia is active but will soon become United German

1531
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:11,935
This this is a transition period for them but either way

1532
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:13,471
Military involved

1533
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:14,239
Mint in terms of

1534
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,263
The way the state is or

1535
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:20,127
Kaiser will be called the Supreme Warlord

1536
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:21,407
That's the kind of thing

1537
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:23,711
Autocratic temper is like a lot

1538
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:31,135
Or you can just go in and turn the dial all the way to the other side and Go full Czar on things if you want to

1539
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:33,439
The Czar of Russia of course during this.

1540
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,719
An autocrat

1541
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:36,511
He's an old-fashioned throwback

1542
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:37,791
The divine right of

1543
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:38,559
Kings

1544
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:40,095
Disposition

1545
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:43,935
Is divinely ordained in the social hierarchy by God

1546
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:45,727
This is not a person who is

1547
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,775
Fearful of Christianity

1548
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:52,383
Like the Japanese were in the Tokugawa regime this is a person who is wrapped up in a Christian

1549
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:53,663
Bow

1550
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:55,711
And presented to his people

1551
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:58,271
As one step below a deity

1552
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,855
The czar's regime is also

1553
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:08,511
Notably hostile to all this talk of democracy and all the social agitation that bothers the Japanese

1554
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:10,815
As much as it bothers the Russian ones

1555
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,887
So the Japanese will form a system

1556
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:17,215
That actually takes the whole idea of the Czar wrapped up is the

1557
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:20,287
Chosen man of God one step farther in

1558
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:22,079
Create an emperor that is a guy

1559
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:25,151
Creative

1560
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:26,687
How about

1561
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:28,223
Warps

1562
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,015
Can you use the word

1563
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:33,599
Rent a historian talking about how this new government

1564
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:34,367
Will take

1565
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,391
The Shinto

1566
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:36,927
Why the Japanese religion

1567
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,207
And War

1568
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:39,743
It for State purposes

1569
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:41,535
But they're going to do this with a lot of thing

1570
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:43,071
Going to Warp

1571
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,863
Bushido they're going to Warp

1572
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,911
The samurai path they're going to Warp

1573
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:47,679
Shintoism

1574
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,447
Going to Warp

1575
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:50,495
Pass

1576
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:53,055
By the way

1577
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,359
Just like everyone else

1578
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:56,895
Only more so

1579
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:59,455
Go look at that

1580
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:03,039
Late 19th century early 20th century

1581
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:05,343
Text books for kids

1582
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:08,415
You know maybe something along the line

1583
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:09,695
11 year old

1584
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:11,999
For 12 year-old what they would read in school

1585
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:14,303
It doesn't matter what great power in air

1586
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:15,839
Country you go to

1587
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:18,399
The books could all be entitled

1588
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:21,471
Not have your flag on it and the title could say something

1589
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:23,007
Here's what's so great about us

1590
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,055
Cuz that's what they kind of sound

1591
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:29,663
And if you open them up I want to remind America cuz I grew up with just the

1592
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:30,431
Fumes

1593
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:33,247
That if you open up those

1594
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:35,039
Those books and looking for example

1595
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:37,855
How they portrayed George Washington

1596
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:41,183
You would not call him a deity

1597
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:46,559
But he was portrayed and I mean people believe this at this time as a guy who never lie

1598
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:49,887
Archetype

1599
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:51,167
Figure I mean well

1600
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:54,751
I guess we can all understand very romanticizing

1601
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:55,775
There were no

1602
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:58,591
And he was portrayed as almost super cute

1603
01:15:58,847 --> 01:15:59,359
Human

1604
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:02,175
It's pretty interesting guy I'm not saying but you know what I mean

1605
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:06,527
This is part of this is part of your National mythology that was so important during this era

1606
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:08,575
And Japan took this and turn it up to 11

1607
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,367
How did the Tsar

1608
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:11,903
Who's only chosen by God

1609
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:18,303
And they wrapped the emperor into a warped version of Shintoism that got more warped

1610
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:19,071
OurTime

1611
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:20,863
And turned him into a guy

1612
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:23,679
Full disclaimer here

1613
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:28,031
Are you done a public sampling of Japanese opinion 100 years ago

1614
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:32,127
And ask the people on the street whether or not the emperor was a god

1615
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:37,503
I'm going to guess here that you get somewhere in the 85% range that says yes

1616
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,527
Anyway

1617
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:39,807
I don't know that that's

1618
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:40,831
Truitt although

1619
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,879
But the point is is that

1620
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:45,183
This was an existing thing

1621
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:49,791
That the government for its own State purposes like most governments anywhere

1622
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:51,327
Took and you

1623
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:56,447
And I used it by wrapping the entire organization of this modern State around the emperor

1624
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:04,127
Now in terms of the power of the emperor figure all I can say about that is good luck

1625
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:05,919
The determining that

1626
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:09,247
And it's such a key point in the story to because

1627
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:11,039
It's so many points you want to know

1628
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:16,671
Who's responsible for this or that decision that has deadly horrible consequences you want to be able to

1629
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:20,511
Play where does the buck stop in this system and you're not going to be able to put your finger on

1630
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:23,071
I seem to be several

1631
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:25,119
Your layers availed

1632
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:30,495
The cover-up the way the Japanese government work some of it put in there deliberately at the time it was formed

1633
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:33,055
Some of it to insulate

1634
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:38,431
The Royal Court from the muddiness of traditional in a day-to-day politics and say the parliament

1635
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:45,855
When I was a kid that history is taught that the emperor during the second world war was like a figurehead sort of to a military

1636
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:48,927
Cherry dictatorship not unlike a 20th century version

1637
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,463
Of the Shogun

1638
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:52,255
Nowadays there are

1639
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:54,559
Pulitzer prize-winning history by historians like Herbert

1640
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:56,607
Suggest that's not true

1641
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:59,679
And maybe what was a conspiracy theory when I was growing

1642
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:04,543
Isn't such a conspiracy theory the idea that the emperor had his reputation laundered

1643
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:05,823
The way

1644
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:10,175
Engineers and scientist who had to work for the Nazis died in Operation Paperclip

1645
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:15,551
So maybe the way you make the emperor and okay figure to be a post-war

1646
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:17,087
Figure on the

1647
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,367
Global

1648
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:21,951
Geopolitical Cold War chess board is to launder

1649
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,999
Is passed by saying Hey listen to music

1650
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:27,839
Tool of the military dictatorship didn't have any power but maybe he did

1651
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:35,519
By the way the system is designed this major restoration system the emperor supposed to be like the top of the Apex in the

1652
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:37,311
Japanese social hierarchy

1653
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:44,223
And theoretically he controls everything and he has the power to reach down through layers of the bureaucracy

1654
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:47,551
Create Justice and solve problems and cut through red tape

1655
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:53,951
What's the likelihood of single figures going to be able to do all that as they say when one person is in charge of everything nobody's really in charge of

1656
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:54,719
Anything

1657
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:58,303
You can see how this gift the entire

1658
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:01,119
Nation-state into trouble for example

1659
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:06,239
When you look at the relationship in this system the Meiji restoration constitutional system of the emperor

1660
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:08,031
To the Armed Forces

1661
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:10,847
The Army and the Navy of Japan don't owe their allegiance

1662
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:11,615
The nation

1663
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,895
State of Japan

1664
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:15,199
The other allegiance to the emperor

1665
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:16,223
Personally

1666
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:17,759
In fact

1667
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:22,367
They're kind of taken out of the realm of politics altogether

1668
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,903
And put into

1669
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:29,279
You know his hands for his uses as he sees fit but what if he doesn't ever get involved in the situation

1670
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:31,327
What it really means

1671
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:34,143
Is that the political leaders have no control over the middle

1672
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:39,263
Military the military can say hey we're answerable only to the emperor in the emperor's stays in his room doesn't bother any

1673
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:40,543
It's a little like that

1674
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:44,639
Can I look at the difference. Between

1675
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:47,711
The potential power of the emperor versus

1676
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:50,015
The reality of the situation I can't help

1677
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,551
But see him as a figure like

1678
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:53,599
The Incredible Hulk

1679
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,623
Superhero reference

1680
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:59,231
My apologies to those who hate that kind of stuff but you seem so perfect in this situation

1681
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:03,071
Because when the guy wants to do and this seems to be almost like

1682
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:06,143
The role of the emperor going way back into ancient time

1683
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,423
They have all this

1684
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,447
Layton

1685
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:09,215
Power

1686
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:14,080
But they don't use it very often it's the Hulk but they don't turn into the whole very often

1687
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:16,640
Maddeningly inconsistent

1688
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:20,224
But when they do they can move Mountain to me one of the things that the war crime

1689
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,016
Investigations after the war

1690
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:23,808
Storing Herbert P big size

1691
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:26,368
But they wanted to know from the Japanese emperor

1692
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:33,280
Is they were trying to figure out if the guy has the power to stop the war you know all he has to do is turn into the Incredible Hulk

1693
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:37,888
The war within now in the War and why didn't he ended it the beginning before millions of people that died

1694
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:39,680
Right it's very frustrating for

1695
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:45,056
The people in the west look at the society and try to figure out where the lines of Power are we're very comfortable

1696
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:47,872
With a couple of different things right there where we used to

1697
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:50,176
I mean if you say you have a ruler

1698
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:52,736
And you have like a Magna Carta

1699
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:54,784
Reconstitution

1700
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:58,112
That dictates what they could do which hardly get that right bring in the

1701
01:20:58,368 --> 01:21:00,160
Magnifying glass and the lawyers

1702
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:02,720
Now you can then read the text so we can't do this

1703
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:07,584
You can do that and this other stuff that smirk in the middle we can argue about we get that with a lot of that

1704
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:12,192
Unfortunately we also have a lot of the other extremely get that too

1705
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:13,728
You know that one that's the

1706
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:20,128
Pharaoh God Julius Caesar Joseph Stalin Adolf Hitler djingis Khan thing we have nothing written down because there's nothing you can't do

1707
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,920
Total power

1708
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:24,992
The Japanese emperor is neither one of those

1709
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:25,760
Those things

1710
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:27,808
But seem to be

1711
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:30,112
Bound by what historian Herbert pubix

1712
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:30,880
Called

1713
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:32,672
You know an ethos

1714
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:33,952
A restraint

1715
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:34,976
In the use of his

1716
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,560
Write something that's Bound by things that are not written

1717
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:42,656
Things that are very difficult for Outsiders to proceed cuz for a bunch of the stuff you have to have

1718
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,960
In agricultural antenna

1719
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:49,056
Set to the Japanese setting you can really only get that most of the time

1720
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:52,384
True amazing Decades of study or being Japanese

1721
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:56,736
What's The Outsiders difficult for us to understand but maybe to the Japanese emperor

1722
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:58,272
And this court protocol

1723
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:03,136
The tradition and a bunch of other considerations may be as binding to him

1724
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:06,464
As a Magna Carta or a constitution would be to some other

1725
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,816
Trying to figure out how

1726
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:12,352
The emperor

1727
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:13,120
Interact

1728
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:15,424
The military how they all interact

1729
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,704
The prime minister

1730
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:17,472
The parliament

1731
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:23,872
Privy Council the genro in all these other elements in that Society will drive you crazy I looks like

1732
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:24,640
Understood it

1733
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:32,320
I couldn't even figure out a shorthand way to describe it so one of the rare times I went to look for somebody else a shorthand way to describe it

1734
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:36,160
And I ended up on Wikipedia which may be the first time we're using something

1735
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:37,184
From there but it was

1736
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:38,208
Perfect

1737
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:43,072
They describe this government remember with adaptations and evolution this is going to be the government that goes into the sea

1738
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:44,864
Where the lines of power

1739
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:47,168
Well the Wikipedia piece described it

1740
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,192
As a quote

1741
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:49,984
Form of mixed

1742
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:53,056
Constitutional - absolute monarchy

1743
01:22:54,080 --> 01:23:00,224
A form of mixed constitutional absolute monarchy what do you think that the term absolute monarch

1744
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,040
So that makes the rest of that phrase moot

1745
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:04,832
He was a wild party

1746
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,624
That is what it is

1747
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,416
That's a good description of it

1748
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:12,512
But that's out of the scripture that really makes any sense or helps you figure out who's in charge of the

1749
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:13,280
Twice

1750
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:16,096
One thing you can say though

1751
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:17,888
Is that by

1752
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:19,168
Injecting

1753
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:22,240
Add or a religious level

1754
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:23,776
Fervor and belief

1755
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:28,640
Into this state and this culture at this time. Deliberately is as for State purposes

1756
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:30,432
These rulers

1757
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:33,760
Ratchet up the intensity level yet again because I mean after all

1758
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:39,648
When do you normally inject religion and deities in the things people don't get more serious and passionate about it

1759
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:41,184
Probably never end in this case

1760
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,232
That was not a bug that was a feature

1761
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,328
And I don't mean to say cuz I think most of these Meiji oligarchs

1762
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,096
We're True Believer

1763
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:51,168
Example motion and probably believed in the Divinity of the emperor

1764
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:55,520
Imagine for a minute that instead of them being true believers they were

1765
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:57,312
Much more cynical

1766
01:23:57,568 --> 01:24:02,176
Power mongers who were just looking at the tools they could use to keep the people under their boot

1767
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:05,504
What an amazing tool this idea

1768
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:08,576
That the emperor is divine is

1769
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:13,696
Looking out if you buy into the state will call State propaganda

1770
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:17,536
Look at how it completely changes your logical calculations

1771
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:18,816
By the parameters

1772
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:23,680
It turns your your mind against you your rational mind for example if you buy the two

1773
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:29,056
Tuileries in this system is going to be drilled into the heads increasingly Japanese students as they grow up

1774
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:32,128
But the emperor is responsible for all the decisions

1775
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,944
Littermaid in terms of charting the course of the nation

1776
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:36,224
Ana policies

1777
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:39,296
And also that the emperor is basically

1778
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:40,832
Superhuman

1779
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,648
What is The Logical choice to make

1780
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,440
In terms of

1781
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,464
Accepting

1782
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:49,024
The government's point of view on things

1783
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:55,936
Or the course of the nation or anything else I mean doesn't become illogical if you buy those parameters to think that

1784
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:57,216
Did you have any business

1785
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:59,520
Even questioning the authority

1786
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:05,408
I mean this is basically a god they see things from a higher perspective you're an idiot to send it from your position

1787
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:07,712
You should be questioning that level of authority

1788
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:09,760
If you buy that level of authority

1789
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:12,576
Could have been a class

1790
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:13,856
If you ruin daughter

1791
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:15,648
I believe was born in 90

1792
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:16,416
P22

1793
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:17,184
When he's in

1794
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:21,280
Don't he's in the Early Education levels in his Jeep and that's the most intensive

1795
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:25,376
To Panic or started the public school system

1796
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:26,912
Copying the great powers

1797
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:28,704
They thought it might have been some of the secret sauce

1798
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,496
What made those great Powers dominant

1799
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:36,896
But they also needed a literate population to man all those Industries and all those other things that we're going to support their modern military

1800
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:38,688
So it was a no-brainer

1801
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,968
But you know

1802
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:41,248
There's an old saying I think the

1803
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:43,296
Nobody ever really object to children

1804
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:45,344
Learning to read the questions always comes

1805
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,136
To the forest what are they reading

1806
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,672
And this case

1807
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:54,048
As in every country it is pretty propagandize State stuff and then the Japanese case more intense than most

1808
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:59,168
And in the same way that we have people in the United States may have had a little bit of a hero-worship

1809
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:02,752
Over George Washington in Japan they had a little bit of a worship worship

1810
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:04,288
Over the Japanese emperor

1811
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:06,080
You think about how

1812
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:07,616
This can

1813
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:14,016
I'm just thinking about differences in how long a country has to inject a national mythology

1814
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,296
Into a popular

1815
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:17,856
Japanese school children

1816
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:18,880
Increasingly

1817
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:25,280
If you boil it down to the subject matter they're all learning things that we would think are good things to Teach Me Senpai treats

1818
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:26,816
Love of country

1819
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:27,584
Sacrifice

1820
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:29,632
Honor your parents

1821
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:32,192
Respect authority minis are all values

1822
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:34,752
Are all the school systems the Japanese were

1823
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:36,288
Imitating we're teaching

1824
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:39,360
And the Japanese parents at the time probably would have approved

1825
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:44,224
There's no doubt it'll brainwash you if you're buying what they're selling

1826
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,552
And if you're going to walk a mile and a guy like

1827
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,880
Hero another's moccasins let's understand

1828
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:53,440
That is logical calculations

1829
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:57,536
That's simply doing what the emperor told him to do

1830
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,328
Is the smart choice to make

1831
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:03,680
And if you are a cynical wielder of the levers of

1832
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,960
The power

1833
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:06,752
True realpolitik

1834
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,544
Dictator type

1835
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,592
He gives you a right onto have that kind of

1836
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:11,872
Belief system on the party

1837
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:12,640
Your population

1838
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,760
Dallas remember the number one goal of this new government.

1839
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:24,928
They have to deal with him in all this other stuff is kind of a means to an end if you can't defend yourself from an outside power wants to take you over

1840
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:26,208
None of this matters

1841
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:32,096
Meiji restoration have to build a modern Army and they do

1842
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,888
And they do it the same

1843
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:40,288
General way they've been doing all these other things they look at who's doing it well and they copy them and they get their help and they buy stuff from them

1844
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,336
Once again this is smart isn't it

1845
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:44,128
On land

1846
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:44,896
Right around

1847
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:46,688
1870 or what not there

1848
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:51,808
If dealing initially with the French military they will eventually though ditch them for the Germans

1849
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:56,928
And in a move that many countries do the United States and the Soviet Union

1850
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:58,464
All the time in the Cold War

1851
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,280
The Germans will send advisors over there who will bring

1852
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:02,304
You know equipment

1853
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,584
Uniforms

1854
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,352
Tactics

1855
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:11,264
Doctrine training leadership bring some of their key officers back to learn things in Germany then send them back to teacher

1856
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,056
Everyone out this relationship free classic

1857
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:15,104
But it's sort of creates

1858
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:15,872
A

1859
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:21,248
A forever German stamp in the early DNA of the modern Imperial Japanese Army

1860
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,528
Might be a good way to put it

1861
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:27,904
I think we all know history has been a pretty good

1862
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:34,816
Demonstrator that just because you give a whole bunch of the best stuff to some other military doesn't mean they're going to fight well

1863
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:37,632
Because there were two sides

1864
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:38,912
The equation

1865
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:43,520
And one side sort of easy to fill the other side's a lot harder

1866
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:45,056
1 sides quantifier

1867
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:46,848
Right you can spend a certain amount of money

1868
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:53,248
To get this job done we can provide this many rifles we can provide this buddy uniforms this many hours of training this much support

1869
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:55,808
We all that stuff can soda be figured out to the end

1870
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:56,832
Decimal

1871
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:00,416
But the other side of what's going to make us

1872
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:01,952
Successful military

1873
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:05,792
Is something as bedrock in terms of values

1874
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:09,376
As whether or not your people are going to be willing to die

1875
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:15,264
And whether they will fight on the battlefield long enough to make that investment in the stuff that they carry

1876
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,032
Worth it

1877
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:21,664
You get two armies and they line up on a battlefield across from each other and one has the best needed

1878
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,688
Coolest most

1879
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:25,504
Devastating new stuff in the others armed with sticks

1880
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:31,648
But the side with the devastating stuff doesn't want to fight or they're afraid or they don't have any interest

1881
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:32,672
Destiny just leave

1882
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,744
Fat lot of good all that investment did you

1883
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:42,144
How do you inject or create or artificially stimulate a warrior ethos in a brand new

1884
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:42,912
Military

1885
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:46,240
But what if you had a shortcut

1886
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:47,008
Mobile to you

1887
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:49,824
What if you already had

1888
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:51,616
An indigenous

1889
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:54,176
Long-standing

1890
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:59,296
Warrior ethos and tradition of your own just sitting there not doing anything

1891
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:01,600
Could you

1892
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:04,928
Reanimated repurposing clone it

1893
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:12,352
Could you customize it so that it meets the needs of a late 19th century early 20th century regime

1894
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:14,912
Even if I told you

1895
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:16,960
The state was pushing

1896
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:19,776
These values what would you think

1897
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:21,568
Values like

1898
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:23,616
Courage

1899
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:25,152
Benevolence

1900
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,688
Politeness

1901
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:28,480
Selflessness

1902
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:30,016
Sincerity

1903
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:31,552
Honor

1904
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:33,088
Loyalty

1905
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,880
Self control

1906
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:37,184
A strong sense of justice

1907
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:43,328
That's all like benishan inventing the Way of the Samurai describing

1908
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:46,400
The various virtues that have sometimes been described

1909
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:48,192
2 Bushido

1910
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:50,240
The ethical Way of the Samurai

1911
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:54,592
Your kids were learning those kinds of things in school you probably

1912
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:56,128
We think that that was a good thing

1913
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,224
What the government of Japan would do during this time.

1914
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:05,600
Is they will pick and choose when we had said earlier that they warp all these things

1915
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:12,000
Preexisting in Japan Bushido goes way way back although the term itself may only date from the lake

1916
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,024
Late 19th century

1917
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:18,656
But this will be another traditional Japanese thing that the modern state will take in warp for its own purposes

1918
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:25,056
And according to Venice if I understand correctly he's basically saying that amongst the wide-ranging inteligencija debating

1919
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:29,920
In the various aspects of Bushido you can find almost every opinion out there you want

1920
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:32,736
But the state would pick the ones that most

1921
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,784
In corresponding

1922
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:38,880
With things that would help it for example finally settling on one of the most

1923
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:42,208
Influential they're called Bushido theorist

1924
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:43,232
Out there

1925
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:50,144
Who is boiled Bushido down to just simply really two things and you can see why the state would like a guy like this

1926
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:55,776
Validate his viewpoint on Bushido cuz he boils it down to love of the emperor

1927
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:57,312
And patriotism

1928
01:31:58,848 --> 01:32:00,128
That's not a bad thing

1929
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:04,736
From the state's point of view to infuse into your public schools and your children

1930
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:11,392
And then to continue doing so too much more intense level when the male children from that public school

1931
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:14,208
Grow up and become part of the military

1932
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:17,280
The father of the second world war prime minister

1933
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:18,560
Hideki Tojo

1934
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:22,912
Told a gathering of Educators in the 1890s

1935
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:28,544
They should totally familiarize themselves with how the Army does everything because the Army is the real finishing school

1936
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:34,688
And all these educators are doing the public school is preparing the kids to join the Army so get used to how we do things and teach the kids that way

1937
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:38,272
Now we should add that in addition to

1938
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:40,832
Just wonderful high-minded philosophical Warrior ethos

1939
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:46,720
I think there's much more grounded understandable reasons why Japanese soldiers might be reluctant to surrender

1940
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:48,000
Or flee

1941
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:51,840
If things like the commands by Japanese General sometimes that said

1942
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:55,680
That we will execute anyone who does This real-world concerns to but

1943
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:58,496
Why not lots of other armies in history

1944
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:00,032
Chilled deserters

1945
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,312
And well

1946
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:02,848
People still route

1947
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:06,176
So there's some combination of elements going on here

1948
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:13,088
Ends up creating a Japanese military that from the very beginning the Imperial Japanese Army will

1949
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:15,392
Will have morale that's probably equal to the other

1950
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:16,672
Best armies out

1951
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:22,816
And it will only get higher as time goes on remember this military only exist for like the light

1952
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:26,144
The 1870s and 1880s it really has built

1953
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:29,728
And course in 1945 it all comes to a halt

1954
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,520
But in that time.

1955
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:35,872
You will go from instantly higher than should be expected morale

1956
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:39,200
2 unbelievable fanatical levels of morale

1957
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:43,040
For comparison purposes because we all know that

1958
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:44,064
The German Army II

1959
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:45,600
What's a very good army

1960
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:49,696
But in the book implacable foe as historians Waldo Hendricks and Mark colicchio

1961
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:51,744
Compare the two in this

1962
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,280
Morale regard

1963
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,584
They point out the

1964
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:58,144
The Japanese situation was often just

1965
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,680
Going to be a question

1966
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:02,240
Victory or death they write quote

1967
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:05,056
Surrender was unthinkable

1968
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:09,152
In Tunisia when the German Afrika korps surrendered in 1943

1969
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:12,736
The British captured more than 120000 German soldiers

1970
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:16,320
Including a colonel General and his staff 12 generals and all

1971
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:23,232
The Allied liberation of France in the summer of 1944 they write 200 thousand

1972
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:29,888
As the war progressed the Allies captured so many German officers that the British set up a special residence for them in the English

1973
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:30,656
Countryside

1974
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:37,056
During the final weeks of the war in Europe more than 1500000 German surrender to the Western allies

1975
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:38,592
In contrast

1976
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:39,360
They right

1977
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:40,128
No

1978
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:44,992
Organized unit of the Imperial Japanese army surrender during the entire Pacific War

1979
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:50,368
Until they were ordered to do so by the emperor After Japan had formally agreed to capitulate

1980
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:52,160
This that right

1981
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:55,488
Was a record unprecedented in the annals of Modern Warfare

1982
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:56,768
And quote

1983
01:34:57,536 --> 01:35:01,120
And as we've already pointed out there were a bunch of Japanese soldiers

1984
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:04,448
But just because the war ended didn't see

1985
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:05,728
Youfit reason to

1986
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:06,752
Surrender

1987
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,056
This is pretty high level of morale

1988
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:16,224
You can't say that this whole Bushido injection which some people compared to an ideology others to more like a religion

1989
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,784
You can't say that this is the reason why

1990
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:20,064
But you can stay the

1991
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:23,392
The state was definitely using the idea for those purposes

1992
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:31,328
The morale of the Imperial Japanese Navy will also be really high in some of these Bushido ideas will be injected

1993
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:32,352
You can do that as well

1994
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:34,400
They may have flirted with another

1995
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:36,448
Advisor for a minute on land but

1996
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:37,216
In terms of

1997
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:38,752
Who to look to As You Are

1998
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:44,128
Mentor for building a great Navy in the 19th century late 19th century there's only one choice

1999
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:45,920
What the best the best is the Royal Navy

2000
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:49,504
The Sun never sets on the British Empire was said

2001
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:50,784
What is the Royal Navy

2002
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:55,392
Text that the Japanese begin a long-standing connection with the British Navy

2003
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:57,696
Same thing is on land tactics.

2004
01:35:57,952 --> 01:35:59,488
When strategy leadership

2005
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:06,400
A long-term serving of Japanese officers on Royal Navy ships and then going back in the traditions of the Imperial Japanese Navy

2006
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:09,984
Japanese leaving buy some of their

2007
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:10,752
Bigger tickets

2008
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:15,360
Items from the British until they can build their own so the relationship is designed

2009
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:17,664
To make up for lost time

2010
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,456
And quickly ASAP right

2011
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:20,224
Create

2012
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,528
And adaptation of Japan

2013
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,600
That as a heart attack at Murphy point that is at least

2014
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:29,440
A reasonable imitation of an imperialist power

2015
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,864
Course if you are trying to present yourself as a reasonable imitation of Imperial

2016
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:38,144
Nation state

2017
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:40,704
That's probably going to require

2018
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:43,008
A little imperialism when you think

2019
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:45,824
Problem with a little

2020
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:46,848
Imperial

2021
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:49,920
Resume is it's one of those things that when a political state

2022
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:55,552
You start down that road it's time to stop sometimes I mean it's like that potato chip commercial you can't just

2023
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:56,832
Eat one

2024
01:36:57,856 --> 01:37:01,184
A little like that with other countries and territories to once you get one of them

2025
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:02,464
Start sit

2026
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:04,256
Feel kind of good

2027
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:09,632
Well that's funny because if you and again I'm unless qualified to talk about anything addiction

2028
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:10,400
Specialist

2029
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:11,936
History

2030
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:14,496
But doesn't it sort of look if you look at

2031
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:15,776
Nation-states

2032
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:17,056
And imagine the most people

2033
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:18,848
Doesn't look like your pants about

2034
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:19,616
How to get hooked

2035
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:21,664
Here and that their rise and fall

2036
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:23,968
Is going to parallel something like

2037
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:25,248
Enter your classic

2038
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:26,784
Drug addict

2039
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:28,320
Cycle of addiction

2040
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:31,136
I think you can make it

2041
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:32,672
Vacation at the wonderful hinge mower

2042
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:34,720
MTG Japanese history may be horrible in

2043
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:36,000
Only because they go from

2044
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:38,048
Simply trying to make sure they don't get

2045
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:39,840
In these

2046
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:42,400
Shark infested Colonial Waters

2047
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:43,936
Looking around

2048
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:44,960
Themselves

2049
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,288
And well

2050
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:50,336
Like potato chips

2051
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:57,504
Sometimes you can develop an appetite for those things once you start it looks like Japan in this era

2052
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:00,576
Dangerously hooked on imperialism

2053
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:05,696
And it's not hard to see how it happened I mean after all

2054
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:12,096
All the countries Japan wanted to be liked and emulate the club that they wanted to join of the great Powers all those

2055
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:14,144
Guys are up to it already

2056
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:15,680
Even little Belgium

2057
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:16,704
Got a problem

2058
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:18,240
Shake it for

2059
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:19,008
Long time

2060
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:24,128
Even the holier-than-thou United States

2061
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:27,200
Which denounces other people's imperialist Adventures

2062
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:28,224
Boss wearing the

2063
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:34,368
Milan transfers of territory with Mexico seizures of Hawaii and whatnot are not indicative of a growing problem

2064
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:37,696
Will begin having a larger more public problem

2065
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:42,304
In the Spanish-American War when Guam the Philippines Cuba and other places will just sort of

2066
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:44,608
The fall into its lap I guess

2067
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:52,800
William McKinley the president of the time going or should I

2068
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:55,616
He was a junkie of some kind might have been adrenaline

2069
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:56,896
Might have been something else

2070
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:02,272
Not Teddy Roosevelt does not strike me as the

2071
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:06,368
Intoxicating substances the mind-altering substances kind of guy

2072
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:11,488
But if you told me he had an addiction or might be likely to develop one

2073
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,304
Uno gym muscle growth steroids

2074
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:17,888
Well shoot I wouldn't be too surprised about that in fact

2075
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:18,912
As I look at

2076
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:24,032
You know what all analogies have a little bit of a silly side but that's kind of what we enjoy sometimes right

2077
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:29,152
Look at this analogy of these countries and imperialism it kind of looks like steroids to me

2078
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:31,200
I mean take Japan for example

2079
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:33,504
Choose a country that in their mind

2080
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:38,880
Should be stacked up with all the great part we can hang with anybody but then they take a 250 year

2081
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:40,928
Seclusion break from the gym

2082
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:44,512
When they next encounter all these other great Powers get huge

2083
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:46,816
We look at how they must have seen Britain

2084
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:48,352
On a map

2085
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:54,752
Lot of comparison to be made a couple of violent Nations you know interesting and distinctive people all these kind of stuff

2086
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:58,336
But that's where the comparison ends

2087
01:39:58,848 --> 01:39:59,872
Japan comes out of

2088
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:00,896
Seclusion

2089
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:06,016
Britain controls a huge chunk of the world are obviously juicing on something India Maybe

2090
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:08,832
But Japan

2091
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:10,880
Goes on a crash course to catch up

2092
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:14,976
Number to understand when we say getting addicted

2093
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:18,560
To imperialism when were using those phrases for countries

2094
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:24,704
What are you get addicted to is a country well let's just really go over this quickly cuz I think we all get it but

2095
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,752
How about raw materials

2096
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:29,568
How long have people been invading and conquering places

2097
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:31,360
To get somebody else's stuff

2098
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:34,176
In this modern era you also have these

2099
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:36,480
Unequal trade agreements which can lock

2100
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:38,272
A colony into

2101
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:42,368
You're turning over a large chunks of their raw materials and well that reduced

2102
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:43,136
Or

2103
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:45,440
Nonexistent rate of exchange

2104
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:48,256
Prestige in this era

2105
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:50,304
Is huge will have a bunch of countries

2106
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:55,936
Are latecomers to the Colonial party who will take the few leftover places

2107
01:40:56,448 --> 01:41:02,592
Just so that they have another place another notch on their belt the reason those places were taken by great power that

2108
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:04,128
Nothing anybody wanted

2109
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:07,968
The last thing they have is a dad to your prestige you I now have $6

2110
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:09,504
Use the last time you saw me

2111
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:11,808
I only had 5 I'm moving up in the world

2112
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:15,136
Those are the things

2113
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:21,792
That attract you to these countries in the first place right with what's the first reason you start using the steroid

2114
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:24,096
Dabbling I want to be a little bigger

2115
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:30,240
Injury I need the raw materials to trade position and LoPresti I want to be big like the other guys it's all understandable

2116
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:32,800
But when you get involved in it

2117
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:38,176
Then you kind of committed and you get sucked into something deeper this is why I like this analogy

2118
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:38,944
And the

2119
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:42,016
Thing that sucks countries into the colonial

2120
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:43,808
Lifestyle

2121
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:46,880
Are things like the capital Investments

2122
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:52,512
But you begin to make it a country or your company's do or your company's in conjunction with a country do

2123
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:54,304
Putting in railroads

2124
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:56,096
Mining

2125
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:59,680
Development in all these local places you begin to have steak

2126
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:06,336
A state that if people start saying listen though they change in foreign affairs dictates it would be best for us to leave this area now

2127
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:08,128
Now I'm turn it back over to the locals

2128
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:09,920
You can have a lot of powerful rich

2129
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:11,712
People were going to say wait a minute

2130
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:13,248
What about our investment

2131
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:15,296
And that's of course just money

2132
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:16,832
What about lie

2133
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,368
The lies it takes

2134
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:22,976
Conquer these places in the lies it takes to keep them conquered I mean for example

2135
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:26,560
The Japanese will get their hands on Taiwan at a certain point

2136
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:32,960
I'll buy some sort of treaty deal but the people in Taiwan word after the Japanese will lose quite a few people trying to pacify that

2137
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:36,288
An area that supposedly on a piece of paper they were just hand it over

2138
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:42,432
This becomes not just a cost you have to pay to play this game right an entry fee into the colonial games

2139
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:43,968
Tekashi have to keep paying

2140
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:47,808
Stay in the game and it provides another investment

2141
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:50,880
It keeps you from having the flexibility

2142
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:51,904
Is the X

2143
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:54,720
Dictate that it'd be better to give up this policy of

2144
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:56,768
Colonialism or steroid use

2145
01:42:57,024 --> 01:43:03,168
Somebody's going to say wait a minute my son died conquering that territory are you going to make his sacrifices

2146
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:04,960
Meaning what are you going to undo

2147
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:07,776
Everything his life bottom you see how that

2148
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,080
To see how that sucks you in

2149
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:11,104
By the country

2150
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:17,248
Remember to the Japanese are seeing these European powers

2151
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,552
Suit up at the height of the good time

2152
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:25,952
While they're riding high in the addiction and they're lifting weights and they're taking steroids they're going to the tanning salon and then cover themselves with baby oil

2153
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:28,512
They're getting their hair bleached and I look great

2154
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:30,816
Right there not seeing

2155
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:33,120
These countries down the road

2156
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:39,520
You know on the downside of this addiction when they're in the in old folks home prematurely with all the healthcare Pro

2157
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:43,616
Problems in the steroids are gone in the muscles are shriveled and they look and feel awful

2158
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:45,664
When the

2159
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,200
Japanese look at the

2160
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:51,296
French in what's called Indochina for example modern-day Vietnam

2161
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:57,696
They see the French sitting there having the Vietnamese serve them food and restaurants are wonderful Colonial existence while of course the French pay them

2162
01:43:57,952 --> 01:43:59,744
Back by giving them French culture in everything except

2163
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,536
Traditional colonial trade off

2164
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:07,680
The Japanese will not see the French 90 years from this time.

2165
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:14,080
When the 1950s there fighting a vicious Insurgency by the vietminh trying to kick the French out of via

2166
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:14,848
Vietnam

2167
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:17,920
Going to go talk to then but of course by that time

2168
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:22,016
In the 1950s the Japanese are in full recovery mode

2169
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:25,344
After a global intervention

2170
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:26,624
Pulling into its

2171
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:28,416
Steroid addiction

2172
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:31,488
It's half-century long steroid addiction

2173
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,536
If it wanted to go back

2174
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:34,560
And Trace

2175
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:36,864
And the roots of how it began

2176
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:39,168
That initial taste

2177
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:44,032
It seemed so consequence-free that got you hooked and Led You Down

2178
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:47,360
And that terrible path rise and fall of Japan's

2179
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:48,896
Imperialism addiction

2180
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:50,944
Starts with Korea

2181
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:53,504
Just just sitting there wasn't it

2182
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:54,784
Like a dagger

2183
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:59,904
And the Heart of Japan is the German advisor from Bismarck told the Japanese government

2184
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,720
The Japanese had already

2185
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:09,120
Treated urea very shortly after it was opened up against its will by the Western powers to that exact same

2186
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:09,888
Pain treatment

2187
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:16,544
And then foisted the same sort of unequal treaties on Korea that the West had foisted on Japan so you can learn

2188
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:17,312
Quickly

2189
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:20,128
They were ripe for trying out

2190
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:21,920
What the Western Powers were

2191
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:24,224
Your building their muscles off of with

2192
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:26,528
And the first hit free happened in Korea

2193
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:34,976
In the 1870s and 1880s the Japanese involve themselves more more in internal Korean politics and Dynamics

2194
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:41,632
Korea is generally in the sphere of influence of the great Jupiter of the region China but increase

2195
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:46,496
Recently is the Russians have advanced all the way to the Pacific they have more of an impact to in that area

2196
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:52,896
Which of the Japanese this is a Kia mean if this were a game of Risk or something where there were no morals or ethics are

2197
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:56,224
Anything involves Reich of the Korean people will suffer terribly

2198
01:45:56,736 --> 01:46:00,832
You know into this time. We're getting into but let's imagine people don't matter in a risk

2199
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:01,600
Games

2200
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:03,904
If you're playing Japan you want to take Korea

2201
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:08,768
During this time. The Chinese and the Russians are in a much better position than you are so what do you do

2202
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,072
Well in 1894

2203
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:14,656
Somehow Japan ends up in a war over

2204
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:18,240
The sphere of influence control of Korea

2205
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,008
With China

2206
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:21,056
1894-s called the first

2207
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:23,104
Sino-japanese War

2208
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:29,248
And it is really the first time that this new Army of Japan since they opened up leaves Japan to fight somebody else

2209
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:30,784
Not counting

2210
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:33,856
In Ireland insurrections and whatnot

2211
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:35,904
Japan's ghost

2212
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:37,440
Someone will say what you forgot

2213
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:38,976
Anything here

2214
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:40,256
First major one

2215
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:43,072
Other way outside Observers

2216
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:46,912
For the most part believe that China will crush Japan

2217
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:53,568
Both China and Japan have been undergoing military modernization for kind of the same reason both of them fighting themselves.

2218
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:55,104
Dangerously vulnerable

2219
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:58,432
To Western Technologies are working to catch up

2220
01:46:58,944 --> 01:47:05,088
The stated opinion out there by most people where's the China had done a better job including having a fleet

2221
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:11,488
I love the way again this is the time. We're race and all that stuff is over they had the most powerful

2222
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:12,256
Asian please

2223
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:14,048
In Asia it was thought

2224
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:19,680
Anime stunning absolutely stunning

2225
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:23,264
Campaign the Japanese just roll the chine

2226
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:29,920
On land and its see and it's much more shocking probably if you read The Observer that see

2227
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:33,248
Where they destroy the Chinese Fleet

2228
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:39,904
So terribly that story Mary Jensen says China won't have another Blue Water Navy for a hundred years

2229
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:42,208
The Chinese Admiral commits suicide

2230
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:45,280
On land

2231
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:47,584
It's interesting

2232
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:50,656
The Japanese are so dominant they are dishing out

2233
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:55,264
Casualties at 10 to 1 ratio 15 to 1 ratio

2234
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:59,360
And you can't label any single advantages being dominant because

2235
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:03,712
Energy sword delve into it a little bit the Japanese scene dominance with across-the-board

2236
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:08,320
Chinese and Japanese military to modernize but the Japanese had done it

2237
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:14,464
In a lot better of a way they made better choices the Chinese had gone with the banner system it just it didn't work

2238
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:21,120
It's a coming out party on the world stage in Addis shocking to westerners

2239
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:27,776
Don't have a lot of respect for orientals to begin with but if they have respect for any of them it's

2240
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:30,592
China even though they're biting off pieces of China

2241
01:48:30,848 --> 01:48:34,432
And what not to do them China still represents one of the wisdom of the East

2242
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:36,992
Confucian ideas in this great culture theoretically

2243
01:48:37,248 --> 01:48:41,344
Is Japanese or nothing but upstart Sandy Japanese go into this war with

2244
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:42,368
China

2245
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:44,416
And end up winning it

2246
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:50,816
While losing less usually the numbers UCR less than 1500 men killed in combat

2247
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:55,680
Less than 1500 men killed in combat

2248
01:48:57,472 --> 01:48:58,240
Astounding

2249
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:00,544
Chinese numbers are

2250
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,848
You're ten times that or something

2251
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:06,688
The idea that you could win a war

2252
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:07,968
China

2253
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:11,296
And lose less than 1500 men killed

2254
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:18,464
What was the downside of imperialism seemingly that small anybody could get hooked

2255
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:19,232
Good night

2256
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:22,816
The first thing that the Japanese got out of this war which state

2257
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:25,632
Clearly wanted from the emperor down to the

2258
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:27,168
You know average

2259
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:28,960
Japanese person on the street

2260
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:30,240
Was respect

2261
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:34,592
And prestige on the international World stage the other great powers

2262
01:49:34,848 --> 01:49:36,640
Sat up and took notice

2263
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:44,064
Nation 95 the year the war ended Lord Charles Beresford was quoted in the times of London this saying quote

2264
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:51,488
Japan has within 40 years gone through the various administrative phases that occupied English

2265
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:52,768
Blind about 800 years

2266
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,560
And roll about 600

2267
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:58,144
And I am loath to say that anything is impossible with her

2268
01:49:58,656 --> 01:49:59,424
And quote

2269
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:07,616
It was a lot of admiration but it was still tempered by this idea that yes they're pretty amazing for Oreo

2270
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:08,896
Bochum University

2271
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:10,176
It was an almost died

2272
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:16,832
Racialist view of things while they have moved themselves up to the the top of the food chain

2273
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:20,928
Amongst their people in that part of the world I mean that was the progressive way of looking at

2274
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:28,352
There were people around the Russian tsar and begin pardon is a new sound like racism both but we're talking about one of the most

2275
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:32,192
Racist periods in world history and impact decision-making

2276
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:34,496
The people around the Russian czar

2277
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:37,824
Thought of the Japanese up there was one quart of there just yellow monkey

2278
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:40,896
Okay well what happens to you

2279
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:44,480
If it's your job to deal with yellow monkeys

2280
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:49,600
And you're trying to figure out okay how many troops do we need on the border with those people I mean when you're trying to make

2281
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:52,672
Conscious decisions about how you should behave

2282
01:50:52,928 --> 01:50:59,072
What your view of reality is so tainted by your racism that you can't possibly imagine these people doing anything that would hurt you

2283
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:04,448
And that's what a lot of the other people said the Japanese were able to do this for the Chinese cuz obviously the Chinese week is heck

2284
01:51:04,704 --> 01:51:07,008
They never be able to do what your white Nation

2285
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:12,384
Will the end of Japan's war with China here

2286
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:17,248
Opens up the door to them having a problem with their first European nation

2287
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:19,040
Because Japan

2288
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:25,696
Gets a peace treaty extracted from China that is like hitting the jackpot in Las Vegas for the Japanese

2289
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:27,744
First of all

2290
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,560
Did the terms are that they get a ton of money

2291
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:35,168
It's like the equivalent of 4 years of Japan's total budget handed over to them

2292
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:40,800
They also get the island of Taiwan which is huge and the surrounding smaller Islands

2293
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:42,848
Right to use Japan's first colony

2294
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:45,408
They also get

2295
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:50,272
A an agreement that they will sort of have the sphere of influence control of Korea

2296
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:53,088
And in order to make that work they have to get this peninsula

2297
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:56,672
Which is strategically very important so it's all part of the deal

2298
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:57,696
Japan

2299
01:51:57,952 --> 01:52:04,096
A sort of had this coming out party during the Great Powers now and then all of a sudden I love the way our Taggart Murphy disc

2300
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:09,472
Scribe that he says it's the equivalent of having three old seasoned lions come in

2301
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:15,872
And steal the first kill of a young leopard who's just learning how to hunt and just you know thinks he's hit the jackpot

2302
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:21,504
No no no no no we're going to alter the terms of the deal said the Three Lions metaphorically named

2303
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:23,040
France Germany and Russia

2304
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:27,136
In a move known as the triple intervention

2305
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:33,280
Those three powers come in until Japan that they can't extract the tri-d from China that they want to

2306
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:37,632
For the sake of the Peace of Asia they said but in reality Japan

2307
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:42,496
Figured that all three of those countries had their own ideas about things in China that they wanted

2308
01:52:42,752 --> 01:52:47,872
And so they told the Japanese no uncertain terms giving them no choice by the way

2309
01:52:48,128 --> 01:52:54,272
I will have China pay you more money than the original deal called for but you don't get to have that important strategic but

2310
01:52:54,528 --> 01:52:56,320
Angela that has that Port named

2311
01:52:56,576 --> 01:52:57,600
Port Arthur on it

2312
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:00,928
Now I should point out

2313
01:53:01,184 --> 01:53:03,744
Something about Port Arthur before we go any farther

2314
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:06,048
Because it's Jermaine to the story

2315
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:07,584
Port Arthur

2316
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:10,656
Was the site of a terrible Massacre

2317
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:13,472
In the sino-japanese war that just ended

2318
01:53:15,008 --> 01:53:15,520
Init

2319
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:18,336
The Japanese Army went in

2320
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:24,224
And killed men women and children between 1000 is the lowest number you see

2321
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:25,760
And the high-end

2322
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:28,064
Possible number is 20000

2323
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:31,904
That's a huge gap obviously but there are other people that take that number

2324
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:33,952
Much much much much higher than that

2325
01:53:34,464 --> 01:53:38,304
But they really aren't that many people in that region of the not really that credible but just know that

2326
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:41,120
The incredible numbers go much higher than 20000

2327
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:44,704
The reasons important though

2328
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:47,776
Is because you will see on display

2329
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:49,824
Things that both look

2330
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:54,432
Medieval to Modern people in the late 19th century

2331
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:56,992
And things that are going to be reminiscent

2332
01:53:57,248 --> 01:54:00,832
Of incidents we will see over and over in the Second World War

2333
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:03,392
The Japanese going to Port Arthur

2334
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:04,928
And the three

2335
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:07,488
Rationales just so you know that you'll get for this

2336
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:12,096
You'll get for the other basically situations like in the Second World War

2337
01:54:12,352 --> 01:54:18,496
You got them at the time you will get them today from ultra-nationalist there's three one is that these incidents happened when

2338
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:21,056
Atrocities were committed against Japanese troops

2339
01:54:21,312 --> 01:54:23,360
The soldiers kind of lose their minds for a while

2340
01:54:24,384 --> 01:54:26,176
A suggestion is that this is understandable

2341
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:27,200
Troops in combat

2342
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:33,088
And that it's not something that the Army itself condone but it's understandable right so you got the atrocity thing

2343
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:35,136
The second thing you'll often hear is

2344
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:41,536
That the Press is reporting that these are civilians but they're really enemy soldiers were trying to hide from our troops and live to see

2345
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:43,328
Might put them in everything from behind buildings

2346
01:54:43,584 --> 01:54:48,960
Dressed as civilians all these people that look like civilians really enemy soldiers and the last thing you will hear

2347
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:50,240
Reliably

2348
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:51,776
Is that the numbers are inflated

2349
01:54:53,056 --> 01:54:57,408
Now there is some potential truth to the numbers are inflated thing because in the same way you have

2350
01:54:57,664 --> 01:54:58,688
Ultra-nationalist

2351
01:54:58,944 --> 01:55:01,504
All around the planet now trying to revamp

2352
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:08,160
The way the World Views perhaps we'll call them negative chapters in the history of their military that they're right

2353
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:10,464
Flea proud of but every nation has them

2354
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:15,584
I mean the Chinese for example have an interest in magnifying Japanese crimes against

2355
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:21,984
Chinese citizens and the Japanese if your patriotic have interest in seeing the numbers in the best possible light it's all

2356
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:23,008
All understandable

2357
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:29,408
But I'm going to let historians argue that sort of stuff I'm just going to try to stick to the facts and I'm going to try to give

2358
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:30,688
Multiple sides

2359
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:32,224
But here's what an eyewitness

2360
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:34,528
And there were several westerners

2361
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:37,344
In Port Arthur when the massacre happened

2362
01:55:38,112 --> 01:55:40,672
Here's how he described it and just so you know

2363
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:44,768
You could take this description out of this time. In this event

2364
01:55:45,024 --> 01:55:50,144
Substituted for any number of incidents that happened in the second world war and you wouldn't know

2365
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:54,752
It wasn't written down because they have a tragically familiar

2366
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:56,032
Ring to them

2367
01:55:58,592 --> 01:55:59,616
Just author who witnessed

2368
01:55:59,872 --> 01:56:00,384
The events

2369
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:04,992
At the massacre Port Arthur in the first sino-japanese war described it this way

2370
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:05,760
Quote

2371
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:13,184
Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday we're spent by the soldiery in murder and pillage from dawn

2372
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:13,952
Wanted dark

2373
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:15,232
Emulation

2374
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:18,560
In every conceivable kind of name was atrocity

2375
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:21,376
Until the town became a ghastly Inferno

2376
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:24,704
To be remembered with a fearsome shutter until one's dying day

2377
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:27,520
I saw corpses of women and children

2378
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:29,056
Three or four in the street

2379
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:30,336
More in the water

2380
01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:35,456
Bodies of menstrual the streets in hundreds perhaps thousands for we could not count

2381
01:56:35,968 --> 01:56:38,016
Some with not a limb on the Severn

2382
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:40,064
Some with their heads hat

2383
01:56:40,576 --> 01:56:42,368
Cross cut and split lengthwise

2384
01:56:43,136 --> 01:56:44,160
Some ripped open

2385
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:48,000
Not by chance but with careful Precision down and across

2386
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:50,304
Disemboweled and dismembered

2387
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:52,352
But occasionally a dagger bayonet

2388
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:53,376
Trust in the private

2389
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:56,960
I saw groups of prisoners tied together in a bunch

2390
01:56:57,216 --> 01:56:58,496
With their hands behind their backs

2391
01:56:59,008 --> 01:57:02,080
Riddled with bullets for 5 minutes and then human two pieces

2392
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:07,712
I saw a junk stranded on the beach build with fugitives of either sex and of all ages

2393
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:10,016
Struck-by volley after volley

2394
01:57:10,272 --> 01:57:11,808
Until I can say no more

2395
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:13,600
And quote

2396
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:17,184
What's going through a few thoughts

2397
01:57:18,976 --> 01:57:25,120
The first one is that there's nothing unusual about an event like this is their your history books are

2398
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:28,192
Are littered with this stuff going back to the beginning of time project

2399
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:28,960
Italy

2400
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:32,032
Go read the Assyrian animals sometimes it's

2401
01:57:32,288 --> 01:57:33,824
Seems like it's nothing but that

2402
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:34,848
Start to finish

2403
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:40,992
But things are starting to change in this. We're coming in to write early 20th century

2404
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:47,648
And you can't necessarily get away with things that people got away with forever nation-states free

2405
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:48,672
Example Army

2406
01:57:49,184 --> 01:57:50,464
Ours kingdoms

2407
01:57:51,488 --> 01:57:53,792
Warlords whatever you want to say mean if your

2408
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:58,912
If you don't settle philosophical experiment if a tree falls in the forest and there's no one there to hear it either really make a sound

2409
01:57:59,424 --> 01:58:00,192
We'll have some

2410
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:06,592
Terrible Massacre occurs if some out-of-the-way people in a remote region in no one ever hears about it outside the little okay

2411
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:07,360
Cavity

2412
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:09,408
Does it really matter

2413
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:11,200
Well

2414
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:12,736
In this time.

2415
01:58:13,504 --> 01:58:18,624
And when you're coming into the 20th century here now we have telegraphs and communication on that level

2416
01:58:19,648 --> 01:58:21,184
Well it's starting to really matter

2417
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:22,720
First of all

2418
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:28,352
Good luck trying to keep it a secret that account we just read you slipped out didn't it it wasn't the only one

2419
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:29,888
Would that have happened

2420
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:32,192
500 years before this time

2421
01:58:33,216 --> 01:58:36,800
The second important point is when it slips out at people in other countries hear of it

2422
01:58:37,312 --> 01:58:40,640
They have the ability if there's enough of them and they're angry enough

2423
01:58:41,152 --> 01:58:41,920
To make you

2424
01:58:42,176 --> 01:58:42,944
Beautiful earrings

2425
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:48,832
And this will be a key part in The Story 2 when public opinion in other countries

2426
01:58:49,344 --> 01:58:55,488
Begins to try to make you conform to their standards

2427
01:58:55,744 --> 01:58:56,256
20th century

2428
01:58:57,536 --> 01:58:59,072
Another standard is changing

2429
01:58:59,328 --> 01:59:00,864
Is the outright idea

2430
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:04,960
Is the right of one country to count to another and take it over

2431
01:59:05,472 --> 01:59:10,336
And it's been pretty well-established and understood in the 20th century starts becoming on fool

2432
01:59:11,872 --> 01:59:13,408
Especially amongst the more

2433
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:16,736
Cool Powers mini old-fashioned ones like

2434
01:59:17,248 --> 01:59:23,392
The Germans and the Russians of course not the Japanese may still think you can go in there and take other people over but we more sophisticated power than your

2435
01:59:23,648 --> 01:59:25,696
Is it morally wrong

2436
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:27,744
Meanwhile they'll go in establishing

2437
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:28,768
Protectorate over someone

2438
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:30,304
Which is a tree about

2439
01:59:30,816 --> 01:59:35,680
Agreement we have with them to safeguard their needs and help them development of an easy what I'm saying mean

2440
01:59:36,448 --> 01:59:39,520
It will require many more layers of diplomatic cover

2441
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:43,872
To conquer or control areas in the 20th century

2442
01:59:44,128 --> 01:59:48,224
In the old days you could just take them over while they were still powers that live by the old rules

2443
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:51,040
And it will be a public opinion price for doing that

2444
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:54,112
I should also point out

2445
01:59:54,624 --> 01:59:56,672
The training of the Japanese military

2446
01:59:57,184 --> 01:59:59,744
Was unlike the training of any other

2447
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,536
Great power military inside

2448
02:00:02,048 --> 02:00:07,168
It's hard for me to find any organized military in the late 19th or 20th century

2449
02:00:07,424 --> 02:00:10,496
The train their soldiers the way the Japanese were trained

2450
02:00:10,752 --> 02:00:16,896
I mean here in the US for example for a long time I don't know if they do this anymore but Marines for example used to have combat with each other

2451
02:00:17,152 --> 02:00:17,664
Bootcamp

2452
02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:20,736
In basically that use weapons that are sticks

2453
02:00:20,992 --> 02:00:21,760
With tatted at

2454
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:22,784
So you're fighting

2455
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:24,576
Even had a hand combat like that

2456
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:30,720
The Japanese in the second world war before I don't know if it comes into this. I have to be very honest with you

2457
02:00:30,976 --> 02:00:33,280
I tried to find research I don't know if it goes back into this.

2458
02:00:33,792 --> 02:00:35,840
But in the second world war in the 1930s

2459
02:00:36,096 --> 02:00:38,912
Japanese troops will often be trained

2460
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:40,704
On live people

2461
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:44,800
There are photos and they're horrible that you can go and see online

2462
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:47,616
Japanese soldiers bayoneting

2463
02:00:47,872 --> 02:00:53,248
In training exercises with the other recruits who's turn is not now watching

2464
02:00:53,504 --> 02:00:54,272
Bayoneting

2465
02:00:54,784 --> 02:00:56,576
Chinese prisoners just hands are tied

2466
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:59,904
Is multiple photos of of Japanese

2467
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:04,256
Captives were what not tied to stakes and have bayonet practice and sword

2468
02:01:04,512 --> 02:01:05,024
I mean

2469
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:08,352
There's an account by Japanese officer who talks about

2470
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:10,400
His training involving

2471
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:12,448
Having to slice the head off somebody

2472
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:13,984
And if you look

2473
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:14,752
At

2474
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:21,152
Paintings of the sino-japanese war made by Japanese artist there's some that

2475
02:01:21,408 --> 02:01:22,176
Show the

2476
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:25,760
Mass beheadings of Chinese captives with samurai sword

2477
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:32,928
Japan's victory over China had big ramifications because it was the equivalent

2478
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:36,000
Of throwing blood and Chum

2479
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:41,888
Into the shark-infested colonial Waters and and telling the rest of the world

2480
02:01:42,144 --> 02:01:45,728
That the recent victories by Britain in the Opium Wars and what not

2481
02:01:45,984 --> 02:01:50,848
What is the sign of temporary Chinese inability to deal with Western military technology

2482
02:01:51,104 --> 02:01:57,248
It was the beginning of the end of maybe this Chinese Imperial Dynasty there was obviously some sort of a rotting house

2483
02:01:57,760 --> 02:02:00,320
Apparent after the Japanese kick the door down

2484
02:02:00,832 --> 02:02:01,344
And that

2485
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:07,744
Lead to something called the Boxer Rebellion where western territories ended up bringing in troops Eight Powers only one of them

2486
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,536
Asian one guess who it was

2487
02:02:10,048 --> 02:02:11,584
Yes in Japanese

2488
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:14,912
And they sent as many troops as everyone else put together

2489
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:20,544
Basically you know throwing are Laden with the club you belong in the club where here you know

2490
02:02:21,312 --> 02:02:24,384
Looking at a map they probably had more of a right to be there than anyone else

2491
02:02:26,688 --> 02:02:30,784
The next big foreign-policy milestone on the way to work story here involves

2492
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:34,624
A war that the Japanese get involved with in 1904

2493
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:35,904
Against the Russians

2494
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:43,584
The Russians were one of the Three Lions and said for the Peace of Asia you can't have this Port Arthur area just not right

2495
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:48,448
And forced the Japanese to give in the Japanese always thought that Russia really wanted it for themselves

2496
02:02:48,704 --> 02:02:54,848
Within three years the Washington taken its confirming the Japanese suspicions and they started fortifying Port Arthur in the whole thing

2497
02:02:55,104 --> 02:02:56,640
Sony 1904

2498
02:02:56,896 --> 02:02:59,712
When the Japanese had decided to know for all sorts of reasons

2499
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:01,248
That they still needed

2500
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:03,040
To control this area

2501
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:04,576
They launched let's just

2502
02:03:04,832 --> 02:03:05,344
Holiday

2503
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:09,440
Free aircraft version of a Pearl Harbor

2504
02:03:09,696 --> 02:03:11,744
On the Russian Far Eastern Fleet

2505
02:03:12,512 --> 02:03:16,352
Having torpedo boats go in there and attack Russian ships

2506
02:03:16,608 --> 02:03:20,192
About 3 hours before war was officially declared

2507
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:22,752
In short order

2508
02:03:23,008 --> 02:03:24,544
The Japanese will

2509
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:26,848
Destroy the Russian Far Eastern Fleet

2510
02:03:28,384 --> 02:03:34,528
The Russian leaders around the Tsar or so caught off guard by this they didn't think the Japanese would attack them or didn't have it in

2511
02:03:35,296 --> 02:03:36,576
Talking white power

2512
02:03:36,832 --> 02:03:41,440
Send the fleet that they have in the Baltic the Baltic Fleet from up near Finland

2513
02:03:41,696 --> 02:03:46,816
All the way to Japan to teach these oriental people a lesson

2514
02:03:47,328 --> 02:03:51,680
Takes months to get there and when they get there the Japanese beat that to

2515
02:03:52,192 --> 02:03:55,520
In stunning fashion is not like a close fight at all

2516
02:03:58,336 --> 02:04:01,152
On land it's more of a harder slog

2517
02:04:01,408 --> 02:04:02,944
4 simple reasons I mean we're

2518
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:05,504
Like a decade away from the first World War

2519
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:08,320
And all of those lessons they are going to learn

2520
02:04:08,576 --> 02:04:13,696
In the first year of the first world war like in the you can't charge machine guns frontally

2521
02:04:13,952 --> 02:04:19,072
The impact of the defense I mean all the stuff you're going to learn the Japanese get to learn against the Russians on land

2522
02:04:19,328 --> 02:04:21,120
And there are horrible photo showing

2523
02:04:21,376 --> 02:04:22,400
I mean like

2524
02:04:22,912 --> 02:04:28,032
Walls of Japanese soldiers dead in front of these fortified positions because

2525
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:34,176
You often led by an officer with the samurai sword they blindly in phonetically charged

2526
02:04:35,968 --> 02:04:36,736
Are you don't have to

2527
02:04:36,992 --> 02:04:43,136
To think of yourselves as Samurai to do that because we all know the European powers will do that in less than 10 years

2528
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:45,952
Turn the last what you see here

2529
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:48,256
Is the Japanese finding out

2530
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:52,352
At the cost of this path on which they have embarked

2531
02:04:52,608 --> 02:04:54,656
To emulate the colonial powers

2532
02:04:55,168 --> 02:04:56,960
He's not going to come as easy as

2533
02:04:57,472 --> 02:05:01,312
That War in China you're not going to lose 1500 or less dead

2534
02:05:01,824 --> 02:05:07,968
You know down the road here it's a commitment and against the Russians in the russo-japanese war the Japanese lose some

2535
02:05:08,224 --> 02:05:10,528
Something more like 40000 dead

2536
02:05:11,296 --> 02:05:13,088
Directions to by the way it's nasty

2537
02:05:13,344 --> 02:05:14,880
World War 1 fighting

2538
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:16,928
Before World War 1

2539
02:05:17,184 --> 02:05:21,792
And it's all the early War stuff when everybody you know has to learn the terrible lessons

2540
02:05:22,304 --> 02:05:24,864
You know about charging into artillery fungus it

2541
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:30,496
Nasty and horrible and then there's disease to as all these wars during this time. Have a terrible problem with

2542
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:37,664
It also and this is another lesson of modern war the other great Powers will learn very soon

2543
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:38,688
It takes

2544
02:05:38,944 --> 02:05:45,088
A horrible toll Modern War does on your economy and the Russian economy in the Japanese economy will instantly

2545
02:05:45,344 --> 02:05:51,232
Start to feel the pinch and then the stretch and it gets to the point with the Japanese secretly go to American president

2546
02:05:51,488 --> 02:05:56,352
Teddy Roosevelt and ask if he can get both countries out of this mess and broke or some kind of a deal

2547
02:05:56,864 --> 02:05:57,888
What she does

2548
02:05:58,656 --> 02:06:02,752
And wins the Nobel Peace Prize for by the way

2549
02:06:03,264 --> 02:06:08,896
But a decent number of people in Japan think that the American president in his peace deal

2550
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:11,200
Rip the Japanese off

2551
02:06:11,712 --> 02:06:14,016
The thing eventually won this war

2552
02:06:14,528 --> 02:06:16,576
I didn't come out of it with a treaty that

2553
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:18,112
It looked anything like

2554
02:06:18,368 --> 02:06:20,160
Hitting the jackpot did

2555
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:23,232
In the first sino-japanese war

2556
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:25,024
This is more like a treaty

2557
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:26,560
Denver countries that

2558
02:06:27,072 --> 02:06:33,216
How to tie rather than one at least where the Japanese people reading a bias press that magnify their victories

2559
02:06:33,472 --> 02:06:35,008
I think that they had dominated

2560
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:37,568
Lose all these lives

2561
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:39,616
All this money

2562
02:06:40,128 --> 02:06:42,432
Beat the Russians in all these battles

2563
02:06:42,688 --> 02:06:46,528
And not get significant territory or a big Financial indemnity

2564
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:52,416
And the terms of the agreement ending the russo-japanese war are made public

2565
02:06:53,184 --> 02:06:57,024
There will be violent riots in Japan the people will die

2566
02:06:58,304 --> 02:07:01,632
The population there pretty much every history book you want to point out

2567
02:07:01,888 --> 02:07:04,192
The people there take it as another grievance

2568
02:07:05,216 --> 02:07:09,056
The Japanese are holding onto grievances like the rain man character did

2569
02:07:09,312 --> 02:07:15,456
In the movie of the same name and they remember vividly that we call it the triple intervention screwjob

2570
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:21,856
That ended the sino-japanese war where a bunch of Western Powers who never would have settled for someone else doing that to them

2571
02:07:22,368 --> 02:07:25,184
Treated the Japanese in a way that the Japanese took personally

2572
02:07:26,464 --> 02:07:29,792
They saw his changing the rules of the game and the Japanese start winning

2573
02:07:30,816 --> 02:07:33,120
And they often sought in racial terms

2574
02:07:33,376 --> 02:07:35,424
And maybe not incorrectly

2575
02:07:35,936 --> 02:07:37,216
Well now it was happening again

2576
02:07:37,472 --> 02:07:39,008
Not only was it happening again

2577
02:07:39,776 --> 02:07:45,920
Body was happening despite the fact that the Japanese had taken proactive measures to see that it didn't again in 1902

2578
02:07:46,176 --> 02:07:47,712
They signed an alliance with Britain

2579
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:54,624
Part of the reason he did it was they were hoping that if you have a great power on your side bunch of other great Powers won't come in like they did last

2580
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:57,184
Best time and try to steal your kill

2581
02:07:57,440 --> 02:08:00,768
And yet here with the agreement ending the russo-japanese war

2582
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:04,608
It looks like it made no difference and your kill got stolen again

2583
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:07,168
Goes on the list of grievances

2584
02:08:09,216 --> 02:08:12,288
But it's very possible that the Japanese citizenry

2585
02:08:13,056 --> 02:08:14,592
Ed unrealistic expectations

2586
02:08:15,616 --> 02:08:21,760
This is the way our Taggart Murphy describes what Japan had one for itself in a decade including two Wars here

2587
02:08:22,528 --> 02:08:24,320
And it is far from

2588
02:08:24,576 --> 02:08:25,344
Auntie rights quote

2589
02:08:26,112 --> 02:08:31,232
Japan's victory in the russo-japanese war was if anything even more striking than its

2590
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:34,048
Triumph 10 years earlier over the Ching Chinese

2591
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:40,704
For the first time since the fall of Constantinople a non-Christian non-western power defeated the forces

2592
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:41,984
Is it a Christian Nation

2593
02:08:42,496 --> 02:08:44,544
Both the Japanese Navy and army

2594
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:46,336
Acquitted themselves brilliantly

2595
02:08:46,592 --> 02:08:52,480
With the Navy sinking much of the Russian Fleet off the coast of Korea while the armies battles on the Korean peninsula

2596
02:08:52,736 --> 02:08:56,832
Culminating in the siege of Port Arthur led to Japanese Mastery on land

2597
02:08:57,344 --> 02:09:00,416
Some of the consequences of the two wars were similar he writes

2598
02:09:00,672 --> 02:09:01,696
Like the chain

2599
02:09:01,952 --> 02:09:04,512
The tsarist regime never recovered its prestige

2600
02:09:04,768 --> 02:09:07,840
It defeats at the stage of the 1917 Revolution

2601
02:09:08,096 --> 02:09:08,864
Meanwhile

2602
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:15,264
Just as Tokyo had picked up Taiwan as a spoil of the earlier War so the 1905 settlement final

2603
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:16,800
Lilliput Korea into its orbit

2604
02:09:17,312 --> 02:09:19,360
Tokyo had to use an ugly trick

2605
02:09:19,616 --> 02:09:20,128
He says

2606
02:09:20,384 --> 02:09:22,432
Divorce the abdication of careers

2607
02:09:22,688 --> 02:09:27,040
King Cole Jung in order to legally convert Korea into an outright colony

2608
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:29,344
But that Ricky says with probably no worse

2609
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:34,208
Done with the United States in 1893 to overthrow Queen let me know akane

2610
02:09:34,464 --> 02:09:36,768
And incorporate Hawaii into the American Empire

2611
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:41,120
Japan he says we're behaving pretty much according to the standards of the time

2612
02:09:41,376 --> 02:09:43,936
More to the point in fewer than 40 years he rides

2613
02:09:44,448 --> 02:09:46,496
The country has transformed itself from a week

2614
02:09:46,752 --> 02:09:52,896
Tottering polity into the preeminent nation-state of Asia and the first non-western country and centuries

2615
02:09:53,152 --> 02:09:55,200
That the great Powers had to admit into their ranks

2616
02:09:55,712 --> 02:09:59,296
But the bill for that transformation had not yet been paid in full

2617
02:09:59,808 --> 02:10:02,880
It turned out to be far higher than anyone at the time could have imagined

2618
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:04,672
And quote

2619
02:10:06,464 --> 02:10:12,096
The reaction to Japan's victory over the Russians a historian Andrew Gordon says runs the gamut from outrage

2620
02:10:12,608 --> 02:10:13,632
To admiration

2621
02:10:14,144 --> 02:10:15,424
Big guys like the emperor

2622
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:16,960
Germany dekeyser

2623
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:20,800
Who is a believer in something he called the yellow peril

2624
02:10:21,056 --> 02:10:21,824
That all these

2625
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:25,152
Innumerable Asian people like ants will join together someday

2626
02:10:25,408 --> 02:10:26,688
Swamp Christendom

2627
02:10:27,712 --> 02:10:28,224
You believe that

2628
02:10:28,992 --> 02:10:33,600
I like that it looks like the Japanese have emerged just the tip of the spear that will lead

2629
02:10:33,856 --> 02:10:35,904
The Asians to swamp Christendom

2630
02:10:36,928 --> 02:10:38,464
Would you have a lot of other European

2631
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:41,024
States that all of a sudden have become admirers

2632
02:10:41,536 --> 02:10:42,560
Some of them head turned

2633
02:10:42,816 --> 02:10:48,192
In a become fans of the Japanese after the victory over China but after the victory over Russia a bunch more people

2634
02:10:48,448 --> 02:10:48,960
Will show up in

2635
02:10:49,216 --> 02:10:50,752
In Japan you know when

2636
02:10:51,008 --> 02:10:56,128
The historians say that they kind of join the great power Club it's more official than you think they actually change

2637
02:10:56,384 --> 02:11:02,528
You know the level of the ambassadors that are sent to your country all of a sudden you know when people are debating things like in the United States

2638
02:11:02,784 --> 02:11:06,368
Will be debated at the Japanese are taking over Korea or not no be

2639
02:11:06,624 --> 02:11:12,768
People who write back even experts and diplomats were going absolutely know what they're doing over there the same thing we're doing in the Philippines another

2640
02:11:13,024 --> 02:11:15,584
You really do get special consideration

2641
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:16,864
As a member of the

2642
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:19,424
In a predator Club as opposed to the parade

2643
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:20,192
Club

2644
02:11:21,472 --> 02:11:23,520
Another Viewpoint that you can look at

2645
02:11:23,776 --> 02:11:25,312
Hits from the colonial victim

2646
02:11:25,568 --> 02:11:26,080
Viewpoint of

2647
02:11:26,336 --> 02:11:27,360
People like the Korean

2648
02:11:29,152 --> 02:11:29,920
Weather history they will suffer

2649
02:11:30,176 --> 02:11:30,688
Terribly

2650
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:32,480
So from their viewpoint

2651
02:11:32,736 --> 02:11:33,504
Decision day

2652
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:36,576
In a good thing this is a tragedy and once again

2653
02:11:36,832 --> 02:11:38,624
It keeps them from Rolling themselves

2654
02:11:39,392 --> 02:11:40,928
They will be seeing by

2655
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:46,560
The Japanese government the same way that Colonial victims were often seen by the mother country

2656
02:11:47,072 --> 02:11:48,352
Sometimes especially if the

2657
02:11:48,608 --> 02:11:52,448
Colonial victims are of a different skin color they will be seen as less than human

2658
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:54,496
We're certainly less than Japanese

2659
02:11:56,288 --> 02:11:58,336
Second-class citizens from the get-go

2660
02:12:00,384 --> 02:12:01,152
But finally

2661
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:02,944
There's another interesting group

2662
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:04,480
The people whose reaction here

2663
02:12:04,992 --> 02:12:05,760
Is important

2664
02:12:06,528 --> 02:12:07,808
The other non-white

2665
02:12:08,064 --> 02:12:08,576
Victims

2666
02:12:08,832 --> 02:12:09,600
Colonialism

2667
02:12:10,368 --> 02:12:12,160
Oh I'm just seeing something that in

2668
02:12:12,416 --> 02:12:12,928
Spires

2669
02:12:13,952 --> 02:12:19,840
They've seen a non-white power punch the great powers in the nose in a way they could only dream of and

2670
02:12:20,608 --> 02:12:22,656
It gives them an opportunity to dream of

2671
02:12:23,424 --> 02:12:27,008
Potential of maybe even with Japanese help doing that down the road

2672
02:12:27,776 --> 02:12:29,056
This idea maybe the

2673
02:12:29,312 --> 02:12:31,104
The Japanese emergence in Asia

2674
02:12:31,872 --> 02:12:33,408
Is the beginning of

2675
02:12:34,176 --> 02:12:38,016
The reality of a bunch of ideas that are sometimes called pan-Asian is

2676
02:12:38,272 --> 02:12:38,784
The idea of

2677
02:12:39,552 --> 02:12:42,880
It's basically the Kaisers worst nightmare come true

2678
02:12:43,136 --> 02:12:44,672
In a way that helps a bunch of people

2679
02:12:45,184 --> 02:12:47,744
It would love to gain their freedom from non-asian powers

2680
02:12:48,768 --> 02:12:49,792
Victory Andrew Gordon rights

2681
02:12:50,048 --> 02:12:50,560
Quote

2682
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:55,680
In places as distant as turkey Iran and India

2683
02:12:55,936 --> 02:12:58,240
Over the several years following the war

2684
02:12:58,496 --> 02:13:03,872
Japan's victory over Russia was invoked by modernizers and Anti-Imperialist activists

2685
02:13:04,128 --> 02:13:10,272
An inspiring harbinger of their own possibilities for nation building and independence from the West

2686
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:11,552
And quote

2687
02:13:13,856 --> 02:13:16,672
The reason this is going to get weird though

2688
02:13:17,184 --> 02:13:21,024
Is this is a real thing the idea of how this might be a useful

2689
02:13:21,536 --> 02:13:22,560
In a way for

2690
02:13:22,816 --> 02:13:27,168
Colonial victims to throw off the Yoke of their oppressors with the help of powerful

2691
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:32,544
People in their region maybe even with the same skin color let's look at it from a racial standpoint

2692
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:38,944
An opportunity to be seized maybe right and there are Japanese intellectuals and an entire

2693
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:44,064
In a political history in Japan of people arguing that this should be what your pan does

2694
02:13:44,576 --> 02:13:50,720
Free the region lead the region become the economic Powerhouse The Diplomatic superpower in all these think it's a way Japan could have

2695
02:13:50,976 --> 02:13:51,488
Gone

2696
02:13:52,512 --> 02:13:53,280
The missed opportunity

2697
02:13:53,536 --> 02:13:54,304
Tragedy

2698
02:13:54,816 --> 02:13:56,096
If you're looking at it from people like

2699
02:13:56,608 --> 02:13:57,888
Saborearte in August

2700
02:13:58,144 --> 02:14:00,192
Viewpoint he wrote a book called The Pacific War

2701
02:14:00,448 --> 02:14:02,496
I may have said this in the late 1960s

2702
02:14:02,752 --> 02:14:03,776
And the point of the book

2703
02:14:04,032 --> 02:14:06,336
Is to try to figure out whether the Japanese public

2704
02:14:06,592 --> 02:14:07,616
Could have avoided

2705
02:14:08,128 --> 02:14:09,664
You know the terrible descent

2706
02:14:10,176 --> 02:14:10,944
Into war

2707
02:14:11,712 --> 02:14:13,504
Well this is the time. Where that up

2708
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:15,040
Trinity best presents itself

2709
02:14:15,296 --> 02:14:20,672
And one of the ways because of Japanese probably just so you know they're almost entirely. Entirely almost entirely

2710
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:22,208
Supportive of the idea of

2711
02:14:22,464 --> 02:14:25,280
Japan having this real huge superpower role in the region

2712
02:14:25,792 --> 02:14:27,328
But how that roll manifest

2713
02:14:27,584 --> 02:14:32,960
Peaceful leadership versus you know some sort of military Colonial domination will that's what's being discussed

2714
02:14:35,264 --> 02:14:36,544
Samuro INR

2715
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:40,128
Seems to Lament The Lost opportunity when he writes quote

2716
02:14:41,152 --> 02:14:47,296
Is Japan a been a champion of Asian nationalism and really desired Independence and progress for it

2717
02:14:47,552 --> 02:14:51,904
Which neighbor and had joined with China to liberate Asia from Western imperialism

2718
02:14:52,416 --> 02:14:54,976
The subsequent history of the region would have been vastly

2719
02:14:57,024 --> 02:14:59,584
Japan would have identified with Chinese nationalism

2720
02:15:00,096 --> 02:15:05,984
Help to end foreign domination and made a real effort to create enduring good relations with the new China

2721
02:15:06,496 --> 02:15:07,776
Unfortunately.

2722
02:15:08,288 --> 02:15:09,824
Japanese leaders chose the opposite

2723
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:10,848
The course of action

2724
02:15:11,104 --> 02:15:14,176
They competed with the West for a place at the imperialist table

2725
02:15:14,432 --> 02:15:15,968
The slice of the Chinese melon

2726
02:15:16,736 --> 02:15:17,248
And quote

2727
02:15:18,784 --> 02:15:19,552
Don't have to say

2728
02:15:19,808 --> 02:15:21,344
Pan-Asian ism is intox

2729
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:24,160
Educating is an idea even to me is for the

2730
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:26,208
Alternative history possibilities

2731
02:15:26,720 --> 02:15:28,256
We can you imagine with all of the

2732
02:15:28,512 --> 02:15:32,608
An independence movement in underground Rebel things that we're going on in all these different

2733
02:15:32,864 --> 02:15:36,192
In a colonial victims in Asia during this time. If somebody had

2734
02:15:36,448 --> 02:15:42,592
In a single swoop coming informed an organization and Alliance System framework in just that everyone can join

2735
02:15:42,848 --> 02:15:43,360
Right now

2736
02:15:44,896 --> 02:15:46,944
What's more than missing ingredient for all of those

2737
02:15:47,456 --> 02:15:51,296
You know people that were under the colonial thumb is some sort of military that could

2738
02:15:51,808 --> 02:15:54,112
In a fight off a military from the great Powers will

2739
02:15:54,368 --> 02:15:56,160
All of a sudden that's what you have in Japan

2740
02:15:56,416 --> 02:16:02,048
The possibilities if it took off could make the fall of the Soviet Union look like a blip on the historical map

2741
02:16:04,096 --> 02:16:05,376
But there were a lot of things sort of

2742
02:16:06,144 --> 02:16:12,288
It working against that may be the number one thing being that the Japanese were not about to let historians point this out

2743
02:16:12,544 --> 02:16:14,080
Japanese were not about to

2744
02:16:14,592 --> 02:16:17,664
Submerged themself in some sort of grand

2745
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:21,504
Beijing United Nations where they were just one of

2746
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:23,296
A bunch of different flowers

2747
02:16:23,552 --> 02:16:26,624
The Japanese were in a place where they were thinking of themselves

2748
02:16:27,136 --> 02:16:30,208
I just wanted to let you write It To The Head and Shoulders of the world but

2749
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:32,512
The Japanese are starting to get some of the

2750
02:16:33,536 --> 02:16:35,072
I would say by products

2751
02:16:35,584 --> 02:16:37,376
Maybe you look at it that way and you have a right to

2752
02:16:37,632 --> 02:16:40,704
Others might say necessary precursors

2753
02:16:41,216 --> 02:16:44,032
Colonialism you know in for a penny in for a pound

2754
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:49,664
The Japanese are exhibiting the same sorts of racial superiority

2755
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:50,944
Tendencies

2756
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:52,992
But all the other Colonial powers

2757
02:16:53,248 --> 02:16:55,296
Their colonizing Asia due to

2758
02:16:56,832 --> 02:16:59,648
Like we said about Shintoism and Bushido and

2759
02:16:59,904 --> 02:17:02,208
Concepts like that the Japanese state

2760
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:03,488
Will Warp

2761
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:07,584
This idea of Pan Asian ISM for its own purposes

2762
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:08,864
In the Second World War

2763
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:09,632
Play something called

2764
02:17:10,144 --> 02:17:10,912
Concept

2765
02:17:11,168 --> 02:17:14,752
Call the greater East Asia co-prosperity sphere yes

2766
02:17:15,008 --> 02:17:15,776
It's a mouthful

2767
02:17:16,288 --> 02:17:17,824
But that's the official name

2768
02:17:19,616 --> 02:17:20,384
This is

2769
02:17:21,152 --> 02:17:21,664
One of my

2770
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:22,688
History professors back

2771
02:17:22,944 --> 02:17:23,456
Hocking College

2772
02:17:24,224 --> 02:17:25,504
This is the marketing

2773
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:26,272
Front

2774
02:17:26,528 --> 02:17:29,600
The Japan uses to disguise their War aims

2775
02:17:30,112 --> 02:17:36,256
But that's a very simplistic Allied way of looking at it because truthfully a lot of people bought into this idea weather

2776
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:39,584
Whether or not the government did and some of the people in the government certainly did

2777
02:17:41,376 --> 02:17:42,912
Problem with the idea of creating

2778
02:17:43,424 --> 02:17:44,192
A giant

2779
02:17:44,448 --> 02:17:46,496
Asia for Asians

2780
02:17:47,008 --> 02:17:47,520
Renee

2781
02:17:48,032 --> 02:17:48,544
Hemisphere

2782
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:49,312
Freed

2783
02:17:49,824 --> 02:17:50,336
By the

2784
02:17:50,848 --> 02:17:55,456
Sacrifice of Japanese soldiers willingly giving up their lives for the greater good

2785
02:17:55,712 --> 02:17:56,992
Write up something every mother

2786
02:17:57,504 --> 02:18:01,088
And father can get behind when they send their son off to the Imperial Japanese Army

2787
02:18:03,136 --> 02:18:04,416
Katakana live up to that

2788
02:18:05,184 --> 02:18:05,696
On the ground

2789
02:18:06,208 --> 02:18:06,720
Trijicon

2790
02:18:07,488 --> 02:18:09,280
Cloak yourself in the robe of

2791
02:18:10,304 --> 02:18:11,584
Asian liberation

2792
02:18:12,096 --> 02:18:13,376
And then treat the people

2793
02:18:14,144 --> 02:18:17,984
But you liberated worse than the people that you liberated them from

2794
02:18:20,032 --> 02:18:21,568
The 1910 Japan

2795
02:18:21,824 --> 02:18:23,616
Officially annexes Korea

2796
02:18:24,896 --> 02:18:25,408
They had

2797
02:18:25,664 --> 02:18:30,272
Acquire the sphere of influence rights officially in a treaty when the Japanese

2798
02:18:30,528 --> 02:18:31,808
Is Russia ended

2799
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:36,928
Five years later boom they just take it out right it's the first real colony of Japan

2800
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:39,744
Of course they had Taiwan for a while now too

2801
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:44,352
So Japan goes from a country writing about joining the colonial great powers

2802
02:18:44,608 --> 02:18:45,632
To one of them

2803
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:48,192
And they don't act a whole lot differently

2804
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:51,520
Then the countries that they wanted to be like

2805
02:18:53,568 --> 02:18:59,200
The Korean economy becomes a subsidiary of the Japanese economy for the purposes of the Japanese economy

2806
02:18:59,456 --> 02:19:00,736
And the people in Korea

2807
02:19:01,248 --> 02:19:03,552
Are treated like second-class citizens

2808
02:19:03,808 --> 02:19:05,344
And sometimes they're treated like

2809
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:06,112
Chattel

2810
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:08,416
The brutalities

2811
02:19:08,928 --> 02:19:10,208
Sometimes are horrible

2812
02:19:10,464 --> 02:19:13,536
The Koreans would sometimes have the gall to get out and

2813
02:19:13,792 --> 02:19:17,120
Demand their rights and they would be shot down at protest mean

2814
02:19:17,888 --> 02:19:18,656
This is not

2815
02:19:19,168 --> 02:19:24,288
The kind of thing that goes on the greater East Asia co-prosperity sphere marketing brochure

2816
02:19:25,056 --> 02:19:26,336
In a Windows come out

2817
02:19:28,128 --> 02:19:32,480
Office of Boracay Onaga discusses this period in Japanese history and mentioned something else

2818
02:19:32,992 --> 02:19:33,760
I'll be in the marketing

2819
02:19:34,016 --> 02:19:34,528
Materials

2820
02:19:35,552 --> 02:19:36,064
Jesus quote

2821
02:19:36,832 --> 02:19:42,976
The wars for control of Korea exceeded their objective and escalated into a general Advance into China

2822
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:49,120
Policies towards Taiwan and Korea became more ruthless as pressure increased on China

2823
02:19:49,376 --> 02:19:53,472
Resistance to annexation in both areas was mercilessly crushed

2824
02:19:54,496 --> 02:20:00,640
I discovered he writes a vivid example of that cruelty among the papers of a military man assigned

2825
02:20:00,896 --> 02:20:03,968
Into Taiwan immediately after the island was ceded to Japan

2826
02:20:04,736 --> 02:20:06,272
It was a photograph he writes

2827
02:20:06,528 --> 02:20:10,880
I'm Japanese troops beheading to pigtail Taiwanese Rebels

2828
02:20:11,136 --> 02:20:13,184
Apparently have been captured in the skirmish

2829
02:20:14,208 --> 02:20:20,352
The horrible scene foreshadow the atrocities committed in every area touched by Japanese forces during the

2830
02:20:20,608 --> 02:20:21,120
Pacific War

2831
02:20:21,888 --> 02:20:22,400
And quote

2832
02:20:24,448 --> 02:20:25,472
Now the Japanese

2833
02:20:25,728 --> 02:20:26,240
Certainly

2834
02:20:26,752 --> 02:20:27,264
Atrocities

2835
02:20:27,776 --> 02:20:28,800
On a wide scale

2836
02:20:29,824 --> 02:20:33,408
But we should make some cultural allowances I think shouldn't we

2837
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:34,688
Four different

2838
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:36,224
Example

2839
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:38,272
Let's take something that bothered

2840
02:20:38,784 --> 02:20:42,368
The Allied soldiers and awful lot and it wouldn't bother me to

2841
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:44,416
The idea of cutting people's heads

2842
02:20:47,232 --> 02:20:48,768
I find this particularly hard

2843
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:49,792
Myself

2844
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:51,584
Let me tell you what I mean

2845
02:20:52,608 --> 02:20:54,400
In 1944 there was a photo

2846
02:20:54,656 --> 02:20:56,192
I believe was taken off of it

2847
02:20:56,960 --> 02:20:57,472
Body of a

2848
02:20:57,728 --> 02:20:58,752
Dead Japanese soldier

2849
02:21:00,288 --> 02:21:01,568
And the photo was forwarded

2850
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:02,848
To come later

2851
02:21:03,104 --> 02:21:04,640
Press Outlet I think of United States

2852
02:21:04,896 --> 02:21:05,408
Life Pablo

2853
02:21:06,176 --> 02:21:10,016
And life was huge there's no way to describe how big Life Magazine was in that Society

2854
02:21:10,272 --> 02:21:10,784
Time

2855
02:21:11,296 --> 02:21:11,808
I need a publicist

2856
02:21:13,088 --> 02:21:15,392
I think you could call this photo arguably

2857
02:21:15,904 --> 02:21:16,416
Top

2858
02:21:16,672 --> 02:21:21,024
3 most upsetting photos for the Allied populations

2859
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:24,352
In terms of stirring them to a white-hot anger

2860
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:26,144
The photo depicted

2861
02:21:26,912 --> 02:21:28,960
An Australian Commando

2862
02:21:29,472 --> 02:21:30,240
Believe

2863
02:21:30,496 --> 02:21:31,008
Triggered

2864
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:33,056
On the island of New Guinea

2865
02:21:33,568 --> 02:21:34,592
By natives

2866
02:21:34,848 --> 02:21:35,616
I think incent

2867
02:21:36,128 --> 02:21:37,920
To the Japanese on the island the Japanese

2868
02:21:38,176 --> 02:21:39,200
Interrogated him

2869
02:21:39,456 --> 02:21:40,480
Took him to a beach

2870
02:21:40,736 --> 02:21:41,760
Put them on the sand

2871
02:21:42,016 --> 02:21:44,832
The photo shows a blindfold on I think it's like a

2872
02:21:45,088 --> 02:21:49,184
Sticky blindfold I don't think it's actually wrapped around his head so it looks kind of particularly modern

2873
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:49,952
For some reason

2874
02:21:50,464 --> 02:21:52,256
He's got his arms pinion with a rope

2875
02:21:52,768 --> 02:21:56,352
There was a semicircle of Japanese soldiers around watching

2876
02:21:56,864 --> 02:21:57,888
And the

2877
02:21:58,656 --> 02:22:00,960
Australian is in the process of having his head coach

2878
02:22:03,264 --> 02:22:05,568
There's a Japanese officer standing above him

2879
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:08,640
And he's swinging the samurai sword down and leave

2880
02:22:08,896 --> 02:22:10,688
Photographer caught in mid stroke

2881
02:22:12,736 --> 02:22:14,272
Now let me point out

2882
02:22:14,528 --> 02:22:18,880
There's going to be some cultural elements that I have to deal with and you might too

2883
02:22:19,136 --> 02:22:19,648
When you look at

2884
02:22:19,904 --> 02:22:24,768
This is the same sort of cultural elements that the Allied populations had to deal with that the Allied soldiers had to deal with

2885
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:26,816
Cutting people's heads off with medieval

2886
02:22:27,328 --> 02:22:27,840
Straight up

2887
02:22:28,608 --> 02:22:30,144
It's barbaric it looks seduced

2888
02:22:31,936 --> 02:22:32,960
It looks like something

2889
02:22:33,472 --> 02:22:36,032
That European countries for example having done

2890
02:22:36,544 --> 02:22:38,592
Set the 1600 when Japan

2891
02:22:38,848 --> 02:22:39,616
And it was last

2892
02:22:40,384 --> 02:22:42,432
Opened before the recent.

2893
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:43,968
They froze their develop

2894
02:22:44,224 --> 02:22:44,736
Maybe

2895
02:22:44,992 --> 02:22:45,760
Some might think

2896
02:22:46,784 --> 02:22:48,576
But let's remember this is a cultural

2897
02:22:49,088 --> 02:22:54,208
In places like China they were still pretty comfortable cutting people's heads off to

2898
02:22:54,976 --> 02:22:56,512
And if we're getting into this on a

2899
02:22:56,768 --> 02:23:01,120
In what type of debate about cutting people's heads off in the rightness OR wrongness of that theoretically

2900
02:23:01,632 --> 02:23:04,960
If they had just taken this for Australian Commando

2901
02:23:05,216 --> 02:23:08,032
And did what most countries would have done to

2902
02:23:08,288 --> 02:23:09,568
Spies and let's be honest

2903
02:23:09,824 --> 02:23:13,152
One man's Commando can easily be another man's by especially since everyone

2904
02:23:13,664 --> 02:23:14,944
I want to make you a spy when they process

2905
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:16,736
If they can

2906
02:23:17,504 --> 02:23:19,296
If they had just shot this poor guy

2907
02:23:19,552 --> 02:23:20,832
You would have heard much about it

2908
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:23,648
It was the cutting off of his head

2909
02:23:24,160 --> 02:23:28,256
The freak everybody out but you know the other side might not have seen it anything like this

2910
02:23:28,512 --> 02:23:31,840
And in fact the people from other countries where beheading was still something

2911
02:23:32,608 --> 02:23:36,192
And it wasn't thought of demonically might not have had as much of a problem with either

2912
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:41,056
It's a weird thing though because theoretically all we should care about

2913
02:23:41,312 --> 02:23:41,824
The suffering

2914
02:23:42,080 --> 02:23:43,872
Right I mean if you shoot somebody

2915
02:23:44,128 --> 02:23:47,456
Or if you cut their heads off it's probably pretty close if they hang them we should probably

2916
02:23:47,712 --> 02:23:48,224
You feel more simple

2917
02:23:48,480 --> 02:23:48,992
Apathy

2918
02:23:49,248 --> 02:23:50,272
But people got hung on

2919
02:23:50,528 --> 02:23:51,808
All the time and you didn't see any

2920
02:23:52,064 --> 02:23:53,088
Particularly

2921
02:23:53,344 --> 02:23:55,904
Top 10 photos from the Second World War

2922
02:23:56,416 --> 02:23:57,184
Depicted that

2923
02:23:58,976 --> 02:24:00,768
Here's the part though that might be more interest

2924
02:24:01,792 --> 02:24:02,816
That photo exists

2925
02:24:03,072 --> 02:24:04,864
Apparently if my research is correct

2926
02:24:05,632 --> 02:24:08,704
Because the guy who was doing the execution the

2927
02:24:09,216 --> 02:24:12,032
Japanese officer swinging that sword down on that

2928
02:24:12,288 --> 02:24:14,592
Captive

2929
02:24:15,104 --> 02:24:15,872
Ask somebody

2930
02:24:16,384 --> 02:24:17,152
To take the photo

2931
02:24:18,688 --> 02:24:20,224
Because he wanted the photo

2932
02:24:21,504 --> 02:24:22,016
I mean

2933
02:24:22,528 --> 02:24:23,552
Let me ask you this

2934
02:24:24,064 --> 02:24:28,416
If you had to kill somebody in your life you know sometimes people have to do that

2935
02:24:29,696 --> 02:24:30,976
How'd you like to have

2936
02:24:31,488 --> 02:24:32,256
A photo

2937
02:24:32,512 --> 02:24:36,096
Of you in the process of doing it to save for later

2938
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:42,496
In the west we would think of that is something a serial killer some weirdo you write a book about in psychologist

2939
02:24:42,752 --> 02:24:43,520
Does Annalise do

2940
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:47,616
So it's not the beheading

2941
02:24:48,128 --> 02:24:50,944
Shows a particularly cruel Nature by the Methodist

2942
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:51,712
Itself

2943
02:24:52,992 --> 02:24:53,504
Wanting to be

2944
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:54,784
Photograph doing it

2945
02:24:55,808 --> 02:24:58,368
Well by the time the 20th century rolls around for a

2946
02:24:58,624 --> 02:24:59,392
Great tower

2947
02:25:00,160 --> 02:25:01,440
That looks a little bit weird

2948
02:25:03,488 --> 02:25:05,792
It may be a sign of something that we could

2949
02:25:06,304 --> 02:25:07,328
Suggested

2950
02:25:07,840 --> 02:25:09,632
And everything we talked about so far

2951
02:25:10,144 --> 02:25:16,288
All these cultural elements layered on top of each other and working together in these human beings and some unquantifiable way

2952
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:18,080
Would help explain all this

2953
02:25:19,872 --> 02:25:20,896
At the same time we can

2954
02:25:21,152 --> 02:25:21,664
Suggest

2955
02:25:22,176 --> 02:25:25,760
The man cutting off the Australian Commandos head in the photograph is a

2956
02:25:26,272 --> 02:25:29,344
In a run-of-the-mill routine general-purpose 8s

2957
02:25:30,368 --> 02:25:32,416
You get those everywhere don't you

2958
02:25:32,672 --> 02:25:33,696
Any more time

2959
02:25:33,952 --> 02:25:36,768
They tend to come out of the woodwork for understandable reasons

2960
02:25:37,792 --> 02:25:39,072
But it's stuff like this

2961
02:25:40,096 --> 02:25:42,656
That will make Allied armies think

2962
02:25:43,424 --> 02:25:48,032
Differently about the Japanese in terms of their level of hatred and intensity

2963
02:25:48,544 --> 02:25:49,568
But even the German

2964
02:25:49,824 --> 02:25:52,640
The Allied powers do not like the driver they really did not

2965
02:25:52,896 --> 02:25:54,176
Like Nazis but it's different

2966
02:25:56,224 --> 02:25:57,504
And things like this played in

2967
02:25:59,552 --> 02:26:05,184
And get you know if you look at the story in 1905 1906 at the end of the russo-japanese war

2968
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:07,744
And realize that the Allied

2969
02:26:08,256 --> 02:26:10,048
Armies fighting the Japanese

2970
02:26:10,816 --> 02:26:12,864
Is only like 35 years away

2971
02:26:13,376 --> 02:26:14,656
You try to figure out

2972
02:26:14,912 --> 02:26:18,240
What the heck's going to happen what do they even have to disagree about

2973
02:26:18,752 --> 02:26:19,264
Bright

2974
02:26:21,312 --> 02:26:22,592
Well this is where I little steroid in

2975
02:26:23,104 --> 02:26:23,616
He kind of comes back

2976
02:26:24,128 --> 02:26:24,640
Play because it

2977
02:26:25,152 --> 02:26:28,992
If Japan's taking of Taiwan and Korea

2978
02:26:29,504 --> 02:26:31,552
Is like taking soda softcore steroid

2979
02:26:31,808 --> 02:26:33,088
The ones that will make you bigger

2980
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:36,672
But then I'm going to turn you into a Great Britain or anyting mammoth

2981
02:26:36,928 --> 02:26:37,440
Like that

2982
02:26:38,208 --> 02:26:42,560
But on the upside you're not going to kill you either you can absorb both of them and still be okay

2983
02:26:43,328 --> 02:26:45,120
The Japanese are going to get like a little sample

2984
02:26:45,376 --> 02:26:46,912
Free little taste a little

2985
02:26:47,424 --> 02:26:52,800
Tiny piece of something that has the potential were they to expand and go deeper into it

2986
02:26:53,312 --> 02:26:54,336
To make them as

2987
02:26:54,592 --> 02:26:57,152
Big a country is they want to be in terms of

2988
02:26:57,408 --> 02:26:58,176
Resources

2989
02:26:58,432 --> 02:26:59,456
And well

2990
02:26:59,712 --> 02:27:00,992
And territory

2991
02:27:01,248 --> 02:27:02,016
And whatnot

2992
02:27:02,784 --> 02:27:04,832
The downside of course like any sort of more hard

2993
02:27:05,088 --> 02:27:05,600
Record

2994
02:27:06,112 --> 02:27:09,440
More effective steroids is they also have the potential

2995
02:27:09,952 --> 02:27:10,720
To kill you

2996
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:12,768
Japan's

2997
02:27:13,024 --> 02:27:15,072
Empires cause of death

2998
02:27:15,584 --> 02:27:17,632
Is now visible in the story

2999
02:27:18,144 --> 02:27:24,288
As part of the settlement the end of the russo-japanese war a little teeny railroad something will be called the South Manchuria

3000
02:27:24,544 --> 02:27:25,056
Green Railway

3001
02:27:25,312 --> 02:27:28,896
A little kitty mining concession just you know in a little area

3002
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:30,944
That at the time

3003
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:34,784
Will be called Manchuria it's a controversial name actually now because

3004
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:36,064
Custom Bose

3005
02:27:36,320 --> 02:27:41,440
But this is part of Japanese propaganda to legitimize their view of things in the region

3006
02:27:41,696 --> 02:27:46,304
We'll call it Manchuria without understanding a lot of history books use quotes now around the term

3007
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:50,400
It's name supposedly for the Manchu people who are one of the many

3008
02:27:50,656 --> 02:27:55,776
Northern East Chinese or establish people who take over China from time to time

3009
02:27:57,056 --> 02:28:00,896
Traditionally though the area falls into sort of the general Chinese sphere of influence

3010
02:28:01,408 --> 02:28:04,224
But the Russians have sort of supplanted them in the lot

3011
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:08,832
20 or 30 years as part of this General disillusion of China or its inability to

3012
02:28:09,088 --> 02:28:11,136
You keep great powers and biting off chunks of it

3013
02:28:12,928 --> 02:28:14,976
The area is huge by the way I read it

3014
02:28:15,232 --> 02:28:17,536
The size of my Texas Louisiana and Alabama put

3015
02:28:17,792 --> 02:28:18,304
Together

3016
02:28:18,560 --> 02:28:19,584
Lots of coal

3017
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:20,608
Lots of iron

3018
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:26,496
A potentially huge amounts of wheat like I'm were talking United States breadbasket type

3019
02:28:27,008 --> 02:28:27,776
Amounts of weed

3020
02:28:29,056 --> 02:28:35,200
The entire area of which the Japanese only have a little tiny little piece of South Manchuria this company in tire

3021
02:28:35,456 --> 02:28:39,296
Terraria borders several different countries and several different cultures and

3022
02:28:39,808 --> 02:28:40,832
You looking at it in the

3023
02:28:41,088 --> 02:28:45,184
Terms that. We use several different ethnic groups or races

3024
02:28:45,696 --> 02:28:47,232
It's mostly Chinese by the way

3025
02:28:47,744 --> 02:28:50,560
But this Manchurian area touches Korea

3026
02:28:50,816 --> 02:28:54,144
It touches China it touches Siberia touches Mongolia

3027
02:28:56,192 --> 02:28:57,216
It's a huge area

3028
02:28:58,752 --> 02:29:00,288
Big enough to give you

3029
02:29:01,312 --> 02:29:03,616
And whatever you wanted in terms of

3030
02:29:03,872 --> 02:29:05,152
Raw materials

3031
02:29:06,176 --> 02:29:06,688
Or

3032
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:07,968
Food

3033
02:29:08,480 --> 02:29:08,992
Or

3034
02:29:10,016 --> 02:29:10,528
Space

3035
02:29:11,296 --> 02:29:11,808
Or

3036
02:29:12,576 --> 02:29:15,136
Customers in emerging market

3037
02:29:16,928 --> 02:29:19,744
But also large enough if it sucks you in

3038
02:29:20,768 --> 02:29:21,536
The kill you

3039
02:29:23,328 --> 02:29:26,400
And the potential to draw you deeper into the affair

3040
02:29:26,912 --> 02:29:27,936
Is ever-present

3041
02:29:28,704 --> 02:29:30,240
Panera people working on

3042
02:29:30,752 --> 02:29:36,896
And making sure that happens in several different places in the story at the same time it's like a wild west with spies if I

3043
02:29:37,152 --> 02:29:40,992
Berlin used to be when I was a kid were all the spies in the world supposedly hung out

3044
02:29:41,248 --> 02:29:47,392
In that one little area that's what this area around the South Manchurian Railway the Japan

3045
02:29:47,648 --> 02:29:50,976
And is developing it becomes a little like that and there's people in there

3046
02:29:51,232 --> 02:29:54,560
Who work for the corporation to a developing things that people who work for

3047
02:29:54,816 --> 02:29:58,656
Have some shadowy groups in there just trying to see what the opportunities are

3048
02:29:59,168 --> 02:30:00,704
Yuan to expand a little bit

3049
02:30:02,496 --> 02:30:03,008
Nonetheless

3050
02:30:03,776 --> 02:30:09,920
Initially it's not much of a problem cuz it's just that little area and the Japanese apparently have the right to develop along the railway line

3051
02:30:10,432 --> 02:30:14,528
You know in a narrow sort of way we can develop hotels along the whistle stops

3052
02:30:14,784 --> 02:30:20,928
And eventually that becomes to support the hotels and eventually becomes homes with people that work at the hotels and it's cool

3053
02:30:21,184 --> 02:30:23,232
Rules for the people who work the hotel's kids and

3054
02:30:23,488 --> 02:30:28,608
Slowly but surely these Japanese companies in conjunction with the Japanese government by the way in a way

3055
02:30:28,864 --> 02:30:31,424
It does remind when a little bit of the way the British

3056
02:30:31,936 --> 02:30:36,800
Colonize India with corporate Affair initially eventually transferring to government sort of thing

3057
02:30:37,312 --> 02:30:38,848
Similar pattern in Japan

3058
02:30:39,616 --> 02:30:41,920
But the development in this region is

3059
02:30:42,432 --> 02:30:43,200
Phenomenal

3060
02:30:44,480 --> 02:30:47,040
It happens at a time when China starts to fall upon

3061
02:30:47,552 --> 02:30:53,184
Can we talk about pieces of it being ripped off in various areas earlier in the story this is the error which is frag

3062
02:30:54,720 --> 02:30:58,304
And the country's in pieces and Warlords are running the show and

3063
02:30:58,560 --> 02:31:01,888
Some parts of it at times can be almost a little wild west

3064
02:31:02,912 --> 02:31:09,056
It work where governments and power that you Weeks Later another government in power than every now and then the Old Government comes back it's why

3065
02:31:09,312 --> 02:31:09,824
Wild

3066
02:31:10,080 --> 02:31:11,616
Are the Japanese have every right

3067
02:31:12,896 --> 02:31:16,992
It might be worth having someone to defend Japanese citizens and Japanese

3068
02:31:17,248 --> 02:31:18,016
Investments and all that

3069
02:31:18,272 --> 02:31:20,064
Stuff in the area so they send a Division I

3070
02:31:20,320 --> 02:31:20,832
I think

3071
02:31:21,088 --> 02:31:23,136
Ava group that will eventually be called

3072
02:31:23,648 --> 02:31:24,672
Towanda narmi

3073
02:31:25,952 --> 02:31:27,232
These people are going to play

3074
02:31:27,488 --> 02:31:28,256
A key role in the

3075
02:31:28,512 --> 02:31:29,536
Story and they're going

3076
02:31:30,048 --> 02:31:31,840
To be part of the unveiling

3077
02:31:32,608 --> 02:31:33,632
Oven giant

3078
02:31:33,888 --> 02:31:34,656
Hidden Track

3079
02:31:35,168 --> 02:31:36,960
In the Japanese governmental system

3080
02:31:37,472 --> 02:31:38,496
It provides the

3081
02:31:39,008 --> 02:31:43,872
You know the opening of the door to the disaster here in this story but no one knows this right now

3082
02:31:44,128 --> 02:31:47,200
Wait a couple more landmarks to hit on the way to our destination though

3083
02:31:47,456 --> 02:31:48,736
One of them happens in 1912

3084
02:31:49,248 --> 02:31:53,344
In 1912 the emperor that the Meiji restoration is named after

3085
02:31:53,856 --> 02:31:54,368
Dies

3086
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:58,208
He's replaced by his son

3087
02:31:59,488 --> 02:32:00,000
The emperor

3088
02:32:01,280 --> 02:32:03,840
Taisho Emperor his name is yoshiki.

3089
02:32:04,096 --> 02:32:04,608
I believe though

3090
02:32:05,376 --> 02:32:07,168
And the taisho emperor

3091
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:12,800
. is really important Japanese history and part of the reason why is because there's something wrong with

3092
02:32:14,592 --> 02:32:15,104
Now

3093
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:18,688
Exactly what was wrong with him is not something that the

3094
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:23,040
Royal Court was really publicizing remember this is an era where they're trying to

3095
02:32:23,296 --> 02:32:25,088
Publicize the emperor is sort of a god

3096
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:27,392
The idea that you would have

3097
02:32:27,648 --> 02:32:32,000
All these human imperfections is not exactly something that matches with the marketing material

3098
02:32:32,512 --> 02:32:33,280
I've read accounts

3099
02:32:33,536 --> 02:32:34,560
Suggest me the emperor

3100
02:32:34,816 --> 02:32:38,912
Cerebral meningitis maybe when he was a little boy and never

3101
02:32:39,168 --> 02:32:40,192
Fully recovered

3102
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:42,752
But some people just say he just

3103
02:32:43,008 --> 02:32:44,032
Wasn't up to the task

3104
02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:46,848
Here's what Herbert P mixes to my helper

3105
02:32:47,104 --> 02:32:48,128
Kiipix writes about it in his

3106
02:32:48,384 --> 02:32:52,224
Hirohito Hirohito course was the World War 2 emperor in this is his father

3107
02:32:52,736 --> 02:32:53,504
Your chiquito

3108
02:32:54,272 --> 02:32:54,784
Pics right

3109
02:32:57,344 --> 02:32:59,904
Hirohito's father Crown Prince yoshihito

3110
02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:04,256
Made Emperor 33 was unable to continue Mages Legacy

3111
02:33:04,768 --> 02:33:05,792
Physically weak

3112
02:33:06,048 --> 02:33:08,864
Indolent and incapable of making political decisions

3113
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:13,728
He was utterly lacking in knowledge of military matters even though he was now the commander and chief

3114
02:33:15,008 --> 02:33:18,080
Less than one month after yoshihito succession to the throne

3115
02:33:18,336 --> 02:33:20,128
At the start of the new taisho era

3116
02:33:20,384 --> 02:33:23,712
The Press reported the appointment of extra doctor's to the court

3117
02:33:23,968 --> 02:33:25,248
In December 1912

3118
02:33:25,504 --> 02:33:28,064
Admiral Yamamoto I believe it's going to be I

3119
02:33:28,320 --> 02:33:33,696
Told General matsukata Metal that when it came to recommending a successor prime minister

3120
02:33:33,952 --> 02:33:35,488
Emperor yoshihito quote

3121
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,560
Is not of the same caliber as the previous emperor

3122
02:33:39,072 --> 02:33:45,216
In my view it is loyal not to obey the taisho emperor is word if we deem it to be disadvantageous to the state

3123
02:33:46,496 --> 02:33:47,776
Discontinuous quote

3124
02:33:48,544 --> 02:33:51,104
Those without any institutional change having occurred

3125
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:54,176
The Ascension in 1912 of hirohito's father

3126
02:33:54,432 --> 02:33:57,248
Became an important turning point in the state of affairs

3127
02:33:58,016 --> 02:33:58,528
And quote

3128
02:34:00,832 --> 02:34:04,160
They say nature abhors a vacuum and power does

3129
02:34:04,416 --> 02:34:04,928
2

3130
02:34:05,440 --> 02:34:07,488
All of a sudden we get to a very interesting

3131
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,304
Question which is in the system where if you

3132
02:34:10,560 --> 02:34:12,096
You said you know who's got the power

3133
02:34:12,864 --> 02:34:14,400
Everyone answered

3134
02:34:14,912 --> 02:34:16,192
It. Where

3135
02:34:16,448 --> 02:34:17,728
The emperor is not up to

3136
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:19,008
Using that premiere

3137
02:34:19,264 --> 02:34:20,032
Who is your

3138
02:34:20,288 --> 02:34:24,384
Default Choice when the emperor is not up to the task that's not been

3139
02:34:24,896 --> 02:34:27,456
Really defined in this vague system

3140
02:34:27,712 --> 02:34:30,272
Ends of the 1920s will be a. For example

3141
02:34:30,528 --> 02:34:34,624
When different elements in the system will be trying to sort of jockey for

3142
02:34:34,880 --> 02:34:37,952
A larger position of power in the state now that

3143
02:34:38,208 --> 02:34:41,280
There's a vacuum sort of where the emperor's rule the supposed to be

3144
02:34:43,072 --> 02:34:44,096
More on that

3145
02:34:44,608 --> 02:34:48,448
After the brief interlude that is known as World War

3146
02:34:49,728 --> 02:34:51,776
First world war breaks out in 1940

3147
02:34:52,032 --> 02:34:52,544
Teen

3148
02:34:53,312 --> 02:34:54,080
And in

3149
02:34:54,336 --> 02:34:55,104
Asia

3150
02:34:55,872 --> 02:34:56,896
It is a very different

3151
02:34:57,152 --> 02:34:58,688
Sullivan animal than it is in Europe

3152
02:34:58,944 --> 02:35:00,224
Obviously in Europe

3153
02:35:00,480 --> 02:35:03,296
Pastor feed is a Charnel house is a night

3154
02:35:03,552 --> 02:35:04,064
Mara

3155
02:35:04,576 --> 02:35:06,368
In Asia it's not that bad at all

3156
02:35:06,624 --> 02:35:07,136
In fact

3157
02:35:07,648 --> 02:35:12,000
The Japanese get into the war they have an alliance with Britain anywhere but they get into the war

3158
02:35:12,256 --> 02:35:15,584
On the Allied side interested to know the book Italians and the Japanese will fight

3159
02:35:16,096 --> 02:35:20,448
With the Allies against the Germans in the first world war and then switch sides in the second but in this case

3160
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:22,752
The Japanese this is a wonderful opportunity

3161
02:35:23,008 --> 02:35:26,080
Opportunities at like hit the jackpot in the way they haven't hit it

3162
02:35:26,592 --> 02:35:29,152
Since that first War in China right the first sign of

3163
02:35:29,408 --> 02:35:30,176
Japanese war

3164
02:35:30,432 --> 02:35:31,200
In this case

3165
02:35:31,712 --> 02:35:33,760
The Germans don't have a lot

3166
02:35:34,016 --> 02:35:34,528
In

3167
02:35:34,784 --> 02:35:37,856
Asia but what they do have is almost done.

3168
02:35:38,880 --> 02:35:39,904
And so you can argue

3169
02:35:40,672 --> 02:35:43,232
And who came out of the first world war the best

3170
02:35:43,488 --> 02:35:44,512
And I think the two candidates

3171
02:35:44,768 --> 02:35:47,840
The most logical choices here is it the United States or is it

3172
02:35:48,096 --> 02:35:48,608
Japan

3173
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:52,192
The United States came out of it much much stronger than

3174
02:35:52,448 --> 02:35:53,984
And what they were like when they went into it

3175
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:58,592
And he did much better than Japan did but they paid a much larger pricing doing it

3176
02:35:59,360 --> 02:36:01,152
And I really short.

3177
02:36:01,408 --> 02:36:03,712
Combat operations United States lost a lot of people

3178
02:36:03,968 --> 02:36:04,992
Comparatively

3179
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:08,064
Japanese lost virtually nobody

3180
02:36:09,600 --> 02:36:11,136
In a winning is good but

3181
02:36:11,392 --> 02:36:12,160
If you look at a map

3182
02:36:12,928 --> 02:36:17,536
Look up with the Japanese acquire as a result of taking over German possessions in Asia

3183
02:36:17,792 --> 02:36:23,936
What are the Germans have will they have a little piece of china basically like everyone else.

3184
02:36:24,192 --> 02:36:25,984
Chunk of China

3185
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:28,544
The Japanese take over the German chunk of that

3186
02:36:29,312 --> 02:36:30,592
And then they take over

3187
02:36:30,848 --> 02:36:33,664
Some Island chains of the German that they have the Marshall I'll

3188
02:36:34,688 --> 02:36:35,456
Eva Mariana

3189
02:36:35,968 --> 02:36:37,248
And they have the Carolina

3190
02:36:38,784 --> 02:36:41,344
If you know your second world war history

3191
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:45,440
You'll note that these are some of the most important battlefields of the Pacific

3192
02:36:45,696 --> 02:36:46,208
Stick War

3193
02:36:46,464 --> 02:36:49,024
And if you look at a map of Japan and its

3194
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:51,072
Possessions before the first World War

3195
02:36:51,328 --> 02:36:52,352
And the same map

3196
02:36:52,608 --> 02:36:58,752
Afterwards you will notice that they basically gain their Pacific island Empire which Japan would later considered to be

3197
02:36:59,008 --> 02:37:01,568
Pacific defense perimeter

3198
02:37:01,824 --> 02:37:04,896
As a result of taking over the German possessions in the first World War

3199
02:37:06,432 --> 02:37:10,016
In 1915 sort of when no one's looking cuz everybody's

3200
02:37:10,272 --> 02:37:12,320
Killing each other so horribly on the Western Front

3201
02:37:12,576 --> 02:37:15,392
Japanese go to China and issue a bunch of demand

3202
02:37:16,416 --> 02:37:22,304
The Chinese are falling apart during this time. The government's very weak and you can see the Japanese almost have a chance to say

3203
02:37:22,560 --> 02:37:24,608
What do we get away with here

3204
02:37:25,376 --> 02:37:27,680
The demands include some

3205
02:37:27,936 --> 02:37:32,032
That was basically the history that was reading so basically turned China into the

3206
02:37:33,056 --> 02:37:35,104
Beginnings of a colony of Japan

3207
02:37:35,872 --> 02:37:37,664
This freaks the Chinese out

3208
02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:42,272
There's no position to resist the Japanese themselves but they appeal to the great powers

3209
02:37:42,528 --> 02:37:46,368
The Japanese are forced to back off on the most outrageous of these demands

3210
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:48,160
But it begins to set up

3211
02:37:48,416 --> 02:37:48,928
Conflict

3212
02:37:49,184 --> 02:37:53,536
With the Allies we're before this time. There hasn't been much of a reason

3213
02:37:53,792 --> 02:37:54,560
For disagreement

3214
02:37:56,608 --> 02:37:59,936
In 1917 we all know what happens to Russia then and right

3215
02:38:00,448 --> 02:38:01,728
They have a revolution

3216
02:38:01,984 --> 02:38:08,128
You going to provisional government that can almost go maybe in a democratic way for 5 seconds but then collapses into the Bolshevik

3217
02:38:08,384 --> 02:38:08,896
Revolution

3218
02:38:09,152 --> 02:38:15,296
Which collapses into the Russian Civil War which ends up with the Communist Victory and this freaks everybody out

3219
02:38:15,808 --> 02:38:18,112
Japan more than just about anyone else

3220
02:38:18,880 --> 02:38:20,416
Now let me stop for a minute

3221
02:38:20,672 --> 02:38:22,464
Point two things one there is no way

3222
02:38:22,720 --> 02:38:24,512
For us to understand how much

3223
02:38:24,768 --> 02:38:26,304
The Bolshevik Revolution

3224
02:38:26,816 --> 02:38:29,376
Scared and freaked people out during the

3225
02:38:29,632 --> 02:38:33,472
Era radar are attitudes toward this now are so much calmer

3226
02:38:33,984 --> 02:38:35,264
And people back then

3227
02:38:36,544 --> 02:38:39,872
And the more traditional and conservative your Society

3228
02:38:40,128 --> 02:38:42,176
The more threatened you were likely to be

3229
02:38:42,432 --> 02:38:47,040
By What was seen at the time. As a utopian

3230
02:38:48,064 --> 02:38:49,856
And by the way one that some people

3231
02:38:50,112 --> 02:38:52,160
We're very interested in some of the

3232
02:38:52,416 --> 02:38:56,256
Do some countries like their people in Britain and Ireland in the United States for example

3233
02:38:56,512 --> 02:39:00,608
Western Europe that looked at the Bolshevik Revolution is something potentially positive

3234
02:39:01,376 --> 02:39:04,704
What are the Japanese communism was extremely scary and

3235
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:08,544
One of the things that was not emphasized in the histories when I was growing up

3236
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:11,616
Either woodcutting about the Nazis or talking about

3237
02:39:12,128 --> 02:39:14,944
The Japanese was how much at least

3238
02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:21,088
They believe in their people believe you how much the materials that they used as propaganda for their own populations

3239
02:39:21,344 --> 02:39:22,624
You sold this idea

3240
02:39:23,136 --> 02:39:25,440
That they were these anti-communist Warrior

3241
02:39:26,464 --> 02:39:28,256
And so much of what they did

3242
02:39:28,512 --> 02:39:32,096
Was based on fighting communism nowadays the histories are very clear that

3243
02:39:32,608 --> 02:39:35,424
And read the materials right what are they writing about what are they talking about

3244
02:39:35,680 --> 02:39:37,984
About what is communism stuff scared them so much

3245
02:39:38,496 --> 02:39:42,848
The one of the arguments made for why Japan has to begin to maybe

3246
02:39:43,104 --> 02:39:45,152
Take over more of Manchuria

3247
02:39:45,408 --> 02:39:51,552
Is to move up into this territory along the border with what used to be rushing but now it's some weird place called the Soviet Union

3248
02:39:52,832 --> 02:39:54,112
Case we have to fend off

3249
02:39:54,368 --> 02:39:55,648
Communist hordes

3250
02:39:58,208 --> 02:40:01,280
Fear of Communism plays into the rest of the Imperial Japanese history

3251
02:40:02,304 --> 02:40:04,864
And they will never get over this fear and it's worth knowing

3252
02:40:05,376 --> 02:40:10,240
The largest army Japan will deploy in the Second World War

3253
02:40:10,496 --> 02:40:11,008
Far

3254
02:40:11,776 --> 02:40:12,800
Will be the one

3255
02:40:13,056 --> 02:40:15,360
It is standing by just in case

3256
02:40:15,616 --> 02:40:16,896
The Soviet Union attacks

3257
02:40:18,944 --> 02:40:20,480
In 1918 in November

3258
02:40:21,504 --> 02:40:22,272
The first World War

3259
02:40:22,528 --> 02:40:25,088
In Japan like a bunch of other powers will get involve

3260
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:26,112
In an effort

3261
02:40:26,368 --> 02:40:27,136
You know to try to

3262
02:40:27,392 --> 02:40:28,416
Play a role in the Russian

3263
02:40:28,672 --> 02:40:29,184
Civil War

3264
02:40:30,208 --> 02:40:33,280
But basically when the war ends Japan gets to go to the peace conference

3265
02:40:34,560 --> 02:40:37,376
Really moving up in the world but at the same time when they propose

3266
02:40:37,888 --> 02:40:41,472
Hey sort of a racial equality kind of clause are really tepid ones

3267
02:40:41,728 --> 02:40:45,312
History describes what the Western powers and garlic Woodrow Wilson

3268
02:40:45,568 --> 02:40:47,104
That's no surprise shoot that down

3269
02:40:47,616 --> 02:40:49,920
The Japanese take this as a sort of a

3270
02:40:51,456 --> 02:40:52,736
Argument against

3271
02:40:53,248 --> 02:40:54,528
Aldi certified mind

3272
02:40:54,784 --> 02:40:57,600
You talk their hearing because there's a lot of wilsonianism going

3273
02:40:58,112 --> 02:41:00,672
I'm here that comes from right this high-minded

3274
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:03,232
The first world war had rocked

3275
02:41:03,488 --> 02:41:04,512
The countries of the world

3276
02:41:05,024 --> 02:41:09,888
And even more than at the end of the second world war there was this attitude that this must never happen again

3277
02:41:10,656 --> 02:41:11,424
There was a lot of

3278
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:15,520
Remember to create the early version of the United Nations the League of Nations

3279
02:41:15,776 --> 02:41:18,080
Countries talking to each other again

3280
02:41:18,592 --> 02:41:19,360
What's more

3281
02:41:19,616 --> 02:41:23,712
And this shows you the pie-in-the-sky level but I mean there was a lot of thinking that we have to have a language

3282
02:41:24,224 --> 02:41:24,736
That we all speak

3283
02:41:24,992 --> 02:41:27,296
We can't have all these foreign tongues anymore that make us

3284
02:41:27,552 --> 02:41:30,880
Impossible to understand each other so let's all learn Esperanto

3285
02:41:32,928 --> 02:41:36,256
But there was also a real sense that one of the main reasons

3286
02:41:36,768 --> 02:41:37,280
You know that

3287
02:41:37,536 --> 02:41:43,168
The world got sucked into those Wars with competition over colonies and things like that the very

3288
02:41:43,424 --> 02:41:49,312
Crocodile in the water that played such an important role in the story was seen to be an important role in why the first World War

3289
02:41:50,592 --> 02:41:51,104
So

3290
02:41:51,360 --> 02:41:52,640
One might think

3291
02:41:52,896 --> 02:41:56,480
This would change people's attitudes in terms of having or not having

3292
02:41:57,760 --> 02:41:59,296
What it really seems to have done

3293
02:41:59,552 --> 02:42:03,648
Is change the way you have to speak about them talk about them and refer to them

3294
02:42:04,672 --> 02:42:05,184
Can't really

3295
02:42:05,440 --> 02:42:05,952
We talked about

3296
02:42:06,208 --> 02:42:08,512
Dominating a people but you can talk about a protector

3297
02:42:09,536 --> 02:42:11,584
Creating the conditions where a stable government

3298
02:42:11,840 --> 02:42:12,864
We can take whole universe

3299
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:15,168
For the safety of the meaning of its

3300
02:42:15,424 --> 02:42:17,472
It's a different way of cervix

3301
02:42:17,728 --> 02:42:19,008
I need other people

3302
02:42:19,264 --> 02:42:21,824
Why you have things like veto power over the

3303
02:42:22,336 --> 02:42:24,128
In a foreign policy of another country

3304
02:42:25,408 --> 02:42:27,968
The Japanese are watching all this stuff to sort of

3305
02:42:28,224 --> 02:42:31,296
I'll see what this new wilsonian world's going to be like

3306
02:42:31,808 --> 02:42:34,880
And what it kind of does for the mood of the age of strengthen

3307
02:42:35,392 --> 02:42:40,000
That group of people in Japan who think we should be working with China we should be the leader of Asia

3308
02:42:40,256 --> 02:42:40,768
Enough

3309
02:42:41,024 --> 02:42:42,304
Economic sense meaning

3310
02:42:43,072 --> 02:42:48,704
That group is sort of exalted all throughout the 1920s in the 1920s or this really sort of exciting here

3311
02:42:49,472 --> 02:42:51,776
In Japanese history where if you're looking at it

3312
02:42:52,288 --> 02:42:55,104
In terms of some of the stages that one would expect

3313
02:42:55,360 --> 02:42:56,896
A true democracy to go through

3314
02:42:57,152 --> 02:42:59,456
True when they're going from where Japan was to where

3315
02:42:59,712 --> 02:43:05,856
True democracy would go you would expect the stage that Japan has in the 1940s to happen it's a crucial stage it's the stage though

3316
02:43:06,112 --> 02:43:09,440
We're all those bench Electric contagions

3317
02:43:09,952 --> 02:43:14,560
Brought over in Pandora's Box by that American Fleet that opened Japan

3318
02:43:14,816 --> 02:43:16,096
In the 1850s

3319
02:43:17,376 --> 02:43:18,912
It's when they've all had a chance to go to

3320
02:43:19,168 --> 02:43:24,544
Take seed and mature and grow up and Bloom and bear fruit even the 1920s is a wild time

3321
02:43:24,800 --> 02:43:25,824
Japan

3322
02:43:26,336 --> 02:43:27,360
The oligarchs

3323
02:43:27,616 --> 02:43:28,384
That were controlling.

3324
02:43:28,640 --> 02:43:29,408
Country

3325
02:43:29,664 --> 02:43:30,688
Start to lose control

3326
02:43:30,944 --> 02:43:31,456
The country

3327
02:43:32,992 --> 02:43:35,296
And it goes back to the fact that the emperor is not evil

3328
02:43:35,552 --> 02:43:37,088
Multiply his normal role

3329
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:39,392
But the Japanese are

3330
02:43:39,904 --> 02:43:40,928
Embracing

3331
02:43:41,184 --> 02:43:44,768
Besides of democracy that are a little bit sometimes messy

3332
02:43:45,280 --> 02:43:49,888
They are rioting regularly after the russo-japanese war

3333
02:43:50,912 --> 02:43:55,776
They are protesting this Parliament which was supposed to just be a rubber stamp Organization for the emperor in the

3334
02:43:56,288 --> 02:43:57,824
The Clique that rules the country

3335
02:43:58,336 --> 02:44:00,640
Is instead really contentious

3336
02:44:01,920 --> 02:44:04,224
Political parties start developing

3337
02:44:04,736 --> 02:44:06,528
And you begin to see

3338
02:44:06,784 --> 02:44:12,160
An interesting development which is that the Japanese really tight to political parties a lot of them and really get into the

3339
02:44:12,672 --> 02:44:18,816
The ebb and flow of the of the confrontation in the ideological battle in the discussions and all that stuff but there's a chunk of Japanese

3340
02:44:19,072 --> 02:44:20,864
Society that is just so turned off

3341
02:44:21,632 --> 02:44:22,144
Buy a couple

3342
02:44:22,656 --> 02:44:26,496
The political wrangling and how vinyl it is and how it seems to

3343
02:44:27,008 --> 02:44:29,056
You know put party over country

3344
02:44:30,080 --> 02:44:31,104
I also don't like

3345
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:34,944
Some of the other things that they see infecting us deciding which they also kind of

3346
02:44:35,200 --> 02:44:38,016
Attached to this new Democratic sort of system

3347
02:44:38,272 --> 02:44:39,296
They don't like the

3348
02:44:39,808 --> 02:44:40,576
Materialism

3349
02:44:41,344 --> 02:44:43,136
I see where are these almost religious

3350
02:44:43,392 --> 02:44:49,536
Values of the Samurai and frugality what makes us great loyalty to the emperor these are what we would consider to be if

3351
02:44:49,792 --> 02:44:50,816
Flashy look at their beliefs

3352
02:44:51,072 --> 02:44:53,120
And you know their place in Japanese Society

3353
02:44:53,632 --> 02:44:54,656
Super Patriots

3354
02:44:56,704 --> 02:44:59,776
Chinese people that look like the country was

3355
02:45:00,544 --> 02:45:02,592
I'm coming apart at the traditional scene

3356
02:45:02,848 --> 02:45:04,384
These are the sorts of people want to be

3357
02:45:04,640 --> 02:45:10,784
We talked about a nation getting the equivalent of decompression sickness as we said coming up from deep water too fast to get the bag

3358
02:45:11,808 --> 02:45:14,368
These are the people that get left behind

3359
02:45:14,624 --> 02:45:15,392
The society Maybe

3360
02:45:15,648 --> 02:45:17,184
It's moving forward too quickly

3361
02:45:19,232 --> 02:45:21,024
And they're not just going to possibly

3362
02:45:21,536 --> 02:45:22,048
Accepted

3363
02:45:22,816 --> 02:45:23,328
And

3364
02:45:23,584 --> 02:45:26,144
Do they have working in their favor the fact that

3365
02:45:26,656 --> 02:45:29,216
Yeah they may differ in many ways with the leadership of

3366
02:45:29,472 --> 02:45:33,056
The country the old cabal style leadership there are some things that they agree upon

3367
02:45:33,568 --> 02:45:35,360
One of the things they agree upon is

3368
02:45:35,872 --> 02:45:37,152
That the country is

3369
02:45:37,664 --> 02:45:40,480
Dangerously flirting with radicalism

3370
02:45:41,248 --> 02:45:42,016
Traditional brain power

3371
02:45:42,272 --> 02:45:42,784
Where in the world is

3372
02:45:43,040 --> 02:45:44,320
Not the most traditional you are

3373
02:45:44,576 --> 02:45:45,600
Definition of radish

3374
02:45:46,880 --> 02:45:48,672
You know might be a little bit different than most

3375
02:45:49,440 --> 02:45:50,720
Here's what historian

3376
02:45:51,232 --> 02:45:54,816
James McClean write to his a modern history of Japan quote

3377
02:45:56,352 --> 02:45:58,912
Feisty tenants and disgruntled labor

3378
02:45:59,424 --> 02:46:01,984
Intrepid feminists and radical students

3379
02:46:02,496 --> 02:46:04,543
Seething minorities and outcasts

3380
02:46:05,055 --> 02:46:07,871
Moga and mobo anarchists and communists

3381
02:46:08,383 --> 02:46:10,175
Too many within the governing establishment

3382
02:46:10,431 --> 02:46:12,991
It appeared that the country was coming apart at the seams

3383
02:46:13,503 --> 02:46:14,527
In the 1920s

3384
02:46:14,783 --> 02:46:17,343
The disruptive consequences of modernization

3385
02:46:17,599 --> 02:46:19,903
The competing attractions of New Visions

3386
02:46:20,159 --> 02:46:22,975
The dish locations in Harrington industrialization

3387
02:46:23,743 --> 02:46:26,303
The tensions associated with new modes of living

3388
02:46:26,559 --> 02:46:30,655
And the stresses that accompanied imperialism we're imploding on one another

3389
02:46:31,167 --> 02:46:32,447
The tumult of the 20s

3390
02:46:32,703 --> 02:46:35,519
Alarm too many bureaucrats and members of the mainstream parties

3391
02:46:35,775 --> 02:46:41,919
Who sought ways to restrain the more extreme forms of radicalism that seemed at times to threaten the very existence

3392
02:46:42,175 --> 02:46:42,687
The state

3393
02:46:43,199 --> 02:46:43,711
Ndk

3394
02:46:46,015 --> 02:46:48,831
The Japanese state will always be more paranoid

3395
02:46:49,343 --> 02:46:54,463
And more repressive against any perceived threat coming from the left side of the political Spectrum

3396
02:46:54,975 --> 02:46:58,303
In Japan that that includes like bomb-throwing Bolsheviks

3397
02:46:59,327 --> 02:47:05,471
And Anarchist to Liberal writers who questioned the Divinity of the Emperor or militarism or women

3398
02:47:05,727 --> 02:47:08,031
Men's rights activists get the broad group of people

3399
02:47:08,543 --> 02:47:10,591
It sometimes gets thrown into a similar

3400
02:47:12,127 --> 02:47:12,639
Bread.

3401
02:47:13,151 --> 02:47:13,919
I mean there will be

3402
02:47:14,687 --> 02:47:19,807
1/8 what police force of thought police inaugurated during this. It will go after

3403
02:47:20,063 --> 02:47:24,159
Likely more writers and thinkers who will be jailed and sometimes torture to death in prison

3404
02:47:24,415 --> 02:47:27,743
It's a tough time to be questioning the status quo from that

3405
02:47:28,255 --> 02:47:29,791
Political Side Of The Ledger

3406
02:47:30,303 --> 02:47:34,655
In the 1920's 1930's early 1940s up till 1945 Japan

3407
02:47:35,423 --> 02:47:36,703
The other side's

3408
02:47:36,959 --> 02:47:37,983
Extremist

3409
02:47:38,239 --> 02:47:39,775
Didn't have that kind of

3410
02:47:40,031 --> 02:47:40,543
Problem

3411
02:47:41,311 --> 02:47:42,335
In part because

3412
02:47:42,847 --> 02:47:44,127
Some of them were

3413
02:47:44,895 --> 02:47:51,039
In government already and in the power structure especially when you got down to like the junior officer level of things

3414
02:47:51,295 --> 02:47:52,575
Military Circle

3415
02:47:53,087 --> 02:47:56,671
They weren't really Outsiders they were kind of Insiders

3416
02:47:57,183 --> 02:48:00,511
The other reason why is every time the Government tried to deal with one of those

3417
02:48:01,279 --> 02:48:02,815
Super Patriot type

3418
02:48:03,583 --> 02:48:04,863
Societies or groups

3419
02:48:05,631 --> 02:48:06,399
Those groups

3420
02:48:06,655 --> 02:48:10,239
Wooden basically wrap themselves in the Imperial flag

3421
02:48:11,263 --> 02:48:14,335
You know you couldn't use a they don't love the emperor

3422
02:48:14,591 --> 02:48:20,735
Excuse on them that would get a lot of the public behind you because their response is know we love the emperor we love the emperor

3423
02:48:20,991 --> 02:48:23,295
More than you love the Airport Extreme

3424
02:48:23,551 --> 02:48:29,695
Sincere in our willingness to lay it all on the line for the emperor proves that we love him more than you do I mean

3425
02:48:29,951 --> 02:48:30,463
Mean

3426
02:48:30,975 --> 02:48:32,511
That's a tough one

3427
02:48:33,023 --> 02:48:34,047
And you will see Allah

3428
02:48:34,303 --> 02:48:35,583
Lot of the

3429
02:48:36,607 --> 02:48:41,471
The things that are done by these ultra-nationalist group that will get off would like sometimes

3430
02:48:41,727 --> 02:48:42,495
Little hand slap

3431
02:48:43,775 --> 02:48:47,871
These groups by the way have some of the greatest names you will ever run into these

3432
02:48:48,127 --> 02:48:48,895
Patriotic

3433
02:48:49,407 --> 02:48:49,919
Start office

3434
02:48:50,175 --> 02:48:52,735
It's kind of like pseudo secret societies but more more

3435
02:48:52,991 --> 02:48:54,271
You come out in the open

3436
02:48:54,527 --> 02:48:55,807
When is one called the black

3437
02:48:56,063 --> 02:48:57,343
Dragon Society

3438
02:48:58,111 --> 02:48:59,647
Is another one called the dark

3439
02:48:59,903 --> 02:49:01,439
Ocean Society

3440
02:49:01,951 --> 02:49:02,975
And they have one called

3441
02:49:03,231 --> 02:49:06,815
The cherry blossom society which sounds beautiful but those

3442
02:49:07,327 --> 02:49:10,655
Members of that cherry blossom Society kill people

3443
02:49:12,447 --> 02:49:16,031
The Robey assassinations in Japan a rising amount starting at least

3444
02:49:16,287 --> 02:49:18,591
In the late nineteen teens

3445
02:49:18,847 --> 02:49:20,127
They have a prime minister and like

3446
02:49:20,383 --> 02:49:20,895
19th Avenue

3447
02:49:21,151 --> 02:49:24,735
21 who's assassinated they have another one assassinated in 1932

3448
02:49:24,991 --> 02:49:25,759
If I had a major

3449
02:49:26,015 --> 02:49:27,295
Corporation assassinated

3450
02:49:27,807 --> 02:49:31,391
And these groups are killing these people as a way one

3451
02:49:31,903 --> 02:49:37,535
To get them out of positions of power and sometimes they do it'll change the course of the way things go by taken out of key person

3452
02:49:38,047 --> 02:49:40,607
Other times they do it as a way to send a message

3453
02:49:41,119 --> 02:49:42,655
There's the other people out there it's

3454
02:49:43,167 --> 02:49:47,007
And intimidation move and an American Diplomat I think it's an American

3455
02:49:47,519 --> 02:49:48,031
At will call

3456
02:49:48,287 --> 02:49:53,151
The government of Japan during with the late 20s early 30s as a government by assassination

3457
02:49:53,919 --> 02:49:56,735
And often times the Assassins are members of these groups

3458
02:49:57,503 --> 02:49:58,015
What are these groups

3459
02:49:58,271 --> 02:49:58,783
Want

3460
02:49:59,551 --> 02:50:02,367
They want to go back to a golden age that never existed

3461
02:50:03,647 --> 02:50:06,975
These groups are generally although there are differences among them but they're generally

3462
02:50:07,231 --> 02:50:08,511
Strongly anti-communist

3463
02:50:09,535 --> 02:50:12,607
They are strongly pro-military and they think that Japan's been

3464
02:50:13,375 --> 02:50:16,447
Giving in to the Western powers on arms limitations and all that too much

3465
02:50:16,959 --> 02:50:19,263
They are usually pan-Asian

3466
02:50:19,519 --> 02:50:20,543
We believe in

3467
02:50:20,799 --> 02:50:25,151
Japan leading an Asian Revolution against in a western Supremacy

3468
02:50:25,407 --> 02:50:26,687
The superior nature

3469
02:50:27,455 --> 02:50:27,967
The Japanese race

3470
02:50:28,223 --> 02:50:28,735
Json people

3471
02:50:30,527 --> 02:50:31,039
Spirit

3472
02:50:33,343 --> 02:50:34,367
Melo's

3473
02:50:34,623 --> 02:50:36,671
Parliamentary democracy in olives

3474
02:50:37,439 --> 02:50:41,535
Vile politicians who are corrupt but they also have a big problem

3475
02:50:41,791 --> 02:50:45,119
With the business and corporate interest of the time the zaibatsu

3476
02:50:45,375 --> 02:50:45,887
The people that

3477
02:50:46,143 --> 02:50:49,215
The corporations in the government that are partnering together for developmental purpose

3478
02:50:50,239 --> 02:50:53,567
These people see them as a western infection

3479
02:50:55,359 --> 02:51:00,735
That is destroying the traditional nature Japanese societies and ripping off the populist right in

3480
02:51:01,247 --> 02:51:02,783
Taxing them to death and

3481
02:51:03,039 --> 02:51:03,807
Squeezing them to death

3482
02:51:04,063 --> 02:51:05,599
Passing clot in there will be a lot of

3483
02:51:06,111 --> 02:51:08,671
Members of these groups or sympathizers who will come

3484
02:51:08,927 --> 02:51:12,767
You know that from idealistic peasant you who to see what's happening

3485
02:51:13,023 --> 02:51:15,327
And their little Villages and whatnot

3486
02:51:15,583 --> 02:51:16,607
And are outraged

3487
02:51:16,863 --> 02:51:21,983
You join a group like this because one of the things they want to do is make it all better and the only way to do that is to

3488
02:51:22,239 --> 02:51:23,775
To put the emperor back in power

3489
02:51:24,031 --> 02:51:27,103
Like he was in the good old days that never existed

3490
02:51:27,359 --> 02:51:29,919
And he'll fix everything Justice wise and if we just

3491
02:51:30,175 --> 02:51:32,991
In a bring back the old Samurai virtues

3492
02:51:33,247 --> 02:51:34,783
It never existed either

3493
02:51:35,807 --> 02:51:38,111
Life will be grand again it's a

3494
02:51:38,879 --> 02:51:43,743
Utopian sort of movement and it a couple of figures it if you are so revered

3495
02:51:43,999 --> 02:51:49,631
And held in such Awe by their subordinates that there's almost a demigod like element to a couple of

3496
02:51:50,399 --> 02:51:51,167
Big thinkers

3497
02:51:51,679 --> 02:51:53,215
Pushing these ideas

3498
02:51:53,471 --> 02:51:55,007
I think it what they want

3499
02:51:55,263 --> 02:52:01,407
There's going to be an expansion of Japanese power in Manchuria and a confrontation with the Soviet Union at the very least

3500
02:52:04,479 --> 02:52:06,015
So with all these different

3501
02:52:06,271 --> 02:52:08,319
Players in the Japanese

3502
02:52:08,575 --> 02:52:09,599
Political sphere

3503
02:52:10,367 --> 02:52:11,647
It's a kind of a vibrant

3504
02:52:11,903 --> 02:52:18,047
The possibly explosives to hear maybe the beginnings of a vibrant early rough-and-tumble democracy maybe something the

3505
02:52:18,303 --> 02:52:20,095
Fall off the cliff in a bad Direction

3506
02:52:22,143 --> 02:52:23,935
There will be several major

3507
02:52:24,191 --> 02:52:29,055
Historical wild cards that get played on Japan in the 1920s that would have made it tough for

3508
02:52:29,567 --> 02:52:34,175
Democracy to flourish anyway I mean in 1923 there's a horrible earthquake

3509
02:52:34,687 --> 02:52:39,551
And it affects a couple of major cities more than the rest of the country but it's like a hundred and fifty thousand dead people

3510
02:52:40,831 --> 02:52:41,855
Tsunami

3511
02:52:43,391 --> 02:52:44,927
Massive economic damage

3512
02:52:46,975 --> 02:52:48,511
A 1924

3513
02:52:48,767 --> 02:52:51,327
The USA decides they going to pass them

3514
02:52:51,583 --> 02:52:56,703
Immigration Act with the Japanese sea is particularly discriminating against them

3515
02:52:57,215 --> 02:53:03,359
The United States is almost oblivious to the fact that it bothers the Japanese to the Japanese it's another sign that they're not being

3516
02:53:03,615 --> 02:53:04,639
Taking his equals

3517
02:53:04,895 --> 02:53:06,175
Was right on the Rain Man

3518
02:53:06,431 --> 02:53:06,943
Greetings list

3519
02:53:08,223 --> 02:53:10,527
In 1927 there will be a financial crisis

3520
02:53:10,783 --> 02:53:12,575
Economic turmoil

3521
02:53:12,831 --> 02:53:15,903
And the two years later everybody gets hit by the Great Depression

3522
02:53:16,671 --> 02:53:21,535
That's a hard sort of soil to try to nurture the seed of democracy and

3523
02:53:21,791 --> 02:53:22,303
And isn't it

3524
02:53:24,095 --> 02:53:25,375
We should point out that

3525
02:53:25,631 --> 02:53:26,143
The emperor

3526
02:53:27,167 --> 02:53:28,191
Yoshihito

3527
02:53:28,703 --> 02:53:34,847
Who has not been seen in public very much since like 1920 his son Hirohito is sort of taking over the duties

3528
02:53:35,103 --> 02:53:35,871
Is Crown Prince well

3529
02:53:36,127 --> 02:53:38,687
In December 1926 yoshihito dies

3530
02:53:38,943 --> 02:53:39,967
Hirohito takes over

3531
02:53:40,479 --> 02:53:42,015
We now have the World War 2 emperor

3532
02:53:42,527 --> 02:53:47,135
You know here in Tower and theoretically perhaps more capable of playing

3533
02:53:47,647 --> 02:53:51,743
In some sort of activist role in the system unit should he want to

3534
02:53:53,791 --> 02:53:54,815
Japan display app

3535
02:53:55,071 --> 02:54:00,959
Are in several major between the two World Wars Arms Control agreement specifically ones limiting Naval

3536
02:54:01,215 --> 02:54:01,727
Shipping

3537
02:54:03,263 --> 02:54:08,127
This absolutely infuriates the ultra-nationalist rytas as you might imagine

3538
02:54:08,383 --> 02:54:09,663
And there will be more assassinations

3539
02:54:12,479 --> 02:54:15,807
I think it's a little ironic that some of the people that get bumped off

3540
02:54:16,063 --> 02:54:17,855
In this interwar period R

3541
02:54:18,367 --> 02:54:19,903
People trying to address

3542
02:54:20,159 --> 02:54:22,207
The Fatal flaw in the Japanese concert

3543
02:54:22,463 --> 02:54:28,607
Two-channel system the one that prevents the political leaders from actually controlling the military pretty basic when you think about it

3544
02:54:28,863 --> 02:54:30,655
If you're going to have a real representative cyst

3545
02:54:30,911 --> 02:54:31,423
I'm right

3546
02:54:33,983 --> 02:54:36,031
Store in Mark rpd's describing

3547
02:54:36,287 --> 02:54:38,079
How this created a confused

3548
02:54:38,335 --> 02:54:39,871
Situation with Japan

3549
02:54:40,383 --> 02:54:40,895
China

3550
02:54:41,663 --> 02:54:42,431
And he writes about the

3551
02:54:43,199 --> 02:54:45,503
What's called the right of supreme command

3552
02:54:45,759 --> 02:54:46,527
And the fact that the

3553
02:54:46,783 --> 02:54:48,319
Army and the Navy are only answerable

3554
02:54:48,831 --> 02:54:49,855
The emperor not to elected

3555
02:54:50,367 --> 02:54:50,879
Bureaucrats

3556
02:54:51,391 --> 02:54:53,695
He describes its effect on on Chinese policy

3557
02:54:53,951 --> 02:54:54,463
Price quote

3558
02:54:56,255 --> 02:55:02,399
To begin with structural and political weaknesses with in Japan confused the development of a clear-cut

3559
02:55:02,655 --> 02:55:03,167
Policy

3560
02:55:03,423 --> 02:55:04,959
First among these abilities

3561
02:55:05,215 --> 02:55:08,799
What's a lethal flaw in the modern Japanese constitutional system

3562
02:55:09,055 --> 02:55:10,335
It's centered on the link

3563
02:55:10,591 --> 02:55:13,407
Between the theoretical Supreme Imperial throne

3564
02:55:13,663 --> 02:55:16,735
Supposedly the source of all political legitimacy and Authority

3565
02:55:17,247 --> 02:55:20,575
Ill-defined locus of political responsibility

3566
02:55:21,087 --> 02:55:26,719
It meant that any institution in the Japanese State could if it had sufficient practical power

3567
02:55:26,975 --> 02:55:33,119
Pretend to act in the name of an inviolable emperor and that's assumed a supreme decision-making row

3568
02:55:33,887 --> 02:55:36,703
With one critical exception however he writes

3569
02:55:36,959 --> 02:55:41,055
No institution could claim an actual constitutional right to do so

3570
02:55:41,823 --> 02:55:44,127
The exception was the armed services

3571
02:55:44,383 --> 02:55:45,919
Right of supreme command

3572
02:55:46,431 --> 02:55:49,759
Which made the service is directly responsible to the emperor

3573
02:55:50,015 --> 02:55:51,551
Engine no civil Authority

3574
02:55:51,807 --> 02:55:57,951
It. Gave the Army and Navy the legal authority to act and speak in the name of the Imperial

3575
02:55:58,207 --> 02:55:58,719
Real throne

3576
02:55:58,975 --> 02:56:04,351
As the throne was not constitutionally responsible to any other institution within the Japanese state

3577
02:56:04,607 --> 02:56:09,727
The services could theoretically act as they please without check for interference from the civil government

3578
02:56:10,239 --> 02:56:10,751
And quote

3579
02:56:12,543 --> 02:56:15,103
If only it was that simple though

3580
02:56:15,615 --> 02:56:16,895
Because then it would just make

3581
02:56:17,151 --> 02:56:23,295
The Japanese division of power in the system like a lot of other states right we have an army on one side and elected officials

3582
02:56:23,551 --> 02:56:24,319
On the other hand they kind of

3583
02:56:24,575 --> 02:56:28,415
Don't necessarily see eye-to-eye but there they are two camps

3584
02:56:28,671 --> 02:56:30,463
The Japanese military

3585
02:56:30,719 --> 02:56:32,511
Isn't unified at all

3586
02:56:33,279 --> 02:56:36,351
Start at the top where the services don't get along with each other

3587
02:56:37,375 --> 02:56:40,447
Let me point out that inter-service rivalry between things like

3588
02:56:40,703 --> 02:56:44,031
The Army and the Navy in most militaries is pretty common

3589
02:56:44,543 --> 02:56:47,103
But the Japanese once again or like everyone else

3590
02:56:47,359 --> 02:56:49,663
Only more so in this regard

3591
02:56:49,919 --> 02:56:50,943
And the service is

3592
02:56:51,199 --> 02:56:51,967
Really don't like

3593
02:56:52,223 --> 02:56:52,735
Each other

3594
02:56:52,991 --> 02:56:57,599
And really don't see eye-to-eye and can only UniFi sometimes when they're talking about

3595
02:56:57,855 --> 02:57:03,999
You know their right to control events or their right to receive piles of money when it comes to specific things they

3596
02:57:04,255 --> 02:57:08,351
A total disagreement in the Navy sees the next war in the Pacific against the United States

3597
02:57:09,119 --> 02:57:10,399
The Army seized the next War

3598
02:57:10,911 --> 02:57:17,055
Has an expansion eventually eventually to confront this new Soviet Union no longer a border where there Japan controls again

3599
02:57:17,311 --> 02:57:19,359
Higher Manchurian area right the Texas

3600
02:57:19,871 --> 02:57:22,175
Alabama Louisiana state full size

3601
02:57:24,479 --> 02:57:26,783
In this system no two services are equal

3602
02:57:27,039 --> 02:57:31,391
And they're totally out of the control of the civilian government of who referees disputes between them

3603
02:57:32,927 --> 02:57:34,207
Maybe a more complex

3604
02:57:34,719 --> 02:57:35,487
The question is

3605
02:57:36,255 --> 02:57:38,047
Who referees disputes

3606
02:57:38,303 --> 02:57:39,071
Within them

3607
02:57:40,095 --> 02:57:44,959
Because neither the Army Northern AVR even unified as a service there faction-ridden

3608
02:57:45,983 --> 02:57:47,007
The Army famous

3609
02:57:47,263 --> 02:57:50,335
He has a faction and these are unofficial things by the way although

3610
02:57:50,591 --> 02:57:52,895
Certain officers become associated with it

3611
02:57:53,151 --> 02:57:55,711
So it's not a good comparison but I mean imagine political parties

3612
02:57:55,967 --> 02:57:59,807
You just know you're not officially one way or the other but you know General yamaguchi's a republic

3613
02:58:00,063 --> 02:58:01,087
In my kind of thing

3614
02:58:02,111 --> 02:58:04,159
In this case one of the factions is called

3615
02:58:04,415 --> 02:58:06,719
Or known as the Imperial Way faction

3616
02:58:07,231 --> 02:58:07,743
Call Doha

3617
02:58:08,255 --> 02:58:09,279
Is the Japanese

3618
02:58:09,791 --> 02:58:11,327
Mispronounced term certainly

3619
02:58:11,839 --> 02:58:13,631
And these people are

3620
02:58:13,887 --> 02:58:15,935
The ones who buy into like the super paint

3621
02:58:17,215 --> 02:58:21,311
The cherry blossom Society sort of thinking it's almost religious

3622
02:58:21,823 --> 02:58:24,639
And it wants to go back to a golden age want to get rid of

3623
02:58:24,895 --> 02:58:30,783
In all the materialism all the liberal democracies the politicians and the corruption and just go right back Joshua restoration

3624
02:58:31,295 --> 02:58:33,087
The return of the emperor of the total power

3625
02:58:33,343 --> 02:58:34,367
The same theme again

3626
02:58:34,623 --> 02:58:35,903
Riley comes up in Japanese history

3627
02:58:38,719 --> 02:58:41,791
A utopian kind of way of looking at things

3628
02:58:42,047 --> 02:58:44,863
And normally you would say to yourself or who the heck cares

3629
02:58:45,631 --> 02:58:51,775
You know what a bunch of maybe mid-level officers in the Japanese military think right who cares if they're Democrats repeal

3630
02:58:52,031 --> 02:58:52,799
Who cares if they're

3631
02:58:53,055 --> 02:58:54,591
Imperial manufacturing people

3632
02:58:54,847 --> 02:58:56,127
For the other faction which is

3633
02:58:56,383 --> 02:58:59,711
Instill expansion is sticking still doesn't love politicians and

3634
02:58:59,967 --> 02:59:03,039
All that kind of stuff but they're more conservative been more opportunistic

3635
02:59:03,551 --> 02:59:08,159
The Imperial Way faction wants to take Manchuria and move on up to the Soviet Union from there

3636
02:59:08,671 --> 02:59:09,695
Again who cares

3637
02:59:09,951 --> 02:59:13,535
Bunch of Colonels and Lieutenant Colonels majors and captains were they going to do

3638
02:59:13,791 --> 02:59:17,375
In a normal military not much shut their mouth and follow orders

3639
02:59:17,631 --> 02:59:19,935
We run into and it's key to the story

3640
02:59:20,191 --> 02:59:20,959
Another one of those

3641
02:59:21,215 --> 02:59:21,727
Little Wonder

3642
02:59:21,983 --> 02:59:22,495
Full

3643
02:59:23,007 --> 02:59:27,359
In a distinctive things about Japan that goes back to an earlier era

3644
02:59:27,615 --> 02:59:32,223
And it provides an opportunity for a bunch of Junior officers to hijack policy here

3645
02:59:32,479 --> 02:59:32,991
In a way that

3646
02:59:33,759 --> 02:59:35,551
Would be impossible in most grade

3647
02:59:35,807 --> 02:59:37,087
Powers not impossible ever

3648
02:59:37,343 --> 02:59:38,367
Impossible in most braids

3649
02:59:39,647 --> 02:59:41,695
Unless things were going down a dark road with your

3650
02:59:41,951 --> 02:59:43,743
Of course as we know things are

3651
02:59:47,327 --> 02:59:48,351
There's a Japanese

3652
02:59:48,607 --> 02:59:50,143
Concept called gecko gecko

3653
02:59:52,447 --> 02:59:55,775
And it's difficult understand it's another one of those things where you kind of have to have the

3654
02:59:56,287 --> 02:59:58,591
Cultural antenna set to Japanese

3655
03:00:01,407 --> 03:00:02,431
It's all so controversial

3656
03:00:02,687 --> 03:00:08,575
Because you will hear historians wonder how much of a role this really played in the story versus how much it was a wonderful

3657
03:00:09,087 --> 03:00:10,623
Use exploited by

3658
03:00:11,135 --> 03:00:13,183
You know higher-ups is a way to say

3659
03:00:13,439 --> 03:00:14,975
Oh well we didn't do it some capped

3660
03:00:15,231 --> 03:00:16,255
Did acting alone did it

3661
03:00:16,767 --> 03:00:20,095
But the concept is not exactly unknown

3662
03:00:20,607 --> 03:00:25,983
In Western Societies or Western militaries for example the Japanese just take it to it

3663
03:00:26,495 --> 03:00:31,615
You know extremes again in the western military for example the concept might be something like

3664
03:00:32,383 --> 03:00:33,151
You're the rule that

3665
03:00:33,407 --> 03:00:34,431
It says that if

3666
03:00:34,687 --> 03:00:36,223
American soldiers

3667
03:00:36,735 --> 03:00:40,063
Irene combat somewhere and some higher up orders them

3668
03:00:40,319 --> 03:00:41,087
To commit some sort of

3669
03:00:41,343 --> 03:00:42,111
Atrocity

3670
03:00:42,367 --> 03:00:46,463
They have a responsibility to be insubordinate in that situation right it's

3671
03:00:46,719 --> 03:00:49,023
Natalie forgiven it's kind of required

3672
03:00:49,791 --> 03:00:51,071
Will the Japanese take that

3673
03:00:51,327 --> 03:00:52,095
To the next level Summit

3674
03:00:52,351 --> 03:00:53,375
They will have

3675
03:00:53,887 --> 03:00:55,423
And this concept that goes back

3676
03:00:55,679 --> 03:00:56,191
Century

3677
03:00:56,447 --> 03:00:57,727
Trees that essentially says

3678
03:00:57,983 --> 03:01:01,567
The lower-ranking people in some circumstances have a right

3679
03:01:01,823 --> 03:01:03,615
Maybe a responsibility

3680
03:01:04,383 --> 03:01:09,247
To act insubordinate and sometimes that can mean extreme sort of behavior like killing people

3681
03:01:10,527 --> 03:01:15,135
But some of the things I read almost portrayed as like a societal safety valve

3682
03:01:15,391 --> 03:01:21,535
Albright in a system in a shaped like a pyramid in terms of its power structure how did the people at the bottom ever have

3683
03:01:21,791 --> 03:01:22,303
Callaway

3684
03:01:22,815 --> 03:01:23,839
To register

3685
03:01:24,095 --> 03:01:27,679
You know their displeasure with something for example maybe this is one of those ways

3686
03:01:29,215 --> 03:01:30,495
The key to the whole thing though

3687
03:01:30,751 --> 03:01:34,335
Is she going to be doing it for the right reasons why your heart has to be in the right place

3688
03:01:34,591 --> 03:01:37,151
Sure they committed in Outrageous Acts

3689
03:01:37,407 --> 03:01:38,175
What's a Manuel

3690
03:01:39,199 --> 03:01:42,783
This is why something like a cocucho probably doesn't work as well for your

3691
03:01:43,039 --> 03:01:44,831
In a communist assassin

3692
03:01:45,343 --> 03:01:46,879
Wants to kill the prime minister

3693
03:01:47,135 --> 03:01:48,415
And sees that as part of his

3694
03:01:49,183 --> 03:01:50,463
Doing it for a good cause

3695
03:01:50,975 --> 03:01:55,583
But the public can be really sympathetic to Japanese probably to these people who do it for patriotic

3696
03:01:56,095 --> 03:01:56,607
Reasons right

3697
03:01:57,119 --> 03:02:00,703
But clearly they loved the emperor sure they were misguided but they meant well

3698
03:02:01,727 --> 03:02:03,263
And again you will see these people

3699
03:02:03,519 --> 03:02:09,151
Get off easy sometimes in these cases and maybe that's a reason if you're more conspiratorial

3700
03:02:09,407 --> 03:02:11,711
And if your general that doesn't want to face a firing

3701
03:02:11,967 --> 03:02:13,247
Squad for treason

3702
03:02:13,759 --> 03:02:17,087
And you can just have some captain or Colonel do it and then say

3703
03:02:17,599 --> 03:02:19,903
David Coker Johnny Manuel

3704
03:02:20,159 --> 03:02:21,439
But let them off easy

3705
03:02:23,999 --> 03:02:26,559
Maybe the upside of a policy of letting them off

3706
03:02:26,815 --> 03:02:29,375
Easy is that you don't create Martyrs out of them

3707
03:02:30,399 --> 03:02:31,935
But the obvious downside is it's

3708
03:02:32,191 --> 03:02:33,727
Not much of a deterrent either

3709
03:02:35,263 --> 03:02:37,311
Example perhaps of this

3710
03:02:37,567 --> 03:02:38,591
Gecko Cujo

3711
03:02:39,103 --> 03:02:40,383
Enochian action

3712
03:02:41,151 --> 03:02:43,711
Happens on June 3rd 1928

3713
03:02:44,735 --> 03:02:46,527
When a railway car

3714
03:02:46,783 --> 03:02:48,063
Full of officials

3715
03:02:48,319 --> 03:02:48,831
From a

3716
03:02:49,087 --> 03:02:49,599
Provence

3717
03:02:50,111 --> 03:02:51,647
A warlord province in

3718
03:02:52,415 --> 03:02:54,207
Manchuria in there quotes

3719
03:02:54,975 --> 03:02:56,511
Get shredded by a bomb

3720
03:02:58,303 --> 03:03:01,375
The bomb killed several people including the governor one of these provinces

3721
03:03:01,887 --> 03:03:05,983
It also kills the warlord himself will die few hours later

3722
03:03:06,239 --> 03:03:08,543
Is Warlord had been a friend of Japan

3723
03:03:08,799 --> 03:03:10,079
Up until that very

3724
03:03:10,335 --> 03:03:11,103
Explosion

3725
03:03:11,871 --> 03:03:16,479
But a couple of Japanese mid-level Junior officers including

3726
03:03:16,735 --> 03:03:19,295
Maybe as low as a lieutenant involvement but

3727
03:03:19,551 --> 03:03:20,319
Kernel and

3728
03:03:20,575 --> 03:03:21,343
Captain Maybe

3729
03:03:22,367 --> 03:03:25,183
Took it upon themselves we are told

3730
03:03:25,695 --> 03:03:31,327
To plant this bomb in order to create an incident that required a response that triggered

3731
03:03:31,839 --> 03:03:32,863
A policy change

3732
03:03:33,119 --> 03:03:34,399
These officers.

3733
03:03:34,655 --> 03:03:36,959
Was the smart move here right that would have triggered

3734
03:03:37,215 --> 03:03:40,031
Something that may have led to the Takeover of Manchuria

3735
03:03:41,567 --> 03:03:45,151
If you wanted to craft an analogy here you have to start playing with things like

3736
03:03:45,663 --> 03:03:50,527
In a u.s. Central Command forces in the Middle East having some mid-level officers there

3737
03:03:51,039 --> 03:03:53,855
Can independently decide we're going to spark a war with

3738
03:03:54,111 --> 03:03:55,135
The place like a Ron

3739
03:03:55,647 --> 03:03:57,183
Because we think it's in the long-term

3740
03:03:57,695 --> 03:04:03,839
You know good interest of the United States to do so right to be better to fight them now than later mean everyone would thank me if they knew what I knew

3741
03:04:04,095 --> 03:04:06,655
I mean it's it's a little inconceivable to think about that

3742
03:04:07,167 --> 03:04:08,959
It has happened throughout history is not

3743
03:04:09,215 --> 03:04:09,727
That didn't conceive

3744
03:04:11,263 --> 03:04:14,591
But amongst the great Powers usually there's more

3745
03:04:14,847 --> 03:04:17,407
No control over that mid-level of command

3746
03:04:17,919 --> 03:04:19,967
In this case is very possible that

3747
03:04:20,479 --> 03:04:21,503
What you have here

3748
03:04:22,271 --> 03:04:24,319
Is a tail wagging the dog

3749
03:04:26,879 --> 03:04:29,183
Where people at the at a low level

3750
03:04:29,439 --> 03:04:30,719
Are able to

3751
03:04:31,231 --> 03:04:36,607
Air control policy perhaps that's one interpretation the other is that they're just Stooges acting for

3752
03:04:36,863 --> 03:04:40,959
Much more powerful generals for corporate interest you know you by the interpretation you like

3753
03:04:43,775 --> 03:04:45,823
Nevertheless this 1928

3754
03:04:46,079 --> 03:04:48,127
Train bombing assassination

3755
03:04:48,639 --> 03:04:51,199
Which goes by several different names by the way my favorite

3756
03:04:51,455 --> 03:04:54,271
Is The Shining solin explosion death incident

3757
03:04:55,039 --> 03:04:56,063
It sounds like a Tom

3758
03:04:56,319 --> 03:04:56,831
Wolf

3759
03:04:57,087 --> 03:04:58,111
Novel title to me

3760
03:04:58,879 --> 03:05:02,719
Nonetheless it didn't achieve almost certainly what the people who did it wanted

3761
03:05:03,231 --> 03:05:08,095
And did in fact prompt significant blow back across a number different from front number one

3762
03:05:08,351 --> 03:05:10,143
Is global public opinion

3763
03:05:11,167 --> 03:05:16,031
1928 before the Great Depression start to most of the world but you're already starting to see

3764
03:05:16,287 --> 03:05:17,055
In Europe

3765
03:05:17,311 --> 03:05:20,895
And over here in the Pacific a little subtle change in the weather if you will from that

3766
03:05:21,407 --> 03:05:22,431
19

3767
03:05:22,943 --> 03:05:23,967
Your twenties

3768
03:05:24,223 --> 03:05:30,367
Post first world war rainbows and unicorns thing all of a sudden the realpolitik return to normalcy sort of clouds rest

3769
03:05:30,623 --> 03:05:32,671
Starting to appear and this is one of those incidents

3770
03:05:32,927 --> 03:05:33,439
The forecast

3771
03:05:33,695 --> 03:05:35,231
DePaul a little bit on things

3772
03:05:35,743 --> 03:05:37,279
In the United States especially

3773
03:05:37,791 --> 03:05:40,351
This assassination stuff just looks sinister

3774
03:05:43,935 --> 03:05:45,727
But the real significant blow back

3775
03:05:46,495 --> 03:05:51,103
Is that this is as my great aunt would have called it a come-to-jesus moment

3776
03:05:51,359 --> 03:05:53,407
In the Japanese governmental system

3777
03:05:54,687 --> 03:05:55,711
Because initially

3778
03:05:56,223 --> 03:05:59,039
The Japanese government is not sure who does this

3779
03:05:59,551 --> 03:06:00,319
And it's

3780
03:06:00,831 --> 03:06:04,671
Supposed to be a bunch of local to me one history of red said it was

3781
03:06:04,927 --> 03:06:06,207
Opium addicts

3782
03:06:06,463 --> 03:06:09,791
The Japanese blame this on some Chinese opium addicts another one said it was

3783
03:06:10,047 --> 03:06:14,911
Blamed officially with a communique on elements of a northern Chinese nationalist Army

3784
03:06:15,167 --> 03:06:16,191
Moron that later

3785
03:06:17,471 --> 03:06:20,287
But almost no one outside Japan was buying it

3786
03:06:20,799 --> 03:06:26,943
And when the opposition party in Japan finds out that it's a lie all heck breaks loose in Japan

3787
03:06:29,759 --> 03:06:31,039
The Prime Minister himself

3788
03:06:31,295 --> 03:06:34,623
During this. A general named Tanaka

3789
03:06:34,879 --> 03:06:35,903
Survive

3790
03:06:36,159 --> 03:06:38,207
Politically this scandal

3791
03:06:38,719 --> 03:06:42,303
And the problem with 20/20 hindsight totally clear as you look back on

3792
03:06:42,559 --> 03:06:45,887
It's a moment where the military essentially pushes back against

3793
03:06:46,143 --> 03:06:47,423
The political leadership

3794
03:06:47,935 --> 03:06:48,703
And they get away with it

3795
03:06:49,983 --> 03:06:50,495
Because

3796
03:06:51,007 --> 03:06:52,287
The prime minister is

3797
03:06:52,543 --> 03:06:54,335
Told by get this

3798
03:06:54,847 --> 03:06:57,151
The Emperor Hirohito in one of these

3799
03:06:57,663 --> 03:07:02,527
Few times and it's an early young indiscretion he says will turn into the Hulk when something goes

3800
03:07:02,783 --> 03:07:05,343
Arai in this whole investigation but he will tell

3801
03:07:05,599 --> 03:07:10,975
The prime minister to get the bottom of this the Prime Minister says I will if there any army men involved you can be sure we'll take care of this

3802
03:07:11,231 --> 03:07:12,767
And he goes back to his army Folk

3803
03:07:13,023 --> 03:07:17,375
Look at him now is a totally political fired General he's not there, read anymore

3804
03:07:17,631 --> 03:07:19,935
It might as well be a politician and they don't cooperate with him

3805
03:07:20,703 --> 03:07:24,287
Emily says we have to look into this thing essentially say no we have to cover it up

3806
03:07:24,799 --> 03:07:28,127
They gave him a whole bunch of good reasons why I should be covered up in a

3807
03:07:28,383 --> 03:07:31,967
Affect International standing it will affect our troops in Manchuria blah blah blah

3808
03:07:32,479 --> 03:07:37,343
But the bottom line is he doesn't have the power and it's made a parent during this incident

3809
03:07:37,599 --> 03:07:43,743
To tell them no I don't want you were approached I'm the boss were going to do it my way he essentially has to go back with his tail between his

3810
03:07:45,279 --> 03:07:49,119
When the emperor finds out he didn't do anything the emperor turns into the Hulk and blames

3811
03:07:49,375 --> 03:07:50,399
Him

3812
03:07:51,167 --> 03:07:53,215
With the famous line the emperor

3813
03:07:53,471 --> 03:07:53,983
Said

3814
03:07:54,239 --> 03:07:55,007
Hindi

3815
03:07:55,519 --> 03:08:01,663
Post-war conversations to Allied investigators the emperor says he told the Prime Minister don't you think you should resign

3816
03:08:02,431 --> 03:08:02,943
Boom

3817
03:08:03,455 --> 03:08:04,223
I mean that nice

3818
03:08:04,479 --> 03:08:10,111
Banal little comment there is more powerful to a Japanese person especially a general like to not.

3819
03:08:10,623 --> 03:08:16,511
Then anything a mustachioed spitting fascist dictator type getting in your face and threatening to

3820
03:08:16,767 --> 03:08:20,863
Dismember you nine ways to Sunday could achieve and Tanaka will not only

3821
03:08:21,631 --> 03:08:23,679
Fall from Government Hill died soon afterward

3822
03:08:25,471 --> 03:08:26,751
Don't make the emperor happy

3823
03:08:28,287 --> 03:08:28,799
Leave

3824
03:08:30,079 --> 03:08:30,591
By the way

3825
03:08:30,847 --> 03:08:34,687
It's worth pointing out that according to Hirohito he learned from this

3826
03:08:34,943 --> 03:08:36,735
Youthful indiscretion

3827
03:08:37,247 --> 03:08:42,111
In a virtual sense killed this poor prime minister by turning into the Hulk and he would learn not to do it again

3828
03:08:42,879 --> 03:08:44,671
So this very intimate does one the reasons

3829
03:08:45,183 --> 03:08:46,207
Allegedly

3830
03:08:46,463 --> 03:08:50,047
You don't see the emperor involving himself more in these sort of matters

3831
03:08:50,559 --> 03:08:55,679
When after the war you keep looking at these things going why the heck in the emperor involve himself more of these matters

3832
03:08:57,471 --> 03:08:59,519
The real bottom-line though if you look at it

3833
03:09:00,031 --> 03:09:05,151
And according to Hirohito himself is there were higher-ups who might have been implicated in all this

3834
03:09:05,407 --> 03:09:10,015
At a real investigation and maybe some interrogation under torture of the

3835
03:09:10,271 --> 03:09:12,575
Mid-level officers who carried out this stuff

3836
03:09:12,831 --> 03:09:18,975
Hirohito says that the mid-level officer in question threatening to squeal about everything so you know things get covered up

3837
03:09:19,231 --> 03:09:20,255
No investigation in

3838
03:09:20,511 --> 03:09:26,655
Nothing to see here we move on and get a 1928 you've established this with a line in the sand that says

3839
03:09:27,167 --> 03:09:30,751
Bennett the political leaders in the military leaders disagree there's not much the political

3840
03:09:31,263 --> 03:09:32,031
To do about that

3841
03:09:32,287 --> 03:09:33,823
Unless the emperor gets involved

3842
03:09:34,079 --> 03:09:36,127
What she says you learn from this incident you shouldn't do

3843
03:09:39,199 --> 03:09:43,551
Let the 1928 train bombing what do we call it the chain Solin

3844
03:09:43,807 --> 03:09:45,087
Explosion death incident

3845
03:09:45,343 --> 03:09:46,367
The timing of that

3846
03:09:46,879 --> 03:09:48,159
Is not coincidental

3847
03:09:49,439 --> 03:09:54,047
It comes at a time when there is a lot of rising anxiety in the South Manchurian area

3848
03:09:55,071 --> 03:09:55,583
About

3849
03:09:56,095 --> 03:09:58,655
Events happening in China events that

3850
03:09:59,167 --> 03:10:01,727
Have the potential to go a certain way maybe

3851
03:10:02,239 --> 03:10:04,287
To cut off the supply of Manchuria

3852
03:10:04,543 --> 03:10:06,079
At some point in the future

3853
03:10:06,847 --> 03:10:09,919
And there are people who begin to make the argument that that can't happen

3854
03:10:10,431 --> 03:10:11,455
We're already hello

3855
03:10:12,735 --> 03:10:14,783
And it's worth asking the question

3856
03:10:15,039 --> 03:10:15,807
Who is Hawk

3857
03:10:16,319 --> 03:10:20,159
Are these corporate / government interest in the South Manchurian area

3858
03:10:20,671 --> 03:10:21,183
Are they home

3859
03:10:21,951 --> 03:10:24,255
Where's the government hook to the revenues coming in which

3860
03:10:24,511 --> 03:10:29,631
Unfortunately off and get turn right back around into new military expenditures because he's new areas require

3861
03:10:30,143 --> 03:10:31,423
In Greater amounts of troops

3862
03:10:31,679 --> 03:10:35,007
Your Navy all these other things and it comes with the cost right security protection

3863
03:10:36,543 --> 03:10:37,823
What are the people who

3864
03:10:38,847 --> 03:10:40,895
Well it's during this time period that an open

3865
03:10:41,407 --> 03:10:47,551
Propaganda pushes made to convince the Japanese people that darn right we're hooked and not just us you are hooked

3866
03:10:48,063 --> 03:10:49,599
We have this thing a lifeline

3867
03:10:50,623 --> 03:10:53,695
In Manchuria the connections to the Eurasian population in

3868
03:10:53,951 --> 03:10:55,487
Houston's raw materials and goods

3869
03:10:55,743 --> 03:10:58,303
Stop back to Japan that keeps us all alive

3870
03:10:59,839 --> 03:11:00,351
Well

3871
03:11:00,863 --> 03:11:04,959
The question about whether or not Japan really needs Manchuria is an interesting one

3872
03:11:05,471 --> 03:11:07,263
Astorian Sandra Wilson in her book

3873
03:11:07,775 --> 03:11:12,383
The Manchurian Crisis and Japanese Society 1931 to 1933

3874
03:11:12,895 --> 03:11:17,503
Point out that the whole idea of Manchuria is this vital lifeline

3875
03:11:18,015 --> 03:11:20,319
Is part of the propaganda of the Japanese state

3876
03:11:21,343 --> 03:11:25,695
The stuff is using to justify whatever is required to keep using Manchuria

3877
03:11:26,975 --> 03:11:29,023
Using the equivalent of the idea that

3878
03:11:29,791 --> 03:11:30,303
We're hooked

3879
03:11:32,095 --> 03:11:32,607
She writes quote

3880
03:11:33,631 --> 03:11:38,495
The principle that Japan was dependent upon access to the resources of Manchuria

3881
03:11:38,751 --> 03:11:40,287
First survival is a nation

3882
03:11:40,543 --> 03:11:42,847
Was part of an attempt to create a narrative

3883
03:11:43,103 --> 03:11:45,663
Justifying Japan's claim to the region

3884
03:11:45,919 --> 03:11:47,199
Emma's closely linked

3885
03:11:47,455 --> 03:11:50,783
With the assertion that man sure you're rightfully belong to the Japanese

3886
03:11:51,551 --> 03:11:54,111
Spike China's technical sovereignty over it

3887
03:11:55,391 --> 03:11:55,903
And quote

3888
03:11:58,207 --> 03:12:00,767
She then goes on to describe this phrase that was in use

3889
03:12:01,279 --> 03:12:03,327
And she points out that it had

3890
03:12:03,583 --> 03:12:07,167
I should have diplomatic Tony it referred to

3891
03:12:07,423 --> 03:12:13,567
So did the idea of what Japan has already paid in Blood and sacrifice an investment for this

3892
03:12:13,823 --> 03:12:16,639
What we talked about earlier

3893
03:12:16,895 --> 03:12:18,431
And certain things keep you there

3894
03:12:18,943 --> 03:12:19,967
She writes quote

3895
03:12:20,991 --> 03:12:24,063
Far from being a dry diplomatic term

3896
03:12:24,319 --> 03:12:29,951
Kenny G in the early 1930s was rather asmira, he only has pointed out

3897
03:12:30,207 --> 03:12:31,487
A vivid word

3898
03:12:31,743 --> 03:12:34,303
Suggesting sacrifice in the shedding of blood

3899
03:12:34,815 --> 03:12:37,887
And it relied for its effect Upon A Certain view of History

3900
03:12:38,143 --> 03:12:42,495
In which the sino-japanese and russo-japanese War has figured prominently

3901
03:12:43,263 --> 03:12:44,031
Manchuria

3902
03:12:44,287 --> 03:12:44,799
She writes

3903
03:12:45,055 --> 03:12:50,943
Was frequently referred to as the place where the spirits of 200,000 Japanese war heroes slept

3904
03:12:51,455 --> 03:12:57,599
The importance of the South Manchurian Railway and a large amount of Japanese public money which it contributed through

3905
03:12:57,855 --> 03:13:00,415
Through the railway to the development of Manchuria

3906
03:13:00,671 --> 03:13:01,695
We're also invoked

3907
03:13:01,951 --> 03:13:03,743
As evidence of Japan's right

3908
03:13:03,999 --> 03:13:06,303
Freely to exploit The Manchurian resources

3909
03:13:07,071 --> 03:13:07,583
And quote

3910
03:13:09,119 --> 03:13:10,655
Citing the sacrifices of

3911
03:13:10,911 --> 03:13:12,703
200000 mortgage

3912
03:13:13,215 --> 03:13:15,519
Would be I would think a pretty effective

3913
03:13:15,775 --> 03:13:18,591
Tactic in most countries even today

3914
03:13:19,103 --> 03:13:24,735
In the Uber patriotic Arrow we're talking about even more effective in the Uber patriotic

3915
03:13:24,991 --> 03:13:27,039
Japan even more effective than that

3916
03:13:30,111 --> 03:13:35,743
But if you happen to be an investor for example in in the South Manchurian Railway

3917
03:13:36,255 --> 03:13:42,399
You have every reason right around the same time. That this warlord's done away with to worry about your in

3918
03:13:42,655 --> 03:13:43,423
Vestments because

3919
03:13:44,447 --> 03:13:50,591
Events in China are starting to get to a point where it's conceivable to see somebody unifying

3920
03:13:51,103 --> 03:13:52,639
In the not-too-distant future

3921
03:13:53,663 --> 03:13:54,943
And what's going to happen

3922
03:13:55,199 --> 03:13:55,967
If that occurs

3923
03:13:56,223 --> 03:13:58,527
Remember everybody's been taking advantage

3924
03:13:58,783 --> 03:13:59,551
China during the

3925
03:14:00,063 --> 03:14:02,623
Proceeding. Here because it's been down

3926
03:14:03,647 --> 03:14:04,927
But what if it gets up

3927
03:14:06,207 --> 03:14:12,095
This is the sleeping giant of the world the largest population on the planet when it's all put together it's a land mass

3928
03:14:12,351 --> 03:14:13,887
Size of the United States

3929
03:14:14,655 --> 03:14:17,215
The Japanese have been taking advantage of this

3930
03:14:17,727 --> 03:14:23,359
In a situation while the Chinese are weak they currently occupy places the Chinese consider their

3931
03:14:23,871 --> 03:14:27,967
What's going to happen if all of a sudden somebody put Humpty Dumpty back together again here

3932
03:14:29,503 --> 03:14:31,807
They'll have half a billion people

3933
03:14:32,319 --> 03:14:34,623
The Japanese have 70 million

3934
03:14:37,183 --> 03:14:39,743
How does a long-term trends hair look

3935
03:14:41,023 --> 03:14:44,351
I mean you can see a positive possible outcome if you are the

3936
03:14:44,607 --> 03:14:45,119
People

3937
03:14:45,631 --> 03:14:46,655
You know who want to keep this

3938
03:14:46,911 --> 03:14:49,983
Lifeline to Japan open you want to keep this

3939
03:14:50,751 --> 03:14:51,775
You know addiction

3940
03:14:52,031 --> 03:14:57,919
You can make it work but it means you got to either keep China perpetually divided or split it up permanently

3941
03:14:58,175 --> 03:14:59,711
Will you got to take it over

3942
03:14:59,967 --> 03:15:04,831
Or you got to control it in such a way that you will never lose control of it but you get to tell it what to do

3943
03:15:05,087 --> 03:15:08,159
You can't have a powerful independent China though

3944
03:15:08,671 --> 03:15:12,255
Because obviously that's going to get messy when they want their stuff back

3945
03:15:14,047 --> 03:15:15,327
The other of course policy

3946
03:15:15,583 --> 03:15:17,119
Approach you could take is the one that those

3947
03:15:17,631 --> 03:15:19,423
More liberal people in Japan

3948
03:15:20,191 --> 03:15:26,335
Let's have this Cooperative Asian relationship with China or Japan and China Uno with their population increase

3949
03:15:26,591 --> 03:15:27,103
Resources

3950
03:15:27,615 --> 03:15:28,639
And our high-tech

3951
03:15:29,151 --> 03:15:30,943
You know nose to the grindstone

3952
03:15:31,455 --> 03:15:33,759
Fanatical work ethic I mean we can do anyting

3953
03:15:35,295 --> 03:15:41,439
Maybe you go the route those people want because it's the only way to deal with China wants their back on their feet start negotiating now

3954
03:15:41,695 --> 03:15:45,023
When they're still weak so that they don't hate you later because the Japanese

3955
03:15:45,279 --> 03:15:48,607
R not in good graces with the Chinese population during this period

3956
03:15:48,863 --> 03:15:51,679
Sleeping giant has already awoken on the ground

3957
03:15:52,447 --> 03:15:54,751
The Chinese people are pissed off

3958
03:15:55,519 --> 03:15:59,103
And a lot of historians blame the 1950s in the middle of the

3959
03:15:59,615 --> 03:16:05,503
First world war when everybody's attention was on Western Europe the Japanese try to slip one of these treaties on a very weak in China that would have made them

3960
03:16:05,759 --> 03:16:07,551
Total colony and I freaked out the Chinese

3961
03:16:08,063 --> 03:16:12,159
But the people freaked out it wasn't a governmental thing I mean the people started boycotting

3962
03:16:12,415 --> 03:16:18,559
Japanese Goods riots with a rubber they kill Japanese officials in in a Chinese I mean it was anger

3963
03:16:19,071 --> 03:16:19,583
It was the same

3964
03:16:19,839 --> 03:16:22,655
Kind of nationalist Awakening to Japan and had

3965
03:16:22,911 --> 03:16:27,263
You know when Commodore Perry at America's black Fleet you know came and opened them up

3966
03:16:28,031 --> 03:16:29,823
You get this Awakening in the case of

3967
03:16:30,079 --> 03:16:34,175
China they were mad at everybody for what has happened when they were weak being taken advantage of

3968
03:16:34,687 --> 03:16:36,223
The Japanese more and more

3969
03:16:36,735 --> 03:16:37,247
Wer

3970
03:16:38,015 --> 03:16:39,039
You're getting the focus

3971
03:16:39,551 --> 03:16:41,343
Specifically of their ire

3972
03:16:42,111 --> 03:16:48,255
And so if you want to forestall this if you don't want the sleeping giant to be mad at you when it's fully awake and now might be the time to

3973
03:16:48,511 --> 03:16:49,023
Start

3974
03:16:49,279 --> 03:16:50,303
Catching up Old Wounds

3975
03:16:50,559 --> 03:16:51,839
Fixing things and by the way

3976
03:16:52,095 --> 03:16:54,143
567 years before this.

3977
03:16:54,399 --> 03:17:00,287
You know when will Sonia nism rainbows and unicorns were totally and play the Japanese were giving territory back to China

3978
03:17:00,543 --> 03:17:02,847
Kind of this peninsula Tina when they were trying it was

3979
03:17:03,103 --> 03:17:03,871
Policy for a minute

3980
03:17:05,663 --> 03:17:10,015
But the people in Tokyo are necessarily in control of policy as we said

3981
03:17:10,271 --> 03:17:13,343
This is where the tail wagging the dog comes into play

3982
03:17:13,599 --> 03:17:15,903
Or a bunch of people who are on the ground

3983
03:17:16,415 --> 03:17:18,463
Can create situations

3984
03:17:18,719 --> 03:17:19,231
That the

3985
03:17:19,487 --> 03:17:22,303
Military and even the government behind them

3986
03:17:22,559 --> 03:17:24,863
Simply have no option but to respond to

3987
03:17:25,119 --> 03:17:26,911
Once again if you're conspiratorial

3988
03:17:27,167 --> 03:17:29,471
You don't believe any of this is like this you believe

3989
03:17:29,727 --> 03:17:31,775
It emanated from Ground Zero

3990
03:17:32,287 --> 03:17:33,311
And has been

3991
03:17:33,567 --> 03:17:39,455
You know what Scarlett responsibility laundered the hallway but the the traditional story is we have elements that are out of

3992
03:17:39,711 --> 03:17:40,223
Control

3993
03:17:40,479 --> 03:17:41,503
You in Asia

3994
03:17:41,759 --> 03:17:43,551
Better able to prompt event

3995
03:17:43,807 --> 03:17:47,135
But everyone else has no choice but to respond to for example

3996
03:17:47,647 --> 03:17:48,927
In 1931

3997
03:17:49,439 --> 03:17:50,719
There will be another

3998
03:17:51,743 --> 03:17:54,815
Explosion on a railway track are you sensing a pattern here

3999
03:17:55,327 --> 03:17:58,143
Also carried out supposedly by mid-level

4000
03:17:58,399 --> 03:17:59,679
Japanese officers

4001
03:18:01,215 --> 03:18:01,983
Here's the way

4002
03:18:03,007 --> 03:18:07,103
Historian James Allen McLain in a modern history of Japan describes it

4003
03:18:07,359 --> 03:18:07,871
Quote

4004
03:18:09,151 --> 03:18:11,199
Captain calimoto Su amore

4005
03:18:11,455 --> 03:18:15,551
Lay the 42 yellow packages and Blasting powder with care

4006
03:18:16,063 --> 03:18:20,415
Shortly after 10 p.m. on September 8th 1931

4007
03:18:20,671 --> 03:18:21,439
He detonated the

4008
03:18:21,951 --> 03:18:26,047
Just placing a portion of the tracks of the South Manchuria Railway line

4009
03:18:26,303 --> 03:18:28,607
Is it past the northern outskirts of Moncton

4010
03:18:29,119 --> 03:18:33,727
How a motor when his co-conspirators intended to derail the Dairy Inn Express

4011
03:18:33,983 --> 03:18:35,007
Do just minutes later

4012
03:18:35,263 --> 03:18:38,079
And blame the act on the local Chinese Warlord

4013
03:18:38,591 --> 03:18:39,359
Zhang julong

4014
03:18:39,871 --> 03:18:42,943
Incredibly when the train reached the damaged section of track

4015
03:18:43,199 --> 03:18:46,015
It's weighed only slightly and passed on safely

4016
03:18:46,527 --> 03:18:47,295
Unruffled

4017
03:18:47,551 --> 03:18:51,135
Calimoto relayed a pre-arranged message to his home base

4018
03:18:51,903 --> 03:18:54,463
This is the famous prearranged message quote

4019
03:18:54,975 --> 03:18:59,583
Engaged in action with the Chinese forces who set off explosion along Railroad

4020
03:18:59,839 --> 03:19:00,607
And quote

4021
03:19:00,863 --> 03:19:02,143
The author continues

4022
03:19:02,655 --> 03:19:03,167
Quote

4023
03:19:03,423 --> 03:19:08,543
Ostensibly in response to that quote-unquote unprovoked aggression

4024
03:19:08,799 --> 03:19:14,687
Units of Japan's kwantung Army immediately attacked the barracks of James soldiers in Moncton

4025
03:19:14,943 --> 03:19:15,711
Enchantress

4026
03:19:16,223 --> 03:19:19,807
Within 48 Hours Japanese troops occupied the two cities

4027
03:19:20,319 --> 03:19:23,647
And do it hurricane g a colonel in the Guangdong Army

4028
03:19:23,903 --> 03:19:24,927
Name himself

4029
03:19:25,183 --> 03:19:27,743
They had an emergency committee to govern moved in

4030
03:19:27,999 --> 03:19:32,095
Effectively detaching that provincial capital from Chinese control

4031
03:19:32,607 --> 03:19:33,375
And quote

4032
03:19:35,167 --> 03:19:40,799
This event by the way is known by a couple different names most famously it's called The Manchurian Incident

4033
03:19:42,079 --> 03:19:43,871
History Andrew Gordon says that engine

4034
03:19:44,127 --> 03:19:46,687
Japan this is generally considered to be the start of a

4035
03:19:47,199 --> 03:19:50,015
They call the 15-year War which is essentially II

4036
03:19:51,295 --> 03:19:53,087
This is an explosive moment

4037
03:19:53,343 --> 03:19:54,879
In some people's view of the

4038
03:19:55,135 --> 03:19:56,159
Entire subject we going

4039
03:19:56,415 --> 03:19:57,183
You talk about here

4040
03:19:58,719 --> 03:19:59,999
And it is the result of

4041
03:20:00,255 --> 03:20:03,071
How much James Bond Undercover

4042
03:20:03,583 --> 03:20:06,399
You look like the Star Wars bar with all the

4043
03:20:06,911 --> 03:20:08,191
Gun-slinging

4044
03:20:08,959 --> 03:20:12,287
Yuno Bootleggers from that time. I mean here's how

4045
03:20:12,543 --> 03:20:13,311
Historian Mary

4046
03:20:13,567 --> 03:20:14,335
Jensen described

4047
03:20:14,591 --> 03:20:18,431
And he's a pretty sober historian so when he uses a word like

4048
03:20:19,199 --> 03:20:19,711
Hardy

4049
03:20:20,479 --> 03:20:21,503
Understand

4050
03:20:22,015 --> 03:20:24,063
You know how much like a novel

4051
03:20:24,319 --> 03:20:26,111
This is but these are the people

4052
03:20:26,367 --> 03:20:29,183
Engineering these events on the ground in a place like

4053
03:20:29,439 --> 03:20:29,951
Like Manchuria

4054
03:20:30,975 --> 03:20:31,743
Jensen rights quote

4055
03:20:33,279 --> 03:20:35,583
Waters had better success in Manchuria

4056
03:20:35,839 --> 03:20:39,423
In the days preceding the explosion that triggered the Manchurian Incident

4057
03:20:39,679 --> 03:20:44,287
An unsavory group in Japanese and collected in Guangdong Army headquarters

4058
03:20:44,799 --> 03:20:46,847
Ethan Goes On by the way the name these people

4059
03:20:47,103 --> 03:20:48,895
The first one is a guy who murdered

4060
03:20:50,175 --> 03:20:51,455
You know you left leaning

4061
03:20:52,223 --> 03:20:52,991
Tickets a writer

4062
03:20:53,503 --> 03:20:54,271
And he was there

4063
03:20:54,783 --> 03:20:57,343
Sentences with money sent by Japanese rightists

4064
03:20:58,111 --> 03:21:00,927
But he says even better Finance was this colonel

4065
03:21:01,183 --> 03:21:03,231
You know the guy who would actually blown up

4066
03:21:03,487 --> 03:21:06,559
The warlord in the train he's there too

4067
03:21:07,327 --> 03:21:09,375
And Jensen says quote arrogance

4068
03:21:09,631 --> 03:21:13,727
Abaris and dishonesty found shelter under the claims of crisis

4069
03:21:14,239 --> 03:21:16,287
Kwantung army officers were in touch

4070
03:21:16,543 --> 03:21:19,615
With Associated figures in the Tokyo general staff

4071
03:21:20,127 --> 03:21:21,151
But those man

4072
03:21:21,407 --> 03:21:27,295
Doubting the timing though personally favoring the KU dispatch tachikawa you'll shoot Seger

4073
03:21:27,551 --> 03:21:29,343
Freshly disappointed that March

4074
03:21:29,599 --> 03:21:32,415
To the scene to urge caution and delay

4075
03:21:32,927 --> 03:21:36,767
Taunton Army plotters aware of talking cat was mission

4076
03:21:37,023 --> 03:21:40,095
Deflected him when he arrived with a round of partying

4077
03:21:40,351 --> 03:21:42,655
The delayed his appearance at headquarters

4078
03:21:42,911 --> 03:21:48,799
When he was ready to resume his mission the next morning a bomb had already gone off on the south Manchurian tracks

4079
03:21:49,311 --> 03:21:49,823
And quote

4080
03:21:51,871 --> 03:21:55,711
So the government not necessarily against the idea of this Manchurian deal

4081
03:21:55,967 --> 03:22:02,111
But doubting that it's a good time send somebody to say don't do it now he's deflected by a bunch of people to take him out drink

4082
03:22:02,367 --> 03:22:07,999
Working so we can't deliver the message right away by the time he's sobered up and ready to deliver the message the events already happened

4083
03:22:08,511 --> 03:22:10,047
That's like a movie isn't it

4084
03:22:11,327 --> 03:22:17,471
But this isn't like the 1928 incident where everybody seemed caught off-guard there's a bunch of people who know this is going to happen and there's a

4085
03:22:17,727 --> 03:22:18,495
A lot more people

4086
03:22:18,751 --> 03:22:22,847
Who knew that at some point you know in the distant future this was likely to happen

4087
03:22:23,359 --> 03:22:24,383
And when it does

4088
03:22:24,639 --> 03:22:26,175
The civilian government

4089
03:22:26,687 --> 03:22:28,735
Is exposed as powerless now

4090
03:22:29,759 --> 03:22:33,087
As an aside we should point out that the prime minister in Powers often

4091
03:22:33,599 --> 03:22:35,135
Lambasted this week

4092
03:22:35,647 --> 03:22:36,671
So maybe he is

4093
03:22:37,183 --> 03:22:39,999
But he wrote an emergency note to one of the

4094
03:22:40,255 --> 03:22:42,047
Minnesota of Old Guard

4095
03:22:42,303 --> 03:22:48,447
A wise man that are built into the Japanese system to General who work less and less powerful than they used to be back in the major

4096
03:22:48,703 --> 03:22:51,007
Restoration days but this guy's obviously desperate

4097
03:22:51,263 --> 03:22:54,079
And this note comes only hours after the

4098
03:22:54,335 --> 03:22:57,919
Explosion happens where the government is finding out about this stuff from the newspaper

4099
03:22:58,943 --> 03:23:02,015
There are me the Japanese Army over there not telling him anything

4100
03:23:04,575 --> 03:23:06,623
The prime minister's name by the way is wakatsuki

4101
03:23:07,135 --> 03:23:07,647
And his

4102
03:23:08,671 --> 03:23:09,951
Appeal to the

4103
03:23:10,463 --> 03:23:12,767
General for assistance says quote

4104
03:23:13,791 --> 03:23:17,887
I am not being kept informed by either the foreign Ministry or the Army Ministry

4105
03:23:18,143 --> 03:23:21,471
I have just warned them through Chief cabinet secretary Kawasaki

4106
03:23:21,727 --> 03:23:26,335
The Chinese forces in Manchuria in Mongolia number more than 200,000

4107
03:23:26,847 --> 03:23:28,383
Well we have at least some ten thousand

4108
03:23:28,895 --> 03:23:30,687
I asked the Army minister

4109
03:23:30,943 --> 03:23:33,503
What are you going to do if by chance your challenge

4110
03:23:33,759 --> 03:23:35,807
Causes something you haven't anticipated

4111
03:23:36,319 --> 03:23:38,623
Something that giving you are so outnumbered

4112
03:23:38,879 --> 03:23:39,647
You can't stop

4113
03:23:40,415 --> 03:23:41,695
Army Minister told me

4114
03:23:41,951 --> 03:23:45,791
Will sending troops from Korea indeed they may have already gone in

4115
03:23:46,303 --> 03:23:47,327
I rebuked him

4116
03:23:47,839 --> 03:23:50,655
How can you allow dispatch of soldiers from Korea

4117
03:23:50,911 --> 03:23:52,447
Without government authorization

4118
03:23:52,959 --> 03:23:53,471
He said

4119
03:23:53,727 --> 03:23:59,103
Well the fact is that during the Tanaka cabinet troops were dispatched without Imperial sanction

4120
03:23:59,615 --> 03:24:02,175
I gather he had not foreseen any problem at all

4121
03:24:02,431 --> 03:24:06,015
Under these circumstances I'm quite powerless to restrain the military

4122
03:24:06,527 --> 03:24:09,343
How can his Majesty's military Act without his sanction

4123
03:24:09,599 --> 03:24:10,623
What can I do

4124
03:24:11,135 --> 03:24:13,183
Maybe I should not be talking to you like this but

4125
03:24:13,439 --> 03:24:14,719
Can you do anything

4126
03:24:14,975 --> 03:24:16,255
I'm in serious trouble

4127
03:24:17,023 --> 03:24:17,535
And quote

4128
03:24:19,071 --> 03:24:20,863
Who's the Prime Minister sounds

4129
03:24:21,887 --> 03:24:24,703
Panic there it's not just my vocal interpretation

4130
03:24:25,471 --> 03:24:28,287
This is the way Mary's B Jensen describes the situation

4131
03:24:28,543 --> 03:24:31,615
It was all this is coming to life in the hours after the incident

4132
03:24:31,871 --> 03:24:32,383
Quote

4133
03:24:32,895 --> 03:24:36,735
Within hours the Guantanamo Army achieved its initial military objectives

4134
03:24:36,991 --> 03:24:38,271
Against the fengtian army

4135
03:24:39,295 --> 03:24:40,831
What's the forces were engaged

4136
03:24:41,087 --> 03:24:45,439
Reuse of military necessity were used as justification for additional move

4137
03:24:45,951 --> 03:24:49,279
Giving the lie to promises from the Tokyo civilian government

4138
03:24:49,535 --> 03:24:51,583
But these were steps taken to preserve order

4139
03:24:51,839 --> 03:24:53,887
And that no further expansion was contemplate

4140
03:24:54,655 --> 03:25:00,031
Those in positions of responsibility we're anxious to limit the incident and regain control of events

4141
03:25:00,543 --> 03:25:05,151
Why the field and Junior grade officers that people the general staff and army Ministry

4142
03:25:05,407 --> 03:25:06,175
Or jubilant

4143
03:25:06,431 --> 03:25:11,295
Manchuria Mongolia quote and quote problem was finally being address

4144
03:25:11,807 --> 03:25:15,903
In Tokyo he writes the atmosphere was electric with rumors of plots

4145
03:25:16,159 --> 03:25:17,439
To take on the home government

4146
03:25:17,951 --> 03:25:20,255
A nervous government did its best to hush things up

4147
03:25:20,511 --> 03:25:22,559
To avoid destabilizing the situation

4148
03:25:22,815 --> 03:25:25,119
But this had the effect of magnifying rumors

4149
03:25:25,375 --> 03:25:27,423
The reality he writes was bad enough

4150
03:25:27,935 --> 03:25:28,703
And quote

4151
03:25:30,239 --> 03:25:31,519
So what was that reality

4152
03:25:32,287 --> 03:25:35,103
Well some of the ultra-nationalist looked at this as

4153
03:25:35,615 --> 03:25:37,151
The coming out party

4154
03:25:37,663 --> 03:25:38,943
Jensen continues quote

4155
03:25:40,479 --> 03:25:46,623
A few weeks after violence broke out in Manchuria lieutenant-colonel Hashimoto kangaroo II division

4156
03:25:46,879 --> 03:25:47,647
General staff

4157
03:25:47,903 --> 03:25:50,719
Install Words of the cherry blossom Society

4158
03:25:50,975 --> 03:25:56,863
Conceived a bizarre plan to wipe out the entire government by aerial bombardment of a cabinet meeting

4159
03:25:57,375 --> 03:25:58,655
A crowd of rightists

4160
03:25:58,911 --> 03:26:02,239
Within surround the war Ministry in general staff headquarters

4161
03:26:02,495 --> 03:26:05,567
Adam and the creation of a military government

4162
03:26:06,079 --> 03:26:06,591
For this

4163
03:26:06,847 --> 03:26:10,175
October incident as it was called which never took place

4164
03:26:10,687 --> 03:26:14,527
Hashimoto received 20 days confinement from superiors

4165
03:26:14,783 --> 03:26:18,623
Who did their best to deny that anything untoward had taken place

4166
03:26:18,879 --> 03:26:19,647
And quote

4167
03:26:20,927 --> 03:26:22,719
This guy's got a plot

4168
03:26:23,487 --> 03:26:29,631
To destroy the government by bombing it while it's in session and he gets 20 days confinement from superiors

4169
03:26:31,423 --> 03:26:32,959
What's going to happen here though

4170
03:26:33,471 --> 03:26:36,543
Is going to get Japan in all kinds of trouble because of

4171
03:26:37,055 --> 03:26:40,383
As over the months go on and the kwantung Army just keeps

4172
03:26:40,895 --> 03:26:45,503
Rounding out their conquest and looking to create it says buffer zones to keep

4173
03:26:45,759 --> 03:26:47,807
Are Bandits and whatnot farther away

4174
03:26:48,319 --> 03:26:49,855
Their conquering Manchuria

4175
03:26:51,391 --> 03:26:54,719
And the people in Japan that were worried and were against this

4176
03:26:55,487 --> 03:26:58,303
Start coming around I mean for the first two weeks

4177
03:26:58,559 --> 03:27:02,911
Stuff I've been reading since the Japanese populist wasn't sure what to think about this but after

4178
03:27:03,167 --> 03:27:06,751
You know incessant propaganda and talk about how this is the life line

4179
03:27:07,007 --> 03:27:12,895
And stories and films of Japanese going to Victory the public comes around and they support this big

4180
03:27:13,407 --> 03:27:18,271
So you're the politician kind of worried the same we need to get control of the situation and no more expansion

4181
03:27:18,527 --> 03:27:21,343
But every time the Army expands the public loves it

4182
03:27:22,111 --> 03:27:22,879
What do you do

4183
03:27:23,903 --> 03:27:28,767
Well if there were no consequences maybe you just go along with it but there are consequences in their huge

4184
03:27:29,279 --> 03:27:30,559
Haley directly to war

4185
03:27:33,119 --> 03:27:35,167
And let's remember in this war

4186
03:27:36,191 --> 03:27:38,239
A bunch of these patriotic civilians

4187
03:27:39,263 --> 03:27:40,799
Supporting the troops

4188
03:27:41,567 --> 03:27:42,335
I'm going to die

4189
03:27:42,591 --> 03:27:43,359
In their home

4190
03:27:43,615 --> 03:27:44,639
Burn to death

4191
03:27:46,175 --> 03:27:47,199
I had conversations

4192
03:27:47,711 --> 03:27:48,223
A lot

4193
03:27:48,991 --> 03:27:49,503
Over the years with

4194
03:27:49,759 --> 03:27:50,271
People

4195
03:27:50,527 --> 03:27:53,343
About what's called strategic bombing the bombing of

4196
03:27:53,855 --> 03:27:55,135
Civilians in cities

4197
03:27:55,903 --> 03:28:02,047
The prevalent in the second world war and there are so many side issues and moral quandaries and things to examine but the one

4198
03:28:02,559 --> 03:28:03,839
That often gets brought up and it

4199
03:28:04,863 --> 03:28:05,631
Well it's

4200
03:28:05,887 --> 03:28:09,471
At this point in the story where it's relevant if it's relevant at all

4201
03:28:09,983 --> 03:28:13,823
Has to do with responsibility on the part of your average Japanese person

4202
03:28:14,079 --> 03:28:16,383
They're getting bombed in the Second World War

4203
03:28:16,895 --> 03:28:20,223
Is that something that's the equivalent of getting their just desserts

4204
03:28:21,503 --> 03:28:22,783
Historical sort of

4205
03:28:23,807 --> 03:28:25,599
The warning maybe lessons are

4206
03:28:26,367 --> 03:28:27,135
Not real in here

4207
03:28:27,391 --> 03:28:33,535
History but is it sort of something that reminds you that these sorts of things have consequences because there people that will blame the Japanese

4208
03:28:33,791 --> 03:28:34,303
Public

4209
03:28:34,815 --> 03:28:35,839
For supporting

4210
03:28:36,607 --> 03:28:42,751
End of this road to war that they're going down but cannot support it seems a little counterintuitive I mean How likely is

4211
03:28:43,007 --> 03:28:44,031
Is it to imagine

4212
03:28:44,799 --> 03:28:50,943
This Japanese public conditions the way we've talked about with all the carrots and sticks and cultural head binding and and punished

4213
03:28:51,199 --> 03:28:51,711
For people who

4214
03:28:51,967 --> 03:28:54,015
You didn't owe the line and all these other thing

4215
03:28:54,271 --> 03:28:57,343
How likely is it to have imagined that they would do anything other

4216
03:28:58,111 --> 03:28:59,391
And support their troops

4217
03:29:00,159 --> 03:29:02,207
When the troops are victorious in the field

4218
03:29:02,463 --> 03:29:04,511
Right when it's their own son's out there fighting

4219
03:29:06,559 --> 03:29:10,143
Of course you got the government pushing the super propaganda button all the time

4220
03:29:10,655 --> 03:29:12,191
How likely is it

4221
03:29:12,703 --> 03:29:14,751
That you're going to see anything other than what you did see

4222
03:29:15,007 --> 03:29:16,031
What's more

4223
03:29:16,543 --> 03:29:17,567
Forget all the

4224
03:29:17,823 --> 03:29:21,151
Cultural head binding stuff I've been throwing out there and just think about your own people

4225
03:29:21,919 --> 03:29:23,455
How hard is it to imagine

4226
03:29:23,967 --> 03:29:26,271
You know most of them not coming out and so

4227
03:29:26,527 --> 03:29:27,039
Supporting

4228
03:29:27,295 --> 03:29:27,807
The troops

4229
03:29:28,575 --> 03:29:30,879
It's something that can be reliably counted

4230
03:29:31,391 --> 03:29:32,927
I'm so if that's the case

4231
03:29:34,463 --> 03:29:37,535
Can you really hold people accountable and say they had any

4232
03:29:38,047 --> 03:29:41,375
Real options as a group right and sometimes individuals

4233
03:29:41,631 --> 03:29:42,911
Surprise at the end

4234
03:29:43,423 --> 03:29:45,983
Was there really another road for the Japanese

4235
03:29:46,495 --> 03:29:49,055
Patriotic civilians to go down once their truth

4236
03:29:49,311 --> 03:29:49,823
Fighting in the

4237
03:29:50,079 --> 03:29:50,591
Field

4238
03:29:53,407 --> 03:29:55,711
It's an interesting question as I said but

4239
03:29:56,223 --> 03:29:57,503
I guess the way I look at it

4240
03:29:57,759 --> 03:29:59,295
Is I look at it and think got that.

4241
03:29:59,551 --> 03:30:00,063
Happen to anybody

4242
03:30:02,367 --> 03:30:04,927
If that means we can all be bombed and deserve it well

4243
03:30:05,695 --> 03:30:06,207
That's a scary thought

4244
03:30:06,463 --> 03:30:06,975
God isn't it

4245
03:30:08,767 --> 03:30:09,535
In case of it

4246
03:30:10,047 --> 03:30:12,607
Uber patriotic Japanese during this period

4247
03:30:13,119 --> 03:30:15,423
It's extra scary cuz this is like a blank

4248
03:30:15,679 --> 03:30:16,191
Check

4249
03:30:16,447 --> 03:30:19,519
For whatever this kwangtung armies going to do

4250
03:30:20,031 --> 03:30:23,103
Control from the central Authority is tenuous

4251
03:30:23,359 --> 03:30:24,127
At best

4252
03:30:24,639 --> 03:30:26,175
And over the next several months

4253
03:30:26,943 --> 03:30:27,455
This

4254
03:30:27,711 --> 03:30:29,759
Quantum Lori's going to destroy

4255
03:30:30,271 --> 03:30:32,063
Japanese diplomatic

4256
03:30:33,343 --> 03:30:38,975
Credibility with the rest of the world because over and over the Japanese government and even the top military officials are going to say

4257
03:30:39,231 --> 03:30:42,559
We're not going to advance any farther everything's going to stay the way it is and then they

4258
03:30:42,815 --> 03:30:43,839
Almost there saying

4259
03:30:44,351 --> 03:30:45,887
The Army in the field would have bats

4260
03:30:47,167 --> 03:30:48,447
At one point the army

4261
03:30:48,703 --> 03:30:53,055
It stopped one tonight because we are not going to promise we will not Advance on the city and they do

4262
03:30:54,335 --> 03:30:58,431
So the starting point not only is the rest of the world not believing anything the Japanese government is saying

4263
03:30:58,943 --> 03:31:00,991
But it's making them extra angry

4264
03:31:01,247 --> 03:31:03,295
I read one history tomato point of listen

4265
03:31:03,551 --> 03:31:09,183
This is a really bad time for the world in the Great Depression and all this everybody's got their own problems every country on the

4266
03:31:09,439 --> 03:31:12,511
Worldstage would love to be able to say I'm just going to ignore this until

4267
03:31:12,767 --> 03:31:13,791
The long way away

4268
03:31:14,559 --> 03:31:16,863
But looking like you're being played for fools

4269
03:31:17,119 --> 03:31:18,911
Over and over by the Japanese government

4270
03:31:19,167 --> 03:31:20,191
Instigates

4271
03:31:20,447 --> 03:31:22,751
Push back that might not otherwise have been there

4272
03:31:24,031 --> 03:31:29,919
In defense of the Japanese government they may have believed it every time they said we're not going to move any farther

4273
03:31:31,455 --> 03:31:34,783
And then think about the weird position it puts the government in

4274
03:31:35,039 --> 03:31:37,855
When the Army does move farther

4275
03:31:38,111 --> 03:31:44,255
Against orders has great victories conquerors more territory the media show the newsreels and plays it up

4276
03:31:44,511 --> 03:31:45,535
The public is cheering

4277
03:31:46,047 --> 03:31:48,095
What are you supposed to do with denounce them

4278
03:31:49,119 --> 03:31:49,887
And remember

4279
03:31:50,143 --> 03:31:51,423
Nobody in the foreign

4280
03:31:52,191 --> 03:31:56,287
World out there at all knows that you don't control your own Army

4281
03:31:56,543 --> 03:32:00,127
You don't want to admit that to them so you kind of have to own these things now

4282
03:32:00,639 --> 03:32:04,479
It's a bizarre situation it gets even more weird time to because

4283
03:32:04,991 --> 03:32:06,527
And you can't tell again if there's a

4284
03:32:07,039 --> 03:32:10,879
A forced feeling to this if you feel like you have to do it if they really want to

4285
03:32:11,135 --> 03:32:12,927
But I mean the emperor has to have

4286
03:32:13,183 --> 03:32:15,999
The general of the Guangdong Army over 40

4287
03:32:17,279 --> 03:32:18,303
Private meeting in the

4288
03:32:18,559 --> 03:32:20,863
Talisman normous on Earth

4289
03:32:21,119 --> 03:32:24,191
He's being honored for all these conquests in Manchuria

4290
03:32:24,447 --> 03:32:26,495
But he went against orders to do

4291
03:32:26,751 --> 03:32:30,079
In what sort of message are you sending here it's Bazaar

4292
03:32:31,871 --> 03:32:34,943
I should point out there have always been some historians and writers out there that's

4293
03:32:35,199 --> 03:32:36,479
Suggest that is possible

4294
03:32:36,991 --> 03:32:39,807
Did you could look at this entire situation with this

4295
03:32:40,063 --> 03:32:42,367
Kwantung Army acting on its own

4296
03:32:43,135 --> 03:32:44,159
As a case

4297
03:32:44,415 --> 03:32:47,999
Gecko Cujo on a mass scale Army wide level

4298
03:32:48,767 --> 03:32:49,535
Entire Army

4299
03:32:50,303 --> 03:32:52,095
Being insubordinate for high-minded more

4300
03:32:52,351 --> 03:32:52,863
Reasons

4301
03:32:54,655 --> 03:32:55,167
Do you say their heart

4302
03:32:55,423 --> 03:32:57,727
Was in the right place and maybe because of that you forgive them

4303
03:32:58,495 --> 03:33:00,287
Especially since they keep winning

4304
03:33:00,543 --> 03:33:01,311
See how that goes

4305
03:33:02,335 --> 03:33:03,359
But if it's true

4306
03:33:03,615 --> 03:33:05,663
Did this Army really did all this

4307
03:33:06,175 --> 03:33:06,687
On its own

4308
03:33:07,455 --> 03:33:09,503
And for super patriotic reasons

4309
03:33:09,759 --> 03:33:12,575
Is right well then they just managed to do in the very country

4310
03:33:13,087 --> 03:33:15,135
And deified emperor that they

4311
03:33:15,391 --> 03:33:15,903
Worship

4312
03:33:16,159 --> 03:33:16,671
Because

4313
03:33:16,927 --> 03:33:17,695
They've gotten

4314
03:33:17,951 --> 03:33:19,231
Japan into a cycle now

4315
03:33:19,743 --> 03:33:20,255
But it's not going to be able

4316
03:33:20,511 --> 03:33:21,023
Get out of

4317
03:33:22,047 --> 03:33:28,191
The best example I came up with is unfortunately am limited practical value cuz unless you gone out to deep in the ocean

4318
03:33:28,447 --> 03:33:31,775
You know what the breakers crashing on you you're not going to know what I mean

4319
03:33:32,031 --> 03:33:33,311
But in my head it seems like

4320
03:33:33,823 --> 03:33:38,175
Analogy and if you've ever done it you know what I mean when you get trapped in that no man's land

4321
03:33:38,687 --> 03:33:40,479
Between the breaking surf in the shore

4322
03:33:41,247 --> 03:33:45,855
Too far away from the shore to get to safety before the next Giant Wave crushes you

4323
03:33:46,367 --> 03:33:47,903
There's only one option

4324
03:33:48,159 --> 03:33:53,535
You have to go out deeper into the surf so you can dive under that giant way before it starts crashing

4325
03:33:54,047 --> 03:33:55,839
The problem is we all know

4326
03:33:56,095 --> 03:33:57,119
Is that when you come up

4327
03:33:57,375 --> 03:33:58,399
Sputtering from that

4328
03:33:58,911 --> 03:34:03,775
You have another giant breaker bearing down on you and you're even farther away from the shore

4329
03:34:04,287 --> 03:34:06,335
So you have to go out even deeper

4330
03:34:06,591 --> 03:34:07,871
And I'm under that one

4331
03:34:08,639 --> 03:34:09,151
Of course you

4332
03:34:09,407 --> 03:34:12,223
You can't keep this up forever eventually

4333
03:34:12,479 --> 03:34:12,991
You drown

4334
03:34:13,247 --> 03:34:14,783
Following that strategy

4335
03:34:15,039 --> 03:34:17,087
And the Japanese are going to drown in China

4336
03:34:18,111 --> 03:34:19,391
And if you believe the

4337
03:34:19,647 --> 03:34:22,975
Army Defenders out there who try to explain what they were doing

4338
03:34:23,231 --> 03:34:27,327
They're going to drown in China simply trying to find a defensible place

4339
03:34:27,583 --> 03:34:28,863
To stop advancing

4340
03:34:31,167 --> 03:34:32,191
The Army claims it's got

4341
03:34:32,447 --> 03:34:33,471
Bandits to deal with

4342
03:34:33,727 --> 03:34:36,031
For example these Bandits are probably

4343
03:34:36,287 --> 03:34:40,127
Really Chinese Guerrilla Fighters and at one point they'll be like 350

4344
03:34:40,383 --> 03:34:41,407
Thousand of them

4345
03:34:41,919 --> 03:34:43,711
That's a lot of Bandits by the way

4346
03:34:46,015 --> 03:34:47,551
There will be a constant

4347
03:34:47,807 --> 03:34:49,087
Drumbeat of things that are

4348
03:34:49,343 --> 03:34:55,487
Called incidence when Japanese troops and bandits or Japanese troops and Chinese troops

4349
03:34:55,743 --> 03:34:57,279
Japanese troops and Warlords troops

4350
03:34:57,535 --> 03:34:59,327
Will have some sort of you know

4351
03:34:59,839 --> 03:35:05,983
Gunfighter something and all that can break loose for a while that the Japanese take another city in response to that and they'll settle down and then another incident

4352
03:35:08,799 --> 03:35:11,359
If you string all these incidents together from

4353
03:35:11,871 --> 03:35:14,687
1931 to about 1937

4354
03:35:15,455 --> 03:35:15,967
You get

4355
03:35:16,223 --> 03:35:16,735
I mean they were like

4356
03:35:16,991 --> 03:35:22,879
50 in a really short. How do you get a lot of incidents and some historians like to refer to that hole. Is an error

4357
03:35:23,135 --> 03:35:24,415
Undeclared war

4358
03:35:24,671 --> 03:35:25,439
Between Japan and China

4359
03:35:25,695 --> 03:35:29,535
Neither side by the way wanted to declare war for different reasons

4360
03:35:30,047 --> 03:35:34,143
The Japanese are trying to make it look like nothing's really going on here

4361
03:35:34,399 --> 03:35:37,471
Nothing to see here great Powers it's not a war we have lunch in

4362
03:35:37,727 --> 03:35:38,239
What is going on

4363
03:35:39,007 --> 03:35:41,567
And the Chinese have their own problems more on that

4364
03:35:41,823 --> 03:35:42,591
Titan II

4365
03:35:44,639 --> 03:35:45,407
These incidents

4366
03:35:45,663 --> 03:35:46,943
Can get very large

4367
03:35:48,223 --> 03:35:52,063
There will be an incident in late January in Shanghai

4368
03:35:52,319 --> 03:35:53,343
Which will go on in

4369
03:35:53,599 --> 03:35:54,111
March

4370
03:35:54,623 --> 03:35:55,135
19th

4371
03:35:55,391 --> 03:35:55,903
32

4372
03:35:56,927 --> 03:35:58,463
Shanghai by the way I believe

4373
03:35:58,719 --> 03:36:01,023
The second largest city in Asia after

4374
03:36:01,279 --> 03:36:02,303
Tokyo itself

4375
03:36:03,071 --> 03:36:05,631
Between 3 and 4 million people

4376
03:36:06,655 --> 03:36:09,727
In a giant city that is an urban environment

4377
03:36:10,495 --> 03:36:12,031
So you can only imagine what it's like

4378
03:36:12,543 --> 03:36:14,335
To have fighting going on in the street

4379
03:36:14,591 --> 03:36:15,615
Streets of Shanghai

4380
03:36:16,383 --> 03:36:18,175
You will have it one point

4381
03:36:18,431 --> 03:36:20,479
It starts off with Japanese Marines but

4382
03:36:20,735 --> 03:36:23,807
They get into trouble because there's very stiff Chinese resistance

4383
03:36:24,063 --> 03:36:24,831
Street fighting

4384
03:36:25,087 --> 03:36:30,463
So the Japanese government sending more troops at one point you'll have a hundred thousand Japanese ground troops

4385
03:36:30,975 --> 03:36:32,511
Several hundred planes

4386
03:36:32,767 --> 03:36:35,327
Like 75 or so ships

4387
03:36:35,839 --> 03:36:37,887
Incident doesn't really do it justice

4388
03:36:39,423 --> 03:36:43,775
In fact the high numbers when you start adding up civilian and Military deaths

4389
03:36:44,031 --> 03:36:45,311
For this incident

4390
03:36:45,823 --> 03:36:49,919
Run somewhere between ten and twenty thousand killed that's quite a few people

4391
03:36:50,687 --> 03:36:51,199
In something

4392
03:36:51,711 --> 03:36:52,223
It sounds

4393
03:36:52,479 --> 03:36:53,503
The smallest an incident

4394
03:36:55,039 --> 03:36:59,135
Now we've been talking a lot about the Japanese here we've been pointing out that they've been fighting in a quote

4395
03:36:59,391 --> 03:37:03,487
And quote Chinese but who are the Chinese during this. It's worth

4396
03:37:03,743 --> 03:37:04,255
Examining

4397
03:37:04,767 --> 03:37:06,047
You know the resistance here

4398
03:37:06,559 --> 03:37:07,071
For a minute

4399
03:37:07,327 --> 03:37:11,167
The resistance used to be in 10 years before this time a bunch of

4400
03:37:11,423 --> 03:37:12,191
Fragmented

4401
03:37:12,447 --> 03:37:12,959
Statesville

4402
03:37:13,471 --> 03:37:16,287
Disunited States of China perhaps you could have called it

4403
03:37:17,055 --> 03:37:18,847
Buddy in the intervening like

4404
03:37:19,103 --> 03:37:21,919
8 years there's been quite a bit of consolidation

4405
03:37:22,431 --> 03:37:24,735
The number one consolidator is a guy

4406
03:37:25,247 --> 03:37:26,271
Name change

4407
03:37:26,527 --> 03:37:27,807
It was a fascinating character

4408
03:37:28,319 --> 03:37:29,087
Japanese

4409
03:37:29,855 --> 03:37:30,879
Protege Maybe

4410
03:37:31,391 --> 03:37:32,927
It almost call it a Chinese

4411
03:37:33,695 --> 03:37:38,303
He's a guy who went to military schools and whatnot in Japan learned a lot from the

4412
03:37:38,559 --> 03:37:43,167
Japanese came back participated in the overthrow of the imperial system in the emperor

4413
03:37:43,423 --> 03:37:44,447
Was a key

4414
03:37:44,703 --> 03:37:46,751
In a protege of the guy who started the

4415
03:37:47,263 --> 03:37:48,799
The first Chinese Republic

4416
03:37:49,055 --> 03:37:51,871
Annie's been fighting ever since to maintain sort of

4417
03:37:52,383 --> 03:37:53,919
It away put together China

4418
03:37:55,199 --> 03:37:55,967
He's a different

4419
03:37:56,223 --> 03:37:59,295
Because he seems to be willing to do

4420
03:37:59,551 --> 03:38:00,575
Whatever it takes

4421
03:38:01,087 --> 03:38:04,159
Achieve his goals as goals are both to create this

4422
03:38:04,415 --> 03:38:10,047
Great China that he sees your rising from the ashes of this terrible low point in Chinese history

4423
03:38:10,303 --> 03:38:11,583
At the same time

4424
03:38:11,839 --> 03:38:17,471
A China may be run by him maybe perpetually he's got this military dictator side to him that is

4425
03:38:18,239 --> 03:38:19,007
Critics

4426
03:38:19,519 --> 03:38:20,543
Uhart Bonzo

4427
03:38:20,799 --> 03:38:21,311
Bear that in

4428
03:38:21,567 --> 03:38:22,079
Remind

4429
03:38:22,591 --> 03:38:28,735
But he's a relatively remarkable person to mean think about somebody trying to put the United States back together again

4430
03:38:28,991 --> 03:38:33,599
Broke up into its component States against the will of those states by the way

4431
03:38:33,855 --> 03:38:36,415
And you get an idea of the tasks were talking about here

4432
03:38:37,951 --> 03:38:38,975
Chiang Kai-shek is

4433
03:38:39,231 --> 03:38:40,511
Heart and is the leader

4434
03:38:40,767 --> 03:38:43,583
Most of the time of a governing / political party called

4435
03:38:43,839 --> 03:38:44,607
Daquan Antonio

4436
03:38:45,631 --> 03:38:46,911
We used to call it the kuomintang

4437
03:38:47,167 --> 03:38:47,679
When I was a kid

4438
03:38:47,935 --> 03:38:48,959
I slip into

4439
03:38:49,215 --> 03:38:51,007
Your bad habits don't know why

4440
03:38:51,775 --> 03:38:52,287
But

4441
03:38:52,543 --> 03:38:53,823
That leader and that

4442
03:38:54,079 --> 03:38:59,711
RDR sort of the big dog in this Chinese reunification thing going on during the 1920s

4443
03:39:00,479 --> 03:39:03,039
He's the major threat that these Japanese people

4444
03:39:03,295 --> 03:39:06,367
Manchuria seeming this Chiang Kai-shek Geico

4445
03:39:06,623 --> 03:39:08,927
Put china back together again and then where are we

4446
03:39:09,695 --> 03:39:11,487
His main competition

4447
03:39:11,999 --> 03:39:13,791
In order to achieve this though

4448
03:39:14,303 --> 03:39:14,815
Are communist

4449
03:39:16,351 --> 03:39:22,495
People getting help for example from the new Soviet Union Chain by the way getting help in the Soviet Union to but he

4450
03:39:22,751 --> 03:39:25,567
You'll take help from anybody who will give it to him

4451
03:39:25,823 --> 03:39:29,663
All he wants to do is Achieve his goals the Communists are working with the Tommy

4452
03:39:30,431 --> 03:39:33,247
But there may be the second great power in China during this

4453
03:39:33,503 --> 03:39:34,015
Era

4454
03:39:34,527 --> 03:39:35,039
And

4455
03:39:35,295 --> 03:39:37,087
They and Chang will have this

4456
03:39:37,599 --> 03:39:39,647
Terrible struggle with each other sometimes.

4457
03:39:40,159 --> 03:39:42,975
Kiss and make up long enough to fight the common enemy

4458
03:39:43,487 --> 03:39:44,767
But Chiang Kai-shek

4459
03:39:45,279 --> 03:39:51,423
Point most of the time is that he wants to unify China first destroy his internal enemies

4460
03:39:52,703 --> 03:39:54,239
And then turn on the Japanese

4461
03:39:55,007 --> 03:40:01,151
So when during this. The Chinese pewter really like not be fighting back too much and deliberately so

4462
03:40:01,407 --> 03:40:02,431
Taking the

4463
03:40:02,687 --> 03:40:08,831
The easy Road backing up making the Heisman it's all because Chiang kai-shek's got his eyes elsewhere he's try

4464
03:40:09,087 --> 03:40:11,135
Trying to defeat the Communists in his country

4465
03:40:12,415 --> 03:40:13,183
And by the way

4466
03:40:13,439 --> 03:40:15,487
As I said when this guy is taken

4467
03:40:15,743 --> 03:40:21,887
In a money and arms and organization from the Soviet Union the Western press is portraying him as a communist stood he's the

4468
03:40:22,143 --> 03:40:22,911
Red General

4469
03:40:23,167 --> 03:40:23,679
Go to them

4470
03:40:24,447 --> 03:40:29,567
But later on he's going to turn on the Communists and he maybe this is arguable it's off the top of my head

4471
03:40:30,079 --> 03:40:31,871
He may hold the record

4472
03:40:32,639 --> 03:40:33,151
Foremost

4473
03:40:33,663 --> 03:40:34,431
Communist

4474
03:40:34,687 --> 03:40:36,479
Or suspected Communists killed

4475
03:40:36,991 --> 03:40:39,551
You kill like three hundred thousand of them in one

4476
03:40:40,319 --> 03:40:42,111
He may have killed Millions

4477
03:40:43,135 --> 03:40:47,999
And many of the may not have been communist at all he's famous for phrase he may or may not have said

4478
03:40:48,255 --> 03:40:48,767
Just let me

4479
03:40:49,023 --> 03:40:50,303
If you got disclaimer right here

4480
03:40:50,559 --> 03:40:53,631
But the phrase was something like you're a rather kill a thousand

4481
03:40:53,887 --> 03:40:56,959
Innocent people than let one communist get through

4482
03:40:57,471 --> 03:40:59,007
It's a little twist of the old American

4483
03:40:59,263 --> 03:40:59,775
Idea

4484
03:41:00,031 --> 03:41:00,799
Is it better

4485
03:41:01,311 --> 03:41:04,639
100 guilty should go free than one innocent man be prosecuted

4486
03:41:06,687 --> 03:41:07,455
In any case

4487
03:41:07,967 --> 03:41:08,735
Chiang Kai-shek

4488
03:41:08,991 --> 03:41:11,295
Seems to be pretty focused on China

4489
03:41:11,807 --> 03:41:17,183
And conquering it first and then turning its enormous weight on the Japanese invader

4490
03:41:17,439 --> 03:41:19,231
Afterwards is his policy

4491
03:41:19,999 --> 03:41:24,863
And not allow this undeclared war to continue longer than maybe a lot of the other leaders in China

4492
03:41:25,119 --> 03:41:27,167
Chang's underlings want it

4493
03:41:29,727 --> 03:41:32,799
Meanwhile though Chiang Kai-shek in the Chinese

4494
03:41:34,335 --> 03:41:34,847
Complain

4495
03:41:35,615 --> 03:41:38,943
To the only body out there that's available to do that

4496
03:41:39,711 --> 03:41:40,479
The League of Nations

4497
03:41:40,735 --> 03:41:43,551
Steve prototype as we said earlier for the United Nations

4498
03:41:44,063 --> 03:41:46,111
This will become a product

4499
03:41:46,367 --> 03:41:46,879
Pickle test

4500
03:41:47,135 --> 03:41:49,695
Are the rainbows and unicorns organization that is

4501
03:41:49,951 --> 03:41:50,975
Supposed to prevent

4502
03:41:51,487 --> 03:41:52,767
Aggressive War

4503
03:41:53,023 --> 03:41:55,839
Because the Chinese are asserting that that's what you have here

4504
03:41:56,351 --> 03:41:57,375
And not only that

4505
03:41:57,887 --> 03:42:03,775
The Japanese are the signatories to a number of treaties during these so-called interwar years

4506
03:42:04,287 --> 03:42:05,823
Design to make war

4507
03:42:06,335 --> 03:42:12,223
If not uncommon and maybe even totally illegal one of these is called The kellogg-briand Pact

4508
03:42:12,479 --> 03:42:13,247
For example

4509
03:42:13,503 --> 03:42:16,319
And sometimes that's the way it's supporters sort of touted

4510
03:42:16,831 --> 03:42:18,111
We're going to make war illegal

4511
03:42:18,623 --> 03:42:20,159
Because people signed the treaty

4512
03:42:20,927 --> 03:42:22,207
So you can see how that goes

4513
03:42:22,463 --> 03:42:24,511
None the less the Chinese make the complaint

4514
03:42:25,023 --> 03:42:30,655
The League of Nations has to respond to it they send investigators in 1932 early to look at

4515
03:42:30,911 --> 03:42:33,983
Train tracks that were blown up and examine everything talk to all sides

4516
03:42:34,495 --> 03:42:36,799
While they're doing this the Japanese military's

4517
03:42:37,055 --> 03:42:38,335
Creating a puppet state

4518
03:42:38,591 --> 03:42:40,127
They're going to call Manju quote

4519
03:42:40,639 --> 03:42:41,919
And the reason you create a puppet

4520
03:42:43,199 --> 03:42:49,343
You're trying to conquer indirectly like you would in the old days it because you just don't do that anymore it's just not done great powers

4521
03:42:50,111 --> 03:42:50,623
Caruthers

4522
03:42:50,879 --> 03:42:52,415
You create a sort of a

4523
03:42:53,183 --> 03:42:53,951
Wilsonian

4524
03:42:54,207 --> 03:42:54,719
Sorta

4525
03:42:54,975 --> 03:42:55,487
Colony

4526
03:42:55,743 --> 03:42:57,535
Where you call it the return

4527
03:42:57,791 --> 03:43:01,119
Of the Manchu people to control your own destiny

4528
03:43:01,375 --> 03:43:07,263
The Japanese brought in the last emperor of China a Manchu put them on the throne made it look like hey we've restored the

4529
03:43:07,519 --> 03:43:09,567
Manchurians to their rightful place

4530
03:43:09,823 --> 03:43:13,919
We Asians are all in this together is going to have this pan-Asian flavor to it

4531
03:43:15,455 --> 03:43:17,759
The Japanese Army's going to defend it it's going to send

4532
03:43:18,271 --> 03:43:22,111
And economically anything Japan wants back to Japan and the Japanese

4533
03:43:22,367 --> 03:43:22,879
Ctrl Alt

4534
03:43:23,135 --> 03:43:24,671
Major decisions it's a puppet state

4535
03:43:25,951 --> 03:43:28,511
But the rest of the world is going to say

4536
03:43:29,279 --> 03:43:29,791
You can't keep

4537
03:43:31,583 --> 03:43:32,095
The United

4538
03:43:32,351 --> 03:43:33,631
States will be the most

4539
03:43:33,887 --> 03:43:34,655
Vociferous

4540
03:43:34,911 --> 03:43:39,775
By the way the u.s. it has is operating on many levels Room 1 level there's a moral level two

4541
03:43:40,031 --> 03:43:45,407
The Americans have a lot of Christian missionaries for example in China and they get to watch a lot of this stuff unfold

4542
03:43:45,919 --> 03:43:49,759
And it's horrible on the ground so they're complaining for moral reasons

4543
03:43:50,015 --> 03:43:55,391
The Americans have huge economic stakes in this region something called the open door policy that they want to keep open

4544
03:43:55,647 --> 03:43:57,695
I don't want anything that would threaten

4545
03:43:58,207 --> 03:44:04,351
The good thing that they have going trade-wise with China and if Japan starts taking all these areas are making

4546
03:44:04,607 --> 03:44:10,751
Treaties that interlock China up for themselves with that cuts out us interest so there's a lot of reasons Americans are

4547
03:44:11,007 --> 03:44:11,519
I'm so happy about

4548
03:44:12,543 --> 03:44:14,079
Invoke something called

4549
03:44:14,335 --> 03:44:19,455
From this. Call the Stimson Doctrine which basically says the u.s. is not going to acknowledge

4550
03:44:19,711 --> 03:44:23,039
Support countenance or anything any territories that are in a

4551
03:44:23,295 --> 03:44:24,575
Created through aggression

4552
03:44:25,599 --> 03:44:26,623
Whether or not it's aggression

4553
03:44:27,135 --> 03:44:28,415
Up to the League of Nations

4554
03:44:28,671 --> 03:44:32,767
They do their investigation they come back with a report that is actually

4555
03:44:33,279 --> 03:44:34,815
So even-handed

4556
03:44:35,071 --> 03:44:41,215
You have a feeling that the great Powers didn't want anything where they had to confront anybody cuz I said earlier they all have their

4557
03:44:41,471 --> 03:44:43,007
Merona shoes they rather look the other way

4558
03:44:43,775 --> 03:44:45,567
But the Japanese required light

4559
03:44:46,079 --> 03:44:47,103
You know a real accept

4560
03:44:47,359 --> 03:44:49,919
They'll be allowed to keep Manchuria they did not get that

4561
03:44:50,431 --> 03:44:51,967
So when forced to make a choice

4562
03:44:52,223 --> 03:44:52,735
Between

4563
03:44:52,991 --> 03:44:56,063
The steroid that could make the maybe as big as they want

4564
03:44:56,575 --> 03:44:57,087
Or

4565
03:44:57,343 --> 03:45:02,463
You staying in the good guy calling me to offbeat Global International naughty list

4566
03:45:03,487 --> 03:45:04,767
They chose keeping

4567
03:45:05,023 --> 03:45:06,047
The Manchurian

4568
03:45:06,303 --> 03:45:07,071
Addiction

4569
03:45:08,351 --> 03:45:09,887
And this will be disastrous in the lawn

4570
03:45:12,191 --> 03:45:18,335
In a practical sense what it means is when the Japanese don't get what they want from the League of Nations they walk out of the League of Nations

4571
03:45:20,127 --> 03:45:25,247
Trendsetters in that regard because Germany and Italy will eventually join them

4572
03:45:25,759 --> 03:45:29,599
But do people like the Americans and the British in the French this looks like

4573
03:45:29,855 --> 03:45:33,183
Choosing the dark side in an Ever increasingly dark

4574
03:45:33,439 --> 03:45:37,023
In the world is the storm clouds on the horizon International Horizon

4575
03:45:37,279 --> 03:45:38,815
Deepen and darken

4576
03:45:39,071 --> 03:45:39,839
And threatened

4577
03:45:40,351 --> 03:45:46,495
The Japanese decided you know in terms of this International Community idea is rainbows and unicorns thing of the past it's just

4578
03:45:46,751 --> 03:45:49,823
The plot by the great powers to keep the status quo or out

4579
03:45:51,615 --> 03:45:52,383
But when you think of

4580
03:45:52,895 --> 03:45:55,967
In what options they actually had in this regard

4581
03:45:56,735 --> 03:45:59,039
And what kind of Japanese really do

4582
03:46:01,343 --> 03:46:03,135
Walk a mile in the moccasins

4583
03:46:03,391 --> 03:46:04,415
The Japanese government

4584
03:46:04,671 --> 03:46:08,511
And here we have to ask what real choices they had in the same way

4585
03:46:08,767 --> 03:46:09,535
You know we were

4586
03:46:09,791 --> 03:46:12,351
Wondering about the responsibility level of your

4587
03:46:12,607 --> 03:46:15,679
Average Japanese patriotic Japanese citizen well

4588
03:46:15,935 --> 03:46:16,703
In this case

4589
03:46:17,215 --> 03:46:19,007
And sometimes I think we pretend like

4590
03:46:19,263 --> 03:46:22,079
There's a fork in the road here for these governments

4591
03:46:22,591 --> 03:46:26,687
And we hold them accountable for making the wrong directional choice

4592
03:46:26,943 --> 03:46:30,271
You know at the fork in the road when maybe there was no Fork there at all

4593
03:46:31,039 --> 03:46:33,087
And this is a wondering but I mean in this case

4594
03:46:33,599 --> 03:46:34,367
Look at what

4595
03:46:34,623 --> 03:46:35,391
Was being a

4596
03:46:35,903 --> 03:46:36,927
Cast of this Japanese guy

4597
03:46:37,695 --> 03:46:40,511
You're being asked to give up this territory that many great

4598
03:46:40,767 --> 03:46:41,535
Great thinkers have been out

4599
03:46:42,559 --> 03:46:43,583
Chinese writing and whatnot

4600
03:46:44,095 --> 03:46:44,863
And many of the Promenade

4601
03:46:45,375 --> 03:46:46,911
San Japan has to have

4602
03:46:47,167 --> 03:46:48,447
In order to survive and

4603
03:46:48,703 --> 03:46:51,519
Protect themselves in part from these very great powers

4604
03:46:52,031 --> 03:46:53,311
Who banded together in this

4605
03:46:53,567 --> 03:46:55,871
League of Nations are telling them they have to give it back in

4606
03:46:56,127 --> 03:46:58,687
You can't have these steroids to get as big as we are

4607
03:46:59,711 --> 03:47:00,479
Japanese is

4608
03:47:01,247 --> 03:47:03,039
I had this long laundry list

4609
03:47:03,295 --> 03:47:04,063
Rain Man like

4610
03:47:04,831 --> 03:47:07,135
Grievances some of which are real

4611
03:47:09,439 --> 03:47:10,207
You also have that

4612
03:47:10,463 --> 03:47:12,767
Wonderful Alimentum play that we talked about the

4613
03:47:13,023 --> 03:47:14,047
Number of people now that

4614
03:47:14,303 --> 03:47:15,071
Died

4615
03:47:15,583 --> 03:47:16,095
2

4616
03:47:16,351 --> 03:47:17,375
Conquer this place

4617
03:47:17,631 --> 03:47:20,703
People that have died to protect the investment in money

4618
03:47:20,959 --> 03:47:23,519
It's in a been invested to create this wonderful

4619
03:47:23,775 --> 03:47:28,383
Bavarian China by the south entry and Railway me just goes on and on so if you're a political leader

4620
03:47:29,407 --> 03:47:30,431
It's going to

4621
03:47:30,943 --> 03:47:37,087
See this as a way to avoid having a showdown with the other great powers in the world and your choices you have to give

4622
03:47:37,343 --> 03:47:38,111
Give this back

4623
03:47:39,391 --> 03:47:39,903
Could you relist

4624
03:47:40,415 --> 03:47:40,927
We do that

4625
03:47:43,231 --> 03:47:44,255
I mean I would think that

4626
03:47:44,511 --> 03:47:45,023
The Moth

4627
03:47:45,791 --> 03:47:46,303
Ace

4628
03:47:46,559 --> 03:47:48,607
On the world stage in of the embarrassment of having

4629
03:47:49,631 --> 03:47:52,447
You listen to what everyone saying go with your tail between your legs

4630
03:47:52,703 --> 03:47:54,751
I mean I think that alone would Doom

4631
03:47:55,007 --> 03:47:56,031
A politician

4632
03:47:56,543 --> 03:47:58,847
In a with the voters in an electoral system

4633
03:47:59,103 --> 03:47:59,615
When you

4634
03:48:00,639 --> 03:48:01,407
But what about

4635
03:48:01,919 --> 03:48:02,943
You know a real dude

4636
03:48:03,455 --> 03:48:04,223
Supposed to

4637
03:48:04,479 --> 03:48:05,247
Electoral.

4638
03:48:06,271 --> 03:48:07,807
Because this is the. Where

4639
03:48:08,319 --> 03:48:09,855
If you realistically sing

4640
03:48:10,111 --> 03:48:11,647
Suggested giving Manchuria back

4641
03:48:12,159 --> 03:48:13,695
The great Powers were telling you to

4642
03:48:13,951 --> 03:48:16,511
You might not live to see the next month

4643
03:48:17,535 --> 03:48:20,351
Because we talked earlier about something one American I think

4644
03:48:21,375 --> 03:48:25,983
Government by assassination in Japanese history this is the. Where that Skyrocket

4645
03:48:26,239 --> 03:48:27,519
The high-water mark

4646
03:48:28,031 --> 03:48:29,311
Between 1931 and 90

4647
03:48:29,823 --> 03:48:30,335
36

4648
03:48:30,847 --> 03:48:34,431
And you will see a number of major figures not just political figures

4649
03:48:34,687 --> 03:48:36,479
Also corporate ones gun down

4650
03:48:38,015 --> 03:48:40,575
How about the one in 1932

4651
03:48:41,087 --> 03:48:43,135
We're 11 Naval Cadets

4652
03:48:43,903 --> 03:48:45,439
From a faction in the Navy

4653
03:48:45,951 --> 03:48:50,559
It wants a military dictatorship in a return to the emperor in the Golden Age and all that

4654
03:48:51,583 --> 03:48:55,423
Storm into the building where the prime minister is in the 11 of them killing

4655
03:48:56,447 --> 03:48:59,263
And is even a conversation that's recorded that happens

4656
03:48:59,775 --> 03:49:05,151
In a while it's going on where the Prime Minister says something to the effect even if I can only talk to you you would understand

4657
03:49:05,407 --> 03:49:08,223
And the person is about to kill him says dialogue is useless

4658
03:49:08,479 --> 03:49:08,991
Spoon

4659
03:49:10,783 --> 03:49:11,807
The people who kill

4660
03:49:12,063 --> 03:49:13,343
The Prime Minister release a man

4661
03:49:13,599 --> 03:49:14,367
Manifesto

4662
03:49:14,623 --> 03:49:16,159
One that historian James album

4663
03:49:16,415 --> 03:49:16,927
McLane Reaper

4664
03:49:18,463 --> 03:49:21,279
Shows the depth of emotional anger

4665
03:49:21,791 --> 03:49:26,655
Experienced by these people who want to put the emperor back on the throne to fix all the Injustice has

4666
03:49:27,679 --> 03:49:28,191
The

4667
03:49:28,703 --> 03:49:29,727
Manifesto says

4668
03:49:29,983 --> 03:49:30,495
Quote

4669
03:49:31,263 --> 03:49:37,407
Look straight at the present state of your Fatherland Japan where we dare ask can you find the

4670
03:49:37,663 --> 03:49:41,759
Genuine manifestation of the godliness of the Imperial country of Japan

4671
03:49:42,271 --> 03:49:46,367
Political parties are blind in their pursuit of power and egoistic game

4672
03:49:46,879 --> 03:49:50,207
Large Enterprises are firmly in collusion with politicians

4673
03:49:50,463 --> 03:49:53,023
They suck the sweat and blood of the Common People

4674
03:49:53,535 --> 03:49:56,351
Bureaucrats and police are busy defending the corrupt

4675
03:49:56,607 --> 03:49:58,143
Politico industrial complex

4676
03:49:58,655 --> 03:50:00,447
Diplomacy is weakness

4677
03:50:00,703 --> 03:50:02,751
Education is rotten to the Core

4678
03:50:03,007 --> 03:50:06,335
Now is the time to carry out drastic revolutionary change

4679
03:50:06,591 --> 03:50:08,383
Rise and take action now

4680
03:50:09,663 --> 03:50:10,175
And quote

4681
03:50:12,991 --> 03:50:14,015
Playing in his book

4682
03:50:14,527 --> 03:50:15,551
Japan a modern history

4683
03:50:15,807 --> 03:50:16,831
These kinds of

4684
03:50:17,343 --> 03:50:18,111
Coos

4685
03:50:18,623 --> 03:50:19,135
Along with

4686
03:50:19,391 --> 03:50:19,903
The stuff

4687
03:50:20,159 --> 03:50:22,207
The challenges posed by Manchuria

4688
03:50:22,975 --> 03:50:23,487
That

4689
03:50:23,743 --> 03:50:25,279
Dooms everything he writes quote

4690
03:50:25,791 --> 03:50:30,655
The Manchurian Incident and the violence from the right in 1931 and 1932

4691
03:50:30,911 --> 03:50:35,263
Mark the copernican turn in Japan's foreign relations and domestic policy

4692
03:50:36,031 --> 03:50:38,847
On the continent the conception of the new state

4693
03:50:39,103 --> 03:50:44,223
Card from Chinese territory and dominated by a wing of the Japanese military

4694
03:50:44,479 --> 03:50:47,807
Soured sino-japanese relations Beyond Redemption

4695
03:50:48,319 --> 03:50:50,623
Began the isolation of Japan from

4696
03:50:50,879 --> 03:50:51,903
Furiated West

4697
03:50:52,159 --> 03:50:55,231
Which view Japanese actions is naked aggression

4698
03:50:55,743 --> 03:50:58,303
And propelled the island nation along a path

4699
03:50:58,559 --> 03:51:01,887
It would lead it to even more dangerous for an confrontation

4700
03:51:02,399 --> 03:51:03,167
At home

4701
03:51:03,423 --> 03:51:05,727
The assassinations and attempted to choose

4702
03:51:05,983 --> 03:51:08,799
Expose The Fragile structure of Japanese Paula

4703
03:51:09,567 --> 03:51:13,407
Contributed to a snowball in loss of confidence in party politicians

4704
03:51:13,663 --> 03:51:15,711
And encouraged the idea log

4705
03:51:15,967 --> 03:51:18,783
Who romanticize the country's Imperial past

4706
03:51:19,039 --> 03:51:21,087
And sought to forge a new National Paula

4707
03:51:22,111 --> 03:51:22,623
And quote

4708
03:51:24,159 --> 03:51:26,463
The 1932 killing of the Prime Minister

4709
03:51:26,975 --> 03:51:29,535
Is a perfect example how so many of these

4710
03:51:29,791 --> 03:51:31,327
A coup attempts and assassinations

4711
03:51:31,583 --> 03:51:32,351
What happened between like

4712
03:51:32,863 --> 03:51:33,375
31 + 9

4713
03:51:34,911 --> 03:51:39,775
Cuz they'll put these young Naval guys the Assassins on trial and they're all like 20 years old

4714
03:51:40,031 --> 03:51:40,543
Their kids

4715
03:51:41,055 --> 03:51:41,823
And they'll

4716
03:51:42,335 --> 03:51:45,407
Wrap themselves in the ultra patriotism stuff

4717
03:51:46,175 --> 03:51:47,199
And the public

4718
03:51:47,711 --> 03:51:51,039
Will be very sympathetic I think they get a petition the court does

4719
03:51:51,295 --> 03:51:56,415
Signed in the blood of hundreds of thousands of Japanese citizens pleading for leniency

4720
03:51:56,671 --> 03:51:58,975
People offer to die in the place of the

4721
03:51:59,231 --> 03:52:01,023
Young naval officers I mean it's

4722
03:52:01,791 --> 03:52:07,935
It's a level of fanaticism on the part of one segment of Japanese society that makes it difficult to just Crush these people

4723
03:52:08,191 --> 03:52:09,471
Anti-government terrorist

4724
03:52:10,751 --> 03:52:12,031
And by the way

4725
03:52:12,287 --> 03:52:14,079
For killing the prime minister

4726
03:52:14,591 --> 03:52:16,383
These guys get a pretty lenient sentence

4727
03:52:16,895 --> 03:52:18,943
Jail time be out maybe in not too long

4728
03:52:19,455 --> 03:52:20,223
What the hell is that

4729
03:52:22,015 --> 03:52:22,527
Several of these

4730
03:52:23,039 --> 03:52:23,551
Events

4731
03:52:24,063 --> 03:52:27,903
In the 1930s culminating in the very famous won the February 26th

4732
03:52:28,159 --> 03:52:29,439
Incident that happened on February

4733
03:52:30,207 --> 03:52:30,719
Next Imagine That

4734
03:52:31,231 --> 03:52:32,255
1930

4735
03:52:32,511 --> 03:52:33,023
6

4736
03:52:34,559 --> 03:52:37,119
In this when you get some of these Imperial Way

4737
03:52:37,631 --> 03:52:38,655
Faction

4738
03:52:38,911 --> 03:52:43,007
Junior officers who lead like 1500 soldiers

4739
03:52:43,263 --> 03:52:49,407
Against the other War Ministry and some other major buildings they take them over they kill a bunch of officials to former Prime

4740
03:52:49,663 --> 03:52:50,175
Ministers

4741
03:52:50,431 --> 03:52:55,295
A very dramatic actually and once again there's sometimes talking between the assassins in the end the Wonder movie

4742
03:52:55,551 --> 03:52:56,831
We killed it very dramatic

4743
03:52:57,599 --> 03:52:58,111
But

4744
03:52:58,367 --> 03:53:03,487
If you believe the emperor's post-war comments he basically says he turns into the Hulk again at this moment

4745
03:53:03,743 --> 03:53:06,815
Ordered the the Imperial Guard across the whole thing

4746
03:53:07,071 --> 03:53:09,375
Awesome people commit suicide the rebels give up

4747
03:53:09,631 --> 03:53:12,191
And this time there's a Crackdown after

4748
03:53:13,215 --> 03:53:16,287
This is the bridge too far for the ultra-nationalist right

4749
03:53:16,543 --> 03:53:18,335
In Japan the Koto half action

4750
03:53:18,847 --> 03:53:20,383
And they get crushed

4751
03:53:20,895 --> 03:53:24,223
Several people I think my 18 to 20 people will go to the

4752
03:53:24,479 --> 03:53:25,503
Firing squad

4753
03:53:26,271 --> 03:53:27,295
Be hooked up to the old

4754
03:53:27,551 --> 03:53:28,319
Steak and shot

4755
03:53:29,343 --> 03:53:32,671
A bunch of generals will be purged from the Army I think it's more than 1/2

4756
03:53:32,927 --> 03:53:33,695
Which shows you

4757
03:53:34,207 --> 03:53:36,511
Deeply embedded this Imperial Way facts

4758
03:53:36,767 --> 03:53:37,279
Why is

4759
03:53:37,791 --> 03:53:39,583
Other influential officers that are not

4760
03:53:40,095 --> 03:53:42,399
Set of ostracize will be pushed off to

4761
03:53:42,655 --> 03:53:47,007
Coming in for they can't cause the kind of trouble that somebody also for example

4762
03:53:47,263 --> 03:53:49,823
In charge of the guantan army can cause

4763
03:53:50,335 --> 03:53:54,431
And the military will once again soon strengthen its hold over the government

4764
03:53:54,943 --> 03:53:58,527
You know they'll say to protected from these kinds of things happening

4765
03:54:00,063 --> 03:54:02,367
This of course is a period of growing global

4766
03:54:02,623 --> 03:54:05,951
Anxieties we all know right the middle 1930s tough time

4767
03:54:06,975 --> 03:54:07,999
In the late twenties

4768
03:54:08,255 --> 03:54:09,279
TV fashion

4769
03:54:09,535 --> 03:54:10,303
Come to power

4770
03:54:10,559 --> 03:54:11,327
Italy

4771
03:54:11,583 --> 03:54:17,215
The 1930 to 1933 time. Have the Nazis coming to power in Germany

4772
03:54:18,495 --> 03:54:24,639
Both of those ideologies of course make it over to Japan in the Pandora's Box intellectual contagion update

4773
03:54:24,895 --> 03:54:25,919
Tina version 3.0

4774
03:54:26,687 --> 03:54:28,223
517 with a patch

4775
03:54:29,503 --> 03:54:33,343
But while most people don't think of the Japanese during this period as Nazis

4776
03:54:33,855 --> 03:54:37,695
Fascism is sometimes debated and people laugh well if we know where the Japanese of this

4777
03:54:38,207 --> 03:54:38,719
Fascist

4778
03:54:39,487 --> 03:54:42,559
You didn't ask for it but my own opinion is to me it looks more like

4779
03:54:43,327 --> 03:54:46,655
Yeah this era provide some frosting on the top of it

4780
03:54:46,911 --> 03:54:47,423
Very

4781
03:54:47,679 --> 03:54:50,751
Call multi-layer Japanese cultural cake

4782
03:54:51,519 --> 03:54:55,359
Each piece of which we've been lovingly talking about in the story

4783
03:54:55,871 --> 03:54:56,383
So

4784
03:54:56,639 --> 03:54:57,151
Not

4785
03:54:57,407 --> 03:55:03,551
Not see you stick or fishes take the both of those ideologies making impact and they seep into some of this

4786
03:55:03,807 --> 03:55:05,087
During this period the influence

4787
03:55:07,647 --> 03:55:09,183
Of course as I was saying my own no next

4788
03:55:09,439 --> 03:55:12,255
Opinion the experts on this from multiple countries

4789
03:55:12,511 --> 03:55:13,279
Have different views

4790
03:55:13,535 --> 03:55:14,047
By the way on

4791
03:55:14,303 --> 03:55:14,815
Will be

4792
03:55:15,583 --> 03:55:16,351
Copper closet

4793
03:55:16,863 --> 03:55:17,631
Location of the Java

4794
03:55:18,655 --> 03:55:19,679
Second world war government

4795
03:55:20,703 --> 03:55:21,727
Where the second world war government

4796
03:55:22,495 --> 03:55:25,823
Now if you wanted to just sort of look at the Optics though and try to make it

4797
03:55:26,335 --> 03:55:30,431
Judgment based on that while the Japanese are not doing themselves any favors because they may not

4798
03:55:30,687 --> 03:55:32,991
Officially be fascist at least in my mind

4799
03:55:33,247 --> 03:55:34,271
But they sure do

4800
03:55:34,527 --> 03:55:35,295
Play nicely with

4801
03:55:35,551 --> 03:55:40,159
In November 1936 the Japanese and Nazi Germany will sign

4802
03:55:40,415 --> 03:55:42,207
Something called The anti-comintern Pact

4803
03:55:42,719 --> 03:55:45,023
Which is supposed to be sort of directed at global

4804
03:55:45,535 --> 03:55:49,887
Communist efforts to undermine the world the Italians will eventually sign at the

4805
03:55:50,143 --> 03:55:55,007
Spanish will eventually find it so these are basically the fascist states of Europe if you're not a fascist you're sure

4806
03:55:55,775 --> 03:55:57,311
Signing the same treaties and

4807
03:55:57,823 --> 03:56:02,431
The Japanese were already were not getting wonderful press in places like the United States

4808
03:56:02,687 --> 03:56:03,199
See

4809
03:56:03,455 --> 03:56:04,223
It just get worse

4810
03:56:06,527 --> 03:56:08,319
Now we should point out a new GOP

4811
03:56:08,575 --> 03:56:14,719
Political reality that's very important now in the scene here that now that the Japanese have this puppet state of Manchu cool

4812
03:56:14,975 --> 03:56:16,767
Wall where Manchuria used to be

4813
03:56:17,279 --> 03:56:20,607
It means they now have the same neighbors Manchuria used to have

4814
03:56:21,119 --> 03:56:23,935
Which means Japan now has a giant or excuse me

4815
03:56:24,191 --> 03:56:24,959
Play the puppet state of Maine

4816
03:56:25,215 --> 03:56:30,847
Now has a giant border with the Soviet Union and another giant border with Mongolia

4817
03:56:31,103 --> 03:56:32,895
Which is a puppet of the Soviet Union

4818
03:56:33,919 --> 03:56:38,783
So now the idea maybe getting involved in any sort of meaningful

4819
03:56:39,039 --> 03:56:40,831
Combat with China that would take

4820
03:56:41,087 --> 03:56:43,135
Any significant amount of effort

4821
03:56:43,647 --> 03:56:44,415
Looks like it might

4822
03:56:44,671 --> 03:56:47,487
Take troops away from this giant border that looks

4823
03:56:47,743 --> 03:56:50,047
Horribly open to

4824
03:56:50,303 --> 03:56:52,095
And maybe a giant tank attack

4825
03:56:52,607 --> 03:56:54,911
Maybe infiltration by communist hordes

4826
03:56:55,935 --> 03:56:59,263
In 1937 the Japanese do not want

4827
03:56:59,775 --> 03:57:01,823
A general war with China

4828
03:57:02,079 --> 03:57:03,359
The problem that they're going to

4829
03:57:03,615 --> 03:57:08,479
Have his this is exactly the time. Where the Chinese are thinking maybe that is what they want

4830
03:57:10,015 --> 03:57:16,159
And of course for the longest time in the store you haven't even been able to say what China wanted because they were multiple choice

4831
03:57:18,719 --> 03:57:19,487
Warlord

4832
03:57:20,255 --> 03:57:22,559
Multiple different states and I mean

4833
03:57:22,815 --> 03:57:23,839
Could hardly keep track of it

4834
03:57:24,095 --> 03:57:24,607
For so long

4835
03:57:26,143 --> 03:57:28,447
But in light 1936 something happens that

4836
03:57:28,703 --> 03:57:29,471
Oil change

4837
03:57:30,239 --> 03:57:31,007
The entire Earth

4838
03:57:31,263 --> 03:57:33,567
Airfare and will do so sort of against the will

4839
03:57:33,823 --> 03:57:35,615
Chiang Kai-shek he's going to be kidnapped

4840
03:57:36,383 --> 03:57:37,407
Buy some of his suborn

4841
03:57:38,175 --> 03:57:40,479
I'm going to whisk him away to a location where

4842
03:57:40,735 --> 03:57:41,247
For two weeks

4843
03:57:42,015 --> 03:57:43,551
They try to convince him

4844
03:57:43,807 --> 03:57:44,319
But he has to

4845
03:57:44,575 --> 03:57:48,415
Stop waging his civil war against the Communists and turn against the Japanese

4846
03:57:50,463 --> 03:57:51,999
This meeting has the

4847
03:57:52,255 --> 03:57:52,767
Feeling

4848
03:57:53,279 --> 03:57:58,399
I would like a mafia so to get together where it's going to put a gun on the table and say either you change your part

4849
03:57:58,655 --> 03:58:00,191
I was here you're not leaving this meeting

4850
03:58:00,959 --> 03:58:05,311
It gets even scarier for Chiang Kai-shek when the Communists show up they've been invited

4851
03:58:06,079 --> 03:58:07,359
Instead of some sort of

4852
03:58:07,615 --> 03:58:09,151
Explosion amongst Arch enemies

4853
03:58:09,663 --> 03:58:11,199
Baby Chang had no choice of course

4854
03:58:11,711 --> 03:58:12,735
Do you actually get this

4855
03:58:12,991 --> 03:58:14,783
Patriotic moment

4856
03:58:15,039 --> 03:58:16,319
Chinese history worthies

4857
03:58:16,831 --> 03:58:18,623
Bitter enemies decide to work

4858
03:58:18,879 --> 03:58:19,903
For the common cause

4859
03:58:21,695 --> 03:58:24,767
They're going to fight the Japanese and stop fighting each other now

4860
03:58:25,279 --> 03:58:25,791
Let's just

4861
03:58:26,047 --> 03:58:27,583
Play the syndical card for a minute

4862
03:58:28,095 --> 03:58:31,935
Chang will eventually execute one of these guys that lured into this

4863
03:58:32,191 --> 03:58:35,007
Detainment in 1949 something like that

4864
03:58:35,519 --> 03:58:36,543
And there are

4865
03:58:36,799 --> 03:58:37,823
More than a couple of books

4866
03:58:38,079 --> 03:58:42,687
It will suggest that the goal of the Communist here rather than some high-minded

4867
03:58:42,943 --> 03:58:44,735
International Unity thing involved

4868
03:58:44,991 --> 03:58:51,135
Another positives for them getting the Nationalist Chinese enemies of theirs and the Japanese enemies of the Earth

4869
03:58:51,391 --> 03:58:52,159
Define each other

4870
03:58:52,415 --> 03:58:54,719
Kill as many of each other as they can and then

4871
03:58:54,975 --> 03:59:00,607
Eventually maybe easier to take over down the road so you can always go there if you want to

4872
03:59:00,863 --> 03:59:03,935
But on the surface this looks like a pretty patriotic heroic

4873
03:59:04,447 --> 03:59:10,079
In a moment in Chinese history and you can certainly see it in the writings of the common soldiers saying things like

4874
03:59:10,335 --> 03:59:12,639
For the first time in my life I get to fight

4875
03:59:12,895 --> 03:59:15,199
Italy to United effort against an outsider

4876
03:59:15,711 --> 03:59:17,503
The Japanese are unaware Bass

4877
03:59:17,759 --> 03:59:18,527
Sick leave any of this

4878
03:59:19,039 --> 03:59:25,183
Show in July 1937 when another one of the incidents breaks out in Beijing which is of course the modern

4879
03:59:25,439 --> 03:59:26,463
Hyundai capital of China

4880
03:59:26,719 --> 03:59:28,767
Everyone thinks it's the same old same old

4881
03:59:29,023 --> 03:59:34,655
By the way there's Japanese troops in small numbers all over China for various reasons going back to

4882
03:59:34,911 --> 03:59:35,423
Treatise

4883
03:59:35,679 --> 03:59:36,703
Decades ago

4884
03:59:36,959 --> 03:59:42,079
In this case though the ones in Beijing open fire against Chinese troops vice-versa they fight for a little while

4885
03:59:42,591 --> 03:59:43,871
The truce get started and the

4886
03:59:44,383 --> 03:59:46,431
Japanese can't get the Chinese

4887
03:59:46,943 --> 03:59:48,991
To agree to the normal kind of almost

4888
03:59:49,247 --> 03:59:52,063
Embarrassing terms that they agree to routinely

4889
03:59:53,855 --> 03:59:55,135
That doesn't happen this time

4890
03:59:55,903 --> 03:59:56,671
Instead

4891
03:59:56,927 --> 03:59:57,951
Taking a public

4892
03:59:58,463 --> 03:59:59,231
Proclamation

4893
03:59:59,487 --> 04:00:05,631
From Chiang Kai-shek is really like in front of the global stage throwing down the gauntlet saying we're not going to take it anymore

4894
04:00:06,143 --> 04:00:07,167
And he says quote

4895
04:00:09,215 --> 04:00:12,543
If we allow one more inch of our territory to be lost

4896
04:00:12,799 --> 04:00:15,359
Or Sovereign rights to be encroached upon

4897
04:00:15,615 --> 04:00:19,711
Then we should be guilty of committing an unpardonable crime against our Chinese race

4898
04:00:20,479 --> 04:00:22,783
China's Sovereign rights cannot be sacrificed

4899
04:00:23,039 --> 04:00:24,575
Even at the expense of War

4900
04:00:24,831 --> 04:00:27,903
And once War has begun there is no looking back

4901
04:00:28,671 --> 04:00:29,183
And quote

4902
04:00:31,487 --> 04:00:33,791
This Proclamation is meant for several days

4903
04:00:34,047 --> 04:00:35,583
Different audiences it's obviously

4904
04:00:35,839 --> 04:00:36,863
Chinese people

4905
04:00:37,887 --> 04:00:38,399
Who are

4906
04:00:39,167 --> 04:00:41,983
In large part really excited about the chance to

4907
04:00:42,239 --> 04:00:42,751
Define lie

4908
04:00:43,007 --> 04:00:43,775
Strike

4909
04:00:44,031 --> 04:00:45,567
Get the outside enemies we said

4910
04:00:46,335 --> 04:00:49,151
But it's also meant for the Japanese public

4911
04:00:49,919 --> 04:00:50,687
And they will be

4912
04:00:50,943 --> 04:00:51,455
Furiate

4913
04:00:51,711 --> 04:00:54,271
For the most part by it in the editorial in the newspapers

4914
04:00:54,527 --> 04:00:55,295
Play it up in general

4915
04:00:55,807 --> 04:00:56,831
And bureaucrats rules

4916
04:00:57,087 --> 04:00:59,903
Call for China to be chastised here and punished

4917
04:01:00,671 --> 04:01:01,439
Are there a country

4918
04:01:02,207 --> 04:01:02,975
Chiang Kai-shek

4919
04:01:03,487 --> 04:01:04,255
Typically

4920
04:01:04,511 --> 04:01:05,791
Not looking very good in the mall

4921
04:01:06,047 --> 04:01:10,655
All of a sudden they kind of like him when he was fighting Communists now when he's Allied to communist don't like him very much

4922
04:01:10,911 --> 04:01:11,423
Much anymore

4923
04:01:13,215 --> 04:01:15,007
But this Proclamation is also meant

4924
04:01:15,775 --> 04:01:16,543
Unifour

4925
04:01:17,055 --> 04:01:18,591
Global public opinion

4926
04:01:19,359 --> 04:01:24,991
To tell the peoples in the great Powers listen how much of the rainbow and unicorn fumes are still left I mean

4927
04:01:25,247 --> 04:01:27,295
The politicians in all these countries like

4928
04:01:27,551 --> 04:01:33,695
France and Britain the United States when these people are all talk and really good games deal with a high-minded moral sentiments

4929
04:01:34,463 --> 04:01:34,975
And Chang's

4930
04:01:35,231 --> 04:01:39,327
Message is kind of another way of saying maybe put your money where your mouth is

4931
04:01:39,583 --> 04:01:43,167
And answering a key question a lot of people who are wondering about

4932
04:01:43,423 --> 04:01:48,799
Supporting China have which is will they be around 5 minutes after real fighting started it worth my investment

4933
04:01:49,055 --> 04:01:53,151
Will there even be a Chinese Army still around by the time the rifles that I buy for them get there

4934
04:01:53,663 --> 04:01:54,943
Legitimate question

4935
04:01:56,991 --> 04:01:59,295
People that are probably in the best position to

4936
04:01:59,551 --> 04:02:03,135
To answer this question although they're probably biased you would think though

4937
04:02:03,391 --> 04:02:09,279
Would be the Japanese military after all they've been fighting the Chinese now for years in this undeclared war

4938
04:02:10,303 --> 04:02:11,839
And they're apparently telling the emperor

4939
04:02:12,607 --> 04:02:15,679
But they can get a handle on this Chinese problem just give him three much

4940
04:02:16,959 --> 04:02:18,495
So not exactly the highest

4941
04:02:18,751 --> 04:02:20,287
Pinyin of Chinese military

4942
04:02:20,799 --> 04:02:23,871
Capabilities but let's remember they've not seen a United

4943
04:02:24,127 --> 04:02:24,639
Did China

4944
04:02:25,151 --> 04:02:27,199
Nor have they seen a very defiant

4945
04:02:27,711 --> 04:02:28,223
Chill now

4946
04:02:29,247 --> 04:02:30,015
They're getting but with

4947
04:02:30,783 --> 04:02:31,295
Time

4948
04:02:33,343 --> 04:02:36,415
But in an attempt to sort of answer these questions for

4949
04:02:36,927 --> 04:02:43,071
You know the global audience out there Chiang Kai-shek and his generals choose a strategy and it's got a lot of reasons why

4950
04:02:43,327 --> 04:02:45,375
But there's a lot of downsides to

4951
04:02:45,631 --> 04:02:47,935
That will put everything that's going to happen

4952
04:02:48,447 --> 04:02:52,287
You know as much as China has an opportunity to do this anyway on the other side of the world from most

4953
04:02:52,543 --> 04:02:54,335
Power is going to put all these events

4954
04:02:54,847 --> 04:02:56,639
Front and center in front of the people whose

4955
04:02:57,151 --> 04:02:59,455
Opinion matters in this case the people that can make loans

4956
04:02:59,711 --> 04:03:00,479
Gendarmes

4957
04:03:00,735 --> 04:03:01,503
Maybe even

4958
04:03:02,271 --> 04:03:08,415
Launch embargoes on Japan or maybe even bring in troops I mean the possibilities are endless if you can just get them interested

4959
04:03:09,183 --> 04:03:09,951
And what if you

4960
04:03:10,207 --> 04:03:14,047
Expand the war to an area where they're already really interested

4961
04:03:15,839 --> 04:03:17,119
About taking the water Shanghai

4962
04:03:17,631 --> 04:03:19,423
I wear all those great powers

4963
04:03:19,679 --> 04:03:22,239
Have a lot of money invested have commercial interest have

4964
04:03:22,495 --> 04:03:28,639
In most cases thousands in some cases tens of thousands of their citizens living there is expatriate

4965
04:03:29,151 --> 04:03:29,919
Or workers

4966
04:03:33,247 --> 04:03:34,783
How about you just bring the war

4967
04:03:35,295 --> 04:03:38,879
To Shanghai where the entire Global media will be there too

4968
04:03:39,135 --> 04:03:39,903
Witness at 2

4969
04:03:40,159 --> 04:03:42,975
And what did he throw in a ton of your strength

4970
04:03:43,231 --> 04:03:45,023
If you know that you've built up over the years and

4971
04:03:45,535 --> 04:03:47,071
And soda safeguarded and kept

4972
04:03:47,327 --> 04:03:53,471
For just such an occasion so that you can give a huge display of your capability to fight the Japanese when you want

4973
04:03:53,727 --> 04:03:54,239
2

4974
04:03:55,007 --> 04:03:56,287
So what you do all that

4975
04:03:56,543 --> 04:03:57,311
And

4976
04:03:57,823 --> 04:03:59,359
Not if you trapped these

4977
04:03:59,615 --> 04:04:01,407
Technologically Superior

4978
04:04:01,919 --> 04:04:07,807
Better trained better coordinated better Supply better LED more experienced in many cases Japanese troops

4979
04:04:08,575 --> 04:04:12,927
If you trap them in the narrow Alleyways of a city in Shanghai in it

4980
04:04:13,439 --> 04:04:15,487
GHIN score like a modern European

4981
04:04:15,999 --> 04:04:16,511
Keystone

4982
04:04:16,767 --> 04:04:17,791
Brick building I mean

4983
04:04:18,303 --> 04:04:20,351
You trap somebody there it could be

4984
04:04:20,863 --> 04:04:21,631
And this is a book

4985
04:04:21,887 --> 04:04:22,655
Title that I use

4986
04:04:22,911 --> 04:04:25,215
For this by Author Peter harmsen

4987
04:04:25,727 --> 04:04:27,519
Stalingrad on the Yangtze

4988
04:04:29,567 --> 04:04:30,847
Things like

4989
04:04:31,103 --> 04:04:33,407
Street fighting that all falls into

4990
04:04:33,919 --> 04:04:35,455
Nicole questions obvious

4991
04:04:36,735 --> 04:04:38,015
If you zoom out here though

4992
04:04:38,271 --> 04:04:39,295
And look at this from this

4993
04:04:39,551 --> 04:04:41,855
Strategic point of view look at with china's done here

4994
04:04:42,111 --> 04:04:43,647
And as I said it's a double-edged sword

4995
04:04:44,671 --> 04:04:45,951
But he's essentially

4996
04:04:46,463 --> 04:04:48,511
Soul calling Japan

4997
04:04:48,767 --> 04:04:50,815
Block in terms I would say of being

4998
04:04:51,071 --> 04:04:52,607
A true great power

4999
04:04:53,375 --> 04:04:54,399
Because there are several

5000
04:04:54,655 --> 04:04:55,423
Great powers that

5001
04:04:55,935 --> 04:04:57,983
Don't have the land mass

5002
04:04:58,495 --> 04:04:59,519
Or raw material

5003
04:04:59,775 --> 04:05:00,799
Rose Foundation

5004
04:05:01,055 --> 04:05:05,663
You have to put them in the very top classic gray powers and living in Germany for example conduit

5005
04:05:05,919 --> 04:05:07,199
They tried to live in the ground

5006
04:05:07,455 --> 04:05:08,223
Something once before

5007
04:05:10,271 --> 04:05:13,087
But they make up for it with a lot of other things like the Japanese do

5008
04:05:13,855 --> 04:05:15,647
But the Chinese are legitimately huge

5009
04:05:16,671 --> 04:05:20,767
We're talking about land masses that New Year Soviet Union type size things although that was

5010
04:05:21,023 --> 04:05:22,047
Someone bigger

5011
04:05:22,303 --> 04:05:25,631
But United States I'd sizes it gives them a luxury most places.

5012
04:05:25,887 --> 04:05:26,399
Don't have

5013
04:05:26,911 --> 04:05:28,703
Gives them the luxury of space

5014
04:05:29,727 --> 04:05:30,495
If you are a battle

5015
04:05:30,751 --> 04:05:31,519
Field General

5016
04:05:32,543 --> 04:05:33,311
Space is

5017
04:05:33,567 --> 04:05:37,151
Just say it's huge might be an understatement might be a determining Factor

5018
04:05:37,919 --> 04:05:38,943
Think like a Russian general

5019
04:05:40,735 --> 04:05:41,759
The Chinese will sometimes

5020
04:05:42,271 --> 04:05:42,783
Space force

5021
04:05:43,039 --> 04:05:44,063
What time and what are the times

5022
04:05:44,319 --> 04:05:44,831
Will be here

5023
04:05:45,599 --> 04:05:46,879
Look at what they've done

5024
04:05:47,903 --> 04:05:49,439
I mean if you look at a map

5025
04:05:49,951 --> 04:05:53,535
The Japanese are up in the north fighting in above Beijing and

5026
04:05:53,791 --> 04:05:55,583
Shanghai is more than 600 miles

5027
04:05:55,839 --> 04:05:58,911
The South with intervening Chinese territory the whole way

5028
04:05:59,679 --> 04:06:05,055
The only way the Japanese are going to be able to fight is by using the Japanese Navy to Ferry troops

5029
04:06:05,311 --> 04:06:07,359
Continually from other areas

5030
04:06:07,615 --> 04:06:11,199
And land them in amphibious operations around Shanghai

5031
04:06:12,479 --> 04:06:13,247
They're going to have to

5032
04:06:13,503 --> 04:06:15,807
Create an ocean-going

5033
04:06:16,063 --> 04:06:21,183
Logistical supply line all the way back to Japan that's more complicated and expensive than doing it

5034
04:06:21,695 --> 04:06:23,743
Railways and supply lines on land

5035
04:06:25,023 --> 04:06:26,303
Are you getting idea of the distance here

5036
04:06:27,839 --> 04:06:29,887
In the book on the battle for China which

5037
04:06:30,143 --> 04:06:30,911
Each chapter

5038
04:06:31,167 --> 04:06:31,935
By different expert

5039
04:06:32,959 --> 04:06:35,519
Historians edwidge Adrian hands Vandeven

5040
04:06:36,031 --> 04:06:38,335
Try to put it in US terms

5041
04:06:38,847 --> 04:06:40,639
And they say that if you locate

5042
04:06:41,151 --> 04:06:46,527
Beijing what used to be called Peking back in this Arab if you locate Beijing up at Michigan

5043
04:06:47,807 --> 04:06:48,831
Upper Peninsula

5044
04:06:49,343 --> 04:06:53,183
That would put Shanghai over by Washington DC

5045
04:06:54,207 --> 04:06:55,231
Canton

5046
04:06:55,487 --> 04:06:57,535
Down by New Orleans

5047
04:06:57,791 --> 04:07:02,143
Wuhan they write would be worse St Louis is approximately

5048
04:07:02,399 --> 04:07:05,215
And Chongqing would be in Southwestern Kansas

5049
04:07:06,751 --> 04:07:09,311
Imagine somebody landing on the East Coast

5050
04:07:09,823 --> 04:07:12,383
And trying to conquer everything to the Mississippi

5051
04:07:13,151 --> 04:07:18,271
Now imagine it's a small island nation with about 70 to 80 million people

5052
04:07:19,039 --> 04:07:24,927
That less than what 75 years ago was living under a military Shogun

5053
04:07:25,183 --> 04:07:27,743
And was closed to the Western world

5054
04:07:29,023 --> 04:07:35,167
China's going to call Japan's Bluff here right how large are you you want to play this game you're beating us in single Deck Poker how about

5055
04:07:35,423 --> 04:07:37,727
We throw at five decks and see if you can still play

5056
04:07:38,751 --> 04:07:40,543
Of course not forget the downsides

5057
04:07:40,799 --> 04:07:46,431
A fighting in a place like Shanghai I mean if your Chinese Shanghai is your commercial Capital to

5058
04:07:47,711 --> 04:07:51,551
If New York is your commercial Capital how much are you going to appreciate having

5059
04:07:51,807 --> 04:07:54,879
A couple of mid-twentieth-century Army's number in the hundreds of thousands

5060
04:07:55,135 --> 04:07:56,927
Fighting it out anywhere in your city

5061
04:07:57,695 --> 04:07:58,719
What's that going to do

5062
04:07:58,975 --> 04:08:00,255
Do your industrial out

5063
04:08:02,559 --> 04:08:03,071
It's even

5064
04:08:03,327 --> 04:08:06,143
Stranger than that then there's a certain Dynamic when you get

5065
04:08:06,399 --> 04:08:07,679
Modern battles in

5066
04:08:07,935 --> 04:08:11,519
Big big cities and that's that you can have fighting raging in one part

5067
04:08:12,031 --> 04:08:15,103
And your total peace and another part so imagine New York City has

5068
04:08:15,359 --> 04:08:18,943
This fighting raging in a place like queens or a burro like Brooklyn

5069
04:08:19,199 --> 04:08:25,343
But it's peaceful enough in Manhattan for you to take a date up to a skyscraper have martinis and watch over the balcony of the puffs of smoke

5070
04:08:25,599 --> 04:08:26,111
Smoke in the distance

5071
04:08:26,367 --> 04:08:27,391
Fighting is Raging

5072
04:08:28,159 --> 04:08:29,695
That'll happen in Shanghai to

5073
04:08:29,951 --> 04:08:35,327
We're people will come out to watch and don't kid me New Yorkers you have a lot of people coming out to watch

5074
04:08:37,119 --> 04:08:41,727
That's the other problem with deciding to have a battle in Shanghai the people

5075
04:08:43,263 --> 04:08:48,639
If you have a city of three to four million people and they're going to start to fight a modern bottle in the middle of it what happen

5076
04:08:48,895 --> 04:08:49,407
Them

5077
04:08:50,943 --> 04:08:52,223
Wella Mass Exodus

5078
04:08:52,479 --> 04:08:53,759
Begins right as the fighting

5079
04:08:54,015 --> 04:08:55,295
Starts in Shanghai

5080
04:08:55,551 --> 04:08:57,855
It will be the largest in the city's history

5081
04:08:58,367 --> 04:09:01,183
And at times will reach Stampede light

5082
04:09:01,439 --> 04:09:02,719
Levels of panic

5083
04:09:03,743 --> 04:09:06,303
And you have to imagine them in all the books try to

5084
04:09:06,559 --> 04:09:07,071
Convey this

5085
04:09:07,839 --> 04:09:13,983
The Sea of humanity in the city at this time it's already a crowded City and you have all these War refugees and also

5086
04:09:14,239 --> 04:09:14,751
Supporting

5087
04:09:15,263 --> 04:09:16,543
It is jam-packed

5088
04:09:16,799 --> 04:09:17,823
The Sea of humanity

Recalls One account from somebody was caught on a bridge

5091
04:09:26,271 --> 04:09:27,551
The bunch of civilians trying to get

Get from one

For the foreigners are Shanghai visitors and residents alike

5096
04:09:39,071 --> 04:09:43,423
The war was a rather violent diversion but nothing truly dangerous

5097
04:09:43,679 --> 04:09:44,447
Or so they thought

5098
04:09:44,959 --> 04:09:47,263
Are the Chinese life was falling apart

5099
04:09:47,775 --> 04:09:50,335
As the fighting intensified around the Japanese District

5100
04:09:50,591 --> 04:09:51,871
Thousands of refugees

5101
04:09:52,127 --> 04:09:52,895
LED through the streets

5102
04:09:53,407 --> 04:09:55,711
Heading for Suzhou Creek in the garden bridge

5103
04:09:55,967 --> 04:09:59,295
Which was the only link to the international settlement that remained open

5104
04:10:00,319 --> 04:10:03,903
It was a mad and merciless Stampy with week had little chance

5105
04:10:04,415 --> 04:10:05,695
Recording primary source

5106
04:10:05,951 --> 04:10:09,279

Quote

5110
04:10:17,727 --> 04:10:23,615
Half a dozen times I knew I was walking on the bodies of children or old people sucked under by the torrent

5111
04:10:23,871 --> 04:10:25,663
Trampled flat by countless feet

5112
04:10:26,431 --> 04:10:26,943
And quote

5113
04:10:27,967 --> 04:10:29,247
Thomson continues quotes

5114
04:10:29,759 --> 04:10:30,527
Near the creek

5115
04:10:30,783 --> 04:10:34,623
The mass of sweating and panting Humanity was almost beyond control

5116
04:10:35,135 --> 04:10:36,927
As it funnel towards the bridge

5117
04:10:37,183 --> 04:10:39,231
Which was a mere 55 ft wide

5118
04:10:39,487 --> 04:10:44,863
Two Japanese centuries were nearly overwhelmed by the crowd then reacted the way that they had been taught

5119
04:10:45,375 --> 04:10:47,679
Weed immediate reflexive brutality

5120
04:10:48,191 --> 04:10:49,471
One of them he writes

5121
04:10:49,727 --> 04:10:54,335
Bayonetta 2 in Old Man and through the lifeless body into the filthy Creek below

5122
04:10:54,591 --> 04:11:00,735
This did not deter any of the other refugees who kept pushing toward the bridge and what they believed to be the safety of the

5123
04:11:00,991 --> 04:11:01,503
No settlement

5124
04:11:01,759 --> 04:11:02,783
They could not know it

5125
04:11:03,039 --> 04:11:05,343
But they were now moving in the wrong direction

5126
04:11:05,855 --> 04:11:09,951
Toward the most horrific Slaughter of innocent civilians of the entire Shanghai campaign

5127
04:11:10,719 --> 04:11:11,231
And quote

5128
04:11:12,511 --> 04:11:16,607
These refugees are trying desperately to get to the area they think is going to be the safes

5129
04:11:17,119 --> 04:11:19,167
Because they know that neither Army wants

5130
04:11:19,423 --> 04:11:21,471
To kill foreigners from great powers

5131
04:11:21,983 --> 04:11:23,775
And they know those foreigners stay in place

5132
04:11:24,031 --> 04:11:25,311
Just like the French concession

5133
04:11:25,567 --> 04:11:27,615
Part of the city where the international settlement part of

5134
04:11:27,871 --> 04:11:29,151
The city so they're trying to get there

5135
04:11:29,919 --> 04:11:31,711
It's an already-crowded very nice

5136
04:11:31,967 --> 04:11:32,735
Part of town

5137
04:11:33,247 --> 04:11:36,831
And so are these refugees pouring they're going to swell the numbers even more

5138
04:11:38,367 --> 04:11:43,231
Now they're running away from the first real Combat which gets going August 13th 1937

5139
04:11:43,743 --> 04:11:46,047
But it's more the Strategic taking of

5140
04:11:46,303 --> 04:11:52,447
Places in preparation for the big attack the big attack will come the next day almost at exactly the same time Murphy's

5141
04:11:52,703 --> 04:11:54,239
Law comes into play

5142
04:11:54,495 --> 04:11:55,263
Murphy's Law

5143
04:11:55,775 --> 04:11:58,079
Urban Warfare in dense population centers

5144
04:11:58,591 --> 04:11:59,871
And in an attempt

5145
04:12:00,383 --> 04:12:03,711
To bomb Japanese warships in the river

5146
04:12:04,223 --> 04:12:05,759
Running through Shanghai

5147
04:12:06,527 --> 04:12:08,063
Twice in 15 minutes

5148
04:12:08,319 --> 04:12:11,391
Chinese planes will instead release their bombs

5149
04:12:12,415 --> 04:12:14,207
In places to kill lots of other people

5150
04:12:14,463 --> 04:12:14,975
Innocent

5151
04:12:15,487 --> 04:12:16,767
People from their own country

5152
04:12:18,303 --> 04:12:20,095
If you had wanted to design Annex

5153
04:12:20,351 --> 04:12:20,863
Experiment

5154
04:12:21,375 --> 04:12:24,447
Maybe you're an arms manufacturer looking for data

5155
04:12:25,215 --> 04:12:25,983
And you wanted to

5156
04:12:26,239 --> 04:12:27,775
Give the maximum number of

5157
04:12:28,031 --> 04:12:28,543
People

5158
04:12:28,799 --> 04:12:34,431
In a one bomb in a given situation could kill you could not design probably a better

5159
04:12:34,687 --> 04:12:35,711
Testing ground

5160
04:12:35,967 --> 04:12:38,783
Positive results as you would see them in that situation

5161
04:12:39,295 --> 04:12:41,599
Then choosing this part of Shanghai

5162
04:12:42,367 --> 04:12:43,135
At this time

5163
04:12:44,415 --> 04:12:45,439
I mean in urban center with

5164
04:12:45,695 --> 04:12:49,791
Concrete everywhere buildings on both sides and people absolutely

5165
04:12:51,839 --> 04:12:53,119
They're extra jam-packed

5166
04:12:53,375 --> 04:12:55,423
Here as well because they're watching

5167
04:12:56,447 --> 04:13:00,287
There are thousands upon thousands of people lined up on the boulevard

5168
04:13:00,799 --> 04:13:06,431
Watching these Chinese planes and cheering them on as they try to hit these Japanese ships in the river

5169
04:13:06,687 --> 04:13:08,479
So when these bombs go arrive

5170
04:13:08,735 --> 04:13:10,527
3000 people watching

5171
04:13:10,783 --> 04:13:14,623
Actually I mean there's account actually see them coming down

5172
04:13:14,879 --> 04:13:16,159
At them they had a

5173
04:13:16,415 --> 04:13:18,719
Split Second to think about what was just about to happen

5174
04:13:20,255 --> 04:13:21,279
Edgewood Peter harmsen right

5175
04:13:21,535 --> 04:13:22,047
Quote

5176
04:13:22,303 --> 04:13:27,167
The two bombs released by the Chinese airplane hits truck at exactly 4:27 p.m.

5177
04:13:27,679 --> 04:13:28,191
The attacks

5178
04:13:28,447 --> 04:13:31,519
Stop the arms of a clock at the entrance of Cathay Hotel

5179
04:13:32,031 --> 04:13:34,335
Freezing in time the moment of the twin blasts

5180
04:13:35,103 --> 04:13:40,735
The shockwaves and the debris had both taken a toll on the mass of people who have been crammed into the street

5181
04:13:41,759 --> 04:13:47,903
To Percy Finch a foreign correspondent it was as if a giant mower had pushed through the crowd

5182
04:13:48,159 --> 04:13:48,927
Chewing it to bits

5183
04:13:49,439 --> 04:13:51,231
According to foreign correspondent quote

5184
04:13:52,255 --> 04:13:53,791
Here was a headless man

5185
04:13:54,047 --> 04:13:59,167
They are a baby's foot wearing his little red silk shoe embroidered with Fierce dragons

5186
04:13:59,423 --> 04:13:59,935
He wrote

5187
04:14:00,447 --> 04:14:04,287
One body that have a young boy was flattened High against the wall

5188
04:14:04,543 --> 04:14:06,847
Twisted clown with ghastly adhesion

5189
04:14:07,615 --> 04:14:08,127
And quote

5190
04:14:08,639 --> 04:14:10,431
Now harmsen continues quote

5191
04:14:11,455 --> 04:14:14,271
A sickening stench of burnt flesh filled the air

5192
04:14:14,527 --> 04:14:16,831
As the wounded came to they started moaning

5193
04:14:17,087 --> 04:14:18,111
Summer screaming

5194
04:14:18,367 --> 04:14:21,695
Part of the facade of the Palace Hotel have been blown away

5195
04:14:21,951 --> 04:14:27,839
On the 4th floor a man clung desperately to the remains of the wall with one hand waiting for help

5196
04:14:28,095 --> 04:14:30,399
It came too late to me eventually let go

5197
04:14:30,655 --> 04:14:33,215
Crashing through the glass awning of the hotel's entrance

5198
04:14:33,471 --> 04:14:34,495
Before hitting the pavement

5199
04:14:35,519 --> 04:14:41,663
Others attempted to crawl to safety scrambling with fumbling limbs over mangled bodies and slipping in the blood

5200
04:14:41,919 --> 04:14:42,687
Who covered the sidewalk

5201
04:14:42,943 --> 04:14:43,711
And quote

5202
04:14:44,991 --> 04:14:47,551
Now let's understand why we know in such

5203
04:14:47,807 --> 04:14:49,855
Graphic detail this kind of stuff

5204
04:14:50,879 --> 04:14:57,023
All the guys at the Modern author just quoted was a foreign correspondent who was in the street when the event

5205
04:14:57,279 --> 04:14:57,791
Happened

5206
04:14:58,815 --> 04:15:01,119
The Press is there and it makes a big difference

5207
04:15:01,631 --> 04:15:05,215
You want to know how you really get foreign countries interested in events

5208
04:15:05,471 --> 04:15:06,495
Far away

5209
04:15:06,751 --> 04:15:08,287
In overseas places

5210
04:15:08,799 --> 04:15:10,335
Have their own citizens died there

5211
04:15:10,847 --> 04:15:11,871
The pay attention

5212
04:15:13,663 --> 04:15:17,759
Channel reporter I can tell you the practice is known as localizing a story

5213
04:15:18,783 --> 04:15:19,551
Easier to get people

5214
04:15:19,807 --> 04:15:21,343
How to relate to something that seems like

5215
04:15:21,855 --> 04:15:24,159
Closer to their lives and something far away the

5216
04:15:25,439 --> 04:15:26,463
How to get your mind around

5217
04:15:26,975 --> 04:15:27,487
In this case

5218
04:15:28,255 --> 04:15:29,791
The Author Peter harmsen

5219
04:15:30,047 --> 04:15:34,911
Accounts the situation involving 66 year old Christian Missionary Reverend Frank Rollins

5220
04:15:35,935 --> 04:15:36,959
He's been in China

5221
04:15:37,215 --> 04:15:38,239
After a long time

5222
04:15:38,751 --> 04:15:41,823
On this particular day he's driving his car with his wife

5223
04:15:42,079 --> 04:15:44,383
Passenger seat 13 year old daughter with him

5224
04:15:44,639 --> 04:15:49,503
Down Avenue Edward the seventh which inventor British king selection show YouTube

5225
04:15:49,759 --> 04:15:50,783
Not in the

5226
04:15:51,039 --> 04:15:53,599
Chinese part of town per se

5227
04:15:54,879 --> 04:15:55,391
I can hear

5228
04:15:55,647 --> 04:15:59,743
About a billion Chinese people screaming in the back of my head saying it's all Chinese but anyway

5229
04:15:59,999 --> 04:16:01,535
Avenue Edward the seventh

5230
04:16:01,791 --> 04:16:03,327
Reverend Frank Rawlinson

5231
04:16:03,583 --> 04:16:04,351
About to

5232
04:16:04,607 --> 04:16:10,495
Run people over with his car it's so packed in the street that is wife says you'll get a better view he's trying to see some of the

5233
04:16:10,751 --> 04:16:13,567
In a bombing in the river going on like everyone else

5234
04:16:13,823 --> 04:16:16,127
If he gets out of his car gets out of his car

5235
04:16:16,639 --> 04:16:18,943
And he gets a hole blown open it is chess

5236
04:16:20,735 --> 04:16:22,527
And story in his wife gets out

5237
04:16:23,039 --> 04:16:27,903
Caesar husband bleeding out in front of her the 13 year old daughter gets out of the car and seizes for riffic

5238
04:16:28,159 --> 04:16:32,767
Traumatizing site and in a weird way because we are human beings and is how we function

5239
04:16:33,791 --> 04:16:38,911
To be able to recount that event back to the folks back home will make more of a difference than

5240
04:16:39,167 --> 04:16:39,679
Explaining

5241
04:16:40,191 --> 04:16:40,959
And the other people

5242
04:16:41,215 --> 04:16:44,543
That that bomb killed because that bomb that killed this Reverend

5243
04:16:44,799 --> 04:16:45,311
On

5244
04:16:46,079 --> 04:16:48,383
Avenue Edward the seventh will also hit

5245
04:16:49,151 --> 04:16:51,711
I guess the best description I can describe is it as a

5246
04:16:51,967 --> 04:16:58,111
6 story shopping mall but much less structurally sound called the Great World amusement Center

5247
04:16:58,367 --> 04:17:04,255
And it's normally packed with thousands of Chinese people right now it's packed with thousands of Chinese people who happen to be most

5248
04:17:04,511 --> 04:17:05,535
Refugees

5249
04:17:06,047 --> 04:17:09,119
I'm more than normal even on site getting a race

5250
04:17:09,375 --> 04:17:10,911
In a food handout

5251
04:17:11,679 --> 04:17:12,447
And the bomb hits

5252
04:17:12,703 --> 04:17:13,215
There

5253
04:17:13,983 --> 04:17:15,263
And the bodies are stacked

5254
04:17:15,775 --> 04:17:16,543
5 feet high

5255
04:17:19,103 --> 04:17:20,639
You're so Author Peter harmsen

5256
04:17:20,895 --> 04:17:21,663
Describes a quote

5257
04:17:23,199 --> 04:17:29,343
The mood was excited once more at about 4:45 p.m. when two Chinese aircraft seemed about to make a

5258
04:17:29,599 --> 04:17:31,647
Another run on the Japanese positions

5259
04:17:32,159 --> 04:17:34,463
Cheers and Applause Rose from the street

5260
04:17:34,975 --> 04:17:39,583
Then sharp-eyed individuals notice to small dark dots drop from one of the plane

5261
04:17:40,095 --> 04:17:41,375
The same bombs that

5262
04:17:41,631 --> 04:17:42,911
Another guy here earlier spoke

5263
04:17:43,167 --> 04:17:44,191
Coconut Head scene

5264
04:17:44,703 --> 04:17:46,239
They fell with deadly Haze

5265
04:17:46,495 --> 04:17:50,335
Hitting the busy street before anyone had time to react let alone Escape

5266
04:17:50,591 --> 04:17:54,687
One left a huge crater near the traffic control tower in the middle of the road

5267
04:17:55,199 --> 04:18:00,063
The other exploded a few feet above the ground causing shrapnel the fly over a large area

5268
04:18:00,575 --> 04:18:06,719
Explosions were so powerful that they killed a servant at the building of the YMCA nearly 700 feet down

5269
04:18:06,975 --> 04:18:08,255
A subsidiary Road

5270
04:18:08,767 --> 04:18:10,815
The casualties included several foreigners

5271
04:18:11,071 --> 04:18:11,839
Arms and rights

5272
04:18:12,607 --> 04:18:16,447
On Avenue Edward the seventh Reverend Rawlinson Lay Dying in his wife's arms

5273
04:18:16,703 --> 04:18:18,751
What is teenage daughter was watching

5274
04:18:19,007 --> 04:18:24,127
Just yards away two other Americans who were konigsberg and his wife were killed in their car

5275
04:18:24,383 --> 04:18:27,455
It was the same type of Carnitas in the name Jean Road earlier

5276
04:18:27,711 --> 04:18:28,479
Just larger

5277
04:18:28,991 --> 04:18:30,783
Death on the most massive scale

5278
04:18:31,039 --> 04:18:33,343
What's at the entrance of the great World amusement Center

5279
04:18:33,599 --> 04:18:36,159
Where the fatalities were piled five feet high

5280
04:18:36,415 --> 04:18:41,023
The victims men women and children have been throwing up against the walls of the building

5281
04:18:41,279 --> 04:18:45,631
Many were stripped completely naked after the intent of gas pressure from the bombs at turn off the

5282
04:18:45,887 --> 04:18:46,399
The clothes

5283
04:18:47,167 --> 04:18:47,679
And quote

5284
04:18:49,983 --> 04:18:54,847
Eventual death toll from the great world and surrounding areas will be more than

5285
04:18:55,103 --> 04:18:55,615
650

5286
04:18:55,871 --> 04:18:56,383
Do people

5287
04:18:56,639 --> 04:18:57,919
Men women and children

5288
04:18:59,455 --> 04:19:04,063
The death toll from both of these accidental bombings put together more than 1,200 people and what

5289
04:19:04,319 --> 04:19:04,831
1500

5290
04:19:05,087 --> 04:19:05,599
Seriously

5291
04:19:05,855 --> 04:19:07,903
When did seven foreigners among the Dead

5292
04:19:08,927 --> 04:19:10,207
Author Peter harmsen calls

5293
04:19:10,463 --> 04:19:11,231
All these American deaths

5294
04:19:11,487 --> 04:19:12,255
Tyrannies bombing

5295
04:19:12,511 --> 04:19:13,023
First

5296
04:19:13,279 --> 04:19:14,047
American casual

5297
04:19:14,303 --> 04:19:15,071
Duties of the second word

5298
04:19:15,327 --> 04:19:15,839
World War

5299
04:19:17,375 --> 04:19:20,703
They matter more than they should theoretically

5300
04:19:21,471 --> 04:19:23,519
In terms of public opinion because

5301
04:19:23,775 --> 04:19:24,287
After all

5302
04:19:24,543 --> 04:19:26,335
People are people they should all count

5303
04:19:26,591 --> 04:19:31,967
But there's something about a young American Christian Missionary and his daughter watching him die on the roadside and all this stuff that

5304
04:19:32,223 --> 04:19:32,735
The tracks mirror

5305
04:19:32,991 --> 04:19:34,015
Attention once again

5306
04:19:34,271 --> 04:19:37,343
And even though these are Chinese bombs that accidentally did this

5307
04:19:37,599 --> 04:19:39,135
Talk to the IRS directly to Japan

5308
04:19:39,391 --> 04:19:41,951
And after all one can ask the obvious question

5309
04:19:42,207 --> 04:19:46,303
What the heck are they doing in Shanghai anyway Chinese City so understandable

5310
04:19:48,095 --> 04:19:49,631
But it's just part of the drum beat

5311
04:19:49,887 --> 04:19:50,399
Atrocity

5312
04:19:50,911 --> 04:19:52,447
To make its way into

5313
04:19:52,959 --> 04:19:54,239
The foreign media

5314
04:19:56,031 --> 04:19:56,543
Manna picture

5315
04:19:56,799 --> 04:19:57,823
Just worth a thousand words

5316
04:19:59,871 --> 04:20:01,151
There's going to be a weird

5317
04:20:01,407 --> 04:20:01,919
Perverse

5318
04:20:02,943 --> 04:20:03,967
Incendium Loop

5319
04:20:04,223 --> 04:20:04,735
It happens

5320
04:20:04,991 --> 04:20:06,015
With these terrible disaster

5321
04:20:06,271 --> 04:20:07,551
The suffering the Chinese people

5322
04:20:07,807 --> 04:20:09,599
Because the more the Chinese people suffer

5323
04:20:10,367 --> 04:20:11,903
Anna Moritz publicized

5324
04:20:12,415 --> 04:20:15,743
The more International sympathy and sometimes eventually Aid

5325
04:20:16,255 --> 04:20:17,023
That brings them

5326
04:20:17,279 --> 04:20:18,303
So for example

5327
04:20:18,559 --> 04:20:22,143
In a month or two from this time. The Japanese will bomb a railway

5328
04:20:22,399 --> 04:20:23,423
Station in Shanghai in

5329
04:20:23,679 --> 04:20:26,239
A photographer will be there again

5330
04:20:26,495 --> 04:20:27,007
What time here

5331
04:20:27,519 --> 04:20:32,383
We'll catch a photo snap a photo of this destroyed railway station with bodies

5332
04:20:32,639 --> 04:20:33,407
Lying around

5333
04:20:34,175 --> 04:20:34,943
Anna baby

5334
04:20:35,455 --> 04:20:36,223
I'm guessing

5335
04:20:36,479 --> 04:20:38,783
Six-month-old seven-month-old sitting there

5336
04:20:39,039 --> 04:20:39,551
Covered

5337
04:20:39,807 --> 04:20:41,087
Burnt but crying

5338
04:20:42,111 --> 04:20:42,623
And

5339
04:20:42,879 --> 04:20:44,159
He sent this image back

5340
04:20:45,183 --> 04:20:45,951
To the

5341
04:20:46,207 --> 04:20:47,999
Emigrate press Outlet it.

5342
04:20:48,511 --> 04:20:50,047
That's one of the most moving

5343
04:20:50,559 --> 04:20:51,839
And emotionally

5344
04:20:53,119 --> 04:20:54,143
Demanding

5345
04:20:54,399 --> 04:20:55,935
Photos of the war

5346
04:20:56,191 --> 04:20:58,239
It's this kind of thing that plays into a

5347
04:20:59,007 --> 04:21:03,615
Change in mood especially once again in the United States a photo like that is a if you

5348
04:21:03,871 --> 04:21:08,223
If you're a reporter and you're trying to move public opinion in somebody hands

5349
04:21:08,479 --> 04:21:08,991
Photo

5350
04:21:09,503 --> 04:21:11,039
Gold how weird is that

5351
04:21:11,295 --> 04:21:12,319
The deaf person suffering

5352
04:21:12,831 --> 04:21:16,159
That little baby suffering on that Railway platform after the bombing

5353
04:21:16,927 --> 04:21:21,791
Is in a weird way serving the interests to Chinese nationalism and patriotism

5354
04:21:22,303 --> 04:21:22,815
Bye

5355
04:21:23,327 --> 04:21:29,471
You helping to publicize the mass Chinese suffering going on in the way that moves people in a way that you can say yes to

5356
04:21:29,727 --> 04:21:34,591
2000 Chinese people died the other day and you go out while you show the baby on the platform to go on my God

5357
04:21:36,383 --> 04:21:37,151
It's weird isn't it

5358
04:21:37,407 --> 04:21:37,919
Nets

5359
04:21:38,431 --> 04:21:42,271
La teacher reporter for example in the news business I mean if it bleeds it leads

5360
04:21:42,783 --> 04:21:44,831
And please localize your story so people

5361
04:21:45,087 --> 04:21:45,599
Care

5362
04:21:46,111 --> 04:21:47,391
This is an example of both of those

5363
04:21:51,231 --> 04:21:54,815
Are almost exact same time that those bombs are going awry and killing all the

5364
04:21:55,071 --> 04:21:55,839
People on the water

5365
04:21:56,607 --> 04:21:57,119
The amusement

5366
04:21:57,375 --> 04:21:57,887
Center

5367
04:21:58,655 --> 04:22:04,799
The Chinese launched their big attack against the Japanese the one by the way that was suggested them by a German general because they

5368
04:22:05,055 --> 04:22:05,823
The Germans are

5369
04:22:06,079 --> 04:22:08,383
Training the Chinese in this is very weird if you know the

5370
04:22:08,639 --> 04:22:09,151
The story because

5371
04:22:09,663 --> 04:22:13,247
Like 5 minutes from now the Germans and the Japanese are going to be allies

5372
04:22:13,503 --> 04:22:16,575
But in this battle which some Japanese refer to

5373
04:22:16,831 --> 04:22:18,111
And the German war

5374
04:22:18,623 --> 04:22:22,719
The Germans are helping the Chinese they've equipped the Chinese elite units

5375
04:22:22,975 --> 04:22:25,791
The German helmets in German stick grenade that mean they look like

5376
04:22:26,559 --> 04:22:32,703
The Afrika Corps Asian Edition right wearing khaki Asian features but otherwise looking like germ

5377
04:22:32,959 --> 04:22:33,471
Soldiers

5378
04:22:33,727 --> 04:22:37,311
They have advisors at the officer level that sometimes as advisor sometime

5379
04:22:38,335 --> 04:22:39,871
Elite units in the combat

5380
04:22:41,663 --> 04:22:47,295
The Chinese amongst a number of other troop there pouring troops into the Japanese are starting to as well

5381
04:22:48,319 --> 04:22:53,695
Have these two units the 87th and 88th division both of which I think you could reasonably classify as a liter

5382
04:22:54,207 --> 04:22:55,743
The best units in the army

5383
04:22:56,511 --> 04:22:57,279
They also have

5384
04:22:57,535 --> 04:23:00,607
Stuff the Chinese do that they've lovingly built up

5385
04:23:00,863 --> 04:23:01,631
Over the years

5386
04:23:01,887 --> 04:23:02,655
Tank force

5387
04:23:03,167 --> 04:23:05,983
An Airforce small obsolete but they've got one

5388
04:23:06,239 --> 04:23:09,311
Armored Cars me but it's all been took forever to build

5389
04:23:09,567 --> 04:23:12,639
And I saved it up and they're gonna throw it all into this

5390
04:23:13,151 --> 04:23:14,431
Attack and they're going to do it with

5391
04:23:14,687 --> 04:23:17,503
Fanaticism it's going to be interesting for you military history majors

5392
04:23:17,759 --> 04:23:22,367
They're going to fight the Japanese the same way the Japanese will fight the Allied powers in the Second World War

5393
04:23:22,623 --> 04:23:28,767
War from a position of being the one who has to have sacrificial suicide attacks to make up for material

5394
04:23:29,023 --> 04:23:30,303
Differences stories

5395
04:23:30,815 --> 04:23:36,959
Chinese troops in throwing themselves under Japanese tanks blowing themselves up to stop a tank column in a shades of what

5396
04:23:37,471 --> 04:23:39,519
The Japanese will do in the Second World War

5397
04:23:40,543 --> 04:23:41,567
The officer

5398
04:23:41,823 --> 04:23:46,175
Casualties on this first day for China will be Irreplaceable and shocking

5399
04:23:46,687 --> 04:23:47,967
What is one author pointed out

5400
04:23:48,223 --> 04:23:51,295
You are literally fighting in rubble in streets with

5401
04:23:51,551 --> 04:23:57,439
Buildings in your having people shooting at you from behind other it's crazy kind of Stalingrad type fighting

5402
04:23:58,463 --> 04:23:59,743
But in the first day

5403
04:24:00,255 --> 04:24:01,023
The Chinese

5404
04:24:01,791 --> 04:24:02,303
Stouffer

5405
04:24:02,559 --> 04:24:03,327
Irreplaceable

5406
04:24:05,375 --> 04:24:06,655
Author Peter Thompson rights quote

5407
04:24:08,703 --> 04:24:14,847
First and foremost however the massive fatality rates among officers and to an even larger extent the rank

5408
04:24:15,103 --> 04:24:15,615
Can file

5409
04:24:15,871 --> 04:24:21,247
Were the results of Chinese forces employing frontal attacks against the well-armed entrenched enemy

5410
04:24:21,759 --> 04:24:24,831
The Man Who as a result we're dying by the hundreds

5411
04:24:25,087 --> 04:24:26,623
What's China's elite soldiers

5412
04:24:27,135 --> 04:24:30,207
The product of years of effort to build up a modern military

5413
04:24:30,719 --> 04:24:35,071
They formed the nation's best hope to be able to resist Japan in the protracted War

5414
04:24:35,583 --> 04:24:40,191
Nevertheless on the first day of battle they were being squandered at an alarming unsustainable rate

5415
04:24:41,471 --> 04:24:41,983
And quote

5416
04:24:44,031 --> 04:24:46,335
By not sweeping away the Japanese.

5417
04:24:47,103 --> 04:24:48,639
German general had advised here

5418
04:24:49,663 --> 04:24:50,175
They

5419
04:24:50,431 --> 04:24:55,039
Allow things to stay in place everybody to reinforce in this thing to go on 4th

5420
04:24:55,295 --> 04:24:55,807
3 months

5421
04:24:56,831 --> 04:25:02,975
Now I suppose looking on the bright side it's a kind of a victory for the Chinese forces cuz the Japanese thought they'd take Shanghai in 3 days

5422
04:25:03,231 --> 04:25:03,999
ISO 3 months

5423
04:25:04,511 --> 04:25:05,791
A lot harder than the Japanese

5424
04:25:06,047 --> 04:25:06,559
Thought

5425
04:25:07,071 --> 04:25:11,423
The other thing that's a lot harder than the Japanese thought was how many people they would have to

5426
04:25:11,935 --> 04:25:14,495
Lose as casualties in order to do this numbers are

5427
04:25:14,751 --> 04:25:16,287
Sketchy here so taken with a grain of salt

5428
04:25:16,543 --> 04:25:18,591
Japanese supper about 40000 casualty

5429
04:25:19,103 --> 04:25:20,127
Dentistry month.

5430
04:25:21,151 --> 04:25:24,735
Number casualties are killed wounded captured missing

5431
04:25:26,271 --> 04:25:30,367
They will by the way and this entire affair with a Stalingrad like

5432
04:25:30,623 --> 04:25:31,135
Almost

5433
04:25:31,647 --> 04:25:37,791
Uno Attack around the city on both sides and they're getting ready to close it off the Chinese forces have to withdraw so that they don't get too you know.

5434
04:25:38,047 --> 04:25:38,559
Dunkirk

5435
04:25:40,607 --> 04:25:43,679
The China is going to suffer something more on the lines of 200

5436
04:25:43,935 --> 04:25:44,447
50 Cent

5437
04:25:44,703 --> 04:25:45,215
Mountain casual

5438
04:25:46,495 --> 04:25:47,007
In 3 months

5439
04:25:48,543 --> 04:25:49,311
250

5440
04:25:49,567 --> 04:25:50,079
2000 cash

5441
04:25:50,591 --> 04:25:52,127
Is it hard to get your mind around

5442
04:25:52,639 --> 04:25:53,919
It may be a good way to look at it

5443
04:25:54,175 --> 04:25:54,687
This if you take

5444
04:25:55,199 --> 04:25:58,015
Those numbers I just gave you Japanese and Chinese cassia

5445
04:25:58,527 --> 04:25:59,807
Can you put them together

5446
04:26:00,575 --> 04:26:03,391
In three months of fighting you have almost as many people

5447
04:26:03,903 --> 04:26:04,671
Darn near

5448
04:26:05,951 --> 04:26:06,975
As the United States

5449
04:26:07,231 --> 04:26:10,047
It's lost in its entire involvement in mediately Shore

5450
04:26:10,815 --> 04:26:12,095
More than a year

5451
04:26:12,351 --> 04:26:13,375
In the first World War

5452
04:26:15,423 --> 04:26:21,567
By the way Chinese numbers always look like somebody did the math wrong it always looks like somebody X some strangely law

5453
04:26:21,823 --> 04:26:23,103
Large number or something but

5454
04:26:23,359 --> 04:26:27,455
It's part of what makes Chinese history so overwhelmingly all inspired

5455
04:26:28,223 --> 04:26:28,735
You can

5456
04:26:28,991 --> 04:26:30,783
How to get your mind around the number sometime

5457
04:26:32,831 --> 04:26:38,463
Yeah we had said earlier sort of with the Japanese you get an extra dose of intensity with the Chinese you get an extra dose of

5458
04:26:38,975 --> 04:26:39,487
Number

5459
04:26:42,303 --> 04:26:44,607
Now when the Chinese forces are

5460
04:26:45,375 --> 04:26:49,983
Should have required to withdraw from Shanghai now you begin to see maybe the downside

5461
04:26:50,495 --> 04:26:54,591
Another downside of expanding the war this area because if you lose shine

5462
04:26:55,615 --> 04:26:57,663
Now you have the Victorious Japanese

5463
04:26:57,919 --> 04:27:04,063
Any new theater War now they're in central China and they're winning and they're pursuing the Chinese forces on the road

5464
04:27:04,831 --> 04:27:09,439
Back-to-the not very far from Shanghai Chinese capital of Nanjing

5465
04:27:10,207 --> 04:27:11,231
A chemist called Nanking

5466
04:27:13,535 --> 04:27:14,047
The Chinese

5467
04:27:14,303 --> 04:27:16,095
Expended an enormous amount of effort

5468
04:27:16,863 --> 04:27:21,727
They are in no position necessarily to stop and halt the Japanese Advance here

5469
04:27:22,495 --> 04:27:25,823
What are the Japanese going to do when they get to the Chinese capital

5470
04:27:27,359 --> 04:27:28,127
The well-known

5471
04:27:28,639 --> 04:27:29,151
Show controversy

5472
04:27:29,663 --> 04:27:30,175
Story

5473
04:27:31,455 --> 04:27:35,551
But a shorthand way to describe the traditional way of looking at it

5474
04:27:36,575 --> 04:27:38,367
It looks like a Mongol

5475
04:27:38,879 --> 04:27:40,159
Sacking of a city

5476
04:27:41,951 --> 04:27:43,743
Arguably the most horrific

5477
04:27:44,255 --> 04:27:45,279
Atrocity they will

5478
04:27:45,535 --> 04:27:46,047
Cur

5479
04:27:46,303 --> 04:27:50,143
In 15 years of war in the Pacific and Asian theater

5480
04:27:50,911 --> 04:27:53,471
Will occur when the Japanese get to this Chinese City

5481
04:27:55,007 --> 04:27:56,031
That's coming up next

5482
04:27:57,823 --> 04:27:59,103
Just strap yourselves in at the

5483
04:27:59,359 --> 04:27:59,871
Beginning of the neck

5484
04:28:00,127 --> 04:28:00,895
Max program cuz it's

5485
04:28:01,407 --> 04:28:01,919
Get nasty

5486
04:28:10,623 --> 04:28:11,647
I have a confession to make

5487
04:28:12,927 --> 04:28:14,463
I did not like

5488
04:28:15,743 --> 04:28:17,791
The idea of the Harry Potter book

5489
04:28:18,047 --> 04:28:19,327
When I first encountered the

5490
04:28:20,351 --> 04:28:23,423
Understand I am a fantasy snob I'm Lord of the Rings

5491
04:28:23,679 --> 04:28:24,191
Snob

5492
04:28:24,959 --> 04:28:30,847
I'm the kind of guy that likes my fantasy to go so deep that we could have legitimate conversations over the proper use of

5493
04:28:31,615 --> 04:28:33,663
Pronouns in the wood

5494
04:28:34,175 --> 04:28:40,319
Language to talk about the high I'll talk about the southern mirkwood dialect mean that's how I like it I'm a big long poems in a

5495
04:28:40,575 --> 04:28:42,111
Language some guy invented in his head

5496
04:28:43,391 --> 04:28:45,439
So I scoffed when my kids wanted me to read

5497
04:28:46,207 --> 04:28:46,719
Harry Potter

5498
04:28:48,511 --> 04:28:50,303
And then I started getting into them

5499
04:28:51,071 --> 04:28:57,215
And more and more it's finally almost start like a book written for like a 7 to 10 year old and then I think the next one came out like about 2 years

5500
04:28:57,471 --> 04:29:02,847
Later it's almost like that book is for the same kid that read the first one but now two years later and they get

5501
04:29:03,103 --> 04:29:04,127
Increasingly more

5502
04:29:05,151 --> 04:29:06,175
Dalton dark

5503
04:29:06,687 --> 04:29:12,831
I just remember one day waking up to the realization at 4:45 in the morning that for six straight hours I've been saying just one

5504
04:29:13,087 --> 04:29:14,367
One more page while I read

5505
04:29:15,135 --> 04:29:15,903
The Order of the Phoenix

5506
04:29:17,695 --> 04:29:18,207
I had to work

5507
04:29:18,463 --> 04:29:19,999
That's what I'm going to have a problem

5508
04:29:21,279 --> 04:29:21,791
A lot of people

5509
04:29:22,559 --> 04:29:23,583
Read to them and

5510
04:29:23,839 --> 04:29:24,863
A good narrator

5511
04:29:25,887 --> 04:29:26,399
So much to us

5512
04:29:26,655 --> 04:29:27,423
I like the guy

5513
04:29:27,935 --> 04:29:28,959
Edibles got doing the whole Harry

5514
04:29:29,215 --> 04:29:29,727

Right now

5516
04:29:30,751 --> 04:29:31,775
Jim Dale

5517
04:29:32,287 --> 04:29:34,335
Become a few samples of him to see if he doesn't

5518
04:29:35,103 --> 04:29:35,871
Just have one of those voices

5519
04:29:36,127 --> 04:29:36,639
The first one

5520
04:29:37,151 --> 04:29:37,663
Do anyway

5521
04:29:38,175 --> 04:29:39,199
