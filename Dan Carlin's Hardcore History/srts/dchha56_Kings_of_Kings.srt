1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:04,608
December 7th 1941

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:08,448
A date which will live

3
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:11,776
In infamy

4
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:13,568
Call Chris Duran

5
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:18,176
Biofreeze

6
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:38,656
Call Miss time and place I take pride in the words ich bin ein Berliner

7
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,304
If we dig deep in our history and our doctor and remember that we are not descended

8
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,864
From fearful men

9
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,448
Hardcore history

10
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,104
The dictionary defines the word

11
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,640
Laconic

12
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,432
As

13
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,480
A form of speech that

14
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,248
Blunt

15
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,784
Kissy

16
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:31,136
That uses an economy of words to make a point and sometimes two point

17
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,440
Is particularly biting

18
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,720
You're On Target

19
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,512
Mysterious

20
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,840
And I love the word because the word refers

21
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,888
2 way of speaking it was

22
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,424
Popular amongst a picture

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,704
Particular group of people

24
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,984
Ancient Greece

25
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,520
People known

26
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,800
Is like an ammonia

27
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:50,848
Otherwise known

28
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,128
Ispartan

29
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,456
Connex peaches Spartan

30
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,760
That's the way they're supposed

31
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,528
To talk

32
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,576
Imagine

33
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,368
Love child

34
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,672
Clint Eastwood and Batman

35
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,952
And that's the way

36
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
Way they spoke

37
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,792
Man's gotta know his limitations

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,584
Man's got to know us

39
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,656
Spartans of the kings of the one-liners

40
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,448
Ancient Greek history

41
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,240
And they are

42
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,848
Cinematic and character I mean is not a movie maker out there that wouldn't want

43
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,408
Clint Eastwood during his various

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,480
Movirs playing various forms of Spartan

45
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:33,600
You know from a spaghetti western era in his twenties he can play your average Spartan warrior

46
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,416
He gets into the Dirty Harry films

47
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:42,816
Enough 72-73 1974 he begins to age a little bit more replays one of those older Spartan Warriors and then you get in

48
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:47,424
You know after the Dirty Harry's are over and he's an older man and now he's the king

49
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,776
And he talks like he talks and all those other movies combined with Batman and you have

50
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,104
Another way the Spartans are supposed to have spoken laconic

51
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,408
How cool is it

52
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,688
Did the 25 centuries

53
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
Those people were

54
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,760
At the height of their Fame and Power

55
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,296
We still know the way they talk

56
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,088
It's famous

57
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:05,856
Prince famous

58
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,624
Because people wrote

59
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
People whose work

60
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,440
We still have

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,792
Telling you the way a certain

62
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,072
People spoke

63
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,864
That long ago

64
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,400
Describing

65
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,448
Some of the things that they said

66
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,776
All these sorts of little details help

67
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,568
Bring color to the story they

68
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,360
They help us all relate to these people

69
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,896
A little bit more

70
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
Human touches the

71
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,968
Flush out these historical figure

72
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,296
You begin to get the sort of stuff

73
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:41,952
The sorts of details that you were likely to hear in an oral tradition anywhere in the world before this time.

74
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,000
When you begin to get the stories

75
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
Come down to us

76
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,816
You begin to see

77
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,608
Truly cinematic

78
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,888
Pipe creations

79
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,680
Stories that you could take

80
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:57,312
With very little changes and updating and make movies out of them today and have them be

81
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,200
And it's not just the character development either the themes can be epic

82
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,224
In the store

83
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,528
Take for example the most

84
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,064
Famous story involved

85
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,088
Sparta

86
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,112
At all

87
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,160
The famous incident in 480

88
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:12,928
BCE

89
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,720
Pass of Thermopylae

90
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,000
Also called hot gay

91
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:20,095
This may be because of the movies and because of the books

92
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,119
Sleeping written forever

93
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,423
This may be the earliest confirmable

94
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,471
Historical event most Americans know about

95
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,775
The defensive

96
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,359
300 Spartans against a million or so Persian

97
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,663
A battle

98
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,967
It's summer described over the eras

99
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,991
For the

100
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,807
Existence of Western Civilization

101
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,111
By the way if those are the stakes

102
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,903
Who side are you rooting for

103
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,279
What was it the Indian leader Mohandas Gandhi supposedly said when someone asked him

104
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,839
What he thought of Western Civilization did he say something like

105
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,631
I think it would be a good idea

106
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,727
Nonetheless the way this story is framed from the get-go

107
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:02,335
Is designed to have you affiliate with one side over the other

108
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,151
One side is like the Plucky little Republic

109
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:08,991
Lakewood Luke Skywalker in Star Wars and their beleaguered and

110
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:14,111
You know they're good and they're under pressure and they're trying to survive against Darth Vader

111
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,903
And the empire

112
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,695
Devil's snuff out all freedom

113
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
Hope and happiness and

114
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,767
You know all those kinds of things

115
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,071
That's the way the ancient

116
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
Story is handled

117
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,911
Water called the Greek and Persian

118
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,263
A moment that has sometimes been

119
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,311
Portrayed in

120
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:37,151
Apocalyptic like terms for what has sometimes been called the West

121
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,687
The part-time christened

122
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,551
So already many in the west are going to feel like

123
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,111
It's a sporting event and where the home team

124
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,903
Why were all homers when it comes to

125
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,439
Greek and Persian Wars unless

126
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
Of course

127
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
You're more like

128
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,791
We're portrayed as the Persians

129
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,583
Then remember this is not just

130
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,655
An ethnic thing this is a values thing

131
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,935
Narrative

132
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,471
Something called the Grand narrative

133
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
Play some

134
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
Greece's fighting

135
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
The things like

136
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,383
Liberty and freedom and democracy and artistic I mean everything

137
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,223
The evil empire isn't evil empire will snuff it all out and make slaves of air

138
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
Coincide

139
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:14,783
That's right

140
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
The story of

141
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,391
Is one of those that is absolute

142
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
Dramatic

143
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,231
Beyond anything you get in early

144
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,839
Because you have a master Storyteller in parting the story to you when I started in

145
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,911
News reporting an editor said to me your job

146
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,703
Is to relate

147
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,495
The facts of the story

148
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,847
The true information and do so in the most compelling way you can

149
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,407
If you imagine the Battle of Thermopylae

150
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,991
That's written by say the scribes of Babylonia

151
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,295
It might sound like this

152
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:54,975
In the fourteenth year the king of lands by the will of Marduk overcame the Spartan Army in a place called the hotkey

153
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:00,607
297 of the enemy were counted the Spartan King went to his destiny

154
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,191
The Babylonians have been writing that way

155
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
Forever

156
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,007
They were great record

157
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
Capers

158
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,311
Things were a little dry

159
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
Now

160
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,175
North of them were the Assyrians a culture that

161
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,479
Existence of alongside the Babylonians

162
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,527
A lot more aggressive

163
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:23,391
And big on the propaganda front and didn't mind showing people's nose in their defeats

164
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,975
And they like to maintain shall we call a muscular foreign policy

165
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,791
There's what sound a little bit more

166
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:34,143
Like Darth Vader's PR firm issuing a press release they would

167
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,703
Describe the Battle of Thermopylae like this

168
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,775
Like a storm I overthrew them

169
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,311
All ice luge

170
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,359
Their King I crucified

171
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,407
Their land I devastated

172
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455
You may notice

173
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,759
There's not a lot of character development

174
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
Fair

175
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,927
Unless making the king of Assyria frightfully terrifying is the development or after

176
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,487
Then the last as I said in this story

177
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,327
Darth Vader's really the only character on the other side that gets flashed out

178
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
Very much

179
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,887
Compare

180
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,983
The sample Babylonian and Assyrian approaches to the story

181
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:15,103
Does something like the description you get from people like Herodotus of halicarnassus

182
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,919
Sometimes called the father of History

183
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
Occasionally called the

184
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
Lies

185
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,807
Writing is history generation after the events at Thermopylae

186
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,343
He talks about

187
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,903
Are the Spartans blocking this road

188
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,183
Understand

189
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,023
Tail that has developed over the hundreds of years afterwards of an event

190
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,631
The people have been adding a few screenwriting touches to since the very beginning

191
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,935
As the story is often told

192
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,239
There's a bunch of Greeks trying to block

193
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,287
The army of the Persians

194
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
I'm coming into Southern Greece

195
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,383
Xerxes the

196
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,943
The crack of Doom named Persian king

197
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,783
The only truly free person in his whole society

198
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
The story would have

199
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,647
Rules all of Asia and so many other lands

200
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,927
He is entitled a

201
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,463
King of Kings

202
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:09,375
All his people of the equivalent of slaves we live or die on his whim and when he orders them to fight the spa

203
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,143
Spartan in this

204
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
Stay obey

205
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
And are whipped

206
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,239
Buy overseers on to the spa

207
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,263
Ears of the Spartan

208
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,663
The Last Stand is it's called at Thermopylae the greatest last and probably in all human history

209
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:27,807
Was not supposed to be the kind of lost and turned out to be there were thousands of Greek soldiers at Thermopylae initially

210
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,855
But eventually became apparent

211
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,903
That it was going to be a death

212
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,951
And so the Spartan King

213
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:40,863
Supposedly sent the other Greeks away and kept a sort of rear guard if you want

214
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,911
Stick with the narrative a rear guard for

215
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,447
Greek and Western freedom

216
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,495
Behind hold off The Purge

217
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
They were other Greeks

218
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,615
Who are involved in the so-called Last Stand at their mop

219
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,639
What is the Spartan

220
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,943
To get the most attention about 300

221
00:09:55,967 --> 00:10:00,063
And again you can understand why as characters they were fascinating in their own time

222
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,391
The Spartans are kind of a cultural experiment

223
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,975
A better way to put it is when you think about all human history together

224
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,303
There's enough law of averages stuff working where you can see

225
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:14,911
All kinds of little human experiments going on in various communities in Sparta

226
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,983
It's whether or not the culture can Infuse

227
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,031
A certain fighting quality

228
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:24,383
Human beings if they grow up a certain way pressured by the culture in certain

229
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:29,503
In a facets that just make them more likely to be extremely nasty and combat

230
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,343
Spartan warrior Sparta its do nothing but fight

231
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,623
There is no other job for

232
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,207
Entire culture seems to be designed from much of what

233
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,231
We know now

234
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,023
To reinforce this

235
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,839
Including a code of laws and behavior

236
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:47,167
Dependent to make the Spartans enough alike so that

237
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,727
Laconic became a term that describes

238
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:54,335
You know most of them they're not a lot of Chatty Spartans in history that culture didn't

239
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
Encouraged

240
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
Listen to the color

241
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,431
Come down from this story

242
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:05,599
The great King Xerxes with his army reported to be a million man so large that it drinks the river is dry

243
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,671
Comes to this road

244
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,487
With this pass that has to be crossed and these

245
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,303
Small group of Greek hoplites guarding it

246
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,119
Xerxes according to Herodotus

247
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,911
Doesn't know what to do

248
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,959
Can't quite believe he would he

249
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,031
Look at the color

250
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,055
Story

251
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,847
According to Herodotus

252
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,151
Xerxes senses Spa

253
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,503
To go up to the Spartan lines and try to figure out what's going on and not

254
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
Get caught

255
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,551
Not only does he have

256
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,343
Get caught but according to Herodotus

257
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:43,743
He reports back to Xerxes and says that the Spartan warriors couldn't have cared less that he was there they were fine with him looking around then care

258
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,071
He said they were doing exercises and combing their hair

259
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,143
Again you have to imagine Clint Eastwood

260
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,447
With long hair and a beard

261
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,239
Right there that be worth

262
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,263
The price of admission right

263
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:00,639
Tall sinewy guy not a big muscle-bound guy doing bodyweight exercise

264
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,919
Xeno calisthenic

265
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
Push ups

266
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
Sit ups

267
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,247
Gymnastics

268
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,271
That's how many

269
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,831
In-app wrapped in the coming a long hair was a Spartan

270
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:13,183
Xerxes cannot get his mind around Herodotus basically says

271
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:18,303
The idea that these people a couple hundred of them we're going to try to take on his reportedly million man army

272
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,607
Three calls in an advisor that he had

273
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,911
He's got a Spartan King

274
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,215
A guy who fell out of favor

275
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,287
And he hooked up with the Persians thinking that if they Conquer All In

276
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
Greece might be good

277
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,383
He's been the advisor to the great king

278
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
He had told

279
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:41,087
The king or earlier about these people and they made fun of him so now Xerxes called him back to report on what the

280
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,647
Spy it said the Spartans were doing

281
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
I'll let

282
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
Herodotus

283
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,255
This ancient screenwriter

Cannabis store

285
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,351
From their writing 2500 years ago

286
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
Quote

287
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,935
Xerxes listen but could not understand

288
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:00,543
Did the lack of the Mohicans were really preparing to kill or be killed

289
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,103
The fight as much as was in their power

290
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,151
CB him to be the height of folly

291
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,687
The action of fool

292
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:11,039
So we sent for demerit oh son of Ariston who was in the camp

293
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,575
Amanda Mariposa ride

294
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,135
Xerxes question him about everything he had been told

295
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,975
Trying to understand the meaning behind what the lack of the mornings were doing

296
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,767
Demirtas answered

297
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,583
You heard what I said about these men before

298
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,887
When we were just sitting out against the Greeks

299
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:30,239
And you made me a laughingstock when you heard my view of how these matters would turn out

300
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,567
But it is my greatest goal to tell the truth in your presence

301
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,615
So hear me now once again

302
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,687
These men have come to fight it for control of the road

303
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,247
And that is really what they are preparing to do

304
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:45,599
Purchase their tradition that they groom their hair whenever they are about to put their lives in danger

305
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,879
No no this

306
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:53,279
If you subjugate these men and those who have remained behind in Sparta there is no other race of human beings that will be

307
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,815
Left to raise their hands against you

308
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,631
For you are now attacking the most noble Kingdom of all the

309
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,167
And the best of men

310
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
What's a merito said

311
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,751
Toronto test rides

312
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,055
Seemed quite incredible to Xerxes

313
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,847
And he asked for a second time

314
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,919
How big could possibly intend to fight his whole Army

315
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,711
Since There were so few of them

316
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,247
Tamara Torres replied

317
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,831
Sire if things do not turn out just as I claim they will

318
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,367
Treat me like a liar

319
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
And quote

320
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,207
July to the

321
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,999
Great king of kings

322
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,303
The achaemenid Persian Empire

323
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,839
Was a capital crime

324
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,887
He was basically saying

325
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,679
If this doesn't turn out exactly like

326
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
I told you it will

327
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
You can kill me

328
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,799
That's pretty darn colorful

329
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,359
But it gets even better

330
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,711
Breaking the Persians was supposed to a send a message

331
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,503
The Spartan life

332
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,295
King Leonidas and say

333
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,831
Basically join us

334
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,927
Making the overlord degrees you'll have more than you ever had before

335
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:59,327
A lot of Nations have done that joining the Persian Empire was not a bad idea sometimes he's basically saying we can make a deal here it'll be worth

336
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
Worth your while

337
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,911
His father Darius was a great deal maker

338
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,495
Xerxes was coming from a position of negotiation here

339
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,567
And the Spartans basically dressed him down more

340
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:15,199
Saying something to the effect if you know you have all this land already but you need to bother us

341
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,735
We'd rather die

342
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:20,575
Freestone anything it was one of those wonderful Spartan moralistic put-downs

343
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
Against

344
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
Q words

345
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
Does possible

346
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,719
And then famously

347
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,791
As recorded by Plutarch 600 years after the event

348
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:33,631
30 sent another Messenger to the Spartan Lions supposedly

349
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,703
Another message for the king of the Spartans

350
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,543
And says to all the men who can hear him you can all go home

351
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,639
All will be forgiven just put down your arm

352
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,455
And then you get the wonderful

353
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
Praise

354
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,015
Alarm

355
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,599
Translated many different ways but it

356
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,391

Come and get it

361
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,815
Having come

Take

363
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,143
You can take them when we're all dead

364
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,191
A lot of the different ways the

365
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,239
Difficult to translate

366
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,007

367
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,823

It's been used

370
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,223
For many causes all throughout history cuz it's such a great

371
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
Dramatic

372
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:25,087
Colorful spit in the face of death line isn't it Clint Eastwood line

373
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,159
Do you feel lucky punk come and take

374
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,999
How do you not stand up in the theater and cheer

375
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,535
When that moment hits

376
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:38,399
Every screenwriters dream to have a scenario like that and if it can be true how wonderful is that

377
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,679
The Greek

378
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,007
Chroniclers who wrote about this stuff

379
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,799
Did not skimp on the drama

380
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:49,663
And it makes it colorful it makes it really make a compelling even 2500 years later

381
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,455
And you give your right arm

382
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,247
To have this kind of stuff

383
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:58,367
Right out of the mouths of the oral historians from all these places that didn't have them

384
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,927
I look black and white because of

385
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,999
The Persian story must be magical author

386
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,791
We don't have that stuff

387
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:11,679
And traditionally difficult for us to imagine that we like to hear

388
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:15,263
From a pro perspective the story of Darth Vader in the Empire

389
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,591
Trout history they weren't always Darth Vader

390
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,127
And some of the

391
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,431
Greatest chroniclers of all time

392
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,711
Have gone to Great Lengths

393
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,503
The show inside

394
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,783
That they may have been on

395
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:27,807
God

396
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,903
If that turns out to be the case

397
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,463
Whose side are you rooting for them

398
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,095
Of course in this time period the Iron Age

399
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,631
Ancient world

400
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,703
And in this area the Mediterranean and the near East

401
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:48,799
You'd have to be a heck of a lot more specific when you start talkin about deity

402
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,591
He's been to just say God

403
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,919
The likely response during that era might have been which God

404
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,759
It was a wild and crazy time

405
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:02,623
The religion in that part of the world and they have a lot of different ones and they ran the gamut from things you might

406
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,927
Understand today too wild and crazy

407
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,719
And everything in between

408
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,767
Most of these

409
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,095
Religious beliefs had a Pantheon of gods a bunch of them

410
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,423
Some of them had a so the dominant leave God but but

411
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,191
Having

412
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,519
You know multiple gods with normal there were groups

413
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,799
Especially one

414
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,847
Known for only having one

415
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,407
And they were the ones that

416
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,431
Put together

417
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,503
With Divine or without Divine help take your pick

418
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
A

419
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,551
Home

420
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,367
A combination of

421
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,903
Catalog of events

422
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,439
Stories

423
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
An accounts

424
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,255
Perspectives

425
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
And

426
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,863
Admonitions and hymns and

427
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,447
It's hard to describe exactly what the old Hebrew Bible is

428
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,751
It's also hard to know when it was written

429
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,775
Are the accounts

430
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,359
From the. Around the time the Persians first appeared on the scene

431
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,151
Legitimate from that.

432
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,687
Biblical A

433
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,967
Experts think they were written light

434
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:06,111
We use Plutarch 500 years after the fact and so does everyone else so

435
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,135
When the

436
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,159
Old

437
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,439
Hebrew Bible

438
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,511
In multiple places talks about the Persians

439
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,047
We should probably at least

440
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,583
Note the attitude

441
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:22,239
And the attitude that the writers whomever they may have been of those Works had toured the Persians especially early on

442
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,519
Wasn't just positive

443
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,799
It was divine

444
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,383
Meanie meaning

445
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,151
Tackle

446
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:29,919
You Farsi

447
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:31,967
Number

448
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
Number

449
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
Wait

450
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,271
Division

451
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,087
My favorite part

452
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,647
The old Hebrew Bible

453
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,767
Which is so full of wonderful stuff you know that the Greeks don't have the market totally Corner tan color

454
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,839
There's just not a ton of stuff from the parts of the world

455
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:54,495
During the time. Represented by the Bible but remember there's a lot of discussion over when various pieces of the Bible

456
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,263
Well written

457
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,895
A lot of this good stuff might have been written in well into the pros. So we've entered into the color era

458
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,967
Because there's so much color on the Book of Daniel has this

459
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:08,319
Scary story spooky stories not like a horror movie but it's a spooky

460
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:13,695
And today you have to have a little CGI help to make it work but it's my favorite scene it's

461
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,743
Out of the Book of Daniel it involves a

462
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,023
Ghostly hair

463
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,607
Writing words on a wall meaning meaning

464
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,631
Tackle

465
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,399
You Farson

466
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:26,239
I have to back up a little bit in the story to set the scene

467
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,287
The king of Babylon

468
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,079
The Bible calls belches

469
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,127
Is having a party

470
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,407
And his body is

471
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,943
What's a concubine

472
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
That's the way the

473
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
Bible books

474
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,551
Probably have to imagine some loud music

475
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,879
You know there's there's booze I mean there

476
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,415
Drinking in a certain point

477
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,719
The king of Babylon want the really nice

478
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,279
In silverware brought in the Big Top

479
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,095
Gold and silver are the ones they took from

480
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,887
Jerusalem when they sacked

481
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,983
The capital of Judah not that long ago cuz that's what the Babylonians is done

482
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,055
Scattered a bunch of Jews everywhere

483
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:07,711
Forced a lot of the Premier families and Craftsman's and Artisans to deport all the way back to Babylon

484
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,015
And destroyed Solomon's Temple

485
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,831
When it comes to PR

486
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:16,159
Is belshazzar guy in the Babylonians are not getting a ton of it

487
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
Positive

488
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
From the Bible

489
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,768
And while he's drinking out of his big

490
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,304
Innaloo Didcot

491
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,352
Hanging out with the concubines

492
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,680
All of a sudden the ghostly hand with a finger

493
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,728
Piers right under the lamp

494
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,800
It starts writing on a wall

495
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,616
Meanie meanie tekel ufarsin

496
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,152
And everybody free

497
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:37,920
Freaks out

498
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,736
My King James version of the Bible

499
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,528
Makes it sound like he

500
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,600
Essentially couldn't control his bowels he was so scared

501
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,416
My eye later more colloquial version just

502
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,696
Sticks to the knees

503
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,464
Shaking

504
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,488
Version

505
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:52,768
Nonetheless

506
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,816
He couldn't figure out what it meant

507
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,376
So the Bible says this

508
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:03,520
Babylonian leader called in all his Sorcerers and necromancers and astrologers

509
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,800
All these people

510
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,848
Are the Wizards that advised

511
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,640
In the high Babylonian King

512
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,456
And part of what makes Babylonian so freaking Wonder

513
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:18,368
Is there a combination of like rational logical hard observational Science and Mathematics and all these kinds of things

514
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,416
Divination

515
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:24,256
You have to imagine a Stephen Hawking type character

516
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:28,096
But a Ouija board is an integral part of how he goes about his business

517
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:33,728
But none of these people the Bible says can explain to belshazzar what the writing mean

518
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:37,312
When someone reminds him that his father use this guy

519
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,336
This

520
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:44,736
Deportee you from Judah after the Babylonian to destroy Jerusalem there and he was here in Babylon

521
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,528
We could bring him in and see if he knows with that

522
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,576
Mostly writing means belshazzar

523
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,880
Grab the guy and brought him in and it was Daniel

524
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,928
It was indeed

525
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
Deportee

526
00:22:54,208 --> 00:23:00,352
Belshazzar gives him the same offer he gave to his soothsayers this and you tell me what this means and in a gold chains and

527
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:03,168
You'll rule the third of the Kingdom all the cat stuff and Daniel says

528
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,448
You keep your gear

529
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,984
Or give them to somebody

530
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,008
I'll tell you what to do

531
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,032
Writing mean

532
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,104
I have a lot of different versions of the Bible

533
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,896
All the Torah all these things in front of me

534
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:16,736
And all the versions are good but the King James Bible with it

535
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,040
The wrath of God Style

536
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,344
If sums it up perfectly

537
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,136
Daniel looks at the

538
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:27,744
Mini mini tickle you Farson then describes the words as meaning

539
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,048
Number number weight division

540
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,328
Define

541
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,352
Dad

542
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,376
As meeting list

543
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,400
From the King James version

544
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,168
Persian quote

545
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,984
This is the interpretation of the thing

546
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:41,056
God hath numbered thy kingdom and finished it

547
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,848
Tell her to wait in the balance

548
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,128
Found wanting

549
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,176
Thy kingdom is divided

550
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,712
I'm given to the medes and The Purge

551
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:49,760
And quote

552
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,320
But pretty color.

553
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,088
Isn't it

554
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,880
And in that version

555
00:23:55,136 --> 00:24:00,000
The king of the Persians a guy named Darius conquered Babylon that night and kills belshazzar

556
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,328
Well none of that's true but that's how the Bible

557
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,168
None the less it's clear from

558
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,704
Yeah that perspective

559
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:15,360
Did the Persians in this story are not going to be the bad guys they're going to be the instrument of God that rectifies things

560
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,200
If God is on anyone's side in that story

561
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,504
He's on the side of the medes and the Persians

562
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,832
Who the heck are these medes and Persians

563
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:29,696
And if they're so good in this story during the time of the Babylonians how did it go from

564
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,464
That

565
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:33,024
To the evil the Greek sea

566
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,328
You know two or three rulers later

567
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,632
I'll let remember Darth Vader

568
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,680
Wasn't always evil

569
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,216
And in fact

570
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,776
The guy who will kick off

571
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
The

572
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:48,640
Persians first real appearance on the world stage

573
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:53,504
Will be a guy that is so beloved by at least the Hebrew God

574
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,552
He will be the only non

575
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,576
2 ever

576
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,368
Proclaimed the Messiah

577
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,952
The person who will get this honor

578
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,744
Is knowing your history

579
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,536
Books by the name of Cyrus II

580
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,328
Horse Iris

581
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,096
The Great

582
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,400
She wanted to make it sound a little bit more like it

583
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,168
Probably Saturday

584
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,192
In Persian you would say

585
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,216
Kourosh

586
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:19,104
He's probably the greatest conqueror in world history up until the time of Alexander

587
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:22,176
He's got some of the best historical

588
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:26,528
Press anybody's likely to get nobody has a bad word to say about the guy

589
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,088
Even the Greeks like him

590
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,136
Xenophon write a whole book

591
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:37,536
Essentially romanticizing Cyrus is the greatest perfect world leader in wins you like to be like him and here's how you could emulate what he

592
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,632
Cyrus becomes part of a

593
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,912
Greek motif

594
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,472
Western tradition will continue for a long time

595
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,264
It portrays the east

596
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,312
As decadent and saw

597
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,592
Interrupt

598
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:58,016
But then how do you explain how some of these great Empires got started will the way the Greeks do it is Cyrus's fantastic

599
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:04,672
And he builds up his entire thing and bequeathed it to the Persians who proceeded to become soft and Rich and lazy and decada

600
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
And ruin

601
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,000
What's a great Cyrus gave them so even the Greeks

602
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,024
Trace Cyrus is this

603
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,792
Describe figure

604
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,840
And yet we know so little about the

605
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:19,520
If you can trust what we know about him and the guy who probably takes the crown from him is greatest conqueror in the world

606
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,312
Up to that point Alexander the Great

607
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,592
It's night and day

608
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,384
Alexander the Great exist

609
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,688
Nepali colorized historical world

610
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,224
A poster rotten

611
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,320
I just world a world where Alexander will bring his own publicist

612
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,344
With him

613
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,696
From place to place so they can record his latest deeds and sayings and doings

614
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,000
Cyrus the Great founds

615
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:43,072
The last great Empire and maybe what you could

616
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,864
Call the black and white era

617
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,400
In the near East

618
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,704
Panera wear

619
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:53,056
We know the majority about the people back then because of things like monologue

620
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
Statue

621
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,616
Send relief

622
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
Carvings

623
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:00,224
And tomb paintings and architecture and ruins

624
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,040
When you do have writing you get

625
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:03,808
Business Rec

626
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,624
Records and proclamations and transactions

627
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:14,304
Some of the best stuff you get from this era are the correspondences the letters between diplomats and governors ruler

628
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,888
But with none of those people are doing is writing

629
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,448
To amuse or entertain anybody

630
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,984
All of the writing from

631
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,288
The black and white. Of human history

632
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,824
Is colder

633
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,920
They all have a purpose Beyond being

634
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,688
Entertain

635
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,480
It might be a religious purpose

636
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,528
Business purpose of governmental purpose

637
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:40,672
Or even two important officials writing each other about in a matters of state and a few personal things creep in

638
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,976
That's very different than writing something

639
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:47,328
To be performed in front of a live audience for their entertainment and enjoy me

640
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,424
I read something historian Michael Grant

641
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,448
10 written about harada

642
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,008
Suggesting that the reason Herodotus

643
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,544
The interesting structures

644
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,824
But he does to his histories

645
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:01,920
Is because it was not meant to be read as much as it was meant to be performed live

646
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,968
Read aloud by Arata

647
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:04,736
Simself

648
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,808
And that the digressions and the tangents in the work

649
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:12,416
Represent things that would have worked much better in a live situation with somebody broadcast

650
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,464
Will and orator

651
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,512
As opposed to use somebody

652
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,792
Writing something to be red

653
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:18,816
By somebody else

654
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
Remotely

655
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,632
If that's the case

656
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,680
And you don't really have the first written

657
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:28,032
Pros history with Hirata tissue of the script for Herodotus is live showing

658
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:34,688
Which would explain a lot considering that if you want to get drama and color and stories before the. Of Herodotus

659
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,736
You're looking at things like The Iliad

660
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,016
By Homer

661
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,064
Or the Epic of Gilgamesh

662
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,392
Mesopotamia history both of which are believed by the way

663
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,720
Tubing stories told for hundreds of years that were finally

664
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,280
Compiled and written down same thing with like a bat

665
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,560
In Scandinavian

666
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,376
Maybe Herodotus is more like the angel

667
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,400
Storytellers

668
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,936
And first meets the eye

669
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:03,104
To give him some credit Herodotus was trying to be a chronicler at the same time he was trying to do the same thing I was told to do a news

670
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:07,968
To relate the facts as best as he understood them in the most compelling way he

671
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,736
He could

672
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,272
So

673
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,296
What you have

674
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,856
I'm here in this ancient story is not so much myth

675
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,928
That wouldn't be fair not just two people like Herodotus

676
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,000
All of the great historians overtime who found all these records

677
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,560
Together like a jigsaw puzzle

678
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,328
8

679
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,608
Viewing of the past

680
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,912
There's always being redone and improved but

681
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,704
Wooden to be existed there if

682
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,264
How different pieces of the puzzle hadn't brought together

683
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,544
But the same time

684
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,824
Well it's not myth

685
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,360
Reject the truth either

686
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,432
Historians

687
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,968
Who spent their whole lives

688
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,992
Separate the

689
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,016
From The Fixx

690
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,040
And works

691
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:43,808
Like Herodotus

692
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,112
Actually laughed out loud when I read

693
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:46,880
Prblms

694
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,184
From Cyrus to Alexander

695
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,024
Rihanna's with the great historians of ancient Persian this book is like

696
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,792
The

697
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:58,144
I made very detailed very specific it's 1200 pages

698
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,424
Enormous

699
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,960
Comprehensive book

700
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,520
And the very first lines in it

701
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:07,872
Are as part of the an opening page where he quotes an artist

702
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,664
Who says quote

703
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,968
And even if it is not true

704
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,016
You need to believe in ancient history

705
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,552
And quote

706
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,112
Does anything better

707
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:18,880
Set up

708
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,416
The dichotomy here

709
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:23,488
And how wonderful that in the 1200 page book

710
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:27,840
It is exhausted as all get-out the very first line from the historian is

711
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:33,984
That may not be true but you have to believe it anyway it's it's wonderful and it sums up the problem with ancient history in that is then

712
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:40,384
You have the feeling that most of what you're reading here is the truth in these events did happen but there's a lot of fiction mix

713
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,736
Extending it's difficult to know what's what and it's difficult to separate one from the other

714
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:52,672
Also difficult to know where to begin the story this is a classic problem anybody has trying to explain something right how do you begin a story of

715
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,976
Cyrus II in the Persians when does that start

716
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:57,792
All history is connected as we know right

717
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,608
It's all a bunch of tumbling dominoes

718
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,632
One event

719
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:05,728
And series of events leads up to other ones and set it all up where is The Logical starting point

720
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,288
I'm terrible at this by the way

721
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:14,688
I did a whole series on the decline and fall of the Roman Republic hours and hours and hours cuz I was trying to find the logical place to start a story about

722
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,712
Cleopatra

723
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,784
Never even got practically to Cleopatra was all

724
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,832
Domino's before then

725
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,904
Herodotus starts

726
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:28,512
With the earliest thing he knows about it it's a miracle he knows about it at all

727
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,816
He begins by talking about the Assyrian

728
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:37,472
He also talked about having multiple versions of this story to Herodotus being Herodotus

729
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,776
He says listen I've heard a lot of different things

730
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,312
Here are my sources

731
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,104
The Story begins boom

732
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,872
And here's what

733
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,664
Quote

734
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:50,528
From here our story demands that we inquire further about Cyrus in the Persians

735
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,600
Who was this man who destroyed the Empire of croesus

736
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,416
And how did the Persians become the leaders of Asia

737
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:02,816
I shall write this account using as my sources certain Persian to do not intend to magnify the Deeds of Cyrus

738
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,608
But rather to tell what really happen

739
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,192
Although I know of three other ways in which the story of Cyrus just told

740
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,472
And quote

741
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,592
Then he begins the story using a phrase that should probably be preceded by a line like

742
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,896
Once Upon a Time

743
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:17,920
Quote

744
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:22,528
The Assyrians ruled Inland Asia for 520 years

745
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:25,088
And the medes were the first to revolt from them

746
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:30,720
It would seem that they prove themselves to be truly courageous Men by fighting the Assyrians for the cause of freedom

747
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,024
Any succeeded in casting off slavery

748
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,048
And we're liberated

749
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,352
Afterwards the other ethnic groups

750
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,144
Read themselves as the Meathead.

751
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,680
And quote

752
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,264
Well the medes need a little explaining

753
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:49,920
Just like after the biblical story of belshazzar's feast when he said that the empire was going to be divided between the medes and the Persians

754
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,736
The medes and the Persians are they related peep

755
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:55,552
The Greeks use the terms interchangeably

756
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,320
They were

757
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,880
You know practically like brothers in the eyes of the Greek

758
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:02,720
When I was growing up they were just starting to change from the brothers sort of

759
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:06,048
Interpretation of maybe saying maybe they were more like first cousins

760
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:12,704
Some of the more recent histories I've been reading maybe you could say we downgrade the relationship even a step further to something like

761
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,496
Second cousins who fought some

762
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:19,872
Historians differ on Wendy's related people's arrived

763
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,712
In the area where they can now play a role in the history of this

764
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,784
You know when close to a geopolitical world

765
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,088
Babylon and Assyria all these places

766
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,136
Historians

767
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:31,904
I think they may have always

768
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,928
We've been there you just did

769
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,952
Didn't hear about them

770
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:38,560
Nevertheless the world upon which they have intruded

771
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,608
Is so old it's

772
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:43,168
Hard for modern people to get our minds around because

773
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:46,752
It's hard for us to imagine something 2500 years ago

774
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:50,080
In a wind Thermopylae is happening now imagine something

775
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,896
From 2500 years before that

776
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:57,248
And that's how old this world is I love the way in the 1940s

777
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,296
Historian a t Olmstead

778
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,320
Tried it

779
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:05,952
Give the reader a sense of how old this world was and how the people who lived in it knew it was old

780
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,768
He starts by talking about

781
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,536
Cyrus

782
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,328
2nd are Cyrus the Great person

783
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,608
Battery takes over Babylon

784
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,376
I'm trying to do

785
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:17,216
Describe how old world is the Babylon represent nieces quote

786
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:21,824
When Cyrus entered Babylon in 539 BCE

787
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,104
The world was old

788
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,176
More significant the world Nuit antiquity

789
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:29,760
It's Scholars who compiled long dynastic list

790
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:34,880
And simple Edition appeared approved the Kings whose monuments were still visible

791
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,696
Head ruled more than four millennium's before

792
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,744
Yet earlier we're other monarchs

793
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,024
Sons of God

794
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,816
Cancel themselves demigod

795
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:47,424
Who's Reigns covered several generations of present-day short-lived men

796
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:50,752
Even these were preceded the Egyptians believed

797
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,288
By the gods themselves

798
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,336
Who helps way through long EI

799
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:59,200
Before the universal flood the Babylonians placed pin Kings

800
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:02,528
The least of whom ruled 18600 years

801
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,832
The greatest 43200g

802
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,880
Other people's he writes

803
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,696
New this flood and told of monarchs

804
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:15,328
Nana cast of Iconium for example who reigned in Pre diluvian * meaning of the

805
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,608
Before the biblical

806
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,144
He continues

807
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,240
The secret history of the Jews extended through 4000 years

808
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:26,848
Modest that's where they're figure is when compared with those of Babylon or Egypt

809
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:32,480
They recorded that one pre diluvian patriarchy almost reached the Millennium Mark before his death

810
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:37,856
Greek poet chanted a legendary history which was counted backward to the time

811
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:41,440
When the genealogies of the heroes ascended to the god

812
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:47,584
Each people in nation each former city-state boasted of its own creation story

813
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,632
With its own local God is creator

814
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
And quote

815
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,008
Avengers on the diagram

816
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,336
That in the 600 and 700 BCE

817
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:04,480
There were quite a few rulers in quite a few of these old countries that became archaeological bus where they would go back and

818
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:10,624
Pay for the excavation of earlier rulers that ruled a thousand fifteen hundred years before them

819
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:13,184
And in Egypt may have dressed

820
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,464
Similarly that's

821
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,280
The continuity of the Egyptian fashion

822
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,328
My favorite

823
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,632
Story that really gives you an idea of the antic

824
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:25,984
If things and how the peoples of this region understood it and new it in a way

825
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,032
That you don't normally think about

826
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,848
Have to do with an archaeological excavation that

827
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:33,408
Happened in late 1800s early 1900

828
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,944
In Modern Day Iran

829
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:35,968
In the city

830
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,528
Through much of the historical period It was called Susie

831
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,832
Sousa is a very old

832
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,112
Ancients

833
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,928
It will be important in the Persian.

834
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,464
After that.

835
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,280
For a very long time of people called the Elam

836
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,096
Resided in Suzhou

837
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,888
And it was in a strata

838
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,192
Where the elamites. Was

839
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,216
Duffy's archaeologist

840
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:00,288
Began to uncover some of the greatest treasures

841
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,848
And Antiquities in near Eastern history

842
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,896
And they didn't belong there

843
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,456
They found for example the famous

844
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,528
Steel or Steely take your pick of Hammurabi

845
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,832
Something that is

846
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:17,952
Huge I mean it's a giant 7ft tall or something heavy big thing

847
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,000
And I find it there

848
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,792
What you doing there

849
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,328
That should be in Babylon

850
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,192
Now if you think the stele of Hammurabi is

851
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:33,824
Circa 1700 BCE or something like that

852
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,640
Archaeologist then find something

853
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,176
It's a good deal older than that

854
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,712
Call the victor

855
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,760
3 stele of narim sin

856
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,296
He was an Acadian

857
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,344
The 2200

858
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,368
BCE

859
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:50,464
So by the time they were making the stele of Hammurabi

860
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,304
The victory stele of narim sin with half a millennia-old

861
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,912
They were other Antiquities that they found to all of them from Elsa

862
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,960
They were

863
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:01,984
The spoiler

864
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:03,776
Balut

865
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,616
Stuff that the elamites took back with them

866
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,408
When they sacked Babylon

867
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,968
And in fact you could tell

868
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:15,296
Because somehow all this stuff was on display

869
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:21,440
I'm below the original inscriptions in the original language explaining what this was

870
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:25,792
Wasn't even might inscription explaining when it was taken from

871
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:28,352
The Babylonians as Loot and spoil

872
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:32,448
And is a piece of memorabilia commemorating the great victory

873
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,520
I keep imagining a bunch of trophies

874
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,288
He's in like a

875
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:39,360
College or university or School trophy case

876
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:43,712
You know commemorating the victories over the air has over your school rivals

877
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,248
The Oaken Bucket

878
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,528
The apple cup

879
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,576
The stele of Hammurabi

880
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
You know that kind of

881
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,928
And by the way it wasn't just

882
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,560
In a cultural artifacts that were taken in the famous Ela might Invasion that happened in the 1100

883
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:02,656
They took the god The Babylon with them they took maardu

884
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,960
With the statue that represented the guy

885
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:11,872
And this is one of my favorite things about ancient history is this idea sometimes that these statues that represented the god

886
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,176
Or somehow connected to the god

887
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,456
Him or herself

888
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:21,344
And sometimes were I mean there were some belief that they were the gods and so you'll see for example the Assyrians

889
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:26,208
In a lot of their were Stone released when they're showing the conquest of some civilization or City

890
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:31,072
They've got the god that their soldiers are carrying away along with all of the loot

891
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:37,984
And it's kind of symbolic when you think about it it's a sign our God stronger than your God after all we've got

892
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,752
Your God

893
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:44,128
And in a lot of these near Eastern civilizations the historians wrote that you can't reestablish

894
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:50,016
Some of these cities until the God has returned so another words with Babylon get sacked in the God has taken away

895
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:53,600
They can't do a big rebuilding thing until the God has brought back

896
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,648
We got your God

897
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,696
I mean talk about rubbing your nose

898
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,488
Any defeat there

899
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:05,632
I mean I was trying to think about what the equivalent would be in the modern world certainly if somebody took over the United States

900
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:09,216
If the elamites have done it they would have the Statue of Liberty

901
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:12,288
In their little Museum there with a little notation underneath

902
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,616
Taking from New York City after we Crush The Americans

903
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,176
I love to eat them

904
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:22,272
Would love to know more about them than one of those people that just not a lot is known

905
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:28,416
What you can say for sure is that they are the great long-standing Urban power

906
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:31,232
In what is now modern-day Iran for thousands of

907
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:37,632
Here's the big contemporaries and the big Power from that region that rival the Babylons in the series

908
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:42,496
He is in the Egypt's there's usually a power in the north to North of Assyria but that changes

909
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:46,592
He could be matani it could be the hittite taking bur to

910
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,872
Nonetheless you have

911
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,920
A relatively stable

912
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:54,272
Geopolitical balance going on for a long time even through the ups and downs

913
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,576
And then that world

914
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,392
Begins to be consciously

915
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,416
Destroyed

916
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,488
And that opens up the door

917
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,792
To an instability

918
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,560
Where

919
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,096
Anything can happen

920
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,400
A shocking things did

921
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,448
It starts with

922
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,496
The absolute

923
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,776
Skyrocketing

924
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,080
By historical standards

925
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,152
The military dominance of the Assyrian

926
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:28,832
And you may be thinking we were just talkin about the medes a minute ago and now we've shipped it over to the Assyrians and what does one have to do with the other

927
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,136
But it's their paths

928
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:31,904
Crossing

929
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:35,232
DeSoto set up the stage for the next.

930
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,280
In Western Asian history

931
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:42,656
The medes will turn out to be one of a couple of David's in this story will take down Goliath

932
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:46,240
In order to understand what a big deal that is

933
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,776
You need to understand

934
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,824
You know how big of a deal Goliath was

935
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,616
In the story the Assyrians are

936
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,431
And they were transformed

937
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,223
In the 700s BCE

938
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:01,087
From one of the great power sometimes the greatest of the great Powers sometimes not

939
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,111
Into the

940
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,647
Regional superpower

941
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,183
And as far as these people

942
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,207
We're concerned

943
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,999
The region was the entire world

944
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:11,327
And this quickly growing

945
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,119
Absolutely

946
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,143
Devastating

947
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,447
New Empire in terms of its military

948
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,471
Abilities

949
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:20,031
Would have been the ones fighting the Greeks

950
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:22,335
And the Spartans at Thermopylae

951
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,127
Have the means

952
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:28,223
And their allies not been able to take down this Goliath and I got news for you

953
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:30,015
I don't think

954
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,575
The Neo Assyrian armies at their height

955
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:37,439
Would have beaten Alexander the Great and his makedonian I'm not sure but I don't think

956
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,487
But I think they Crush

957
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,279
The ancient Greeks of Athens

958
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,047
Sparta

959
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:49,471
And so maybe if the pass of Thermopylae in the greco-persian wars really was a war for Western Civilization

960
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:54,591
We should be thankful that there were people like the medes to take down the people

961
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:58,687
Oh I think would have been the odds-on favorite in any Vegas betting pool

962
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,015
To take down the ancient Greeks in 480 BCE

963
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:06,879
They weren't around in 480 BCE in part because of these people to me to

964
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:10,463
In the 700 when the story really heats up and gets strange

965
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:14,815
Quora people on the periphery of the known universe at the time

966
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,375
Do the Assyrians the medes

967
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:20,959
Are sort of the Eastern edge of the known Galaxy

968
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:25,055
Biondo's midi and tribes with all their petty little

969
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:25,823
Kinglets

970
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:29,663
Are groups of half human half monsters

971
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,967
Call The Omen Monday

972
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:36,831
In the Syrian annals Eagleman Mondo by the way in Old Acadian term

973
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:39,903
Demeans The Horde from who-knows-where

974
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,951
It's believed

975
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,487
At this refers

976
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,023
2D nomadic

977
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:51,679
Cultural forebears of the Huns in the Turks and the Mongols and all those people

978
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:57,311
Infected medes and the Persians were supposed to be able to speak

979
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,359
To the Lumen Monda

980
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,151
Without the use of Translate

981
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,967
How'd you like to be related enough

982
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,015
Two people known as the

983
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,319
Horde from who-knows-where

984
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:11,903
To be able to understand their language without anybody helping

985
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,695
None the less

986
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:17,791
It's in this. Right around 7:50 BCE

987
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,375
Where you get a sort of an unusual happening in ancient

988
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,167
History where a lot seems to happen

989
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,959
In a relatively short period

990
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:25,727
Free time

991
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:30,335
Because it's ancient history you get these long stretches where it seems like very little changes

992
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,895
In 7:45 BCE

993
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:36,479
With the arrival of a new Assyrian King a guy named tiglath

994
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,247
Pily's Earth

995
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,015
The 3rd

996
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,831
Syria begins to go on this

997
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:44,415
Sprint maybe you could call it a historical Sprint

998
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:48,767
That will last until about 6:15 6:12 BCE

999
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,559
And we'll be like

1000
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,351
Maybe you could say the last

1001
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,143
Burst of rocket fuel

1002
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:57,471
Historical era of that ancient world

1003
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,519
About to give away to the air of the

1004
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:02,079
The Greeks and classical Antiquity and all that kind of stuff

1005
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:06,431
And Rockets it to the heights where the Assyrian army for example

1006
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:09,759
In say 700 BCE

1007
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:13,855
Are the equivalent of like the Roman Empire's armies if they're high

1008
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,135
For their error

1009
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,695
The Assyrians will

1010
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,231
Systemic

1011
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
Smash

1012
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,791
The other great powers

1013
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:26,655
In that area and it's difficult by the way they're powerful they're sophisticated

1014
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,703
They have a lot of money some of these places

1015
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,983
The Assyrians

1016
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:32,799
Often have to face not single States

1017
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,079
Coalition

1018
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,103
Estate

1019
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:40,735
Big allies that alive simply to deal with the Assyrians and they lose most of the time anyway

1020
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:45,855
I'll try not to geek out on the Army too much but it's the gold standard for the era

1021
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:49,951
Richard Gabriel and Karen Metz in their book from Sumer to Rome

1022
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:56,607
Describe it in a nutshell in terms of just giving you a mental picture of the capabilities of an army

1023
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,375
From this era

1024
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:00,959
End of the so-called biblical era when I was growing up there right quote

1025
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:04,799
The Assyrian army of the 8th Century BCE

1026
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:08,895
What's comprised of at least a hundred and fifty thousand to two hundred thousand men

1027
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:13,247
And was the largest standing military force at the Middle East and witness to this time

1028
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,807
An Assyrian combat field Army

1029
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:18,367
Numbered approximately 50000 men

1030
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:21,439
With various mixes of infantry chariots and cavalry

1031
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:27,839
In modern times the size of an Assyrian field Army was equal to 5 modern heavy American Division

1032
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,655
Oromo State Soviet field division

1033
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:35,519
Win a raid for battle the Army took up an area of 2500 yards across

1034
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,055
And a hundred yards deep

1035
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:41,407
The Assyrian army was also the first Army to be entirely equipped with iron weapons

1036
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:42,943
And quote

1037
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,991
Boy doesn't that's so V

1038
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,271
Reference date me

1039
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,551
Nonetheless

1040
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:51,903
You get an idea that we're talkin about armies that were exponentially larger

1041
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,695
Then in the recent past

1042
00:46:55,231 --> 00:47:01,375
In the Bronze Age you know now room scene was putting like 6,000 guys into the field and thinking he had a lot of men

1043
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:05,215
The Assyrians have multiple divisions of 50000 each

1044
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:11,615
They will smash the power of the Mountain State of you are too at one point during this

1045
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,663
. that's where Modern Armenia is

1046
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:18,271
They will several times have to deal with Babylon

1047
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,831
Another one of their great Kings

1048
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,623
Sennacherib take care of that

1049
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:27,487
And then they just have to do it again and again Babylon is a thorn in the side perpetually of the Siri

1050
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:32,863
And the elamites always get in trouble with the Assyrians today we support the Babylonians cuz after all

1051
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:36,447
All of them would like to see the Assyrians cut down to size

1052
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,007
Eventually the Assyrians will cut

1053
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,823
The elamites down to size 2

1054
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,359
One of the most

1055
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:46,687
Horrifying of all the Assyrian reliefs

1056
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:49,503
And you know there's a lot of them in historians

1057
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,551
Don't always know how to classify them

1058
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,343
You can't tell if

1059
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,367
You want to say

1060
00:47:54,623 --> 00:48:00,767
That these are real scenes that they're showing when you see these carvings which were probably painted at one time or often

1061
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:03,583
Displayed in the waiting room before you got to see the king

1062
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:09,983
What are you looking at while you're cooling your heels waiting to see the Assyrian King the things he did to the people like you

1063
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,775
Who may be turned against him

1064
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,823
Sometimes historians think

1065
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,359
If they're taking a sadistic

1066
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,407
Sort of cruel loving this

1067
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:21,759
Sometimes it's meant to be terrifying and they enjoy that Saddam Hussein Style

1068
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:24,063
Sometimes they think of it as a convention

1069
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,623
In the same way the Egyptians always seem to show them

1070
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:33,023
Wearing certain kinds of clothing whether or not they did anymore was artistic convention showing people getting their heads lopped off

1071
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:33,791
Is just

1072
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:36,863
You know if you go to Assyria you expect to see BC ringtones

1073
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:37,887
Ted Kennedy

1074
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:38,911
That's who we are

1075
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:45,055
Nonetheless one of my favorite Assyrian relief shows the aftermath

1076
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:50,175
Of the era where the Assyrians finally decided to deal with the ongoing elamites

1077
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:50,943
Problem

1078
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:57,599
It shows the Assyrian King ashurbanipal reclining on one of those wonderful Oriental near Eastern

1079
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:00,671
New kinds of things that they used to lay down on the couch

1080
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:05,791
What do we have somebody feed you grapes or something and he's sitting there drinking wine or eating food

1081
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:12,447
In a luxuriously relaxing soda paste in a garden with little palm trees if I recall it correctly and is a woman

1082
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,215
In there with him

1083
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,775
And you get the feeling like he in that woman are together

1084
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,799
And then right

1085
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:21,407
Over nearby up on the side of a wall or poster pillar

1086
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:22,943
Is a head

1087
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,527
The head of the elamites

1088
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:28,831
Pickled

1089
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,111
Or otherwise

1090
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:34,975
And that woman who you think maybe is ashurbanipal zwei for maybe

1091
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,511
Royal concubine

1092
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,815
Some historians think is the wife

1093
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,095
Of that elamites

1094
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,423
She having to be there with the person who killed him

1095
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,471
And have him looking on

1096
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:49,055
Anybody list the whole time the Assyrians just had this wonderful

1097
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:52,895
Historical reputation for something that once again is Cinematic

1098
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,991
Now it's not color it's not like Herodotus and all that we don't have it in color

1099
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,271
But it's a really

1100
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,575
Scary black and white horror film

1101
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,135
If you're on the receiving end

1102
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,671
I'm a Syrian violin

1103
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:08,511
I should point out that you know focusing so much on geopolitics

1104
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:14,911
And a Syrian foreign policy May Minnesota color the picture in a very negative way because to live in in the syrians

1105
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,959
City during this time period might have been awesome

1106
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:23,615
Vitamin the height of civilization and it was it was a society that was in some respects one of the most literate at all

1107
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:26,687
Time. It was wealthy it was cultured

1108
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:31,807
How you been great to live in the Siri you just didn't want to be on the wrong end of Assyrian for Impala

1109
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,903
I'm about 7:45 BCE

1110
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:39,743
To about the you know early 600 a lot of people were

1111
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:44,095
And very few people came away doing very well after that they

1112
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:47,935
Systemically batter down the structures of this region now

1113
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:54,591
Battering down the structures of the region were very important if you wanted to kind of make it aminia Bowl 2

1114
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:58,175
Being incorporated into a single political entity like an Empire

1115
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:02,271
Everybody is individualistic nature had to be curtailed somewhat

1116
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,063
The problem will come

1117
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:07,903
When the unifying force that did this disappears

1118
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:11,487
To get an idea by the way of how many peoples were talking about

1119
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:16,607
But he has a wonderful way to sort of contradict the earlier way the story was told

1120
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,423
Which was focusing on people's ethnicity

1121
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,191
You say

1122
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,983
You know the Assyrians were submitted

1123
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:22,751
And the

1124
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,823
Iranian people's leave medes and the Persians were

1125
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,615
Indo-European and all that

1126
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:33,247
Is to realize when you deal with a place that is so filled with different ethnic groups

1127
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:35,295
Intermarrying living together

1128
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:39,647
It doesn't take very long for peoples languages to change which used to be the way

1129
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,439
We charged who was whom

1130
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,231
It also means that

1131
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:47,583
The job of any unifying force that wants to turn all these different

1132
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,119
Freedom-loving groups

1133
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,679
Into a single political entity is huge

1134
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:58,079
History will Durant tries to little lay the foundation and then basically says you just so you know

1135
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:03,711
Look at how many people there are in this part of the world and they're all interacting all the time and their intermarrying in them

1136
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:05,503
It's an ethnic Melting Pot

1137
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,527
He says quote

1138
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,599
Do a distance and yet Discerning Eye

1139
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:13,951
The near East in the days of nebuchadrezzar would have seemed like an ocean

1140
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:18,303
In which vast swarms of human beings moved about in turmoil

1141
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,351
Forming and dissolving groups

1142
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:26,495
Enslaving or being enslaved eating or being eaten killing or getting killed endlessly

1143
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:29,311
Behind and around the great Empires

1144
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,079
Egypt

1145
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:32,639
Babylonia Assyria and Persia

1146
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:36,735
Flower this medley of half Nomad have settled tribes

1147
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,295
Canarians collegians

1148
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,343
Cappadocians bithynian

1149
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,367
Ashkanian

1150
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,391
Messenians

1151
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,415
Nyan Nyan

1152
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:48,511
Carrion's like kean's pamplin's pisidian lucky Nyan

1153
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:54,911
Philistines amorites Canaanites edomites ammonites moabites and a hundred other people's Each of which

1154
00:52:55,167 --> 00:53:01,311
Spelled itself the center of geography and history and would have marveled at the ignorant Prejudice of his story and who would win

1155
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,591
Induce them to a paragraph

1156
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,127
And quote

1157
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,943
I got a bunch of History to talk about

1158
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:10,271
Difficult the task is to meld all these individual list

1159
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,807
Different peoples into

1160
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:15,647
A single political entity Chester star writing in the middle 1960s

1161
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,951
Put it this way as he tries to sort of

1162
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,975
Counterbalance

1163
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:23,839
This ruthless image the Assyrians have with the job they're trying to do when he writes quote

1164
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,143
This ruthless Spirit perhaps

1165
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:29,727
Proves not so much that the Assyrians were inhuman monsters

1166
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:33,823
As it shows the sternness required to break and harness the near East

1167
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:39,455
Assyrian. Was in reality one of the greatest turning point in the Civilized history of the area

1168
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:42,527
And in this fact must be sought the justification

1169
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,575
Are the booty in the tribute of Empire

1170
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,367
If Empire needs justify

1171
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,135
Vacation

1172
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:53,535
Politically such Kings is tiglath-pileser the third took decisive steps towards uniting the fertile

1173
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:59,935
Crescent the next great Empire the Persian reaped the benefit and so could afford to exercise its way

1174
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,471
Hey in a more lenient Style

1175
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:02,751
And quote

1176
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:06,079
This is actually key to one of the things we've been talking about

1177
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,895
The fact that even though the Greeks portrayed

1178
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:12,223
One of the Persians a suit of Darth Vader and the empire

1179
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:18,111
History outside the Greeks knew them as a comparatively tolerant Empire

1180
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,903
Comparatively lenient

1181
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,207
Who were they being compared to

1182
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,487
The Assyrian

1183
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:27,839
But it may have taken with the Assyrians did

1184
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:30,399
To make an Empire that was docile enough

1185
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:33,983
For the Persians to treat them that way and have it all work out

1186
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:38,847
I should also point out that there are quite a few historians

1187
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:39,871
Suggest

1188
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:42,943
Did the Assyrians have another Legacy

1189
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,223
Potentially

1190
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,247
Credit them

1191
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,551
A much more noble

1192
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:50,367
One by the way despite the horrific

1193
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,927
Marketing and the frightful branding

1194
00:54:54,463 --> 00:55:00,607
Perhaps you might look at them during this time. Depending on your Viewpoint in more of a Captain America

1195
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,887
Style roll

1196
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,167
Fending off

1197
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,959
The hordes of barbarism

1198
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:06,239
Whomping

1199
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:08,543
The Civilized world with their

1200
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:10,847
You know Murder and robbery

1201
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:16,223
Because in the last years of the 700 BCE

1202
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,271
The Omen monitor

1203
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,039
Breakthrough

1204
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,855
And when they do

1205
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:26,207
It will take the greatest military of that age

1206
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:32,863
To be able to resist and go up against what is a revolutionary military channel

1207
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,703
The first peoples in history probably

1208
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:39,007
Who had to try to figure out how you die

1209
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:39,775
Defeated Army

1210
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,847
Where everyone in the Army is mounted on horse

1211
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,407
Now

1212
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:48,223
Our modern era is so different than

1213
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,271
How the Dynamics of

1214
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:53,343
Warfare work for most of human history that it's sometimes

1215
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:56,415
Is it difficult to reintroduce the more obvious thing

1216
00:55:57,183 --> 00:56:02,047
Tissot to click a light bulb on in your head and remind you oh yeah we're talking about something this basic for exam

1217
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:05,375
I cannot love these military Revolution.

1218
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:08,447
Can you imagine what it be what it must have been like when the first

1219
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,215
Chariot

1220
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,263
Attacked the first

1221
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:14,079
In a settled civilizations out there

1222
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:16,127
In the first time in army

1223
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:19,199
It was composed entirely of people walking

1224
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:22,527
Had to deal with something moving at the speed of a horse

1225
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:28,671
And by the way the way that they usually function was that the person inside the Cherry had a very powerful

1226
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:33,023
And shot arrows at people and never really tried to

1227
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:38,399
No contact them at all until they were broken and running away so you couldn't catch him and they move faster than you did

1228
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,423
And it changed Warfare

1229
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:43,007
And sometimes it's funny by the way to read some of the

1230
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:47,103
Did the records that have been kept that you have from some of these very early Chariot Society

1231
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:53,759
And you realize how little they know about horses because people who knew anything about horses are these really high paid in

1232
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:56,319
Important individuals and they have this hidden knowledge about

1233
00:56:56,831 --> 00:57:02,975
And here's how you take care of the feet of a horse and he fears what you do if they get bloated mean at things that today Brazilians of people know

1234
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:05,279
Acton this was like privileged information Heights

1235
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:06,559
Right

1236
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,631
And the Horse Inn

1237
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,399
The

1238
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:16,799
Settled societies the Egypt The Babylon and Assyria at first you can see that they that they don't know how to deal with

1239
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:19,871
And there are wonderful little figurines and what

1240
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:20,639
Not showing

1241
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,943
In the Egyptian movies like an Egyptian Scout

1242
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,711
Out during

1243
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:30,111
Maybe the first two hundred years or something that the Egyptians were really trying to use horses and he's sitting way back over the tale of

1244
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,903
The horse like he hasn't even figured out

1245
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,183
But that's not the right spot

1246
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:33,951
Decision

1247
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:37,279
But we take it for granted that this is an obvious thing

1248
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:39,071
You might not have been

1249
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:42,655
About 1000 BCE Cavalry first

1250
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,423
Appears

1251
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,727
And it generally appears

1252
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:52,895
In in in in in a way that once again makes you think that these people are not very comfortable riding and

1253
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:56,223
Remember there are no Saddles there are no Spurs there are no stirrups

1254
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:58,527
I mean there's a lot of

1255
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,295
Mac

1256
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:01,087
To knowing what you're doing here

1257
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,671
And remember also that riding horses can be

1258
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:06,207
Dangerous and fatal

1259
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:11,327
If you're not used to it right in none of these people are growing up doing a whole lot of horse riding

1260
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:17,727
About 900 BCE you can see carving showing Assyrian Cavalry which is probably

1261
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,751
If you think about it

1262
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:22,079
In a cutting-edge for the time. For the subtle civilizations

1263
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:25,407
And they send the Cavalry Riders out in pairs

1264
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:32,063
Because one guy has to hold the reins for The Other Guys horse when the other guy decides he's going to shoot or anything

1265
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:36,671
In other words they don't even feel comfortable enough to shoot and ride

1266
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,439
You know

1267
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:42,815
Independently you got to have someone there to hold the horse when you do it another word you can watch the evolution right

1268
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:46,143
It's different when the armies from the Middle East

1269
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,423
The ancient near East

1270
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:50,495
First run into the step troops that will make up

1271
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,799
One of the dominant important

1272
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:56,383
Tribal areas in world history for

1273
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:59,455
Almost at 4 I mean it's only the last couple hundred years

1274
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:01,759
That the Eurasian steppe

1275
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:05,087
Part of which you would refer to a central Asia today

1276
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,879
Kazakhstan Keurig

1277
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,159
Yes and those kind of places

1278
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:12,255
Show me the last couple hundred years those places have not been massively relevant to

1279
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,535
You know what's going on

1280
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:17,375
I was reading a book not that long ago that was going into all of the things that

1281
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,703
China and Russia of the 1700

1282
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:23,263
See he's only a couple hundred years ago

1283
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:25,567
All the things that they had to do to deal with it

1284
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:26,335
Tribes

1285
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:28,639
On the step and it's crazy because

1286
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:32,991
You know when you look at history you become very accustomed to watching

1287
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:35,807
The so-called civilized societies

1288
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:41,695
Just rolling over tribal peoples you know to certain point in history once once the momentum gets going

1289
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:46,559
And you have like Julius Caesar in Roman armies just rolling over Celtic Society

1290
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:52,959
You're already prepared to get to the part where the colonial Europeans going to show up on these Distant Shores and run into people

1291
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,775
People with wooden clubs and bows and arrows when you got gun

1292
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:57,823
Conclusion write

1293
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,639
But you look at the step

1294
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:06,783
And you see the one place in history where for a number of different reasons the odds are much more equal

1295
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:09,087
Between settled and tribal people

1296
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:10,879
First of all

1297
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:16,255
It's likely that the odds in terms of fighting Power in terms of Manpower was probably pretty close

1298
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,815
The settled societies had a lot more people

1299
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,863
But a lot of them weren't Fighters the

1300
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,399
Tribal societies

1301
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,703
Usually had most of their male people

1302
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,727
As Fighters

1303
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:29,055
And some females by the way

1304
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,127
The weapons technology was

1305
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:36,735
Probably comprable that the bows used by the step people are famously

1306
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,527
Some of the best ever made

1307
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:44,671
But it would have been other things that the settled so-called settled societies had in their favor so probably wash their butt imagine

1308
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:46,719
Imagine the Native Americans

1309
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:49,791
With a rough parody in fighting men

1310
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:56,191
And a rough parody and weapons technology what would the Native Americans have done to the settlers then

1311
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:59,007
Who knows but at least it's a fair fight

1312
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,287
Add to that

1313
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:06,431
The geographic conditions in the distance right this is a harsh environment the step sometimes if you're not adapted to it

1314
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:10,271
And it's a long way from point A to point B no matter where you're going

1315
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:14,367
And you had a part of the world that was protected by steppe peoples

1316
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,647
For millennia

1317
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,975
Were they maintained their way of life

1318
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:24,095
And where shall we say relevant relevant is a good non bias in any direction where relevant

1319
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:26,655
To the societies of world powers around them

1320
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:28,959
And we've known them forever right we've seen

1321
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:32,543
Wave after wave of these people come forward from the magyars

1322
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,335
The church to the Honda to the Mongols

1323
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:40,223
This is the first. In recorded history where these people break through and then someone's there to

1324
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,247
Record

1325
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:48,927
There's always been a historical school of thought the Chariot invasions from Central Asia long before this.

1326
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:51,487
Earlier versions of these kinds of invasions

1327
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,791
But this is the first one recorded

1328
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:55,327
Will you get to see

1329
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,887
You know the kinds of Step arm usually

1330
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:58,911
Respect for the next

1331
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,447
2000 years

1332
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:02,239
Mounted on horseback

1333
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:09,151
With people who are you know as we said about the Spartans that they were sort of a laboratory experiment to see if a culture

1334
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:10,687
Circuitry in a super soldier

1335
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:14,527
The steppe societies are kind of a laboratory Experiment 2

1336
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:17,599
If you put people on Horseback from the time when they are

1337
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:18,367
Toddlers

1338
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:21,439
And put a bow in their hand from not much later

1339
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:27,839
And have them ride all the time and do everything on Horseback and use those bows continually and developed a

1340
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:31,423
Tactics where they never really come into contact with people that don't want to come down

1341
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,215
What do you end up with

1342
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:37,567
Then the answer is you end up with a weapon system

1343
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,871
That was so effective

1344
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:47,039
The even after guns were developed modern societies were having a tough time pardon the pun corralling me

1345
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:47,807
These people

1346
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:50,623
Even up until relatively modern times

1347
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:55,999
Now when you think about how long that is people trying to contend

1348
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,279
With the step people

1349
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:01,375
Think about how much admiration we should have with the first people who had to try

1350
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:03,935
With no track record of experience

1351
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:09,055
The Assyrians would develop a kind of a broad policy of dealing with these

1352
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:11,359
Tribal step people that resembles

1353
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:15,711
What very sophisticated people who dealt with him for a very long time came up with

1354
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:21,087
With the Chinese and the byzantines for example would use a mix of diplomacy intermarriage

1355
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,367
Warfare

1356
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,391
And

1357
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:26,719
Keeping the tribes divided and fighting amongst themselves

1358
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:31,327
New series did all this stuff do they use some of these people as allies sometimes it have

1359
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,607
Mercenaries were

1360
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:37,727
Do people from these tribes the tribes like the canary in the Skippy in the various socotra

1361
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,007
Jobs in the mass of GD they have

1362
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:40,543
Tribal

1363
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:41,567
Confederation

1364
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:42,847
M1 is

1365
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:45,919
Scarier than the next and if you're one of those settled Society people

1366
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:51,551
Barbarians in air quotes always scared you mirror just something scary to settle people about

1367
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:53,599
Do people like the Celts for example

1368
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,647
Skinny jeans are no different

1369
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:00,255
Coventry steppe peoples are no different there headhunters for example famously will

1370
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,279
Drink

1371
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,047
From

1372
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:05,375
The skulls of their dead enemies make cups out of them

1373
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:06,911
And if you want it

1374
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:10,751
See how the wonderful continuity of Step culture sometime ago they were doing this in

1375
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:16,895
In ancient times and they were doing this up until relatively in the Mongol type history the drinking cups golfing

1376
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,431
A perennial favorite

1377
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,991
But it's just a cultural thing

1378
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:24,319
Ride me the Assyrians are hanging enemies heads on walls

1379
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:26,879
So that they can watch their in a wife have

1380
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:30,719
Relations with the Assyrian King who killed them I mean everybody's got their thing

1381
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,487
Right

1382
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,023
Same time

1383
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:35,327
These people are are scary

1384
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,863
They're effective

1385
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:37,887
They

1386
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:44,543
Are entirely mounted which means they have amazing challenges to the militaries of the day cuz remember you move at the speed of your

1387
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:47,359
Slowest person if you have an entire Army mounted

1388
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,895
The entire Army moves at the

1389
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:49,663
Speed of a horse

1390
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,967
Peter huge challenges in the Assyrians

1391
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:55,551
Managed to ward off the worst of the attacks in the sense

1392
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:58,879
You know you can make a case that they protected this entire

1393
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:00,927
Area of civilization

1394
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,463
From marauding

1395
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:08,863
Scary people who were not going to leave it intact and you know this because there were several Invasion that do brakes

1396
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:11,167
There's a horde

1397
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,191
Ascidians

1398
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:18,591
It will rape and pillage all the way down to Egypt before the Egyptians either buy them off or militarily turn them back

1399
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:21,663
Can they go bouncing around the region like a snooker ball

1400
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:27,039
The fact that in a lot of these step Army's every single person was mounted

1401
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,599
Was also revolutionary and

1402
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,367
Huge

1403
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,927
In the armies of the day

1404
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:35,743
If you were lucky and 15 or 20% of their

1405
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:36,511
Force mount

1406
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,279
Did sometimes

1407
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,303
Quite a bit less

1408
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:41,119
You still move at the speed of your slowest troops

1409
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:46,495
If you don't if you break the Cavalry off so you can operate independently you'll have a

1410
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:48,031
Nice small group of cavalry

1411
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:50,591
It gets overwhelmed by an entirely mounted Force

1412
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:51,359
Turn on the lights

1413
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:58,015
A10 army with infantry moves at the speed of inventory these armies that the settled Societies in this geopolitical round and

1414
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,551
Sunshine are trying to deal with

1415
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:01,087
Speed of a horse

1416
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:03,135
Strategically on the map

1417
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:06,207
That's a devastating thing to try to counter

1418
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:09,279
The fact that the Assyrians could is a testimony to how great

1419
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:11,839
The greatest military the world has ever seen was

1420
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:13,375
And how well LED

1421
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:17,215
You could see how big the challenge

1422
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,007
705 BCE

1423
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:21,567
Sargon II arguably the greatest

1424
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:23,103
King of Syria ever had

1425
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:25,663
Well as an elderly man

1426
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:28,991
Leave the Assyrian army in person

1427
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:31,295
Up to Modern

1428
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,575
Southeastern

1429
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:33,855
Turkey near the border

1430
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,903
Neo hittite area

1431
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,183
Call to ball

1432
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:41,279
And probably fighting in conjunction with some of these

1433
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,071
Neo hittite cities

1434
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,863
Eurasian steppes

1435
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,143
Trips to Marion

1436
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,727
And Sargon II

1437
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:50,751
Will disappear

1438
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:52,543
With the army

1439
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,359
The body will never be

1440
01:06:56,383 --> 01:07:00,479
That is a very rare event when the body is not recover the assumption is that nobody

1441
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:05,343
Because one of the last things you will do is grab the king's body

1442
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,879
B&M Spirited Away

1443
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:08,671
It's like saving the flag

1444
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,951
* 10

1445
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:12,511
Dubina Gyptian King 2

1446
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,279
Famously

1447
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:19,167
Will stay on the battlefield and they they they end up getting it later and mummifying

1448
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,447
A body that's been

1449
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:23,263
The mutilated it on the battlefield for a few weeks

1450
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,543
Can you can still look at the

1451
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,079
Mommy today and see

1452
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:26,847
Oh wow

1453
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:28,895
Didn't get them for a while

1454
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:35,295
Sargon II will never be found I've often thought it's not a coincidence his son's Tanaka read never

1455
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,063
Actually

1456
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:36,831
Letter

1457
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,111
Forcing person when he was

1458
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:41,695
He left that to the generals is very important things in Nineveh that need taking care of

1459
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,231
Newsstand

1460
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,023
Anyone who could do that

1461
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:48,607
Two in the Syrian Army at the height of the series Power

1462
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,655
Is formidable indeed

1463
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:54,495
Now you know Siri could protect some of this region they couldn't protect

1464
01:07:55,519 --> 01:08:00,639
And some of these tribes filtered down to the area where the people were ostensibly talking about here are

1465
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:04,735
The medes the Persians the elamites the Zagros Mountains Iran

1466
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,807
The peoples in this region are about

1467
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,831
To go through

1468
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:12,415
A one-two punch that will change them for a

1469
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:16,511
The second of these punches will be delivered by the Assyrians

1470
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,351
Surprise surprise there throwing punches everywhere why shouldn't this read

1471
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:21,631
Get to

1472
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:23,679
The first will be delivered by these steps

1473
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:24,703
Belize tribes

1474
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:26,239
Sumerians

1475
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,263
Skip the end

1476
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:32,639
Who will at a certain point I said filtered I thought that was a nice ambiguous way

1477
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:37,503
When you don't really know what happened but the traditional idea is that the Skippy Inns in the khmerian

1478
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:38,527
Attacked

1479
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,319
Broken to assaulted

1480
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,087
Dominis

1481
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,879
In a giant invasion

1482
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:44,159
There's even a year

1483
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:44,927
Associated with

1484
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,719
At 6:53 BCE

1485
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:49,535
Which if you think about it like 50 years after

1486
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:51,583
Sargon II dies

1487
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:56,191
You up into ball right at about 55 60 years since these

1488
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:58,495
Horse people first appeared

1489
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:01,567
And they're still managing to totally disrupt

1490
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,871
In a huge areas of this

1491
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:07,967
Geopolitical ecosystem only use that word from now on we all know what I mean right

1492
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:13,855
Filtered is a good word though because it also allows room for Theory

1493
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:17,695
Where Warfare should have doesn't dominate the reasoning behind

1494
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:22,047
Why all of a sudden all these Central Asian tribes moved into this part of the Run

1495
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:29,727
One of the things that's really changed since I first started studying the story is the concept that historians have about who these midi in the world

1496
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,007
What kind of state they had

1497
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:33,055
When I was growing up the history is all made it

1498
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:33,823
Sound like

1499
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:35,615
The medes were like the Babylonians

1500
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:41,503
Any Assyrians by this time a centralized state with cities and and governance of bureaucracies and all that

1501
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:45,087
Historians today and you know I'm not one I just read the best

1502
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:51,487
They make it sound much more like the current state of theory is that these means are much more tribal

1503
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,279
Then we had previously assumed

1504
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:59,679
And if so might not be that much different than these Skippy and zakim Aryans coming into their area

1505
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,727
To be much more like

1506
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:06,591
A tribal relationship would have received the medes and the Persians were second cousins who fought sometimes

1507
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:09,407
Easter peoples are like 3rd cousins who fight a lot

1508
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:13,759
Remember they could allegedly speak to each other

1509
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,551
There without the use of a translator

1510
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:17,087
When you are that

1511
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,879
Close to another people

1512
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:22,719
What appears to be a conquest from outside might be much more like

1513
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:24,767
Dynastic marriage

1514
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:31,423
Or someone having to change their Alliance status or becoming a vassal of someone else are having to pay tribute

1515
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:35,775
Herodotus might see all of that stuff is a version of slavery

1516
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:39,615
But when he calls it slavery we might be picturing something else entirely

1517
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:42,687
Herodotus says that the

1518
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:45,759
Domination of the medes last

1519
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,295
28 years

1520
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,343
An interesting little

1521
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,135
Tidbit

1522
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,927
That might confirm what he says is

1523
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:59,327
During that time. The Assyrians in the Babylonians who keep records and who know and mentioned the medes from time to time

1524
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:02,399
Start calling everyone who lives in that whole region

1525
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,447
The Omen Mondo

1526
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:08,543
And Reese's origami among others suggest that this bite

1527
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:09,311
Mean

1528
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:12,895
The entire area has just been sort of overwhelmed

1529
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:15,711
And if you can't tell one tribe from another without

1530
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:16,735
Scorecard

1531
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:21,855
Herodotus if you want to go with this tells one of his really

1532
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,903
Fun stories I'll me know if

1533
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,183
Like me

1534
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:29,023
About how the medes eventually threw off

1535
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:31,327
The nomadic eoq know if that was

1536
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,887
Suppressing them and he tells a story about how

1537
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:36,959
They invited the Skippy and leaders to a banquet

1538
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,775
And then got them all drunk

1539
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:43,871
Can the money were also inebriated they could hardly stand they went in and killed them all

1540
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:47,199
I guess you could call that

1541
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:51,551
Your decapitating the enemy leadership literally

1542
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:56,671
Or maybe the tactic is drunken Mass homicide whatever you want to call it

1543
01:11:56,927 --> 01:12:03,071
It seems like a motif another one of these recurring sorts of things you see all throughout history in the writing and and one

1544
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:03,839
What are those

1545
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:10,495
One of those aspects of the story that often times professional historians will discount because after all we see this all the time this

1546
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:13,567
Sounds just like blah blah blah and they're almost always right

1547
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:19,967
Here's the weird part though this is something that you actually see in history confirm Ubly

1548
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:25,087
The relationship between using alcohol as some sort of a trap

1549
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:31,999
To ensnare other people who then become vulnerable when we seen this in recorded history like not that long ago

1550
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:36,095
Native American tribes had this treatment done to them

1551
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:37,631
Sometimes multiple times

1552
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:41,983
In other words what might look in this case like a recurring motif

1553
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:45,823
Might actually be a recurring historical occurrence

1554
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:48,127
How would you tell the difference

1555
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:52,223
In any case it'll happen again in this story

1556
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:58,623
Which once again makes you say okay is this just a recurring Motif or is this a tactic that worked last time so we're try

1557
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,391
Trying it again

1558
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,951
Nonetheless somehow

1559
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:03,743
The medes regain

1560
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:07,071
In a freedom of action from these people who are then thrown out

1561
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,863
Leaving behind another

1562
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:15,519
Wonderful ethnic strain of the Central Asian bloodline that will run through around over the ages and that will be added

1563
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:17,055
Do with New Blood

1564
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:19,615
Sometimes tragically from time to time

1565
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:24,479
The guy who is supposedly the king of the medes during this

1566
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:27,039
Period of Domination by The Scorpions

1567
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:29,087
Is a mead name

1568
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:29,855
CV axle

1569
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,415
Herodotus

1570
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:34,975
Credit scam with totally reorganizing

1571
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:37,279
The military of the meat

1572
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:38,303
He says

1573
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:43,935
Seahawks series becomes the first Asian leader to in a separate

1574
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:47,007
An army into component parts in archery

1575
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:52,127
Cabaristas before that they all fought together in a chaotic Mass which is not

1576
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:53,663
True at all

1577
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:57,759
But some historians think he's preserving some sort of a memory of this important

1578
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:59,807
Madeon ruler who

1579
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:04,927
Reorganize the military made it much more powerful and considering what he was about to do with it

1580
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:10,559
There seems to be some historical evidence for the Meads all of a sudden becoming very formidable indeed

1581
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:13,119
Right about the same time

1582
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:16,959
When the Great traditionally great power in that region

1583
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:17,983
Gets

1584
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:20,799
Mortally wounded by Assyria

1585
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:24,383
Alluded to this earlier part of the series

1586
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:25,919
Laying waste

1587
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,199
To all these

1588
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:28,223
In a competitor

1589
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:32,319
Lyrics for their superpower status I did not going to be anybody that even gets to put up

1590
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,343
A little resist

1591
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:38,719
The elamites once again get on the hit list for doing the same thing they always do

1592
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,535
Babylon revolt against Assyria

1593
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:46,655
Elong helps Babylon as soon as the Assyrians take care of Babylon they come for

1594
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:49,471
The elamites and this happens under the last

1595
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:50,239
The Great

1596
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,519
Assyrian rulers

1597
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:52,799
Ashurbanipal

1598
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,591
Ashurbanipal

1599
01:14:55,359 --> 01:15:01,503
Hoosier Hoosier very long ruling guy in at the start of his Reign the Empire could not be

1600
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:02,527
Fireplace

1601
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:08,927
By the end of his Reign you know he's writing these woe-is-me Tales what did I do to have the gods turn against me

1602
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:09,951
Everything sucks

1603
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,023
You know but I'll die soon at least kinds of

1604
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,047
Your writings

1605
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,095
Assyria

1606
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:19,423
We'll go from the height of its fortunes to

1607
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:24,031
1945 Berlin fall of the Third Reich devastation

1608
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,567
Never to rise again

1609
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:28,639
In a very short period of time

1610
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,943
And some have argued

1611
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,991
The part of the reason why

1612
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:35,807
Is because of what they did to the people around them

1613
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:39,135
They destroyed the other powers

1614
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:45,535
But might have acted as barriers against New Rising ones with of the new Rising ones are Skippy and sinking Marion from the eurasians

1615
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,327
Or whether there

1616
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,607
An obscure

1617
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:53,983
Tribal people known as the me to all of a sudden they're really getting powerful and well lad

1618
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,799
The weather wise would have been dealing with the elamites

1619
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:00,127
But the elamites get smashed by Usher Bonaparte

1620
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:04,479
In 646 BCE and the devastation is

1621
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:07,295
Arguably immortal

1622
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,111
We are ready

1623
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:12,415
Mention two scene from the actor

1624
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:14,463
Elamites

1625
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,999
Final Solution when

1626
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,535
Ashurbanipal is lying on his

1627
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:19,327
Couch with that woman there

1628
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:23,679
And then this Everett had you know upon the pillar of the wall That's

1629
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,983
In a part of the aftermath

1630
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:28,543
Dealing with the elamites this way

1631
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:30,079
Ashurbanipal Leeds

1632
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,615
The greatest Syrian Army

1633
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:34,431
All the way it's a long way again to Susa

1634
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:39,551
Devastate coelom as his scribe writing for himself

1635
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:40,831
Recounts

1636
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:41,599
Quote

1637
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:47,231
For a distance of 1 month in 25 days March I devastated the districts of Eli

1638
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:51,327
I spread salt and thornbush there to injure the soil

1639
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:54,655
Sons of the Kings Sisters of the Kings

1640
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:57,983
Members of balaam's royal family young and old

1641
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:58,751
Prefix

1642
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:02,335
Governor's Knights Artisans as many as there were

1643
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:07,711
Inhabitants male and female big and little horses mules asses

1644
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:11,039
Flocks and herds more numerous than a swarm of locusts

1645
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:13,855
I carried them off as booty to Assyria

1646
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:20,511
The dust of Susa of medoc to of how termination of the other cities I carried it off to Assyria

1647
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:25,119
In a month of days I subdued Alam and its whole extent

1648
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:30,751
The voice of man the steps of flocks and herds the happy shouts of Mirth

1649
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:35,359
I put it into them and it's feels which I left for the asses the gazelles

1650
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:37,663
And all manner of wild beasts

1651
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,431
Two people

1652
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:39,967
And quote

1653
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:43,295
The Assyrians were

1654
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:44,319
Thorough

1655
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:47,391
They even removed

1656
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,415
The bone

1657
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:51,231
Show me old going back to ancient

1658
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:54,303
Elamite rulers from their tombs

1659
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,095
Them back

1660
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:57,631
It was Siri with the loot

1661
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:00,959
Historian 80 Homestead says they put them in

1662
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:02,751
Particularly awful spots

1663
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:07,103
So that they would get no rest ever again laying in a foreign land

1664
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:11,455
I'm paying an eternal price for their enmity to Assyria

1665
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:14,271
It may have happened in the Deep Misty

1666
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:15,551
Eras of the past

1667
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,855
And we said you earlier that it

1668
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:18,623
The elamites

1669
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:23,743
Conquer the United States they take the Statue of Liberty back as a prize of War to be displayed

1670
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:27,071
Police syrians wouldn't stop at the Statue of Liberty

1671
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:30,911
They steal our constitution they take the Washington Monument

1672
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:32,959
8 snuff out the flame

1673
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:36,031
John F Kennedy's grave and take the bones with them

1674
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:38,847
Assyrians

1675
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:45,247
We're sort of setting the bar for this region people like the Babylonian to come afterwards we'll be just as brutal like they're trying to

1676
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:47,551
Imitate whatever the standard of the day is

1677
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:49,855
But the standard of the day

1678
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:50,623
Is

1679
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:52,159
Even today

1680
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:57,023
Try making a movie out of it it's going to be it's going to be a cable one for sure

1681
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:01,119
In the story Olmstead tells of the parade is that a good word

1682
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:04,959
When is your Bonnet Paul and his army arrived back home in Nineveh

1683
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:07,007
Displaying the loot

1684
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:11,871
And the prisoners and meeting out punishment by the way to all and Sundry

1685
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:13,407
Is

1686
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,431
Spiteful

1687
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:16,223
First of all

1688
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:20,319
The head of that Edomite ruler that will be sitting up on Usher bottom pause

1689
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:22,111
Wall or what have you

1690
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:25,183
Was transported from Susa on foot

1691
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:26,719
Around the neck

1692
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:28,255
Of the elamites general

1693
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:29,279
Imagine how

1694
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,303
Freaky that with a

1695
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:31,839
2 Live Crew

1696
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:35,167
Who did The Walking Shane supposedly

1697
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,703
And then

1698
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:43,359
The various generals are brought out and punished and there's a psychological twist with Siri and Punishment by the way

1699
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:45,663
That is part of kind of what the

1700
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:47,711
Persians will sort of do away with

1701
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:49,247
Here's what

1702
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:50,783
18 Olmstead

1703
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:56,159
Brighten I'm going to try my best at some of the pronunciations of these Mesopotamian names they are wonderful

1704
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,207
He writes quote

1705
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:02,303
Ashurbanipal was about to leave Arbella for Nineveh

1706
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:06,911
And the severed head of the elamites ruler was entrusted to his General

1707
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:09,215
Dunoon news neck for transport

1708
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:13,055
As the musicians led the ghastly procession into Nineveh

1709
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,336
The terrible sight

1710
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:16,896
Craze how Madara and Nabu dummy

1711
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:20,480
The ambassadors who would receive their commissions from the dead monarch

1712
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:22,272
One tore his beard

1713
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:25,344
The other thrust his girdle sword into his bosom

1714
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:32,000
Aplia son of Nabu Shalom and Grandson of the famous merodach-baladan was extradited from

1715
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:38,400
Mallam Manu keahi Dunn Avenue and Nabu Shalem The Gambler Chieftains had spoken

1716
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:40,448
Blasphemy against the Assyrian gods

1717
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:43,520
And for this crime they had their tongues pulled out by the roots

1718
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:44,800
And we're skinned alive

1719
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:48,896
The horrible scene is represented on one of the reliefs although

1720
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:51,200
Strangely enough Olmstead rights

1721
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:54,528
The names have never been filled in the blanks left for the purpose

1722
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:58,112
The new new was placed on the rack and slaughtered like a lamb

1723
01:20:58,368 --> 01:21:00,416
His brother Sam gulou when aplia

1724
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:04,000
We're slain and their flesh distributed among the surrounding land

1725
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:07,840
Nabu not eating bellatier sons of Naboo Schumer

1726
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:10,400
We're forced to crush the bones of their father

1727
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:15,520
And the head of the Edomite King found its final resting place over the gate which led to Usher

1728
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:19,616
And quote Asher being a primary a Syrian City

1729
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:24,736
The forcing the sun's to crush the bones of the father is one of those really

1730
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:26,528
Psychologically

1731
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:32,672
Horrible things and you'll see this in other occasions the Babylonian King for example who supposedly

1732
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:36,512
Once he took Jerusalem took the ruler the king

1733
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:38,304
And forced him to watch the

1734
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:44,704
The slaughtering of his two young sons in front of his eyes and then had his eyes put out so that the last thing he saw

1735
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,728
Always.

1736
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,264
Extralegal cruelties

1737
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,544
That just seemed

1738
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:55,200
Well that just seemed calculated to subdue somebody's will to resist but you could easily

1739
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:57,760
Really see how it might have the opposite effect

1740
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,832
You could see how a people coming

1741
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:02,112
After this time

1742
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,208
Might be able to make all sorts of political hay

1743
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:11,072
Selling themselves as the alternative to this kind of Cruelty

1744
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,376
And you can also see why

1745
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:15,424
I went to Syria

1746
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,704
Spell

1747
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:20,288
There were not a lot of Tears cried

1748
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:22,080
What was gone in fact

1749
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:25,408
Even the biblical prophets are rejoicing

1750
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,504
As I was trying to come up

1751
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,784
Some sort of analogy

1752
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:32,064
To try to do

1753
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,112
Define the stakes here

1754
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,416
With what's about to happen all I could

1755
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,696
Think of in my

1756
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:38,720
On creative

1757
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:40,512
Mine was the idea

1758
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,840
Of the United States over the next five or so years

1759
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,120
Somehow

1760
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:47,424
End with jaw dropping

1761
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,728
Astonishing events

1762
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,008
Tell apart

1763
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:52,544
Imploded

1764
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:59,200
Broke into some kind of a Civil War ended up getting involved in maybe a foreign war at the same time I mean

1765
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:03,808
You never know how these things are going to turn remember how you felt if you were old enough to remember

1766
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:08,160
What the 9/11 attacks look like on live television while you watch them

1767
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:12,000
There's almost nothing positive that comes out of something

1768
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:15,072
Like that but one of the few things that was in my mind

1769
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:16,608
Was that you watched it

1770
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,400
You were reminded

1771
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:21,728
That the most astonishing things not only

1772
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:23,520
Can happen but we'll have

1773
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:27,360
They're like earthquakes you know there's going to be a big one you just don't know when

1774
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:34,016
You know there's going to be some massive jaw-dropping historical event in the future you just don't know the date

1775
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:37,344
I have time like a 911 but when you watch that happening

1776
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,672
That astonishment is how mankind has failed over and over and over

1777
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,464
As you look back on it

1778
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:47,328
There's about to be an astonishing moment in this story it's not really a moment

1779
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:52,192
5 to 15 years it just appears astonishing now

1780
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,264
But it's akin to the United States imploding

1781
01:23:55,776 --> 01:24:00,896
Really I think it's more than the Soviet Union falling but a little less than the modern United States going away

1782
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:04,480
Nonetheless if the United States did go away in the next 5 years

1783
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:07,552
What is the international situation look like

1784
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:09,088
Then

1785
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:10,368
Mean what

1786
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:15,488
World instantly Springs up to replace such an important call and how does that go

1787
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:18,560
This is actually the world

1788
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,608
It is going to exist

1789
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:23,936
As soon as this story that must be

1790
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:26,496
You're one of the great events in all human history

1791
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:27,776
But we don't know

1792
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:30,592
Because you don't have a Herodotus there to give it

1793
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:35,200
Even with a bunch of lies and exaggerations and untruths that may have filtered in over the hundreds of years

1794
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:37,760
We don't have his version or anyone like him

1795
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:38,784
To explain it to us

1796
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:40,320
We like the color

1797
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:44,160
By the way promised he was going to tell the story

1798
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:47,232
In one part of his histories and then never did

1799
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,792
Or didn't come down to us or something

1800
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:53,376
Futurist Babylonian sources

1801
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:58,240
And that's it in fact the stuff you thought you couldn't count on like as wonderful as Siri and

1802
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:01,056
In a pronouncements by the king of kings

1803
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:03,872
I went in there I planted Thorn bushes I killed everybody

1804
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:08,992
That ends in like 6:39 BCE ominously and mysteriously all of a sudden

1805
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,296
What the heck's going on

1806
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,368
I love the different ways that historians try to

1807
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:17,952
Describe this 211 history says he was unclear what was happening

1808
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:20,256
Author Mark Healy

1809
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:24,096
Explain the importance though this. Silence cuz he says

1810
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:29,216
Quote and it is in the Silence of those years that is written the fate of the Assyrian Empire

1811
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:30,752
And quote

1812
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:34,592
So the important stuff is happening we just don't know much of what it is

1813
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:37,664
Open to interpretation is how another

1814
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:38,688
Historian put it

1815
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,248
Here's what basically goes on

1816
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:43,552
Ashurbanipal zeringue

1817
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:46,368
At the end you start to see things spray

1818
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:51,232
You begin to see places that were under a serious control on the on the margin

1819
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:52,000
Break Free

1820
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:59,424
A lot of historians think that it's rather telling that all of a sudden you can have these Skitty and tribes riding roughshod now in air

1821
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:02,752
Areas with the Assyrians used to keep them out it must mean that they can't

1822
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,824
Well no one is really paying alot of attention

1823
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:09,152
The medes are beginning diffuse sort of

1824
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:12,736
And it's unclear how they did this with the elamites civilization

1825
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:15,040
Could have been peaceful could have been War like

1826
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,832
Could have been diplomatic marriage

1827
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:18,624
But it's making both

1828
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,416
Civilization stronger

1829
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:23,488
Ashurbanipal die

1830
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:26,304
And his sons go to war with

1831
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:28,864
Now

1832
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,912
This is not uncommon

1833
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,472
In Assyrian royal succession

1834
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,544
But this is coming at a particularly bad time

1835
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:39,360
Does all of a sudden the Babylonians

1836
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,384
A resurgent

1837
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:42,944
It got a new Dynasty

1838
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:48,832
They got an army that is modeled it's it's it's a not as effective copy of the Assyrians

1839
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:55,232
B series copy the Babylonian civilization not quite as well as the Babylonian original and the Babylonians copy.

1840
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:59,328
The Assyrian military though it's not quite up to the originals standards either

1841
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:01,632
But when you've been fighting

1842
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:07,008
One half of your Army against the other which is what the Assyrians were doing in the Civil War that's why they're so ruinous

1843
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:13,664
Do you have outside power starting to loom over you and what do you do with your army you divide it in half and fight against each other

1844
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:15,968
Worst possible thing that could happen

1845
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,760
And then the Babylonians

1846
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:20,064
Starting at about 6:16 start

1847
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,600
Sending out an army

1848
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:25,696
Taking some of these border cities between Assyria

1849
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:26,464
Babylon

1850
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:33,376
And then the war heats up a little bit in there fighting back and forth in the Assyrian army seems to be a shadow of its former self but you could see how

1851
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:34,912
How strong it still is

1852
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:40,288
Because they're holding their own against these Babylonians pushing them back sometime chasing them back sometimes

1853
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,592
But it's all they can handle

1854
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:46,176
And then like 6:15 BCE

1855
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,712
The meter's jumping

1856
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:48,736
Going to East

1857
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:50,528
Anna North

1858
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,856
They start taking cities in the east

1859
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:57,696
The next year the medes come forward

1860
01:27:57,952 --> 01:28:00,000
Under their King tri-axle Ruiz

1861
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:01,536
And Advance is on

1862
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:03,072
And one of the capitol

1863
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,352
Nineveh

1864
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:06,400
I can't take it

1865
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:08,704
Because none of this massively fortified

1866
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:11,008
Probably the most fortified City

1867
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,544
West of China

1868
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:15,360
In this whole human history up to this point I mean just

1869
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:16,896
Incredible feet

1870
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:17,920
The human Marvel

1871
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:20,736
And it pushes these me sideways

1872
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:22,016
They just can't deal

1873
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,040
Right now

1874
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:27,392
Unfortunately syrians if you can't go out there and defeat that midi in army

1875
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:28,928
They can do whatever they want

1876
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:33,536
So they go Sac a nearby City that's not as well defended to just happens to be a sure

1877
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:34,816
Integrate

1878
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:37,888
And Once Upon a Time Assyrian capitals vital

1879
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:40,448
Connected to their religion and their God and

1880
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,496
And morale and everything else

1881
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:44,032
The big deal

1882
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:46,080
At the last minute

1883
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:49,920
The Babylonians run up to be a part of it this is a famous event that

1884
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:52,224
They don't want to allow the medes

1885
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:56,832
To take this important city by themselves be left out of the spoils the reputation everything

1886
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:59,136
But they arrived too late with their army

1887
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:03,232
The means of already sacked the place maybe rushing the attempt

1888
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:05,536
So that they beat the Babylonians there

1889
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:09,888
They treated the way the Assyrians would have treated it and it's a horrific event

1890
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:11,936
The Babylonian

1891
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:13,728
Kane and the

1892
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:15,008
Dianping

1893
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:17,824
Pledge their friendship to each other as

1894
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:20,640
Asher Burns in the background

1895
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,480
Chilling continues in the slaves are being dragged off

1896
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:26,272
All of a sudden

1897
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:28,064
A week into Syria

1898
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,600
Has Babylon

1899
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:30,880
And the medes

1900
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:32,416
Working together

1901
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:35,232
Advancing on Nineveh

1902
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:36,768
612 BCE

1903
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,096
If this wasn't bad enough

1904
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:46,496
At the last minutes allegedly not everybody says this but the standard belief is at the last minute

1905
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,800
A horde of Skitty ins

1906
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:52,384
In the rides in the wild Northern Horseman

1907
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,432
And joins both the medes

1908
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:57,248
And the Babylonians in this last assault

1909
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,272
Upon this

1910
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,296
Greatest of

1911
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:01,088
West Asian

1912
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:02,880
Military fortresses

1913
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:05,184
Together they take

1914
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:08,256
Had to fight

1915
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:10,304
Three battles on the plains

1916
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,096
Supposedly before they even got a chance to

1917
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:12,864
To get near the wall

1918
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:17,728
Walls with this last old aging damage Lion of Assyria swatting them away

1919
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:19,008
And fighting well

1920
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:20,544
As long as they could

1921
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:23,104
The Babylonians

1922
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:23,872
King

1923
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:25,664
Winter style

1924
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,968
And if those people wrote In

1925
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:29,760
Describe what he did to

1926
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:31,808
What he calls the land of subaru

1927
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:32,832
Is there a word for

1928
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:33,600
For Syria

1929
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:38,208
And by the way notice how he's couching this in terms of liberation

1930
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:39,488
From the

1931
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:42,304
You know what Siri iniocc the record say quote

1932
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:44,864
I Slaughter the land of Subaru

1933
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:47,936
I turn the Hostile land into heaps and ruin

1934
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:54,080
The Assyrian who since distant days has ruled over all the peoples and with his heavy yoke

1935
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:56,384
Injury to the people of the land

1936
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:58,688
Is feet from a card I turned back

1937
01:30:58,944 --> 01:31:00,224
His yoke I threw off

1938
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:02,016
And quote

1939
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:06,112
And you have a basic problem when when discussing

1940
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:07,392
Events of the past life

1941
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:10,464
If we're discussing something from recent his

1942
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:11,232
3 say

1943
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:12,768
The end of the Third Reich

1944
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:13,792
Get the Second World War

1945
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:16,096
All that emotion is still felt

1946
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:21,216
Right you get a real feel for the kinds of things historians don't want to touch once you get back

1947
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:22,496
A certain distance

1948
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:25,568
Someday they're not going to look at the Nazis

1949
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,128
As the kind of evil that we do

1950
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,664
They're going to

1951
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:35,040
Somehow say well they were on the far end of the spectrum of what people did that

1952
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:38,624
Which is kind of what a lot of modern ones would say about Assyria

1953
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:42,208
They're not doing anything anybody else isn't doing

1954
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:45,280
They just may be at the far end of the spectrum of

1955
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:46,560
Anaconda

1956
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,376
It's all kind of relative right

1957
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,936
But you could certainly see

1958
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:53,216
The

1959
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:53,984
Anger

1960
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:57,824
And Vengeance in the people that goes beyond mere

1961
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:03,456
You know the taking of Loot and slaves in the things that have motivated Soldier sometimes In the Heat of battle at all time

1962
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:05,760
This involved

1963
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:06,784
Some Payback

1964
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,856
Story Mark Vande Maru

1965
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:12,160
Explains that you can still see

1966
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:13,696
Avengeance today

1967
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:16,768
I mean there's an eternal bit of payback that was done

1968
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:18,560
Erase quote

1969
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:22,400
The Conqueror set out to destroy the cities of Assyria

1970
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:26,496
Taking revenge for the humiliation they had suffered a serious hand

1971
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:28,544
On wall reliefs of Kings

1972
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,872
Tanaka read and ashurbanipal in Nineveh for example

1973
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:34,688
They identified the representations of the Kings

1974
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:39,296
With the help of the inscriptions accompanying them and ritually destroyed them

1975
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:41,344
By cutting out the ears and eyes

1976
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,904
These were not random acts of Mutilation

1977
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:50,304
In the detail to picture of ashurbanipal to feed of the elamites for example only the face of a soldier cutting

1978
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,376
Turn off the head of the king of Elam was similarly destroyed

1979
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,912
Probably by the medes

1980
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:56,960
Who saw the elamites as their ancestor

1981
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:58,240
Likewise

1982
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:00,032
The records of loyalty Oaths

1983
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:06,432
The Chinese are head-on had forced Maddie and bodyguards to swear and which has been stored at Cal who

1984
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:12,064
The Palaces were broke down only after the lengthy task of defacing images

1985
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:15,648
And destroying symbols of submission to Assyria had been completed

1986
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:16,928
And quote

1987
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:19,744
If you go to the British museum

1988
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,048
Today and look at the Assyrian reliefs

1989
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,328
You can see

1990
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,144
Are the defacing done by some

1991
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:29,728
Angry vengeful and probably rightfully so

1992
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:36,128
Soldier as they took down Assyria piece-by-piece but stunningly quickly by historical stand

1993
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,712
And while there may be no Herodotus

1994
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:41,760
To give color to this story

1995
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:44,064
There is one of the most

1996
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:45,600
Tickets for military

1997
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:49,440
Three fans one of the most colorful sections of the Old Testament

1998
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:50,720
The Bible 2 deals

1999
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:52,768
With the fall of Assyria

2000
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,584
And I'm sure Assyrian descendants of people who are

2001
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:58,912
Big Assyrian fans think this is very unfair

2002
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:00,704
Soda propaganda

2003
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:04,800
Again it's just their bad luck to get bad PR sometimes in the Bible

2004
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,592
The biblical Prophet Nahum

2005
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:09,920
Was prophet sizing supposedly that you're going to get it

2006
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:13,760
And then once they did get it he was sort of saying see this is what you get

2007
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:17,344
Now what kind of interesting about Nahum unlike some of these other prophecy

2008
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,904
There's a decent chance he was a contemporary

2009
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:24,000
A lot of this stuff was put together in the Hellenistic period later

2010
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:27,584
Unifab earlier stories are all kinds of things dealing with that era

2011
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:32,704
Some of this goes back and it's tough to know when the story is argue but it's possible

2012
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:39,104
But this profit damn guy was maybe even a predecessor to some of these events so who knows you know I won't get into

2013
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,896
Something like that I just found it interesting

2014
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:45,504
Because when he recounts what happens first of all he gives you the color and tells you

2015
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:51,904
A little bit about the story in it in a religious sort of framers still doesn't sound like Herodotus there's a religious tones

2016
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:54,208
But at the same time it's very colorful

2017
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:56,768
He describes for example

2018
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:01,888
In what the battle is like after proper sizing that you're going to get it for a long time he says quote

2019
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:04,192
He that shatters in pieces

2020
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:05,728
Has come up against the

2021
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:07,008
Guard the wall

2022
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:11,104
Guard the way make Thai strength the utmost

2023
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:13,408
The Shield his Heroes is red

2024
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:15,712
His Warriors are clad in Scarlet

2025
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:17,760
They prepare the Chariots today

2026
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:19,552
The Chariot horses are eager

2027
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:21,600
The Chariots rage in the field

2028
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:26,464
They rushed to and fro in the plaza their appearance is like that of torches

2029
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:28,512
The yard about like lightning

2030
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:30,816
He reads out the list of his Noble

2031
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:36,448
In their eagerness they stumble they hastened to reach the walls the battering ram is made ready

2032
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:37,984
+ 4

2033
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:40,544
10 a.m. describes

2034
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:44,384
The unleashing of the rivers I guess the dams were broken

2035
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:46,688
Or reroute it or they reroute the

2036
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:51,040
The course of the rivers are what have you to help undermine the walls that's not that unusual atactic

2037
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:52,576
But with a big city like this

2038
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:54,624
Not a small engineering feet

2039
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:56,160
And the prophet

2040
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:57,184
Name says quote

2041
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:59,232
The river sluices are open

2042
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:04,864
The palace walls are crumbling the queen is stripped of her clothing they are leading her way capped

2043
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:07,680
Handmaidens moan like doves

2044
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:09,728
Upon their breasts they're beating

2045
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:11,776
Nineveh was a tank of water

2046
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:13,568
From it they are now escaping

2047
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:17,664
Handstands they cry not one of them looks backwards

2048
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:19,712
And then he

2049
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:25,344
Basically tells everybody to take back the stuff that Assyria took from them and that their housing in this

2050
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,904
Immensely wealthy City he says quote

2051
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:32,000
Takee the spoil of silver take either spoil of gold

2052
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:38,400
There is no end to the store in abundance of all good lie objects she is empty and void and waste

2053
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:39,680
Hearts melt

2054
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:40,704
Me shake

2055
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:44,544
There is pain in all loins and pale have waxed all the faces

2056
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:46,080
And quote

2057
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,128
And he does a little

2058
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,920
Trash Talk loading

2059
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:55,040
Maurice's where are The Beano great Lions now and all the people who took all this stuff

2060
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:59,136
And then like again so many of the people during this era

2061
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:01,184
This was seen to involve

2062
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:06,048
You know a little proof that their God was Superior or in the case

2063
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:08,096
Of some of these people by this point

2064
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:10,400
In history the only God

2065
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:12,448
The name says

2066
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:16,800
Quote behold I am against the says Yahweh of hosts

2067
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:19,104
Dilator I will burn with smoke

2068
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:25,504
They're young the sword shall devour I will cut off. I pray from the earth no more be heard by Messengers voice

2069
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,088
And he continues to rub it in

2070
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:33,184
And basically blame this on Karma if you will

2071
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:35,488
Woe to the bloody City

2072
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,536
Full of lies and robbery

2073
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:38,816
The crack of the whip

2074
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:40,864
And the Thunder of the rumbling wheel

2075
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:47,264
The Prancing horse in the bounding Chariot The Horseman mounting in the flash of stored The Gleam of spirit

2076
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,568
Mass of slain a heap of corpses

2077
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:51,360
There is no end to the dead body

2078
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:55,200
For the many in Fidelity's of the well favoured Harlot

2079
01:37:55,712 --> 01:38:00,320
The Mistress of incantations Who Sold States for her Wicked Deeds

2080
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:05,184
10 Clans through her incantations behold say if Yahweh of hosts

2081
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,464
I am against it

2082
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:10,816
I will strip thee of thy clothing and show their shame to the nation's

2083
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:13,888
Bill I will cast upon the in disgrace the

2084
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,192
I will sit V up as a warning

2085
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:19,520
All who see the Shelf leave she'll cry

2086
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:20,800
Desolate Nineveh

2087
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:22,336
Who shall bewail her

2088
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:23,872
And quote

2089
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:28,480
Well listen they may not have a ton of dramatic stuff

2090
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:31,552
From the near East during this time.

2091
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:32,576
That's awesome

2092
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:35,392
I mean the all history aside that's awesome stuff

2093
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:38,208
And it does give you a feel

2094
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:40,768
The emotion of the time. We may think

2095
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:45,120
You know that it's all been drained but that's somebody who is clearly thinking

2096
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:47,424
What is Siri is reaping

2097
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:48,960
What she sowed

2098
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:53,056
Again I pity the poor Assyrian people who have to live with

2099
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:57,152
One piece of horrible PR making it down through the eras

2100
01:38:57,408 --> 01:39:01,760
The most widely read book in history and your people get some negative PR

2101
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:06,368
The last Assyrian King is rumored

2102
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:07,648
That's a good way to put it

2103
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:10,720
There's not enough information to know on this is rumored to have

2104
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:14,048
As the enemy was closing in

2105
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:20,448
Heil all of his worldly possessions that were in his Palace around him in the gold and the silver and have family

2106
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:26,848
Play members killed and eunuchs and concubines thrown on in the pile stuff with him and then have it all set up

2107
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:28,384
The light with him sitting in the middle of it

2108
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:32,736
There's a seem like that in The Lord of the Rings to apparently in this time.

2109
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:34,784
It happened a few times probably

2110
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,600
Who's the motif they certainly referred back to

2111
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:40,160
For short time

2112
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:43,488
An Assyrian successor State maybe you could call it

2113
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:49,120
If you could call it the last gasp of resistance try to make a stand but by 605 that was

2114
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:50,400
Destroyed to

2115
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:52,192
And the Assyrians will

2116
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:55,008
Turn into a people that never disappeared

2117
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:58,080
But whose destruction was so massive

2118
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:00,384
And so sustained until total

2119
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:01,920
That they seem like they do

2120
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:08,832
You will hear Assyrians trying to tell the world still today we are still here

2121
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:15,744
And try to fight that idea that every last one of them was killed in the in their version of a holocaust you know at the end of that era

2122
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:18,048
What's not true

2123
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:19,328
But you can certainly say that

2124
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:21,888
Within a very short period of time

2125
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:23,168
Those masks

2126
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:25,728
The top of their era

2127
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:27,264
Cities and fortresses

2128
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:29,568
We're almost unrecognizable

2129
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:33,408
In a famous passage the Greek General xenophon

2130
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:36,224
What is 10000 weeks bleeding

2131
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,016
A Persian Civil War

2132
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:40,832
Will get chased all the way through

2133
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:42,112
What's now Northern Iraq

2134
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:44,416
He will come upon

2135
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,208
These great

2136
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:47,488
Master Sidious

2137
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:49,024
By their standards of the day

2138
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:51,840
Simply no rotting in the dark

2139
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:53,376
Deserted

2140
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:56,704
But the walls are so high

2141
01:40:57,472 --> 01:40:58,496
And the workmanship

2142
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:00,288
You on the streets and everything

2143
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:01,568
All modern

2144
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:05,152
That he doesn't understand where it came from

2145
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:08,736
The locals don't know anything about a Siri they think the medes built it

2146
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:11,296
Another word for than 200 years

2147
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:17,440
The cities are lying in Ruins they're still larger than almost anything new being built at that time

2148
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:20,256
And nobody even remembers that they were Assyrian

2149
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:24,864
The account by xenophon

2150
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:26,400
Are these ghosts

2151
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:27,936
Cities by the way

2152
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:31,264
I've spoken about them before it's the ultimate

2153
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:34,848
Statue of Liberty in the sand sort of historical moment

2154
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:36,896
You know what I mean when I say that

2155
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:40,480
The end of the Planet of the Apes with Charlton Heston believes he's been on a

2156
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:43,552
Distant planet the whole time in the very last scene in the movie

2157
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:45,344
He looks and in the distance

2158
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:50,976
You know with the surf crashing against it he sees the Statue of Liberty 3/4 buried

2159
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:52,000
In the sand

2160
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:56,096
If you could take in the Syrian

2161
01:41:56,608 --> 01:42:01,472
Individual from 3 for 500 years before xenophon

2162
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:07,360
Lived and bring him forward or her forward in the time machine so that she could hang out there

2163
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:09,408
You know by the ruins of Nineveh

2164
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:11,712
With xenophon

2165
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:17,600
Run through her head what would run through your head if you could go forward in a time machine and see

2166
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:19,136
Our ghost City

2167
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:20,672
Someday

2168
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:24,768
Am I Marvel the size of me 200 years later

2169
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:29,376
Xenophon says and he can't really lies a lot of people who know

2170
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:33,216
It was uniforms talking about here and have seen it and could call him a liar

2171
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:39,616
And he says the base of the fortification he's camping by is 50 ft Broad and 50 feet high

2172
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:41,408
And then has

2173
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,200
A brick wall

2174
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:47,808
50 ft Broad and another hundred feet high on top of that

2175
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:52,672
And that the circumference of the fortifications is 18 miles

2176
01:42:53,952 --> 01:43:00,096
He says there are some people so they've been a little like refugees and small villages and semi-nomadic group

2177
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:01,632
Groups of people camping by

2178
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:03,936
But that City used to have

2179
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:07,008
Hundreds of thousands maybe a million people

2180
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,288
Living there

2181
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:10,848
That's a ghost City

2182
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:12,128
From a

2183
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:13,152
Dead era

2184
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:16,992
Are the X and the funds they are only a couple hundred years later

2185
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:19,552
And when Assyria Falls

2186
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:25,952
It's like that moment we spoke about earlier what would happen if United States disappeared in 5 or 15 years

2187
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:27,488
What's the world

2188
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:33,888
And look like without that you know Center spoke of the Wagon Wheel anymore it's hard even to think for people born

2189
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:34,656
In the last

2190
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:36,704
20-30 years maybe

2191
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:38,752
Does any other sort of reality

2192
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:46,176
Maybe that's the case for the people who lived through and maybe they were blinking and just waking up to a new day it really does have soda

2193
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:48,224
End of the second World War

2194
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:54,624
Sort of feel like everything's been devastated in the whole bunch of people who had Allied together for this

2195
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:57,696
Common interest of taking down the Assyrian Empire

2196
01:43:57,952 --> 01:44:01,024
When I was staring over the rubble wondering who gets what

2197
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:02,560
And all of a sudden

2198
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:04,864
Like in 1946

2199
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:10,240
In a year up especially allies were turning into potential adversaries very quickly

2200
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:12,288
There were four

2201
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:14,080
You know if we look at this as a

2202
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:19,200
Encapsulated little micro-world here go politically speaking which is how I look at

2203
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:19,968
Happy stories

2204
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:20,992
Sorry for all

2205
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,272
A little bit more

2206
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:23,808
A religion

2207
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:28,672
Nonetheless in the geopolitical setup we really have four great Powers now you go from one

2208
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:32,000
And a hegemonic power Assyria

2209
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:33,536
To Babylon

2210
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:37,120
Picking up a lot of the Syrian territory in this whole deal

2211
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:38,144
By the way

2212
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:42,752
You also have the meats obviously doing the same thing you know moving into

2213
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:44,800
Territory in the north Assyria tone

2214
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:49,152
Irani Egypt always a great power if they can be

2215
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:54,784
But not that long ago you know under Siri and domination like everyone else they start moving

2216
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:57,600
Towards the modern-day area around

2217
01:44:57,856 --> 01:45:00,928
And it is real and in there and they are

2218
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:04,256
IPlayer and finally it's at 4th power called Lydia

2219
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:06,560
Lydia

2220
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:08,864
Is the power that's now in modern-day turkey

2221
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:10,144
For the most part

2222
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:13,728
Like everyone else they benefited from the Assyrians going away

2223
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:16,544
They were able to move and expand into other areas

2224
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:17,824
They are

2225
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:20,384
Generally credited with the ones

2226
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:22,944
Inventing metal money

2227
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,736
At least in the western world

2228
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:30,880
And you will begin to see at least in the long-term view of things

2229
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:34,208
All sorts of conflicts breaking out now

2230
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:36,768
As all these new powers sort of

2231
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:37,792
Vie with each other

2232
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:42,144
The Egyptians and the Babylonians for example will go at it

2233
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:48,032
And several times trying to figure out you know is anybody going to talk to anybody Where's the border going to be in all that kind of stuff

2234
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:51,616
And a lot of the littler States just get totally screwed

2235
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:54,432
In this deal it's a little like the Cold War

2236
01:45:54,688 --> 01:46:00,832
Where some states in the middle try to decide do I side with the Soviets or do I side with the Western and then if you screw up

2237
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:02,624
All kinds of bad things can happen.

2238
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:03,648
Exactly what happened

2239
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:05,184
Chipor Judah

2240
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:08,256
It was sacked by the Babylonian King during

2241
01:46:08,512 --> 01:46:09,536
Dussehra

2242
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:11,072
For continually

2243
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:17,472
In a swaying soda between the two powers that were vying for them Babylon on one side and Egypt on the other

2244
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:21,056
And finally exasperating the Babylonian King

2245
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:22,336
Connect to the breaking point

2246
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:24,640
There are

2247
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:28,992
Jews in Iraq today whose ancestors were apart

2248
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:31,040
Of the Babylonian King

2249
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:34,880
You know taking them out of the city of Judah that he was just destroying

2250
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:36,672
That's where by the way

2251
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:43,072
Solomon's Temple was destroyed by the Babylonians again earning them bad PR

2252
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:46,912
In one of the most important PR books of all time

2253
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:48,960
The medes

2254
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:54,848
Will scare the Babylonians to the point where the Babylonians would build something called them to DN wall

2255
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:57,152
To hopefully slow them down

2256
01:46:57,408 --> 01:47:01,504
And then upon Saul that to about a hundred and fifty years later

2257
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:04,064
It was a wall that supposedly

2258
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:10,464
Ran across the narrowest part of the division between the Tigris and Euphrates River so you'd have the river on tubes

2259
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:12,256
Poseidon in this wall in the middle

2260
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:14,816
And xenophon says that 200 years later

2261
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:15,840
It was quote

2262
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:20,960
Made of burnt bricks laid in bitumen it was 20 ft thick

2263
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:22,752
100 ft High

2264
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:26,592
And said to be 60 miles long it is quite close to Babylon

2265
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:27,616
And quote

2266
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:32,224
Again if he's lying about that there's a lot of people who would know that he was

2267
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:34,784
You have a reputation for that that would follow him

2268
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:37,344
Unto our own time now

2269
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:41,440
The medes will famously go to war

2270
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:43,488
With the lydians

2271
01:47:44,512 --> 01:47:50,400
And this is when some of Herodotus is really just has a little bit of a horror

2272
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:54,240
Story and Alfred Hitchcock e side to him sometimes

2273
01:47:54,496 --> 01:47:57,824
Or maybe just the people he talks to happen to

2274
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:04,224
Cuz during this little. Which were really only last like 40 45 years between the fall of the Assyrians in the rise

2275
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:04,992
The Persians

2276
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:11,904
There's going to be incidents that are eerily similar and you start to wonder whether the guy telling you about them or the

2277
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:14,976
People existing in this era have a certain weakness

2278
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:16,256
For that sort of incident

2279
01:48:16,512 --> 01:48:20,096
In this case Herodotus says this is how the war with the medes

2280
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:21,632
And the lydian started

2281
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,192
There were some skit Ian

2282
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:27,264
Who were hunters for The Medallion King

2283
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:29,056
That guy cxr

2284
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:29,824
Freeze right

2285
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:34,944
And normally they bring back food but one time they show up Herodotus says

2286
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:36,224
Empty-handed

2287
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,016
In front of

2288
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:44,416
Who supposedly Herodotus says had this awful temper freaks out and starts abusing including some physical abuse

2289
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:46,208
One must imagine him kicking

2290
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:47,232
Maybe these

2291
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:48,512
Skitty in archers

2292
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:52,352
Dallas Gideons would never known to have particularly

2293
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:53,888
Non

2294
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:57,216
Excitable temperaments shall we put it that way is that fair

2295
01:48:57,984 --> 01:48:59,008
And Herodotus says

2296
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:01,056
That they went in in their anger

2297
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:04,640
Chilled one of the boys probably from the Royal Court

2298
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:06,944
The team Indian king had sent

2299
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:08,224
To learn archery

2300
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:14,624
From the same Skippy and while they're great Archer let's send some of the royal boys out there and they can learn how to shoot bows like a

2301
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:15,392
Ancient

2302
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:17,184
Eurasian steppe Archer

2303
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:24,096
And they killed one of these boys are out at this says and cut him up like that game that they normally gives the Maddie and King

2304
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:28,448
Showed up gave him the food watch them eat it hahaha

2305
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:32,032
It's like putting urine in someone's beer before you give it to them

2306
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:33,824
The king finds out

2307
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:36,896
Anna goes after them they run to Lydia

2308
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:43,296
And then the median King says I want those Skitty into cut up that boy and made me eat him

2309
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:45,856
And Herodotus says that the king of Lydia sit down

2310
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:47,392
Cat album

2311
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:48,416
War

2312
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:53,024
That will run into Herodotus telling a similar story with an even

2313
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,840
Greater psychological twist very soon after this

2314
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:57,120
Nonetheless

2315
01:49:57,376 --> 01:50:01,984
This war with the medes and the lydians are going for like 5 years Herodotus says

2316
01:50:02,752 --> 01:50:04,032
And will end

2317
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:10,944
With an we don't have a fact here we can play with something that's real we don't have to say he says she says this historian claims we've heard from

2318
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:11,712
Herodotus

2319
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:14,784
There is a solar eclipse

2320
01:50:15,552 --> 01:50:17,088
That happens on May 28th

2321
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:19,392
585 BCE

2322
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:24,256
And at the time that solar eclipse happened

2323
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:27,072
Which by the way Herodotus is a Greek

2324
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:28,352
Predicted

2325
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:30,656
Claiming it was the first time that ever been done

2326
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:31,680
I'm sure the Babylon

2327
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:35,008
Hold off a few of those correctly who knows

2328
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:38,080
Modern astronomers of course have no problem

2329
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:39,104
Going back

2330
01:50:39,616 --> 01:50:41,920
With Precision calculating the date

2331
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:42,944
Past

2332
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:46,784
Astronomical event which is why we have a rare confirmable fact

2333
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:48,576
At this point in the story

2334
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:50,624
But when the eclipse happened

2335
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:51,904
The medes

2336
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:53,952
And the lydians happen to be fighting about

2337
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:59,328
Herodotus says as it was warming up as the battle was getting hot

2338
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:00,864
There goes the Sun

2339
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,960
Now if you are an ancient

2340
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:05,728
Person

2341
01:51:07,008 --> 01:51:12,640
With the religious beliefs you must imagine many of these ancient people had there are few atheist

2342
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:14,688
In the ancient world

2343
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:19,552
And sometimes it can be very superstitious indeed as you might imagine

2344
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:23,136
Now you're involved in a battle man killing man

2345
01:51:23,392 --> 01:51:29,536
You know both sides have almost certainly had sacrifices any Omens examined in there looking at the liver

2346
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:34,400
It's a good day to attack and all these kinds of things in the middle of the battle of a song goes

2347
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:35,168
Out

2348
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:36,704
What are you going to say

2349
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:39,776
Well you might imagine

2350
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:42,592
The medes and the lydians stop fighting

2351
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:45,152
In the Heat of the fighting they stop fighting

2352
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:46,688
We're talking about

2353
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:51,296
Tens of thousands of people on each side and everybody just stops

2354
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:55,904
That's the way it's portrayed anyway but think about it this way

2355
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:58,976
If an Eclipse is really going to stop a battle

2356
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:02,304
It's going to happen fast cuz eclipse doesn't last that long

2357
01:52:03,328 --> 01:52:08,192
The piece was brokered we are told by another of the great Powers Babylon

2358
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:14,848
And also the collegians involved maybe you would call them a midsize power in that region Regional power

2359
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:15,872
That part of the world

2360
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:19,200
And the deal sealed we are told

2361
01:52:19,712 --> 01:52:24,064
In the traditional way although the Greek did a little differently we're not told how

2362
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:26,624
Both rulers slit their skin

2363
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,672
And suck the blood from each other

2364
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:31,744
Also you know gave

2365
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,584
Daughters and whatnot in marriage that's the part I left out two of the deal

2366
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:38,144
When the Babylonians and the medes

2367
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:39,680
You know sign that agreement

2368
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:46,080
Probably the same way a little vampiric blood sucking to go along with it outside of a sure as they destroy that is Siri

2369
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:48,128
Green City they also married off

2370
01:52:48,384 --> 01:52:52,480
Daughters to each other and I mean it was one of these things were all the suddenly families are related

2371
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:58,368
As though that's really going to stop anything given the history nonetheless they did the exact same deal here

2372
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:03,232
Got a few daughters we can spread around got some blood we can suck and and and

2373
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:04,512
Forever Friends

2374
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:08,608
That battles known as the battle of the Halley's River

2375
01:53:09,376 --> 01:53:11,168
Or the battle of the eclipse sometime

2376
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:13,984
That one thing

2377
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:15,520
But it's worth pointing out

2378
01:53:16,032 --> 01:53:16,800
From this.

2379
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:18,336
Because it's going to matter

2380
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:21,152
In the northwest

2381
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:22,688
And very West

2382
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:23,968
Hearts of

2383
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:25,248
Modern-day turkey

2384
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:26,272
The Anatolia

2385
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:27,808
It was called earlier

2386
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:29,344
AR

2387
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:31,904
Settlements and Villages and cities

2388
01:53:33,184 --> 01:53:33,696
Greeks

2389
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:36,256
Nicole ionian

2390
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:38,816
But Greeks of one kind or another

2391
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:42,656
Being you know such a seafaring people around that region head

2392
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:46,240
Colonize that whole area a very long time ago

2393
01:53:47,008 --> 01:53:49,312
And they had relationships with the Greeks

2394
01:53:49,568 --> 01:53:50,592
You know on the mainland

2395
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:51,872
Places like Athens

2396
01:53:53,408 --> 01:53:57,248
You got to imagine trade routes back and forth people going back and forth in fact

2397
01:53:57,504 --> 01:54:02,624
The part of the Greek world that was located in modern-day turkey at this time

2398
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:05,952
Was the more sophisticated the more cultured the more learn it

2399
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:10,048
The Greeks in Athens and Sparta might say the more effeminate

2400
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:15,680
The more corrupted the more lazy the more opulent in a connected to all that Eastern opulence as they were

2401
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:17,216
See how that Motif work

2402
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:19,008
Nonetheless

2403
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:21,056
Those Greeks in

2404
01:54:21,312 --> 01:54:23,616
Anatolia will become a big part of

2405
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:25,664
You know the problem because

2406
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:30,016
They are the part that links Asia back to the Greek mainland

2407
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:34,368
And the Greek mainland has an interest in how their shall we call them

2408
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:35,392
Cousins

2409
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:36,928
Second cousins

2410
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:38,208
How they're doing

2411
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:41,536
The time the battle of the eclipse

2412
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:44,864
Figures out what's going on between the lydians and the medes

2413
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:48,448
Those Greeks are for the most part subject to the lydian king

2414
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:50,240
That's going to change

2415
01:54:51,264 --> 01:54:52,544
Going to change for everybody

2416
01:54:54,336 --> 01:54:57,920
What's about to happen in this region that will affect the Greeks and everyone else

2417
01:54:58,432 --> 01:55:00,480
Is every bit as shocking

2418
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:03,552
And unexpected as the fall of Assyria was

2419
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:09,952
It's interesting that they will happen within a reasonably historically speaking short. Of time from each other

2420
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:11,232
You have to imagine that

2421
01:55:11,744 --> 01:55:14,048
Analogy we have the United States disappearing

2422
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:17,120
In 5 to 15 years and what would the world look like after that

2423
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:19,424
Well what if I told you that Within

2424
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:26,080
You know another 20 or 30 years after that one country that you'd never know some out-of-the-way place

2425
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:28,640
I taken over the entire planet

2426
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:34,272
That's how this analogy works when we start trying to realize that somehow this people call the Persians

2427
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:37,856
Will first get their control over the medes

2428
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:42,464
And how that even happened I mean resource origami the author has a great line when he points out

2429
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:45,536
But you know between the fall of the last great Assyrian monarch

2430
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:47,328
And the rise of Cyrus the Great

2431
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:50,912
There's no mention of these Persian people in any text

2432
01:55:51,168 --> 01:55:52,960
In any politically significant way

2433
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:55,520
They are virtual nobody

2434
01:55:56,288 --> 01:56:00,640
And within a generation they're running the show for everyone in this part of the world

2435
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:02,432
How did that happen

2436
01:56:04,992 --> 01:56:06,784
Judging from the overwhelming

2437
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:11,392
Number of historians from ancient times all the way to the

2438
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:14,720
The latest often contrarian writings

2439
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:21,120
The Lion's Share of the answer seems to have something to do with this incredible leader

2440
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:22,656
Cyrus II

2441
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:24,960
Also called as we said earlier

2442
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:26,496
Cyrus the Great

2443
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:31,872
There are lots of stories by the way and some of them are fantastic

2444
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:34,176
One of Herodotus as best as one of the ones

2445
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:37,760
Details about the rise of Cyrus but you have to remember something

2446
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:41,856
This person Cyrus the Great is to

2447
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:48,512
Persian and Iranian history sort of what George Washington is to American history with King Arthur is

2448
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:50,048
Do British Legend

2449
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:51,840
I mean this is a legendary figure

2450
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:55,680
And because there's so little that talks about him

2451
01:56:55,936 --> 01:56:57,984
During his rise to power historians here

2452
01:56:58,496 --> 01:57:02,080
In a really thrust into the detective role trying to figure out what it is

2453
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:03,616
It is going on

2454
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:07,456
I like the way his during Peterburg and kind of tries to explain

2455
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:13,856
What sort of assumptions you should maybe build into this and I got a history and so he was writing as a historian trying to explain to a laborer

2456
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:16,416
Person like yours truly left up the layperson understood

2457
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:17,440
But he kind of said

2458
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:20,768
Listen if something appears to happen out of nowhere

2459
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:27,424
But it's unlikely that it could you should assume that there was stuff bubbling up under the surface you know a foundation

2460
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:31,776
Taking place but that's hidden from our eyes through the historical Veil right

2461
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:37,664
So when a Cyrus the Great all the sudden takes over the median Empire that looks like a lightning bolt strikes

2462
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:39,712
It's probably safe to assume

2463
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:42,272
Things have been leading up to this somehow for a while

2464
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:45,856
For a long time one of the things historians like to

2465
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:47,904
Suggest was percolating

2466
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:49,440
You know beneath the scene

2467
01:57:49,696 --> 01:57:51,744
But you couldn't see you with something like rot

2468
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,792
I guess you could say maybe moral

2469
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:54,560
Rot

2470
01:57:55,072 --> 01:57:56,352
This is something that is

2471
01:57:56,864 --> 01:58:03,008
Inner part of earlier histories and because it's impossible to quantify I mean we can even ask these questions a day is there any

2472
01:58:03,264 --> 01:58:05,312
Truth to the idea and we have by the way

2473
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:09,408
The older Generations in tougher times are tougher than we are today

2474
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:14,016
If there is any truth to that could that have been true in the past how would a historian even measure that

2475
01:58:14,784 --> 01:58:15,296
So they don't

2476
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:16,576
Anymore

2477
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:19,648
Writing in 1935 and I love him

2478
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:21,696
But it was written in 1935

2479
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:24,768
Historian will Durant tries to tie

2480
01:58:25,024 --> 01:58:28,864
Are the downfall of the medes to their moral degeneration

2481
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:30,656
And the fact that they were sort of

2482
01:58:30,912 --> 01:58:31,936
Nouveau riche

2483
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:33,216
He writes quote

2484
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:37,056
The generation was even more rapid than their rise

2485
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:41,152
Osteology who succeeded his father 3 accessories

2486
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:43,712
Proved again that monarchy is a Gamble

2487
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:48,320
In whose royal succession great wits and Madness are nearly alive

2488
01:58:48,832 --> 01:58:52,672
He inherited a kingdom with Equanimity and settle down to enjoy it

2489
01:58:52,928 --> 01:58:57,536
Under his example the nation for God it's turn morals and stoic ways

2490
01:58:57,792 --> 01:59:00,352
Well fed come to suddenly to be wisely used

2491
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:04,192
The upper classes became the slaves of fashion and luxury

2492
01:59:04,448 --> 01:59:09,824
The men wore embroidered trousers the women covered themselves with cosmetics and Jewelry

2493
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:12,640
The very horses were off in comparison to gold

2494
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:19,296
These once simple and pastoral people who have been glad to be carried in rude wagons with wheels cut roughly

2495
01:59:19,552 --> 01:59:20,576
Out of the trunks of trees

2496
01:59:20,832 --> 01:59:23,904
Now Road inexpensive chariots from Feast of Feasts

2497
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:25,184
And quote

2498
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:29,792
The truth is though that what Durand writes there in 1935

2499
01:59:30,048 --> 01:59:32,864
Isn't a whole lot different from what the ancient Greeks saw

2500
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:37,216
The ancient Greeks or the saw themselves as Marlboro Man

2501
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:40,288
Compared to these people from the East that were at best

2502
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:42,336
Citic metrosexuals

2503
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:46,944
The Greeks like to point out the use of makeup as part of their idea that these

2504
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:51,808
Easterners were effeminate writing hundreds of years later by the ways in a van talks about

2505
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:54,880
Osteology the last king of the medes and his

2506
01:59:55,392 --> 02:00:01,536
Guyliner I guess you would call it today his stencil dies the Rouge on his face and xenophon who would have no

2507
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:02,816
No way of knowing

2508
02:00:03,328 --> 02:00:03,840
Says

2509
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:05,632
A wig of fake hair

2510
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:07,680
Now here's the thing though

2511
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:09,472
In the east

2512
02:00:09,728 --> 02:00:15,872
These kinds of things were cultural norms it wasn't a sign of effeminacy of the Pharaohs and the Egyptians have been using the

2513
02:00:16,128 --> 02:00:18,432
Dark color around the Eyes Forever

2514
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:22,528
Just a different cultural thing that the Greeks Sade is just another sign

2515
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:24,576
Of these Oriental

2516
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:25,856
Effeminate

2517
02:00:26,624 --> 02:00:27,392
Opulent

2518
02:00:27,648 --> 02:00:28,160
Week

2519
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:31,488
Clever sneaky you know fill in the blank

2520
02:00:31,744 --> 02:00:32,512
Easterners

2521
02:00:34,048 --> 02:00:35,328
I will leave it to the

2522
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:38,656
Credible historians to decide someday

2523
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:42,240
Whether there's any truth to this Motif about the medes

2524
02:00:42,496 --> 02:00:43,008
Sort of

2525
02:00:43,264 --> 02:00:48,128
Slouching towards Gomorrah or what-have-you most of the modern stuff I read today look at that as a

2526
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:54,272
As a terribly old-fashioned way to view the situation but as I said how do you quantify something like that anyway

2527
02:00:54,784 --> 02:00:58,112
But if you follow that narrative the way of Godlike Herodotus is to

2528
02:00:58,368 --> 02:01:01,696
Taking it or guy like will Durant writing in 1935 is taking it

2529
02:01:02,208 --> 02:01:06,048
There's an almost opportunity created by the decadence of the meat

2530
02:01:06,304 --> 02:01:08,096
The cruelty of the ruler right

2531
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:12,192
And that can be exploited by somebody who has the opposite values

2532
02:01:12,448 --> 02:01:14,752
From the people that are busy slouching towards Gomorrah

2533
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:17,568
In other words people that were less corrupted by luxury

2534
02:01:17,824 --> 02:01:18,848
We're not as decadent

2535
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:21,152
Who were more shall we say

2536
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:24,224
Possessors of the old-time virtue

2537
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:31,904
And this gets us back to a secondary value that a guy like Herodotus has remember like I said he's like the color are the first

2538
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:32,928
Real screenwriter

2539
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:36,768
You know showrunner and and and you learn two things from a guy

2540
02:01:37,024 --> 02:01:39,584
Writing the way he writes in the way a lot of people after him

2541
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:42,400
One you learn about these events he's trying to relate to you

2542
02:01:42,912 --> 02:01:47,264
Which may or may not be true and are probably a combination of the two right we learned about

2543
02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:50,592
You know the rise of Cyrus at least the story that this guy her

2544
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:52,640
But at the same time

2545
02:01:52,896 --> 02:01:55,968
You're having like a Vulcan mind meld

2546
02:01:56,480 --> 02:02:00,832
With a 2500 year-old basically alien mine

2547
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:02,880
The one way

2548
02:02:03,136 --> 02:02:04,160
Conversation

2549
02:02:04,672 --> 02:02:06,720
With a 2500 year-old guy

2550
02:02:08,512 --> 02:02:10,304
And when you read Herodotus I

2551
02:02:11,584 --> 02:02:13,120
I really wish I could speak

2552
02:02:13,632 --> 02:02:15,424
The ancient Greek and read it

2553
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:21,824
And understand the little nuances so I could really hear this guy in his own words that he meant every specific word

2554
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:24,896
But you're getting a chance to see

2555
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:29,504
You know what this guy from a completely different time. Likes

2556
02:02:30,528 --> 02:02:31,040
And dislike

2557
02:02:32,832 --> 02:02:35,904
Is worldview what he thinks is good and what he thinks is bad

2558
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:39,744
You know his views sort of on the Supernatural and the Gods

2559
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,048
His biases and his prejudices

2560
02:02:43,328 --> 02:02:44,352
You're learning about

2561
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:47,680
He and his world when you read his stuff

2562
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:53,568
Why do I have to filter it so carefully because just like all of us his world pollutes his worldview so that

2563
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:55,104
You know we don't get as

2564
02:02:55,616 --> 02:02:57,408
Non-bias view now

2565
02:02:57,664 --> 02:02:58,688
As we might want

2566
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:01,760
But what Herodotus does in the story

2567
02:03:02,272 --> 02:03:06,368
Is kind of say that because osteology was the way he was

2568
02:03:06,624 --> 02:03:08,672
A Cyrus arises on the scene

2569
02:03:10,464 --> 02:03:16,608
Modern-day historians can't decide or argue over whether or not there was some War fought between

2570
02:03:16,864 --> 02:03:20,192
The medes and the Persians remember these are for the most part

2571
02:03:20,704 --> 02:03:23,776
Semi tribal peoples probably at this time

2572
02:03:24,032 --> 02:03:28,640
They used to think they were more like States now no one's sure maybe a combination of some cities

2573
02:03:28,896 --> 02:03:35,040
With some pastoral people that were lied to it it it's an interesting sort of hybrid and there might have been a lot of these kinds of us

2574
02:03:35,296 --> 02:03:37,600
Societies around back then when you're transitioning from

2575
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:44,256
You know an old tribal world to something more along the lines of a centralized bureaucratic State when you're inside of it a tween

2576
02:03:44,512 --> 02:03:46,048
Zone if you will

2577
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:50,912
Twitter war between these medes and Persians were the tribes that they controlled

2578
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:54,240
Or sort of like has one historian describes it

2579
02:03:55,008 --> 02:03:58,848
The midi and Empire getting a change in management

2580
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:03,200
With maybe some Maddie & Nobles

2581
02:04:03,456 --> 02:04:08,064
Helping to rebel against this osteology person in modern historians have some interesting

2582
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:11,648
Understandable should have common sense reasons why they might want to

2583
02:04:11,904 --> 02:04:17,280
The theory is that this osteitis guy is trying to convert them he's into more

2584
02:04:17,792 --> 02:04:21,632
Ava typical centralized Mesopotamian government

2585
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:26,496
Where the king is is more autocratic has a lot more Authority it sounds like maybe he has to share

2586
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:29,568
A lot of authority with these different tribal rulers

2587
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:33,152
And as you might imagine it's almost like a law of nature

2588
02:04:33,408 --> 02:04:35,456
They're unlikely to like that

2589
02:04:35,968 --> 02:04:41,856
This may have led some Modern historians think just sort of an uprising an internal coup if you will

2590
02:04:42,112 --> 02:04:44,672
And this Cyrus the second guy might be

2591
02:04:44,928 --> 02:04:46,976
The person who gets to lead this now

2592
02:04:48,512 --> 02:04:51,072
As the greatest early screenwriter

2593
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:55,424
Herodotus has his own view of sort of what turns the tables on

2594
02:04:56,448 --> 02:04:59,520
Now it's one of these stories that again maybe tells us more about

2595
02:04:59,776 --> 02:05:02,592
Herodotus and the audience he trying to please

2596
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:08,992
But he must have heard this story somewhere this is a typical tail by the way of Oriental cruelty

2597
02:05:09,248 --> 02:05:10,528
But he's setting up

2598
02:05:10,784 --> 02:05:15,648
Something that actually seems to happen in the story and trying to give you a reason why it happened

2599
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:19,232
Without having any real way of knowing other than these people he's talking to

2600
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:21,792
He tells one of the most horrific stories

2601
02:05:22,048 --> 02:05:22,816
In his writing

2602
02:05:23,072 --> 02:05:24,352
But he tells it like

2603
02:05:24,608 --> 02:05:25,632
Alfred Hitchcock

2604
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:28,960
Or Wes Craven or someone like that

2605
02:05:29,216 --> 02:05:33,568
We alluded to it earlier when we said than earlier story in those Skippy ins

2606
02:05:33,824 --> 02:05:37,664
You know kill the boy and served it to the Midian King and he didn't like that

2607
02:05:38,176 --> 02:05:38,944
Well in this

2608
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:44,320
Story it's that same thing but with an extra twist I have several different versions of Herodotus

2609
02:05:46,368 --> 02:05:48,160
But let me set this up what happens

2610
02:05:48,416 --> 02:05:49,440
In the story

2611
02:05:49,696 --> 02:05:55,840
Is it concerns this osteology is Guy the son of CX series and nowhere near his

2612
02:05:56,096 --> 02:05:59,680
His father in terms of greatness and in kind of a jerk and that's the way he's portraying

2613
02:06:00,448 --> 02:06:02,496
And he has a dream

2614
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:07,360
And these dreams you got to love ancient history cuz they're always so wild Herodotus related

2615
02:06:07,616 --> 02:06:10,432
The dream has something to do with his daughter

2616
02:06:10,688 --> 02:06:13,248
Urinating over the whole world or something

2617
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:15,040
As I said, love the engine history

2618
02:06:15,552 --> 02:06:21,696
And he asked the Magi to interpret it and they say very good this daughter is going to give birth

2619
02:06:21,952 --> 02:06:25,280
Bertha something or she's the seed of something that maybe going to overthrow you and so

2620
02:06:25,792 --> 02:06:26,560
Play it safe

2621
02:06:27,072 --> 02:06:29,632
Herodotus and he marries her off to some Persian

2622
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:36,544
You know maybe a great Persian guy but this is a median Empire and and no son of a Persian is going to be ruler

2623
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:41,664
Numidian Empire so that's been taken care of but then about a year later Herodotus says he has another dream

2624
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:42,944
His daughter

2625
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:46,272
Who's about to give birth to her first child in this dream

2626
02:06:46,784 --> 02:06:47,552
Ecu's

2627
02:06:47,808 --> 02:06:53,952
I think it's it's like vines coming out of her womb and then encompassing the whole earth or something again

2628
02:06:54,208 --> 02:06:54,720
Do that

2629
02:06:54,976 --> 02:06:58,560
And the Magi come in and interpret that and as you might imagine it's not good

2630
02:06:59,328 --> 02:07:04,960
And it scares osteology who thinks that she's his daughter is going to give birth to a person who takes his throne

2631
02:07:05,472 --> 02:07:07,008
Show me the story that you see

2632
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:09,056
Another tales in other words

2633
02:07:09,568 --> 02:07:12,384
It's a pretty common Motif with Different Twist

2634
02:07:13,152 --> 02:07:14,944
Osteology is called in a gym

2635
02:07:16,224 --> 02:07:16,992
A guy named Harper

2636
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:19,552
Who seems to be a historical figure

2637
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:21,856
And tells harpagus

2638
02:07:22,368 --> 02:07:23,392
To get rid of the baby

2639
02:07:24,672 --> 02:07:27,488
The Harper guess Herodotus doesn't want to get rid of the baby

2640
02:07:28,256 --> 02:07:29,792
Let me stop for a second

2641
02:07:30,048 --> 02:07:35,168
In the story Herodotus is lovingly telling the story he knows what the colorful

2642
02:07:35,424 --> 02:07:36,192
Pieces are

2643
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:40,800
And he says Harper guess it doesn't want to get rid of the baby Emily kill a baby

2644
02:07:41,056 --> 02:07:43,616
So we give the job to a shepherd

2645
02:07:44,128 --> 02:07:46,688
And give the shepherd the babies get rid of the baby

2646
02:07:46,944 --> 02:07:50,016
Expose it you know out into the open and let it die

2647
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:54,880
Emma Shepherd doesn't want to get rid of the baby and it just so happens his wife is pregnant

2648
02:07:55,392 --> 02:07:58,464
And she gives birth at just this time to a stillborn child

2649
02:07:58,976 --> 02:08:02,048
Doesn't sound like a bunch of old Grimm's Fairy Tales at this point

2650
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:03,072
So

2651
02:08:03,328 --> 02:08:07,424
As you might imagine they take the stillborn child wrap it in the Royal clothes

2652
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:13,824
Cheap alive when they were supposed to kill a give the stillborn child back to Harper gifts to give to his boss the Kings AC

2653
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:16,128
Fast forward

2654
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:18,688
Like 13 years later or something like that

2655
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:24,064
And a boy is brought before this is the hood rata two-story osteology because he's been whippin

2656
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:30,464
Little boys higher on the social standing scale than he after a bunch of questioning it is determined and again this

2657
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:33,792
Is the wonderfulness of the ancient mind-meld you're having with Herodotus

2658
02:08:34,048 --> 02:08:35,072
The basically

2659
02:08:35,584 --> 02:08:38,144
Asiatees can tell that this boy is a king

2660
02:08:38,656 --> 02:08:44,800
Like in your DNA you can tell the difference between Blue Bloods and now I'm Blue Blood by the way they just handle situations

2661
02:08:45,056 --> 02:08:45,568
Sodium bread

2662
02:08:46,336 --> 02:08:48,896
Besides that. The ig's notices that

2663
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:52,224
The kid looks like human after all he is his grandfather

2664
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:57,344
He calls in harpagus when he calls in the shepherd He does a little investigation figures the whole story out

2665
02:08:58,368 --> 02:09:00,672
And pretends he's not mad

2666
02:09:02,464 --> 02:09:04,000
Tell Harper I guess he's often felt

2667
02:09:04,256 --> 02:09:10,400
I'm paraphrasing here for productivity Patel's hard because he felt bad about the whole thing afterwards so he's he's secretly relieved

2668
02:09:10,912 --> 02:09:17,056
Did the whole thing went the way it did why don't you go home I'll tell your wife we're going to have a banquet to celebrate all this

2669
02:09:17,312 --> 02:09:19,104
You can come over and end with Will

2670
02:09:19,616 --> 02:09:25,504
Highlight you at the banquet send your son over your thirteen-year-old son so he can keep the new boy you know my grandson company

2671
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:27,552
And you know we'll have a party tonight

2672
02:09:28,064 --> 02:09:33,952
And Herodotus says that Harper just goes back home he's relieved cuz he knows he could have gotten in big trouble the wife is happy

2673
02:09:34,208 --> 02:09:35,232
And they go to this banquet

2674
02:09:35,488 --> 02:09:36,256
And this is where

2675
02:09:36,512 --> 02:09:41,120
Alfred Hitchcock Herodotus of halicarnassus takes the story over

2676
02:09:41,632 --> 02:09:45,472
And again I keep telling myself I don't think this is making this stuff up

2677
02:09:45,728 --> 02:09:46,496
Somebody

2678
02:09:46,752 --> 02:09:50,848
Little Kim this story this is what somebody somewhere believe

2679
02:09:51,872 --> 02:09:54,688
Now listen to this and try to imagine a story like this

2680
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:56,736
From the Assyrians

2681
02:09:57,248 --> 02:10:02,112
Were the Babylonians or the ancient Mesopotamians they just didn't write this way

2682
02:10:02,624 --> 02:10:04,416
The rocket has a story has

2683
02:10:04,672 --> 02:10:08,256
The 13 year old son of heart because going to the Palace as requested

2684
02:10:09,024 --> 02:10:10,560
And then picks up the story and says

2685
02:10:11,072 --> 02:10:14,656
This is from my de selincourt translation by the way

2686
02:10:15,424 --> 02:10:15,936
Quote

2687
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:18,496
When Harper gets his son arrived at the palace

2688
02:10:18,752 --> 02:10:20,288
Osteology had him butchered

2689
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:22,336
Cut up into joints and cooked

2690
02:10:22,848 --> 02:10:25,152
Roasting some boiling the rest

2691
02:10:25,408 --> 02:10:27,968
And having the whole properly prepared for the table

2692
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:30,528
Dinner time came in the guests Assemble

2693
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:32,064
With heart because among them

2694
02:10:32,576 --> 02:10:35,904
Dishes of mutton were placed in front of Osteology is everyone else

2695
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:39,744
The Harper guess was served the Flesh of his son

2696
02:10:40,256 --> 02:10:40,768
All of it

2697
02:10:41,024 --> 02:10:43,584
Except for the head the hands and feet

2698
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:45,632
What you been put separately on a platter

2699
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:46,656
Covered with a lid

2700
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:52,288
When Harper gets started eating as much as he wanted I see I just asked him if he did enjoy this dinner

2701
02:10:52,544 --> 02:10:54,848
He answered that he enjoyed it very much indeed

2702
02:10:55,104 --> 02:10:58,176
Whereupon those whose business it was to do so

2703
02:10:58,432 --> 02:11:01,760
Brought in the boy's head hands and feet in the covered dish

2704
02:11:02,016 --> 02:11:03,808
Stood by har Pegasus chair

2705
02:11:04,064 --> 02:11:06,880
And told him to lift the lid and take what he fancied

2706
02:11:07,392 --> 02:11:10,720
Harper just remove the cover and saw the fragments of his son's body

2707
02:11:11,488 --> 02:11:15,328
Has he kept control of himself and did not lose his head it's a dreadful sight

2708
02:11:15,584 --> 02:11:19,168
Osteology asked him if he knew what animal it was whose fleshy and just eating

2709
02:11:19,936 --> 02:11:22,496
I know my Lord was Harper gets his reply

2710
02:11:22,752 --> 02:11:25,056
And for my part May the Kings will be done

2711
02:11:25,568 --> 02:11:29,408
He said no other word but took up what remained of the Flesh and went home

2712
02:11:29,664 --> 02:11:32,224
Intending I supposed to bury all of it together

2713
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:34,272
And that was how Harper yes was pun

2714
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:35,552
And quote

2715
02:11:37,088 --> 02:11:40,416
If that'd been in the Syrian record it would have said something like

2716
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:45,792
His son I divided the pieces I fed to him I mean it would be a straightforward sort of thing

2717
02:11:46,048 --> 02:11:49,376
You wouldn't have anybody setting up the suspense of

2718
02:11:49,632 --> 02:11:55,776
You know having him eat and not know what it is and then having the platter brought in having the king asked the question do you know what you

2719
02:11:56,032 --> 02:12:01,408
Did you like it and then the platters lifted up I mean those moments where you set up the tension in the drama

2720
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:02,432
It's

2721
02:12:02,688 --> 02:12:03,456
A movie

2722
02:12:04,736 --> 02:12:06,016
You could do that

2723
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:08,576
Movie and change nothing

2724
02:12:10,624 --> 02:12:11,392
Living Color

2725
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:14,464
What's more Herodotus is

2726
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:20,352
Clearly setting up these moments for his audience to do the equivalent of what we would do in a movie theater one

2727
02:12:20,608 --> 02:12:21,888
Some great seen on the

2728
02:12:22,144 --> 02:12:28,288
Screen happens that we're all really glad to see in you clap or something he's got these moments cuz when you make iced tea ig's out to be such

2729
02:12:28,544 --> 02:12:29,056
Jerk

2730
02:12:29,568 --> 02:12:32,640
And he gets what's coming to him in the story it's a crowd-pleaser

2731
02:12:33,408 --> 02:12:35,200
And in this story of course he does

2732
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:42,624
And while it's tempting to think that the entire thing is just a great tale somebody's brake tail maybe not Herodotus is initially

2733
02:12:43,136 --> 02:12:48,000
There are definite facts mixed in and you can see Herodotus trying to explain

2734
02:12:48,256 --> 02:12:50,048
The reasons behind the facts

2735
02:12:50,304 --> 02:12:53,120
Text today maybe a screenwriter would call it dramatic license

2736
02:12:54,144 --> 02:12:55,936
Because Babylonian records indicate

2737
02:12:56,448 --> 02:12:57,984
That there was

2738
02:12:58,240 --> 02:13:01,312
A general who corresponds to this harpagus guy

2739
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:06,432
And the. General was involved in a Battlefield

2740
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:08,992
Betrayal maybe you could say

2741
02:13:10,272 --> 02:13:12,832
In a key battle osteology had

2742
02:13:13,344 --> 02:13:15,136
A large part of his army

2743
02:13:15,648 --> 02:13:18,464
Desert him on the battlefield and go to the other side

2744
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,816
It very well may have been this harpagus person

2745
02:13:23,328 --> 02:13:24,608
Who led them to do that

2746
02:13:25,888 --> 02:13:27,680
And Herodotus want you to think

2747
02:13:28,448 --> 02:13:29,472
Dead Sea

2748
02:13:29,728 --> 02:13:30,752
He was a jerk

2749
02:13:31,264 --> 02:13:32,544
And now this is what he get

2750
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:37,408
That's an end who would think that you could trust a man whose son you had served him for dinner

2751
02:13:37,664 --> 02:13:40,736
With the entire Army in the first place but none the less

2752
02:13:41,248 --> 02:13:47,392
The moment when Harper guess and the Meads cross over to Cyrus's side of the battlefield must have been a crowd-pleasing

2753
02:13:47,648 --> 02:13:48,160
Satisfying

2754
02:13:48,672 --> 02:13:49,184
The audience right

2755
02:13:50,208 --> 02:13:51,488
Jerk got what he deserved

2756
02:13:52,256 --> 02:13:56,096
In the Babylonian records it's much more Stark as you might imagine

2757
02:13:57,120 --> 02:13:57,888
One of the texts

2758
02:13:58,144 --> 02:14:00,448
From Babylon as quoted by Pierre Briand

2759
02:14:01,216 --> 02:14:01,728
Reeds

2760
02:14:01,984 --> 02:14:02,496
Quote

2761
02:14:03,008 --> 02:14:06,592
Osteology has mobilized his army and he marched against Cyrus

2762
02:14:06,848 --> 02:14:08,384
King of on Shonda conquer

2763
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:11,968
The Army rebelled against osteology and he was taken prisoner

2764
02:14:12,224 --> 02:14:14,016
They handed him over to Cyrus

2765
02:14:14,272 --> 02:14:17,344
Cyrus March towards ekbatan on the Royal City

2766
02:14:18,112 --> 02:14:18,624
And quote

2767
02:14:19,392 --> 02:14:22,208
By 550 BCE or thereabouts

2768
02:14:22,976 --> 02:14:23,744
Cyrus

2769
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,024
And the Persians

2770
02:14:25,792 --> 02:14:31,936
We're basically in control of the old elamite territories and now heading heritage

2771
02:14:32,448 --> 02:14:34,752
Control of the Madea and Empire

2772
02:14:35,008 --> 02:14:39,872
Which was already one of the great empires in this particular World stage

2773
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:45,760
It's kind of possible that the lydian came for example

2774
02:14:46,016 --> 02:14:46,784
Wedding

2775
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:47,808
3 years

2776
02:14:48,064 --> 02:14:49,344
Cyrus will be at war with

2777
02:14:49,856 --> 02:14:54,464
Doesn't even really have a key idea who the Persians are I'm not sure but I mean

2778
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:56,512
Judging from the sources this is

2779
02:14:57,024 --> 02:14:57,792
Quite the turnaround

2780
02:14:58,048 --> 02:14:58,560
Ground

2781
02:14:58,816 --> 02:15:01,120
And as I said in 547

2782
02:15:01,376 --> 02:15:04,448
Cyrus and the new Persian Empire

2783
02:15:04,704 --> 02:15:08,288
Is fighting those same people that means were fighting when that eclipse

2784
02:15:08,544 --> 02:15:11,104
You know caused everyone to think that maybe they shouldn't be fighting

2785
02:15:11,872 --> 02:15:14,176
And it's a great story cuz the guy who runs

2786
02:15:14,432 --> 02:15:20,576
The lydian Empire now at this time is a gun increases and there's a saying about him you may have heard rich as

2787
02:15:20,832 --> 02:15:21,344
Croesus

2788
02:15:21,856 --> 02:15:24,416
And that's the stereotype of the lady into this time

2789
02:15:24,928 --> 02:15:26,464
As I said they're known

2790
02:15:26,720 --> 02:15:29,280
As people who invented metal coinage

2791
02:15:30,048 --> 02:15:36,192
It's really true or not but that's their reputation and it's attached to them because they're in a thought to be extremely wealthy

2792
02:15:37,728 --> 02:15:43,872
Increases is supposed to have gone to one of the famous oracles maybe the most famous Oracle in

2793
02:15:44,128 --> 02:15:45,408
The entire Greek world

2794
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:47,712
The Oracle at Delphi

2795
02:15:48,224 --> 02:15:49,760
Which he may have been giving

2796
02:15:50,016 --> 02:15:56,160
Money to influence it was a whole big problem during this. We're some questioned the reliability of these oracles

2797
02:15:56,416 --> 02:15:57,184
Can you imagine

2798
02:15:57,696 --> 02:16:00,256
Because of them taking money to keep operating

2799
02:16:00,512 --> 02:16:04,864
People increases with Richie gave money to everybody a little Donald Trump issue maybe you might say

2800
02:16:05,376 --> 02:16:06,400
And

2801
02:16:06,656 --> 02:16:07,936
Ask the oracle

2802
02:16:09,216 --> 02:16:13,312
You know now what would happen if I went to war with the Persian Empire

2803
02:16:14,592 --> 02:16:15,104
No

2804
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:16,128
Lucite tray

2805
02:16:16,640 --> 02:16:17,408
Maybe only

2806
02:16:17,664 --> 02:16:19,200
Worthwhile for the bedding people

2807
02:16:19,456 --> 02:16:20,224
Amongst you

2808
02:16:20,992 --> 02:16:23,296
But if you went to an advisor

2809
02:16:23,552 --> 02:16:26,624
In Las Vegas who gave you betting advice and you said

2810
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:28,928
Will the Green Bay Packers

2811
02:16:29,184 --> 02:16:31,488
Win the Superbowl and the answer was

2812
02:16:32,256 --> 02:16:34,816
If the Green Bay Packers play in the Super Bowl

2813
02:16:35,072 --> 02:16:37,120
They will add to a great legacy

2814
02:16:37,632 --> 02:16:38,400
Do you bet

2815
02:16:39,680 --> 02:16:42,752
Creases was told by the Oracle at Delphi

2816
02:16:43,008 --> 02:16:47,360
They have creases attacks the Persians he will destroy a great Empire

2817
02:16:48,896 --> 02:16:51,712
You can take that a number of different ways couldn't you

2818
02:16:52,736 --> 02:16:57,344
You can say hey the Green Bay Packers are going to win or you can say listen at the Dallas Cowboys

2819
02:16:57,600 --> 02:16:59,136
Beat the Green Bay Packers

2820
02:16:59,648 --> 02:17:00,928
They've added to a great

2821
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:03,232
Championship Legacy 2

2822
02:17:03,488 --> 02:17:06,304
It's just the Dallas Cowboys championship Legacy

2823
02:17:07,072 --> 02:17:09,120
When creases and the lydians

2824
02:17:09,376 --> 02:17:09,888
Fight

2825
02:17:10,144 --> 02:17:11,424
Cyrus and the Persians

2826
02:17:12,448 --> 02:17:13,216
He loses

2827
02:17:13,984 --> 02:17:15,264
Who destroys a great Empire

2828
02:17:16,032 --> 02:17:17,824
The one that invented metal coinage

2829
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:23,456
I would love to get into the kind of army that Cyrus had and what he used

2830
02:17:23,712 --> 02:17:25,760
To accomplish this victory over the libyans butt

2831
02:17:26,528 --> 02:17:28,832
The achaemenid military system

2832
02:17:29,088 --> 02:17:35,232
Is not well understood anyway it was only in the 1980s that they started putting together realistic reconstruct

2833
02:17:35,488 --> 02:17:36,256
Sections of the army

2834
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:37,280
In the days

2835
02:17:37,536 --> 02:17:41,376
That are much better known than this. I mean during the Greek and Persian Wars or after

2836
02:17:41,632 --> 02:17:45,216
Against Alexander in this. It's all conjecture what the heck

2837
02:17:45,728 --> 02:17:50,848
Cyrus was using I mean you can say well you probably use this and it's logical to assume that but nobody knows

2838
02:17:52,896 --> 02:17:56,736
When you read Herodotus he's always got some little stratagem

2839
02:17:56,992 --> 02:17:59,040
In play the keeps you from having to know

2840
02:17:59,296 --> 02:18:02,112
In a really what the Army was doing in one of these big battles against creases

2841
02:18:02,624 --> 02:18:05,696
You're the Persians were told will take their baggage camels

2842
02:18:05,952 --> 02:18:10,048
And take the baggage off of them and put them in front of the army so that when the lady in horses

2843
02:18:10,304 --> 02:18:15,936
Never seen camels ride up to the front will be scared off by the camels I mean are you get a victory the battle just with that

2844
02:18:16,192 --> 02:18:17,472
Uno

2845
02:18:17,728 --> 02:18:22,336
Much about an army that must have been really really good to do all these things Cyrus was doing with

2846
02:18:24,384 --> 02:18:26,688
He does look like a very bold Commander

2847
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:29,760
From the sources I mean one of the things are audited talks about

2848
02:18:30,016 --> 02:18:32,576
Is this what we call it a misunderstanding

2849
02:18:32,832 --> 02:18:34,112
Between croesus and Cyrus

2850
02:18:34,368 --> 02:18:34,880
After this

2851
02:18:35,136 --> 02:18:37,184
Big battle that starts off the campaign and

2852
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:38,976
It's bloody and inconclusive in

2853
02:18:39,232 --> 02:18:44,608
Winter's coming so creases does with any ancient Commander would have done during that. He went home

2854
02:18:45,376 --> 02:18:48,448
Went to the capital that starred at this giant fortified City in

2855
02:18:48,704 --> 02:18:51,520
Dismissed his mercenaries and let most of the army go home

2856
02:18:51,776 --> 02:18:52,800
And told his allies

2857
02:18:53,056 --> 02:18:55,616
You know in four months show up here and we'll deal with this

2858
02:18:55,872 --> 02:18:57,152
Emerging Persian threat

2859
02:18:57,920 --> 02:18:59,200
Is All Eyez by the way including

2860
02:18:59,712 --> 02:19:01,504
The great Powers Babylonia

2861
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:04,576
An Egypt so maybe Cyrus was starting to be seen as

2862
02:19:05,088 --> 02:19:07,392
The destabilizing force in that little

2863
02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:09,696
Geopolitical ecosystem

2864
02:19:10,208 --> 02:19:11,744
In that part of the world nonetheless

2865
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:13,280
Cyrus didn't

2866
02:19:13,536 --> 02:19:14,048
Disband

2867
02:19:15,072 --> 02:19:21,216
He didn't go home for winter he were told pursued the lydians right on their heels this is bold strategy

2868
02:19:21,984 --> 02:19:23,264
Any forced another battle

2869
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:27,104
And we're told it was after creases that already basically sent most of the people home

2870
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:30,944
The person win that battle ain't got the camel battle

2871
02:19:31,712 --> 02:19:34,272
Anime faces monsters fortification

2872
02:19:34,528 --> 02:19:39,904
At Sardis the capital of Libya that could easily hold out until all those Ally show up in four months you would think

2873
02:19:40,672 --> 02:19:42,720
We're told it holds up like 14 days

2874
02:19:43,232 --> 02:19:45,024
Again we have another Herodotus story

2875
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:48,352
About a S8 back path to the

2876
02:19:48,608 --> 02:19:54,752
Citadel being found by a Persian who spies one of the guards hats falling off helmets falling off in the guard

2877
02:19:55,008 --> 02:19:56,032
Retrieving it down some

2878
02:19:56,288 --> 02:19:57,056
Unipath again

2879
02:19:57,824 --> 02:20:00,384
You wouldn't know about what amazing Siege engine

2880
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:04,224
Maybe Cyrus had because we always have some little story that accounts for

2881
02:20:04,736 --> 02:20:08,832
How one of the great fortified cities in this part of the world gets taken in 14 days

2882
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:11,136
Nonetheless we also get

2883
02:20:11,648 --> 02:20:17,024
Some accounts now of of of something we spoke in about about how the Persians maybe like Darth Vader to the Greeks

2884
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:20,864
But they have something in and you know you don't know if you want to call this

2885
02:20:21,376 --> 02:20:22,400
Propaganda

2886
02:20:23,168 --> 02:20:24,704
Or a sincere

2887
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:29,056
And clever and Common Sense and realistic approach to things

2888
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:31,104
So take it away

2889
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:34,176
Shall we call it the tolerance bomb

2890
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:35,712
Which hole

2891
02:20:35,968 --> 02:20:37,760
Diodorus siculus especially dimensions

2892
02:20:38,016 --> 02:20:43,392
It's Cyrus gave a deal to the lydians before this whole thing started he said listen submit to me

2893
02:20:43,904 --> 02:20:45,696
And I'll leave you in charge of this whole area

2894
02:20:45,952 --> 02:20:49,024
It's basically the same deal Xerxes offered the

2895
02:20:49,536 --> 02:20:52,864
Spartans at Thermopylae come on let's make a deal on those weapons and

2896
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:54,912
Not only will you get to go home

2897
02:20:55,168 --> 02:20:57,472
I'll put you in charge of all these people you'll benefit

2898
02:20:58,496 --> 02:20:59,776
Submit and profit

2899
02:21:00,032 --> 02:21:01,312
Maybe you can call

2900
02:21:01,568 --> 02:21:03,360
This combination of

2901
02:21:03,872 --> 02:21:04,384
Sort of

2902
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:06,688
Machiavellian thinking

2903
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:11,552
With a sort of Gandhi like ethic that's going too far but I love the

2904
02:21:11,808 --> 02:21:12,576
Connection

2905
02:21:13,344 --> 02:21:15,392
A realistic hard-headed

2906
02:21:15,648 --> 02:21:18,464
Knife in the back sort of diplomacy

2907
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:22,560
With tolerance and mercy and leniency as your weapon

2908
02:21:24,096 --> 02:21:25,120
Nike with leniency

2909
02:21:26,912 --> 02:21:29,216
And you know you would have to suggest perhaps

2910
02:21:29,984 --> 02:21:32,800
That there were two ways this lenient idea could go

2911
02:21:33,312 --> 02:21:35,360
Either not work at all

2912
02:21:35,616 --> 02:21:38,432
And then you see why the Assyrians had to be as harsh as they were

2913
02:21:38,688 --> 02:21:43,040
Or because the Assyrians were as harsh as they were in the Babylonians who followed after them

2914
02:21:43,552 --> 02:21:45,344
The area was right

2915
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:46,368
For somebody

2916
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:52,256
Who would offer if everybody was going to be under somebody's control when do you want to go with the tolerance guy

2917
02:21:53,024 --> 02:21:55,328
Remember we are grading on a curve here

2918
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:57,376
Let me talk about tolerance

2919
02:21:58,144 --> 02:22:00,448
The Persians could be every bit as atrocious

2920
02:22:00,704 --> 02:22:03,264
As any other ancient people on occasion

2921
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:06,080
It just seemed like once they took over there were a lot

2922
02:22:06,336 --> 02:22:07,616
Fewer of those occasions

2923
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:11,712
Maybe the historians are some of them that I grew up with would say something like

2924
02:22:11,968 --> 02:22:14,016
Well that's because the Assyrians already broke all the trouble

2925
02:22:14,272 --> 02:22:15,296
Some people to the yolk of Empire

2926
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:16,832
Seems a bit

2927
02:22:17,344 --> 02:22:18,112
Far-fetched

2928
02:22:19,648 --> 02:22:21,184
Certainly you can say though

2929
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:26,816
That the whole sort of mood and attitude was altered and you don't get anymore

2930
02:22:27,328 --> 02:22:30,912
Are those really intimidating reliefs showing things like

2931
02:22:31,168 --> 02:22:33,728
You know heads of your enemies staring up at you

2932
02:22:33,984 --> 02:22:36,032
Or horrible violence of the flaying of

2933
02:22:36,544 --> 02:22:42,688
Live captives and you don't get the the writings where there's a boasting and a propaganda Valley

2934
02:22:42,944 --> 02:22:44,992
Are you where you're saying this is what will happen to you

2935
02:22:45,248 --> 02:22:46,784
If you rebel against us

2936
02:22:47,296 --> 02:22:48,320
Rhesus argami

2937
02:22:48,576 --> 02:22:49,088
Quotes

2938
02:22:49,344 --> 02:22:55,232
Leave rassam cylinder it's called and it's ashurbanipal the last great king of Assyria boasting of what he did

2939
02:22:55,488 --> 02:22:57,792
To Babylon after his brother

2940
02:22:58,048 --> 02:23:00,608
Please put on the throne of Babylon rebelled against him

2941
02:23:01,632 --> 02:23:03,680
In 6:49 BCE

2942
02:23:04,192 --> 02:23:04,704
Firsties

2943
02:23:04,960 --> 02:23:07,520
Besiege the people until they were cannibalistic

2944
02:23:08,288 --> 02:23:10,080
And then picks up in there it is saying quote

2945
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:14,944
Out of hunger the Flesh of their sons and daughters day 8

2946
02:23:15,456 --> 02:23:20,832
Afterwards I ripped out the tongue of those officers whose mouths had blasphemed against Asher

2947
02:23:21,088 --> 02:23:22,880
My master and then slaughtered them

2948
02:23:23,136 --> 02:23:29,280
Any soldiers found still alive we're flawed in front of the wing it bowls built by Sinatra with my grandfather

2949
02:23:29,792 --> 02:23:32,096
I whipped them on sennacherib Tomb

2950
02:23:32,352 --> 02:23:34,656
And then tossed their quivering flesh for The Jacka

2951
02:23:34,912 --> 02:23:36,192
The birds and the fish to eat

2952
02:23:36,704 --> 02:23:40,544
In this way I placated the Wrath of the Gods would become incensed

2953
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:42,080
Spider ignominious bee

2954
02:23:43,872 --> 02:23:45,152
Prince argami picks up

2955
02:23:45,664 --> 02:23:47,200
The Narrative saying quote

2956
02:23:47,712 --> 02:23:53,856
This grisly passage related to events that transpired in Babylon precedes a brief description

2957
02:23:54,112 --> 02:23:57,696
Section of the restorative work that I sure banipal undertook in that City

2958
02:23:58,208 --> 02:24:03,328
That the Assyrian King was unabashedly about intertwining the account of his brutality

2959
02:24:03,584 --> 02:24:05,120
Without of his clemency

2960
02:24:05,376 --> 02:24:11,520
Indicates that Mesopotamian royalty did not frown upon the infliction of vicious reprisals against Concord pop

2961
02:24:11,776 --> 02:24:12,288
Populations

2962
02:24:12,544 --> 02:24:15,872
This attitude enabled the Assyrian and Babylonian Kings

2963
02:24:16,128 --> 02:24:18,688
To base their policies largely on terror

2964
02:24:18,944 --> 02:24:25,088
During the two centuries preceding Cyrus's rise to power the Assyrians and Babylonians hits act nearly

2965
02:24:25,344 --> 02:24:27,136
Every major near Eastern capital

2966
02:24:27,392 --> 02:24:32,512
Enter preferred practices of population deportation and kidnapping sacred images

2967
02:24:32,768 --> 02:24:35,584
A deeply traumatized the people of the ancient near East

2968
02:24:36,352 --> 02:24:36,864
And quote

2969
02:24:37,632 --> 02:24:38,656
In other words

2970
02:24:39,424 --> 02:24:43,264
If you had ever wanted to find a winning military strategy

2971
02:24:43,776 --> 02:24:45,568
This might be the time

2972
02:24:45,824 --> 02:24:46,592
Where Mercy

2973
02:24:46,848 --> 02:24:48,128
Tolerance and being

2974
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:50,176
The cool conquerors

2975
02:24:50,432 --> 02:24:51,712
Really worked in your favor

2976
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:56,064
Cyrus is the one who initiates this idea

2977
02:24:56,576 --> 02:24:57,088
That

2978
02:24:58,368 --> 02:25:00,160
We're not going to impale everybody

2979
02:25:00,416 --> 02:25:04,512
And we're not going to play them and we're not going to force them to convert to our religion

2980
02:25:05,024 --> 02:25:06,304
You join us

2981
02:25:06,816 --> 02:25:08,096
Pay your taxes

2982
02:25:08,352 --> 02:25:11,424
I may have some representatives in a Garrison in your city

2983
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:14,496
But life will be good this Persian deal

2984
02:25:14,752 --> 02:25:16,032
Was very seductive

2985
02:25:17,568 --> 02:25:18,080
Now

2986
02:25:18,592 --> 02:25:22,432
Here's where the Story begins to dovetail with what we've already talked

2987
02:25:22,688 --> 02:25:23,200
About earlier

2988
02:25:24,224 --> 02:25:26,272
The peoples that we spoke about

2989
02:25:26,784 --> 02:25:27,552
These Greeks

2990
02:25:28,064 --> 02:25:30,368
Who were in Anatolia

2991
02:25:30,624 --> 02:25:34,464
Spoken language that was called ionian so they're often called ionia's but they were

2992
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:36,512
Other types of Greeks there too

2993
02:25:36,768 --> 02:25:37,792
Asiatic Greek

2994
02:25:38,048 --> 02:25:39,328
Pictures of turn that sometimes used

2995
02:25:39,584 --> 02:25:41,632
These people have been paying tribute

2996
02:25:41,888 --> 02:25:48,032
Two creases in the lydians and Cyrus had gone to them before the war with creases in the lydians and said listen

2997
02:25:48,544 --> 02:25:49,824
How about you revolting

2998
02:25:50,336 --> 02:25:52,128
Croesus and they said no

2999
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:58,784
And some of them foreign creases aside so after Cyrus wins all the people in the region are coming to him to kind of say hey boss

3000
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:02,368
I was wanted you to win I'm glad I'm glad you're Victorious and.

3001
02:26:02,624 --> 02:26:06,464
In the case of these Greeks they went to him and said can we have the same deal we had with

3002
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:07,488
The lydians

3003
02:26:08,256 --> 02:26:14,400
And Cyrus gets mad at me which hole he basically says you could have had that deal if you join me and didn't fight against me now you will

3004
02:26:14,656 --> 02:26:15,680
Want a special deal

3005
02:26:15,936 --> 02:26:18,496
Over all the other people in this region who didn't fight against me

3006
02:26:20,544 --> 02:26:21,568
And got mad

3007
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:25,408
And those Greeks went back home had a big meeting amongst each other

3008
02:26:25,664 --> 02:26:30,784
Started rebuilding the walls of their cities which they had knocked down it in as part of their deal with creases

3009
02:26:32,064 --> 02:26:33,344
And put the word out

3010
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:34,112
For help

3011
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:36,416
And they sent word to the Spartan

3012
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:37,952
Now

3013
02:26:38,208 --> 02:26:41,792
The Spartans had also promised help to croesus when he was

3014
02:26:42,304 --> 02:26:43,072
In trouble

3015
02:26:43,584 --> 02:26:49,728
Supposedly they were just getting in the boats getting ready to go help when in 14 days the lydian capital Falls

3016
02:26:49,984 --> 02:26:51,264
Didn't give him enough time to get there

3017
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:52,544
Now they get

3018
02:26:53,056 --> 02:26:55,872
You know in a very short period of time a second call

3019
02:26:56,384 --> 02:26:58,176
For helping this time from Greeks

3020
02:26:59,712 --> 02:27:05,856
It's about the Persians just like that last all these Persians must be a Troublesome people the Spartans were a little busy

3021
02:27:06,112 --> 02:27:07,392
When the message came

3022
02:27:07,648 --> 02:27:09,952
But they sent an emissary

3023
02:27:10,208 --> 02:27:15,072
To talk to this Persian now every historian I'm reading is assuming that these Persians

3024
02:27:15,328 --> 02:27:16,864
Any Spartans do not know each

3025
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:22,240
Did this may be the first time they ever encounter one another

3026
02:27:22,496 --> 02:27:26,080
And it seems The Logical considering all the trading and what not going on

3027
02:27:26,336 --> 02:27:27,360
But let's understand

3028
02:27:28,128 --> 02:27:30,432
Best case scenario it's unusual

3029
02:27:30,688 --> 02:27:32,224
Chinese people don't really know each other

3030
02:27:32,736 --> 02:27:38,368
Any Spartan Diplomat shows up in front of Cyrus were told him we have one of these wonderful.

3031
02:27:40,160 --> 02:27:41,952
We can imagine our

3032
02:27:42,976 --> 02:27:45,280
Clint Eastwood type figure showing up

3033
02:27:45,792 --> 02:27:47,072
In front of this

3034
02:27:47,328 --> 02:27:51,168
King on the rise again I try to imagine in Alexander the Great life

3035
02:27:51,424 --> 02:27:53,216
Like figure on the rise

3036
02:27:54,496 --> 02:28:00,640
Must have been a pretty good-looking guy cuz we're told that the Persians standards of beauty were modeled on him ever after

3037
02:28:00,896 --> 02:28:01,408
Words

3038
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:04,736
This is the way Herodotus

3039
02:28:05,504 --> 02:28:08,320
From my purpose translation describes

3040
02:28:08,832 --> 02:28:10,112
The Diplomat

3041
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:11,648
Talking to

3042
02:28:11,904 --> 02:28:12,416
Peking

3043
02:28:12,672 --> 02:28:14,720
Of the Persians was just conquered Lydia

3044
02:28:14,976 --> 02:28:18,560
I was just about to put the hammer down on the Greeks of Asia

3045
02:28:19,584 --> 02:28:20,096
Herodotus

3046
02:28:20,352 --> 02:28:20,864
Quote

3047
02:28:21,888 --> 02:28:28,032
And when they arrived at the Kia they sent the most distinguished man with them name Lecrae needs to start is to declare desyrel

3048
02:28:28,544 --> 02:28:34,688
In the name of the lack of the mountains that he must not inflict Reckless damage on any of the Greek territory

3049
02:28:34,944 --> 02:28:36,992
Since the lack of demonion would not tolerate

3050
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:39,808
Remember liking ammonium is another name for spark

3051
02:28:40,832 --> 02:28:46,976
Now this people that Cyrus has never heard of it's just told him not to mess with any of these people he just

3052
02:28:47,232 --> 02:28:47,744
Concord

3053
02:28:48,512 --> 02:28:51,840
And he basically turns to the Greek advisor next to him and says

3054
02:28:52,352 --> 02:28:54,912
Who are these people and how many of them are there

3055
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:56,960
Herodotus is quote

3056
02:28:57,472 --> 02:29:00,288
They say that when the herald had delivered this message

3057
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:03,104
Cyrus question the Greeks who were with him

3058
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:08,224
Asking them who were these like a demoney and who would send such a command to him

3059
02:29:08,480 --> 02:29:10,016
And how many of them were there

3060
02:29:10,528 --> 02:29:14,880
When he heard their response Herodotus says he said to the Spartan Harold quote

3061
02:29:15,392 --> 02:29:20,000
I have never yet feared any men who have a place in the center of the city

3062
02:29:20,256 --> 02:29:21,792
Set aside for meeting together

3063
02:29:22,304 --> 02:29:24,864
Swearing false Oaths and cheating one another

3064
02:29:25,120 --> 02:29:26,656
And if I live long enough

3065
02:29:26,912 --> 02:29:29,984
Leica demonion will have troubles of their own about which the converse

3066
02:29:30,240 --> 02:29:31,776
Rather than those of the ionian

3067
02:29:33,312 --> 02:29:34,592
Herodotus then says

3068
02:29:35,104 --> 02:29:41,248
Quote Cyrus that insulted the Greeks because of their custom of setting up agoura's which are Market play

3069
02:29:41,504 --> 02:29:44,576
Places in their cities for the purpose of buying and selling

3070
02:29:44,832 --> 02:29:50,976
Which is unknown among the Persians who do not use markets and indeed have no such place as an Agora in any of

3071
02:29:51,232 --> 02:29:51,744
Their cities

3072
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:52,512
And quote

3073
02:29:54,560 --> 02:29:58,912
This is worth a little digression for a second just from an interest standpoint first of all

3074
02:29:59,424 --> 02:30:01,216
Herodotus would have probably known

3075
02:30:01,472 --> 02:30:02,752
What person cities were like

3076
02:30:03,008 --> 02:30:03,776
He himself

3077
02:30:04,032 --> 02:30:10,176
Was an ionian Greek or lived in an ionian Greek city he would have known this and that's fascinating when you consider that you think of

3078
02:30:10,432 --> 02:30:13,760
The Middle East now and you think of the bazaars in the marketplace isn't all that

3079
02:30:14,272 --> 02:30:17,088
But the Persians had this really interesting

3080
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:18,624
Cultural

3081
02:30:19,136 --> 02:30:24,000
Carrot and stick thing going themselves and we talked about the human laboratory experiment few times in this

3082
02:30:24,256 --> 02:30:24,768
Burn like a spark

3083
02:30:26,304 --> 02:30:29,888
The Persians had a different one going and it's fascinating to me

3084
02:30:30,400 --> 02:30:35,264
Everything you read about them says that you know of the top three things that that Society

3085
02:30:35,776 --> 02:30:38,592
Places import on one of them is the truth

3086
02:30:39,872 --> 02:30:46,016
And if anything is in our world today we think oh yes sure everybody should tell the truth but what if you made this like a command

3087
02:30:46,272 --> 02:30:46,784
Management

3088
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:50,624
The people took Ultra seriously we told you earlier that when the

3089
02:30:50,880 --> 02:30:54,208
Spartan told Xerxes about the Persians he said if I'm lying

3090
02:30:54,464 --> 02:30:55,744
You treat me like a liar

3091
02:30:56,000 --> 02:31:00,096
And and I told you that that's a death penalty the Persians took lying really seriously

3092
02:31:01,632 --> 02:31:04,704
We're told that the education of Persian male youth was

3093
02:31:05,216 --> 02:31:09,312
To learn to ride to learn to shoot the bow and to learn not to lie

3094
02:31:10,080 --> 02:31:10,848
To tell the truth

3095
02:31:12,384 --> 02:31:15,968
Isn't it fascinating to imagine a society where this was both

3096
02:31:16,224 --> 02:31:21,600
A state and legal requirement for hats and certainly a heavily

3097
02:31:22,368 --> 02:31:27,232
Encouraged and incentivised cultural norm thou shalt not lie

3098
02:31:27,488 --> 02:31:30,560
You know most becomes like the plot to one of those movies you know where

3099
02:31:30,816 --> 02:31:36,960
The main character drink some potion and all of a sudden you know was forced to tell the truth all the time what if you had a society like that

3100
02:31:37,216 --> 02:31:43,360
What Cyrus is saying to the Spartans is I can't respect any people who have these places in their cities

3101
02:31:43,872 --> 02:31:46,944
Set up where people can specifically go to lie to one another

3102
02:31:48,224 --> 02:31:54,368
And by the way without going too deeply into it there's a lot of connection to Persian religious beliefs during this time.

3103
02:31:54,624 --> 02:31:57,184
And how that plays into the question of lying

3104
02:31:58,208 --> 02:31:59,232
The Persians were

3105
02:31:59,744 --> 02:32:02,816
Worshippers of Aqua Mazda was a god named and

3106
02:32:03,072 --> 02:32:05,376
The old Mead used to worship a god named Mithra

3107
02:32:05,632 --> 02:32:11,776
And if connections between good and evil that some religious experts tie to Christianity in ancient Judaism and who the hell

3108
02:32:12,032 --> 02:32:14,336
Techno is all you know is that it's not just a cultural

3109
02:32:14,592 --> 02:32:17,152
And legal question it's a religious 1/2

3110
02:32:18,176 --> 02:32:19,712
Interesting to speculate

3111
02:32:19,968 --> 02:32:21,504
How much people still alive

3112
02:32:22,016 --> 02:32:26,368
In a society with that many things favoring the truth it's interesting to think about

3113
02:32:27,136 --> 02:32:33,024
Another human laboratory experiment if you will the truthful society and how realistic is that

3114
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:35,072
Nonetheless

3115
02:32:35,584 --> 02:32:37,120
We have now set the stage

3116
02:32:37,888 --> 02:32:38,400
4

3117
02:32:39,168 --> 02:32:40,448
Problems between the Greeks

3118
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:41,984
And the Persians

3119
02:32:42,752 --> 02:32:43,776
From this point on

3120
02:32:44,032 --> 02:32:50,176
If you want to call it a clash of civilizations you who have marketplaces in lie and we who don't it's about to happen

3121
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:52,992
Lucky for the Spartans don't get to stay out of it

3122
02:32:53,504 --> 02:32:55,296
Waka Cyrus isn't done conquering

3123
02:32:55,808 --> 02:32:56,576
Not by a long shot

3124
02:32:58,624 --> 02:32:59,648
Historian still

3125
02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:01,696
Discuss whether or not

3126
02:33:01,952 --> 02:33:02,464
Cyrus

3127
02:33:02,720 --> 02:33:06,816
Should be seen as an intentional yunnan conscious conqueror

3128
02:33:07,072 --> 02:33:10,400
Paula Alexander the Great or Napoleon

3129
02:33:11,168 --> 02:33:13,472
Recreate the old Assyrian Empire

3130
02:33:13,984 --> 02:33:17,824
Or somebody that got involved in a bunch of conflict each for their own reason

3131
02:33:18,336 --> 02:33:22,432
And you know when you when you take over their territory and and kind of tripped into Empire

3132
02:33:22,944 --> 02:33:24,736
I mean obviously that's a little simplistic

3133
02:33:25,248 --> 02:33:26,016
But

3134
02:33:26,272 --> 02:33:27,552
I think it's indicative of

3135
02:33:27,808 --> 02:33:31,392
Howling inserting really key motivational areas

3136
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:33,952
This guy is still a bit of a mystery

3137
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:37,536
He will disappear

3138
02:33:37,792 --> 02:33:42,912
Behind the veil of our historical site I guess you could say for several years

3139
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:44,960
After his

3140
02:33:45,728 --> 02:33:50,080
Taking over Lydia he will leave a general who maybe this historical harpagus guy

3141
02:33:50,336 --> 02:33:51,872
And an army behind

3142
02:33:52,128 --> 02:33:54,432
In Western turkey was not modern

3143
02:33:54,688 --> 02:33:55,712
De Western turkey

3144
02:33:55,968 --> 02:33:58,272
To reduce these Asiatic Greek cities

3145
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:00,320
And he will go

3146
02:34:01,088 --> 02:34:02,112
It's assumed

3147
02:34:02,624 --> 02:34:05,952
To the eastern part of his realm in the northern part of his realm

3148
02:34:06,208 --> 02:34:11,072
And Conquer further and also Shore up his defenses against

3149
02:34:11,328 --> 02:34:14,656
The many powerful tribes that sort of ring his territory

3150
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:16,960
Probably a combination of

3151
02:34:17,216 --> 02:34:20,288
Fighting some of them showing the flag to some of them

3152
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:24,384
Intermarrying and making diplomatic agreements with some of them

3153
02:34:24,896 --> 02:34:26,432
Accepting vassalage for mothers

3154
02:34:26,688 --> 02:34:28,224
I mean it was years of work

3155
02:34:28,992 --> 02:34:30,528
So this guy is doing the

3156
02:34:30,784 --> 02:34:32,832
You know yeoman's work the hard

3157
02:34:33,088 --> 02:34:33,600
Slogging

3158
02:34:34,112 --> 02:34:40,256
Of creating a stable State and it requires years of constant effort he disappears from the historical record while he's doing this

3159
02:34:41,536 --> 02:34:42,304
And then Ian

3160
02:34:42,560 --> 02:34:44,864
539 BCE

3161
02:34:45,376 --> 02:34:47,936
He reappears again at the head of an army

3162
02:34:48,704 --> 02:34:49,984
Heading toward Babylon

3163
02:34:52,032 --> 02:34:54,848
Now what Cyrus is going to do to Babylon is

3164
02:34:55,104 --> 02:34:56,640
Probably his crowning

3165
02:34:57,920 --> 02:35:00,992
And I have to remind myself to his career is already incredible

3166
02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:06,112
This is a guy who buy 539 BCE has been a king for about 20 years

3167
02:35:06,624 --> 02:35:08,672
And in 20 years he's taking his people

3168
02:35:09,184 --> 02:35:10,208
From a virtual

3169
02:35:10,464 --> 02:35:12,256
In a Backwater nowheresville

3170
02:35:12,768 --> 02:35:18,912
To a point where they've conquered half of the great nation states and their little ecosystem that exist you know after the fall

3171
02:35:19,168 --> 02:35:19,680
Fall of Assyria

3172
02:35:20,192 --> 02:35:24,544
And he's outside the gates of number 3 of 4 with an army

3173
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:26,592
That's pretty awesome right there for a

3174
02:35:27,104 --> 02:35:28,640
King of on Sean

3175
02:35:28,896 --> 02:35:31,968
Very soon be referring to himself as

3176
02:35:32,224 --> 02:35:35,296
Part of his official Royal titles at the king of the universe

3177
02:35:36,320 --> 02:35:40,928
When you go from an Sean to King of the universe that's quite a jump and he's kind of a self-made conqueror

3178
02:35:41,184 --> 02:35:44,768
You compare him to someone like Alexander the Great was a course awesome

3179
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:48,608
But Alexander reminds you of sort of a historical

3180
02:35:48,864 --> 02:35:55,008
Rich kid who inherits his father's already thriving Corporation with tons of ready cash and does great things with it

3181
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:56,032
No offense

3182
02:35:56,288 --> 02:35:57,056
Go to Alex

3183
02:35:58,848 --> 02:36:00,640
But Cyrus never had any of those

3184
02:36:01,152 --> 02:36:02,944
And look where he is only 20 years ago

3185
02:36:04,992 --> 02:36:09,856
Now let me just voice my own opinion that what Cyrus is about to do to Babylon

3186
02:36:10,368 --> 02:36:11,392
Is strange

3187
02:36:11,904 --> 02:36:18,048
You can't tell with the sources what's really going on in the different histories have different approaches to it and it's been argued about it

3188
02:36:18,304 --> 02:36:20,864
And the views have changed and updated over time

3189
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:24,192
There's just not enough hard sources though for anyone to really know

3190
02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:26,496
For anyone to conclusively win

3191
02:36:27,008 --> 02:36:30,080
I'm certainly not going to take a position on a plane could explain

3192
02:36:30,336 --> 02:36:31,360
What are the weirdness of

3193
02:36:31,872 --> 02:36:33,152
The first thing you have to ask

3194
02:36:33,664 --> 02:36:38,528
Is whether or not Cyrus arriving outside Babylon when he did was a coincidence

3195
02:36:39,040 --> 02:36:40,320
Because the timing is awesome

3196
02:36:40,576 --> 02:36:41,856
If you're hoping to take over Babel

3197
02:36:43,136 --> 02:36:49,280
Is that just because he gets lucky or is that just because of the Babylonian propaganda would say later the end of March

3198
02:36:49,792 --> 02:36:51,840
Can seize him and brought him to Babylon

3199
02:36:52,352 --> 02:36:55,168
To get rid of the horrible king of Babylon and restore things

3200
02:36:55,936 --> 02:36:56,448
Just lucky

3201
02:36:57,728 --> 02:37:02,848
Orb did Cyrus and the Persians have advanced information that thinks sucking Babylon right now

3202
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:04,384
You come now

3203
02:37:04,640 --> 02:37:10,016
And half the population will be ready to welcome you with open arms was that may be part of the reason he showed up when he did

3204
02:37:11,296 --> 02:37:11,808
Orisa

3205
02:37:12,064 --> 02:37:18,208
I have argued for years could you make a case to the reason that people were so disaffected in Babylon was in part due

3206
02:37:18,720 --> 02:37:20,768
The Persian propaganda that undermine

3207
02:37:22,048 --> 02:37:22,816
Retire

3208
02:37:23,072 --> 02:37:23,840
Will to resist

3209
02:37:24,864 --> 02:37:25,632
And I have to be honest

3210
02:37:25,888 --> 02:37:27,168
I did not understand

3211
02:37:27,424 --> 02:37:29,216
That part of the story for years growing up

3212
02:37:29,728 --> 02:37:32,800
Something has changed in the way historians view it so now makes more sense to me

3213
02:37:33,312 --> 02:37:37,408
When I was growing up the attitude was it in 539 BCE this is when the Cyrus arrived

3214
02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:42,016
So something happens and occurs in Babylon Falls in sorry takes it over there you go so

3215
02:37:42,272 --> 02:37:46,880
This idea that he had this propaganda undermining Babylon made you think about

3216
02:37:47,136 --> 02:37:47,648
When

3217
02:37:48,416 --> 02:37:51,488
When was that going to happen mean you just everything happened so quickly

3218
02:37:51,744 --> 02:37:57,888
The modern way of viewing this almost a lot of historians is that maybe the Persians in the Babylonians have been fighting battles for a couple

3219
02:37:58,144 --> 02:37:58,656
What years

3220
02:37:59,168 --> 02:38:03,264
And then 539 when Cyrus and his army show up outside of Babylon

3221
02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:09,152
That's like the end of the second World War 1 the Russian show up outside of Berlin and you're having your last climactic battle

3222
02:38:09,664 --> 02:38:11,712
In a multi battle long War

3223
02:38:12,480 --> 02:38:14,272
Again the sources are just not there

3224
02:38:14,784 --> 02:38:16,064
To confirm any of this

3225
02:38:16,576 --> 02:38:17,344
Are categorical

3226
02:38:18,112 --> 02:38:24,256
But it would make a heck of a lot more sense if you were saying that Cyrus and the Persians were undermining the Babylonians with propaganda if you had years to

3227
02:38:24,512 --> 02:38:25,280
To do it right

3228
02:38:26,816 --> 02:38:28,864
Understanding what Cyrus might have been doing work

3229
02:38:29,120 --> 02:38:30,400
Requires talking about Babylon

3230
02:38:32,192 --> 02:38:33,984
Like the Assyrian city of Nineveh

3231
02:38:34,496 --> 02:38:36,288
This is a great urban center

3232
02:38:37,056 --> 02:38:42,432
And it's large enough in complex enough so that you see a lot of the same sorts of Dynamics going on

3233
02:38:42,944 --> 02:38:45,504
In Albia through an ancient lens that you would see

3234
02:38:45,760 --> 02:38:47,552
In any modern large city today

3235
02:38:48,576 --> 02:38:49,600
There are fissures

3236
02:38:49,856 --> 02:38:50,624
Is there a division

3237
02:38:51,136 --> 02:38:52,160
There are tensions

3238
02:38:52,416 --> 02:38:53,184
There are

3239
02:38:53,696 --> 02:38:55,744
Are disagreements there are there also

3240
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:57,024
Two things that if someone wanted

3241
02:38:57,280 --> 02:38:58,560
To come in they could widen

3242
02:38:59,328 --> 02:39:00,096
The disagree

3243
02:39:00,352 --> 02:39:02,656
Slowly but surely increase the level of

3244
02:39:03,424 --> 02:39:03,936
Anger

3245
02:39:04,704 --> 02:39:05,216
Discontent

3246
02:39:06,752 --> 02:39:09,056
The number of things to be exploited to

3247
02:39:09,568 --> 02:39:10,592
Start with the fact

3248
02:39:11,360 --> 02:39:12,384
The king is on Pop

3249
02:39:14,176 --> 02:39:15,200
The king of

3250
02:39:15,712 --> 02:39:19,296
Babylon during this time. Almost certainly suffers from from

3251
02:39:19,552 --> 02:39:22,880
Bad bad historical publicity his name is nabonidus somebody

3252
02:39:23,136 --> 02:39:25,184
The time all of this is going down

3253
02:39:25,440 --> 02:39:27,232
Nabonidus is about 70

3254
02:39:28,512 --> 02:39:29,536
70 years old

3255
02:39:29,792 --> 02:39:30,560
World in a world

3256
02:39:31,328 --> 02:39:33,120
You know where the lifespan is so much shorter

3257
02:39:33,632 --> 02:39:35,424
How many 70 year old people are they

3258
02:39:36,192 --> 02:39:37,216
He's like a wizard

3259
02:39:37,984 --> 02:39:39,264
Into the population

3260
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:40,288
In terms of this is a guy

3261
02:39:40,544 --> 02:39:41,056
Guy

3262
02:39:41,312 --> 02:39:44,896
Whose memory goes back to events most people can't get anywhere near

3263
02:39:45,152 --> 02:39:45,664
Memory

3264
02:39:46,176 --> 02:39:47,968
He may have been the general

3265
02:39:48,224 --> 02:39:50,016
Who helped seal the deal

3266
02:39:50,272 --> 02:39:54,368
Between those two sides at the Battle of the eclipse remember when they suck each other's blood

3267
02:39:54,880 --> 02:39:55,392
Part of a

3268
02:39:55,904 --> 02:39:57,184
And sealing the deal this this

3269
02:39:57,440 --> 02:40:01,792
This nabonidus guy when he was much younger and more vigorous may have been one of the generals on site

3270
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:03,584
Now he's old

3271
02:40:04,608 --> 02:40:08,192
And it's really hard to get your mind around what this guy was really like

3272
02:40:09,472 --> 02:40:11,008
He sort of portrayed

3273
02:40:11,520 --> 02:40:13,568
As a as a kind of a doting

3274
02:40:13,824 --> 02:40:14,848
Antiquarian

3275
02:40:15,360 --> 02:40:15,872
I-70 East

3276
02:40:16,896 --> 02:40:23,040
Some people consider him the first official archaeologist I think it's got to be crazy cuz because there were lots of earlier Kings who were into

3277
02:40:23,296 --> 02:40:23,808
Digging up

3278
02:40:24,064 --> 02:40:26,880
You know earlier versions of their civilization but this guy

3279
02:40:27,136 --> 02:40:33,280
Is portrayed as somebody who almost prefers it to being a king he'd rather be out there Indiana jonesing

3280
02:40:33,536 --> 02:40:36,608
Some old Babylonian stuff from the previous Kings than

3281
02:40:36,864 --> 02:40:38,656
Then dealing with the day-to-day government

3282
02:40:40,448 --> 02:40:44,032
He also looks like a guy who doesn't mind getting out of Babylon

3283
02:40:44,544 --> 02:40:46,336
I have this image for the movie of some

3284
02:40:46,592 --> 02:40:51,968
I want to use like the guy who played The Scientist the doctor in Back to the Future and have him be

3285
02:40:52,224 --> 02:40:54,272
Nabonidus and just have him sort of

3286
02:40:54,528 --> 02:40:59,392
Finding the hustle and bustle of Babylon too much in those young kids and their loud music and all that stuff

3287
02:41:00,928 --> 02:41:06,048
He and the priesthood of Babylon especially the main important

3288
02:41:06,304 --> 02:41:07,072
Marduk

3289
02:41:07,584 --> 02:41:09,120
Begin to have these disagreements

3290
02:41:10,400 --> 02:41:11,168
Now understand something

3291
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:13,728
In the world before modern times

3292
02:41:13,984 --> 02:41:17,056
There is really only one reliable counter.

3293
02:41:17,568 --> 02:41:18,336
To the power of a

3294
02:41:19,616 --> 02:41:20,128
Pharaoh

3295
02:41:21,664 --> 02:41:22,432
And at the priesthood

3296
02:41:23,712 --> 02:41:25,760
Because the power that that

3297
02:41:26,016 --> 02:41:28,320
They have stems from the same source

3298
02:41:28,576 --> 02:41:31,904
Right ear your King by divine right it's a God who wanted to be a king

3299
02:41:32,416 --> 02:41:35,232
Who was the special relationship with the gods and who helps me know

3300
02:41:35,488 --> 02:41:39,328
Placate the gods who does the work of the Gods and who knows what the god really wants while the priesthood

3301
02:41:39,584 --> 02:41:40,096
Allegiant

3302
02:41:40,352 --> 02:41:42,656
The only other source of legitimate

3303
02:41:43,168 --> 02:41:44,192
Empower

3304
02:41:44,704 --> 02:41:47,520
In these societies before modern times are often

3305
02:41:47,776 --> 02:41:52,128
Other priests in the priests of Marduk don't like this nabonidus guy and part of the reason why

3306
02:41:52,384 --> 02:41:54,176
Is he seems to be kind of

3307
02:41:54,688 --> 02:41:57,504
Will favoring another God over there

3308
02:41:58,784 --> 02:42:01,344
This is what I mean by it's hard to get your mind around nabonidus

3309
02:42:01,600 --> 02:42:02,880
Because he may

3310
02:42:03,136 --> 02:42:04,928
Be like an Akhenaten type Cara

3311
02:42:05,184 --> 02:42:10,560
Do you know the Egyptian pharaoh that may have been a monotheistic may have tried to change Egypt religion

3312
02:42:10,816 --> 02:42:16,192
Another similar story right where you have the autocratic ruler opposed by a powerful priesthood

3313
02:42:17,216 --> 02:42:23,104
And after Akhenaten died things return back to normal that kind of work carving his face off of all of the old thing trying to forget he ever lived

3314
02:42:23,616 --> 02:42:26,944
Nabonidus may have been one of these guys to the wanted to change the religion

3315
02:42:27,712 --> 02:42:29,760
His mother was supposedly a priestess

3316
02:42:30,272 --> 02:42:31,040
Have a religion

3317
02:42:31,296 --> 02:42:32,832
Devoted to a guy named sin

3318
02:42:33,088 --> 02:42:33,600
The moon God

3319
02:42:34,880 --> 02:42:38,720
And so nabonidus right before this time. Give me the ultimate middle finger

3320
02:42:39,488 --> 02:42:40,768
To the priesthood of Marduk

3321
02:42:41,280 --> 02:42:45,632
By leaving Babylon and going to some Arabian Oasis

3322
02:42:47,424 --> 02:42:51,264
Now historians in modern times I found all sorts of really good logical

3323
02:42:51,520 --> 02:42:52,544
Patriotic reasons

3324
02:42:52,800 --> 02:42:54,080
Why the king might do that

3325
02:42:54,336 --> 02:42:57,664
In Past Times it was much more portrayed like this guy is a mist

3326
02:42:58,944 --> 02:43:02,272
Either a Mystic or an old man or a combination of the two

3327
02:43:02,528 --> 02:43:07,904
And he just wants to get away from his unworthy people and he appreciates it more in in these Arabian Oasis

3328
02:43:08,160 --> 02:43:09,184
It's probably what modern

3329
02:43:09,440 --> 02:43:10,976
Historians that he's probably they're doing

3330
02:43:11,232 --> 02:43:12,000
Important work

3331
02:43:12,256 --> 02:43:14,304
The country but he's missing important work

3332
02:43:15,072 --> 02:43:15,584
Time

3333
02:43:16,096 --> 02:43:21,216
The Babylonians required their King to be there once a year for a New Year's Festival it was import

3334
02:43:21,728 --> 02:43:24,800
He had to physically grasp the hand of the god in front of the

3335
02:43:25,056 --> 02:43:27,104
Population once a year to be sure

3336
02:43:27,360 --> 02:43:30,944
Success and good things in all these kinds of deals and he stayed away for like a

3337
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:31,712
Decade

3338
02:43:32,736 --> 02:43:37,088
When the Babylonian records will say every year the King was not here for the ceremony or what have you

3339
02:43:37,344 --> 02:43:38,624
And they're getting pissed

3340
02:43:39,648 --> 02:43:41,184
Annies putting more money into it

3341
02:43:41,440 --> 02:43:47,584
Creating more of these temples for the other religion denying some money that the people of Marduk expecting and you can just see it

3342
02:43:47,840 --> 02:43:53,984
It boiling over right and then the Kings not even there is Sun belshazzar as ruling as a reagent and he's not

3343
02:43:54,240 --> 02:43:55,008
Popular either

3344
02:43:56,032 --> 02:43:57,312
So the king is part of it

3345
02:43:58,592 --> 02:44:00,128
The Babylon is going through

3346
02:44:00,384 --> 02:44:06,528
In a tough Economic Times too and that's putting the squeeze on people they're having problems with disease and that's causing unrest

3347
02:44:07,296 --> 02:44:08,576
Archaeologist doctor

3348
02:44:08,832 --> 02:44:09,344
John Oates

3349
02:44:09,600 --> 02:44:10,368
Describes

3350
02:44:10,624 --> 02:44:16,768
You know the down-and-dirty parts of a day-to-day suffering and let's remember something babylon's banking system

3351
02:44:17,024 --> 02:44:23,168
And financial system was developed enough so that they had great banking houses there that were very powerful and lived on

3352
02:44:23,424 --> 02:44:27,520
Long after this. And that's just another one of those dynamics that

3353
02:44:27,776 --> 02:44:29,824
Makes us think about modern times these are

3354
02:44:30,080 --> 02:44:31,360
Powerful interest that have

3355
02:44:31,872 --> 02:44:33,408
Unisom Authority in the state

3356
02:44:33,920 --> 02:44:38,784
What happens when things seem to be falling apart and people are losing money in end times are bad and

3357
02:44:39,040 --> 02:44:41,856
And you start getting Persian propaganda about this King

3358
02:44:42,368 --> 02:44:46,208
It sounds like things are going his way which remember during this time.

3359
02:44:46,464 --> 02:44:49,024
Cause a lot of people to figure the gods are smiling on that

3360
02:44:49,280 --> 02:44:49,792
Guy

3361
02:44:50,048 --> 02:44:53,888
And are Kings not even showing up to shake the guy's hand every New Year's right

3362
02:44:54,144 --> 02:44:56,448
Is the weight doctor Joe notes describes the

3363
02:44:56,704 --> 02:44:57,728
Situation in Babylon

3364
02:44:58,496 --> 02:45:04,640
Considering also remember that this King looks like a guy who's trying to change religious Traditions trying to change a bunch of other things in end.

3365
02:45:06,688 --> 02:45:10,016
Clearly nabonidus is religious and administrative reforms

3366
02:45:10,272 --> 02:45:11,552
Provoke great resentment

3367
02:45:11,808 --> 02:45:17,952
While the wars and extensive building programs of his predecessors had proved a severe burden on the country's res

3368
02:45:18,720 --> 02:45:20,512
Large numbers of economic text

3369
02:45:20,768 --> 02:45:22,304
Reveal severe inflation

3370
02:45:22,560 --> 02:45:25,120
A situation now made worse by the spread of plague

3371
02:45:25,376 --> 02:45:31,520
Between 560 BCE and 550 BCE Prices rose by up to 50%

3372
02:45:31,776 --> 02:45:36,640
Turn 560 to 485 BCE the total increase amounted to some 200%

3373
02:45:36,896 --> 02:45:37,408
And quote

3374
02:45:38,688 --> 02:45:39,456
Nitrostat

3375
02:45:40,736 --> 02:45:43,296
But again you know take this with a grain of salt at Target about

3376
02:45:43,552 --> 02:45:46,368
But there are people inside Babylon

3377
02:45:47,136 --> 02:45:50,720
Who might be considered shall we say vulnerable

3378
02:45:51,232 --> 02:45:52,512
Two propaganda that

3379
02:45:53,024 --> 02:45:54,048
Creative dissent

3380
02:45:54,816 --> 02:45:57,120
There are a lot of people in Babylon

3381
02:45:57,632 --> 02:46:01,216
For there because they were forcibly taken Once Upon a Time

3382
02:46:01,728 --> 02:46:03,008
From where they came from

3383
02:46:04,799 --> 02:46:07,871
And some of the propaganda afterwards certainly

3384
02:46:08,127 --> 02:46:11,967
Post propaganda but maybe some of the pre propaganda to from Cyrus

3385
02:46:12,735 --> 02:46:15,551
Told these people that have the Persian War to take over

3386
02:46:16,063 --> 02:46:17,087
They get to go home

3387
02:46:18,367 --> 02:46:19,135
Start with

3388
02:46:20,159 --> 02:46:21,951
The deportees from Judah

3389
02:46:23,231 --> 02:46:25,279
Jewish people today there and there are still

3390
02:46:25,791 --> 02:46:26,559
I'm sure still

3391
02:46:27,071 --> 02:46:27,839
With all the troubles

3392
02:46:28,607 --> 02:46:31,423
Jews in that part of the world today that are descendants

3393
02:46:31,679 --> 02:46:34,495
People who were forcibly removed after the Babylonians

3394
02:46:35,007 --> 02:46:36,287
Sacked Jerusalem

3395
02:46:36,799 --> 02:46:38,591
What is Cyrus was telling those people

3396
02:46:39,103 --> 02:46:39,871
If I get

3397
02:46:40,127 --> 02:46:41,663
Vicodin power you can go home

3398
02:46:41,919 --> 02:46:44,735
And what if he was telling all the other deportees the same thing

3399
02:46:46,015 --> 02:46:49,087
When historians refer to Cyrus in the Persians propaganda

3400
02:46:49,599 --> 02:46:55,743
The first idea that comes to mind is like negative propaganda like the Nazi stop designed to lie to people and get you to believe

3401
02:46:55,999 --> 02:46:57,023
Things that aren't true

3402
02:46:57,791 --> 02:47:00,607
But you could make a case that that's since we know

3403
02:47:01,119 --> 02:47:05,215
Did Cyrus and the Persians will eventually actually do what they're saying here

3404
02:47:05,727 --> 02:47:06,751
Write that they will

3405
02:47:07,007 --> 02:47:09,055
For example allow the Jews to go back

3406
02:47:09,311 --> 02:47:11,615
To Judah and re-establish their religion

3407
02:47:12,127 --> 02:47:15,967
And even eventually you know pay for some of the rebuilding of the second temple

3408
02:47:16,223 --> 02:47:19,039
What will be the second temple with with royal funds

3409
02:47:19,295 --> 02:47:24,927
When you know that they're actually going to do that maybe you could say that this propaganda is a lot more like dropping leaflets

3410
02:47:25,695 --> 02:47:31,839
Over enemy military lines that say something like you no surrender do us we don't hurt prisoners and we'll give you a hot meal

3411
02:47:32,863 --> 02:47:35,679
In a few bucks in your pocket some cigarettes over they've done in the old days

3412
02:47:37,215 --> 02:47:38,495
Maybe this is like telling

3413
02:47:39,007 --> 02:47:41,311
The people inside Babylon do not fear

3414
02:47:41,567 --> 02:47:43,871
I may be coming but I'm going to send you home

3415
02:47:45,663 --> 02:47:46,175
No

3416
02:47:46,687 --> 02:47:51,551
Real experts on this light Pierre Briand caution us against thinking about this the way

3417
02:47:52,063 --> 02:47:52,575
That

3418
02:47:52,831 --> 02:47:53,599
I just described

3419
02:47:54,367 --> 02:47:54,879
But this is a

3420
02:47:55,391 --> 02:47:59,231
Conscious policy of Toleration he says the way the marketing really is

3421
02:47:59,487 --> 02:48:01,279
Is a lot more like Cyrus's

3422
02:48:01,535 --> 02:48:03,839
Assyrian and Babylonian predecessors

3423
02:48:04,095 --> 02:48:07,167
Where he's essentially promising continuity

3424
02:48:07,935 --> 02:48:13,823
And because continuity means allowing these people to do things the way that they are accustomed to do it

3425
02:48:14,335 --> 02:48:15,359
It seems like tile

3426
02:48:16,639 --> 02:48:22,783
He points out that it's normal for conquerors in this region even before this time. To come in and promised to restore every

3427
02:48:23,039 --> 02:48:23,807
Everything that's wrong

3428
02:48:24,575 --> 02:48:26,623
The gods are upset I will fix that

3429
02:48:26,879 --> 02:48:33,023
Economy is bad I will fix that you are kept away from your home and your gods are just you know I will fix that

3430
02:48:33,279 --> 02:48:35,583
The restore Andre creator of order

3431
02:48:37,375 --> 02:48:38,911
The whatever you want to call this

3432
02:48:40,191 --> 02:48:41,727
In 539

3433
02:48:42,239 --> 02:48:44,799
Cyrus and the Babylonian Army me

3434
02:48:46,335 --> 02:48:49,919
I need a battle where there seems to have been a really maybe nasty massacre at the end

3435
02:48:50,431 --> 02:48:52,223
The Babylonian Army is defeated

3436
02:48:53,759 --> 02:48:56,319
The rest of the troops of the run back to the very

3437
02:48:56,831 --> 02:48:58,879
Formidable defenses of the city

3438
02:48:59,903 --> 02:49:01,439
I'm within 2 days

3439
02:49:01,695 --> 02:49:02,719
Somehow

3440
02:49:02,975 --> 02:49:08,351
The gates of the city are opened in Cyrus's General is marching through the streets and triumphant Babylon Falls

3441
02:49:09,631 --> 02:49:15,007
Nabonidus fleas eventually captured and supposedly treated well by Cyrus just like all the other kings were

3442
02:49:16,799 --> 02:49:21,151
Herodotus of course has to give us a stratagem story of how it happened this time it involves

3443
02:49:21,407 --> 02:49:26,527
In a waiting until they can get the river down the flows through the city to a certain length or to a point where they

3444
02:49:27,039 --> 02:49:29,343
The troops can go through the marshes or what have you

3445
02:49:29,599 --> 02:49:32,927
And capture the city and I think he's one of the ones that say

3446
02:49:33,183 --> 02:49:36,255
That the city didn't even know it was being captured because there was some

3447
02:49:36,767 --> 02:49:38,815
The revelry going on attached to a

3448
02:49:39,327 --> 02:49:42,399
Religious cult in the city so big anyway

3449
02:49:42,655 --> 02:49:43,679
Me modern excavation

3450
02:49:43,935 --> 02:49:44,703
But the city sizes

3451
02:49:45,471 --> 02:49:47,263
Over 2000 Acres

3452
02:49:47,519 --> 02:49:48,031
And

3453
02:49:48,287 --> 02:49:51,103
The wall circumference at about 11 miles

3454
02:49:51,359 --> 02:49:53,407
So it's possible that in one part of the city

3455
02:49:53,663 --> 02:49:54,687
But they were partying it up

3456
02:49:54,943 --> 02:49:56,223
And then the Persians got in

3457
02:49:57,247 --> 02:50:01,087
The natural thing to do would be to throw out a story like that and blame it on typical

3458
02:50:01,343 --> 02:50:04,671
You know Greek stereotypes and what not but it should be pointed out

3459
02:50:04,927 --> 02:50:09,535
One that often times in these ancient religions there was an awful lot of

3460
02:50:09,791 --> 02:50:13,375
Decadence or fun or depends on your point of view I guess stuff that was

3461
02:50:13,631 --> 02:50:14,143
Heart of

3462
02:50:14,399 --> 02:50:20,031
You know the religious rights and you'll see this in Greece and Roman a ton of other religions the world over especially the ancient.

3463
02:50:20,287 --> 02:50:26,431
And these people are immensely religious the Babylonians especially the holy city of Mesopotamia rights are very religious

3464
02:50:26,687 --> 02:50:32,831
People to imagine people with the commitment of like a Taliban right the seriousness with which they take

3465
02:50:33,087 --> 02:50:35,135
Strident militancy

3466
02:50:35,903 --> 02:50:40,767
But you might be commanded to party it's a party for God and if you're not there the

3467
02:50:41,023 --> 02:50:42,303
Ramifications could be huge

3468
02:50:42,815 --> 02:50:43,327
Right

3469
02:50:44,351 --> 02:50:47,679
I'm inclined to think that it's a Greek stereotype of course but there's a

3470
02:50:47,935 --> 02:50:48,703
The part of me that wants

3471
02:50:48,959 --> 02:50:49,471
To believe

3472
02:50:49,727 --> 02:50:50,239
The latter

3473
02:50:51,519 --> 02:50:52,543
Can the one thing this

3474
02:50:52,799 --> 02:50:53,311
Conquest

3475
02:50:53,567 --> 02:50:55,871
If that's even the right word of Babylon is known for

3476
02:50:57,151 --> 02:50:58,175
Is the fact that

3477
02:50:58,431 --> 02:50:59,455
It's generally

3478
02:50:59,711 --> 02:51:00,735
Considered to be blood

3479
02:51:01,759 --> 02:51:04,319
You forget that battle we talked about with the nasty potential Mass

3480
02:51:04,831 --> 02:51:05,343
At the end

3481
02:51:05,599 --> 02:51:07,391
When the city of Babylon

3482
02:51:07,647 --> 02:51:13,791
Is taking its taken essentially voluntarily minutes like the Babylonians open up the door in Cyrus's General comes in

3483
02:51:14,047 --> 02:51:17,887
17 or so Days Later Cyrus himself comes in and we're told that the population

3484
02:51:18,143 --> 02:51:20,447
You don't get in front of his Chariot and lays down

3485
02:51:20,703 --> 02:51:21,471
Palm fronds

3486
02:51:21,727 --> 02:51:24,287
Stopwatch some historians in the old days used to be

3487
02:51:24,799 --> 02:51:27,615
Sure was a sign of how much people wanted in there

3488
02:51:27,871 --> 02:51:34,015
More modern-day historians point out that that's generally how you get treated when you come into a city that's trying to show that there

3489
02:51:34,271 --> 02:51:35,807
No threat at all and please don't hurt us

3490
02:51:37,087 --> 02:51:38,111
That's perhaps what

3491
02:51:38,879 --> 02:51:41,695
The Persian takeover of Babylon is most known for

3492
02:51:42,463 --> 02:51:43,487
Cyrus didn't hurt anybody

3493
02:51:45,279 --> 02:51:48,095
And as I said earlier nabonidus is life is spared

3494
02:51:48,863 --> 02:51:50,655
Which supposedly

3495
02:51:51,167 --> 02:51:57,311
Is the same fate that Cyrus has meted out to all the king's he's faced which by the way is not only unusual

3496
02:51:57,823 --> 02:52:03,967
But it's not even maybe true who knows they're always a little hint somewhere that maybe Cyrus killed these kings in the in the propaganda covered it up

3497
02:52:04,223 --> 02:52:10,367
Nonetheless historically and traditionally he supposed to have spared and given good lives all these other things he did

3498
02:52:11,135 --> 02:52:11,903
Biaggi's

3499
02:52:12,159 --> 02:52:15,743
Priests of the palladians now banaitis of the Babylonians

3500
02:52:16,767 --> 02:52:20,607
What is the message Cyrus is trying to send here I mean that's what I find

3501
02:52:21,375 --> 02:52:23,167
You want to know a little bit about the guy

3502
02:52:23,423 --> 02:52:28,287
Himself and maybe what he was trying to do what the message when he does that because the Assyrian King

3503
02:52:28,543 --> 02:52:31,871
Who last conquered Babylon brags about how he tied the

3504
02:52:32,127 --> 02:52:34,175
King of Babylon up like a pig

3505
02:52:34,687 --> 02:52:36,479
And displayed him in the center of Nineveh

3506
02:52:37,247 --> 02:52:39,295
So this is not standard operating procedure

3507
02:52:39,551 --> 02:52:42,111
It's one of the things by the way that fascinates me about Cyrus

3508
02:52:42,879 --> 02:52:47,487
Because the Occam's razor approach to history which is the right way to go me what else you going to do

3509
02:52:47,743 --> 02:52:51,071
Is to assume the most logical thing you don't assume Elijah

3510
02:52:52,095 --> 02:52:53,375
The Assumption always is

3511
02:52:53,631 --> 02:52:55,167
Someone likes irises playing at

3512
02:52:55,423 --> 02:52:56,703
Hardcore

3513
02:52:56,959 --> 02:52:58,751
Cynical propaganda game

3514
02:52:59,007 --> 02:53:01,567
Again Audrey probably is most people would be

3515
02:53:02,079 --> 02:53:06,943
But occasionally you're going to get some different kind of human being because we see them exist

3516
02:53:08,735 --> 02:53:12,063
It's just if you're using the Occam's razor approach to try to determine

3517
02:53:12,319 --> 02:53:15,391
You know what a Gandhi was really like a thousand years from now

3518
02:53:15,647 --> 02:53:17,695
You might be looking at listen Gandhi was really up

3519
02:53:17,951 --> 02:53:24,095
You know this was a cynical attempt to figure out a way to gain power level I mean could figure out all these real logical reasons why a guy might do this

3520
02:53:26,399 --> 02:53:29,215
Sometimes people who are doing things for Mystic reasons

3521
02:53:29,727 --> 02:53:35,871
Or morality reasons or humanistic reasons or any of these things sometimes those people slip through the cracks because it's just so

3522
02:53:36,127 --> 02:53:36,895
Easy to assume

3523
02:53:37,151 --> 02:53:40,735
They had a more real-world terrafirma reason for doing things

3524
02:53:40,991 --> 02:53:42,527
Is it possible

3525
02:53:43,295 --> 02:53:45,599
It's Cyrus was kind of a humanist

3526
02:53:46,111 --> 02:53:46,623
Maybe

3527
02:53:46,879 --> 02:53:50,463
You know this is how he's portrayed by the way by his real fans on the

3528
02:53:50,719 --> 02:53:51,999
Why do people back in the rain

3529
02:53:52,255 --> 02:53:54,815
Is the guy who invented human rights

3530
02:53:55,071 --> 02:53:56,607
Sort of at least as a

3531
02:53:57,375 --> 02:53:58,143
The ruler is

3532
02:53:58,399 --> 02:54:01,215
Concerned and Babylon is one of the number one pieces of evidence

3533
02:54:01,727 --> 02:54:04,287
Another gets trotted out in defense of this idea

3534
02:54:05,055 --> 02:54:07,103
But this isn't just some sort of policy

3535
02:54:07,871 --> 02:54:10,175
A tolerance for expediency sake

3536
02:54:10,687 --> 02:54:14,527
But this is how Cyrus really believes you can govern

3537
02:54:16,063 --> 02:54:17,599
And it should be pointed out that the

3538
02:54:17,855 --> 02:54:22,207
Not only has Babylon kind of surrender without a fight there's another Babylonian City or two

3539
02:54:22,463 --> 02:54:24,767
The kind of opens their doors to Cyrus

3540
02:54:25,535 --> 02:54:31,679
And it's interesting because he knows reasons argami has an interesting take on something that the Babylonian King did is part of the

3541
02:54:31,935 --> 02:54:33,983
The fighting with Cyrus for Babylon

3542
02:54:35,007 --> 02:54:36,031
Supposedly in this is

3543
02:54:36,287 --> 02:54:42,431
Way to look at nabonidus showing that maybe he was just really responsible king after all before Cyrus get the Babylon

3544
02:54:42,943 --> 02:54:46,527
Nabonidus goes around all the surrounding towns and it takes their God

3545
02:54:47,295 --> 02:54:50,623
Takes all their little the statues in the representations of their God

3546
02:54:50,879 --> 02:54:52,159
And take some to Babylon

3547
02:54:53,439 --> 02:54:55,487
And traditionally this is considered to be an actor

3548
02:54:55,743 --> 02:54:56,767
The safekeeping right

3549
02:54:57,023 --> 02:55:03,167
You know that you don't want your Statue of Liberty falling into the hands of the elamites and ending up in their trophy case rescue take all these

3550
02:55:03,679 --> 02:55:06,495
Village guide back to Babylon for safekeeping

3551
02:55:07,263 --> 02:55:09,311
Risa zarghami that has an interesting take

3552
02:55:10,847 --> 02:55:12,383
In his book discovering Cyrus

3553
02:55:12,639 --> 02:55:17,759
You did a great job reminding us of the interesting belief systems of the people who have these guys

3554
02:55:18,271 --> 02:55:23,135
And then how maybe you could see what nabonidus is doing is the equivalent of 4/2

3555
02:55:23,391 --> 02:55:23,903
Kidnap

3556
02:55:24,159 --> 02:55:28,511
The gods of these towns and holding them hostage for good behavior

3557
02:55:29,279 --> 02:55:29,791
Right

3558
02:55:30,559 --> 02:55:33,631
Stay loyal to Babylon or your God gets it in the neck

3559
02:55:33,887 --> 02:55:35,679
Something like that here's what's origami rights

3560
02:55:35,935 --> 02:55:37,471
And remember this only makes sense

3561
02:55:37,983 --> 02:55:44,127
If nabonidus is seriously worried that some of these towns are just going to go over to Cyrus because of the propaganda

3562
02:55:44,383 --> 02:55:46,175
Or whatever he writes quote

3563
02:55:46,687 --> 02:55:51,295
Faced with a very real prospect that is cities would open up their gates to the Conqueror

3564
02:55:51,551 --> 02:55:54,111
Nabonidus settled upon a drastic policy

3565
02:55:54,623 --> 02:56:00,767
He decided to hold hostage the sacred Idols of Babylonians outline City to ensure the Loyalty of their

3566
02:56:01,023 --> 02:56:01,535
Inhabitants

3567
02:56:02,047 --> 02:56:06,911
So when Cyrus and his army resume their March in the late summer of 539 BCE

3568
02:56:07,167 --> 02:56:11,775
A series of Caravans Laden with Divine Images and other religious artifacts

3569
02:56:12,031 --> 02:56:13,567
Made its way to Babylon

3570
02:56:14,079 --> 02:56:19,711
Living today we can hardly grasp the full psychological impact nabonidus as action

3571
02:56:19,967 --> 02:56:23,295
The idol was the centerpiece of the ancient Mesopotamian a cult

3572
02:56:23,551 --> 02:56:25,599
And the most important symbol of the community

3573
02:56:25,855 --> 02:56:28,671
The inanimate statues were treated like royalty

3574
02:56:29,183 --> 02:56:29,695
Bathe

3575
02:56:29,951 --> 02:56:30,719
Perfumed

3576
02:56:30,975 --> 02:56:35,327
Groomed and even fed lavish Meals by an Entourage of domestic servants

3577
02:56:35,583 --> 02:56:37,119
Priests and personal attendants

3578
02:56:37,631 --> 02:56:40,959
Ancient Mesopotamian culture geographically centralized

3579
02:56:41,215 --> 02:56:44,031
And the god Powers territorially Limited

3580
02:56:44,287 --> 02:56:49,663
That is why Cyrus could not receive the Divine approval he desired with the gods concentrated in Babylon

3581
02:56:51,199 --> 02:56:56,319
He then continues but nabonidus was playing a dangerous game by emptying the cities of their idols

3582
02:56:56,831 --> 02:57:00,415
Proximity to the cult statue meant everything to the superstitious masses

3583
02:57:00,671 --> 02:57:03,999
Who believed that the sacred images of their gods could perform miracles

3584
02:57:04,255 --> 02:57:05,023
Cure illness

3585
02:57:05,279 --> 02:57:07,839
And most importantly protect their settlements

3586
02:57:08,351 --> 02:57:10,911
Cities lost Divine protection when their gods left

3587
02:57:12,191 --> 02:57:12,703
And quote

3588
02:57:14,239 --> 02:57:17,311
One of the first things that Cyrus will brag about doing

3589
02:57:18,079 --> 02:57:19,359
When he takes over Babylon

3590
02:57:20,383 --> 02:57:22,431
Is returning all those

3591
02:57:22,687 --> 02:57:24,735
God's to the outlying communities

3592
02:57:25,503 --> 02:57:27,039
And those people freaking out

3593
02:57:27,551 --> 02:57:29,087
And you know having their gods back

3594
02:57:29,855 --> 02:57:35,999
Once again is Pierre Breann says Cyrus is portraying himself as the restorer of order of things that they should

3595
02:57:36,255 --> 02:57:36,767
Should be

3596
02:57:37,535 --> 02:57:39,327
Is beginning to tie himself

3597
02:57:40,095 --> 02:57:41,375
To the ancient

3598
02:57:41,887 --> 02:57:43,423
Assyrian tradition

3599
02:57:43,679 --> 02:57:45,471
Some historians suggest consciously

3600
02:57:45,727 --> 02:57:48,543
He'll talk about repairing something in the city and coming across

3601
02:57:49,055 --> 02:57:54,175
Some Proclamation by ashurbanipal the Assyrian king of tie himself to Assyria

3602
02:57:54,687 --> 02:57:55,967
And it's ancient

3603
02:57:56,479 --> 02:57:57,503
The Royal tradition

3604
02:57:57,759 --> 02:57:59,295
We start calling himself king of

3605
02:57:59,551 --> 02:58:01,087
King of the universe

3606
02:58:01,343 --> 02:58:03,647
These are old a Syrian and even

3607
02:58:03,903 --> 02:58:04,927
Acadian terms

3608
02:58:06,719 --> 02:58:10,047
But if Cyrus was starting to use these ancient titles for himself

3609
02:58:10,559 --> 02:58:12,095
You can see why he thought he might

3610
02:58:12,351 --> 02:58:12,863
Deserve it

3611
02:58:14,143 --> 02:58:16,191
Because 80 or 90 years after

3612
02:58:16,703 --> 02:58:19,519
You're the ancient Kingdom of Assyria fell

3613
02:58:20,543 --> 02:58:23,103
Cyrus and put Humpty Dumpty back together again

3614
02:58:25,151 --> 02:58:26,687
What sort of a different form

3615
02:58:27,455 --> 02:58:28,479
Different marketing

3616
02:58:29,247 --> 02:58:30,271
I'm Different branding

3617
02:58:32,831 --> 02:58:35,903
But all of a sudden once again just as had existed during

3618
02:58:36,415 --> 02:58:37,951
Later Assyrian times

3619
02:58:38,719 --> 02:58:40,767
One power had hegemony

3620
02:58:41,535 --> 02:58:42,559
In that part of the world now

3621
02:58:46,655 --> 02:58:47,935
Trying to rule

3622
02:58:48,703 --> 02:58:50,239
Immensely different people

3623
02:58:50,495 --> 02:58:51,007
People from

3624
02:58:51,263 --> 02:58:55,359
And everything from from deeply Urban environments and places like Babylon

3625
02:58:56,127 --> 02:58:57,919
Two Phoenician cities

3626
02:58:58,431 --> 02:59:04,319
Two tribes that existed off in the edges of the Eurasian steppe and incorporate all these different

3627
02:59:04,575 --> 02:59:05,087
People

3628
02:59:05,599 --> 02:59:06,367
Into one Empire

3629
02:59:07,903 --> 02:59:09,439
Much is made of the different

3630
02:59:10,207 --> 02:59:10,975
Strategies that the

3631
02:59:11,231 --> 02:59:15,327
The Persians use over the Assyrians instead of trying to shoot everybody into one

3632
02:59:15,839 --> 02:59:17,119
Intercultural Style

3633
02:59:17,375 --> 02:59:19,423
Convert everybody to your religion

3634
02:59:20,447 --> 02:59:23,263
Make good Assyrians of these conquered people

3635
02:59:23,775 --> 02:59:25,567
The Persians used a much lighter touch

3636
02:59:25,823 --> 02:59:28,639
That the idea of Toleration really was to allow

3637
02:59:28,895 --> 02:59:30,431
Local Customs to continue

3638
02:59:31,455 --> 02:59:37,599
The Assyrians wounded tolerated that the fact that the Persians didn't try to change all that whether it was a question of religion

3639
02:59:37,855 --> 02:59:39,647
Or language or anything else in fact

3640
02:59:40,159 --> 02:59:41,695
When the Persian Empire gets up and running

3641
02:59:41,951 --> 02:59:44,767
Persians will be putting all the most important positions

3642
02:59:46,559 --> 02:59:52,191
The Purge it will not be the language of the Empire there will always be only a tiny minority of people actually speaking Persian

3643
02:59:52,447 --> 02:59:57,567
All of the official in a proclamation will be multilingual so the different people can read them

3644
02:59:59,103 --> 03:00:01,663
All the local gods are respected and supported

3645
03:00:02,687 --> 03:00:04,223
Now again is this some sort of

3646
03:00:04,991 --> 03:00:11,135
Humanitarian gesture on Cyrus's park or is it a guy who is a humanitarian and thanks listen I'm just now

3647
03:00:11,391 --> 03:00:17,023
Tell me this is the best way to treat people and it will work out that's another where the guy who believes his own humanitarian beliefs and morals

3648
03:00:17,279 --> 03:00:19,327
Dovetail into good outcomes

3649
03:00:19,583 --> 03:00:25,727
Or is it somebody who's cynically looked at this and just as listen to just telling you if we do it this way we'll have less revolting to be much better

3650
03:00:25,983 --> 03:00:26,751
Assyrians

3651
03:00:27,519 --> 03:00:28,031
Who knows

3652
03:00:29,567 --> 03:00:33,407
It's tempting to think of Cyrus as brilliant and visionary

3653
03:00:33,663 --> 03:00:36,223
Regardless of which one of those things is true

3654
03:00:37,759 --> 03:00:42,879
He organizes this Empire restarts creating things that are called satrap since at trapeze

3655
03:00:43,135 --> 03:00:43,647
Which are

3656
03:00:43,903 --> 03:00:44,927
Administrative

3657
03:00:45,183 --> 03:00:47,743
Units that will be built upon by his successors

3658
03:00:49,535 --> 03:00:55,423
And then the next major thing we hear about Cyrus it's almost let you know when these people live that far back you get the highlights of their life

3659
03:00:55,679 --> 03:01:01,823
Why is right by letting everyone know conquest of Madea highlight number to conquest of Lydia hi Lite number 3 Conquest

3660
03:01:02,079 --> 03:01:03,615
Babylon highlight number 4

3661
03:01:04,639 --> 03:01:05,151
The

3662
03:01:05,663 --> 03:01:08,223
Expedition against a queen

3663
03:01:09,759 --> 03:01:12,575
One of the most powerful tribal coalition

3664
03:01:13,343 --> 03:01:14,367
In Central Asia

3665
03:01:16,415 --> 03:01:22,559
Now the fact that there is a queen involved in the story should tip you off to the idea that it's going to be a good

3666
03:01:23,583 --> 03:01:29,727
Herodotus by-the-way knows that he's eager to get to the story and he's going to spend a ton of time on a fusion setting it up

3667
03:01:30,239 --> 03:01:31,775
He knows his audience is ready

3668
03:01:32,031 --> 03:01:35,615
He's got a little moral Twisted may or may not have anything to do with reality

3669
03:01:36,127 --> 03:01:37,407
But you get a look at that 25

3670
03:01:37,663 --> 03:01:39,967
Hundred-year-old mind that your mind melding with

3671
03:01:40,223 --> 03:01:41,759
One way at this point the story

3672
03:01:42,527 --> 03:01:46,111
But if it comes the time where Herodotus is at his least reliable to

3673
03:01:47,391 --> 03:01:51,487
He jumps from highlight number 3 to highlight number 4 in Cyrus's life

3674
03:01:51,743 --> 03:01:55,583
In one second if you look at the actual dates and Volvo you'll see that

3675
03:01:55,839 --> 03:02:01,471
There is like 9 years between highlight number 3 and highlight number 4 and 9 years when Cyrus is

3676
03:02:01,983 --> 03:02:02,495
Well to use

3677
03:02:03,519 --> 03:02:05,567
Marketing and branding King of the universe

3678
03:02:05,823 --> 03:02:08,127
What the heck was this guy doing for 9 years

3679
03:02:10,431 --> 03:02:12,991
While he was putting out some propaganda we know

3680
03:02:13,759 --> 03:02:15,807
Something called the Cyrus cylinder is

3681
03:02:16,063 --> 03:02:16,575
Famous

3682
03:02:17,087 --> 03:02:22,207
And it's this piece where first Cyrus has the Babylonian God saying I was with him the whole way

3683
03:02:22,463 --> 03:02:24,767
And then he introduces himself is this good guy

3684
03:02:25,791 --> 03:02:31,935
Again propaganda makes it easier to rule the subject people if you make it feel like it was your God that wanted me

3685
03:02:34,495 --> 03:02:39,359
I came because he took my hand right to figure legitimizing your rule and tying you into the

3686
03:02:39,615 --> 03:02:45,759
Did the angel power structure basically saying that King you defeated was the real weirdo that the guy didn't want I am

3687
03:02:46,015 --> 03:02:46,783
Restoring

3688
03:02:47,039 --> 03:02:49,855
You know the kingship to the people that Marduk wants to have it

3689
03:02:50,367 --> 03:02:52,415
You can see that the same is true

3690
03:02:52,927 --> 03:02:59,071
In a lot of the other religions that Cyrus is involved with this is why a lot of people think this whole propaganda tolerance thing was much more.

3691
03:02:59,327 --> 03:03:00,095
Political move

3692
03:03:00,351 --> 03:03:03,423
Because look at how it helps him politically

3693
03:03:03,679 --> 03:03:06,751
In a way that by the way he could not have foreseen

3694
03:03:07,263 --> 03:03:08,287
It made him immortal

3695
03:03:10,335 --> 03:03:12,127
This is from Pierre Briones book

3696
03:03:12,383 --> 03:03:12,895
From Cyrus

3697
03:03:13,151 --> 03:03:14,175
2 Alexander

3698
03:03:14,431 --> 03:03:16,479
What's the translation from the Bible that he use

3699
03:03:17,247 --> 03:03:23,391
In the same way that the Cyrus cylinder says the Babylonian God Marduk took Cyrus handle swept away all the opposition

3700
03:03:24,159 --> 03:03:27,487
This is what the Israeli God Yahweh did according to the Bible

3701
03:03:27,743 --> 03:03:28,255
Quote

3702
03:03:29,023 --> 03:03:31,071
Thus says Yahweh to his appointed

3703
03:03:31,327 --> 03:03:32,095
Bucyrus

3704
03:03:32,351 --> 03:03:36,191
Whom he has taken by his right hand to subdue Nations before him

3705
03:03:36,447 --> 03:03:38,239
And strip the loins of Kings

3706
03:03:38,495 --> 03:03:42,079
Divorce gateways beforehand that their Gates be closed no more

3707
03:03:42,335 --> 03:03:44,639
I will go before you leveling the heights

3708
03:03:44,895 --> 03:03:46,943
I will shatter the bronze gateways

3709
03:03:47,199 --> 03:03:48,479
Smash the iron bars

3710
03:03:48,735 --> 03:03:50,527
I will give you the Hidden Treasures

3711
03:03:50,783 --> 03:03:51,807
The secret hoard

3712
03:03:52,063 --> 03:03:53,855
That you may know that I am Yahweh

3713
03:03:54,879 --> 03:03:55,391
And quote

3714
03:03:56,671 --> 03:04:02,047
The once again Cyrus has these Gods on his side why are they on the side when he's always helping isn't he

3715
03:04:02,303 --> 03:04:05,887
He's always doing what the priesthood of Marduk would like engine

3716
03:04:06,143 --> 03:04:08,447
It's interesting how Marduk follows along he likes you

3717
03:04:08,703 --> 03:04:09,983
Treat his priests well

3718
03:04:10,495 --> 03:04:12,031
In the case of Yahweh

3719
03:04:12,799 --> 03:04:18,943
Well according to the Bible again and Peter Brianna skeptical of the details but says in the bigger picture at least it was

3720
03:04:19,199 --> 03:04:20,479
Consistent with what actually happened

3721
03:04:20,735 --> 03:04:23,295
The Bible says that in the reign of a king

3722
03:04:23,551 --> 03:04:24,319
2 Chainz

3723
03:04:24,575 --> 03:04:28,671
After 2 official Kings after Cyrus they found the actual order

3724
03:04:28,927 --> 03:04:32,511
That would have made Yahweh pleased with investing shall we say

3725
03:04:32,767 --> 03:04:34,047
In the Cyrus conquests

3726
03:04:34,559 --> 03:04:37,375
According to the Bible in Pierre breons description of it

3727
03:04:37,887 --> 03:04:39,423
This is from Ezra by the way

3728
03:04:40,703 --> 03:04:43,263
Out of the royal archives of Fatima

3729
03:04:43,775 --> 03:04:44,799
The order said quote

3730
03:04:45,823 --> 03:04:48,127
In the first year of Cyrus the king

3731
03:04:48,383 --> 03:04:51,967
King Cyrus decreed temple of God in Jerusalem

3732
03:04:52,479 --> 03:04:58,367
The temple will be rebuilt as a place at which sacrifices are offered by which offerings are brought to be burnt

3733
03:04:58,623 --> 03:05:00,415
It's height is Tubi 60 cubits

3734
03:05:00,927 --> 03:05:01,439
It's with

3735
03:05:01,695 --> 03:05:02,207
60 cubed

3736
03:05:02,719 --> 03:05:05,023
There were to be three thicknesses of stone blocks

3737
03:05:05,279 --> 03:05:06,047
And one of what

3738
03:05:06,559 --> 03:05:08,863
The expenses to be met by the king's household

3739
03:05:09,375 --> 03:05:15,519
Furthermore the vessels of gold and silver from the temple of God which Nebuchadnezzar took from the sanctuary

3740
03:05:15,775 --> 03:05:19,103
Jerusalem and brought to Babylon going to be restored

3741
03:05:19,359 --> 03:05:24,479
So that everything may be restored to the sanctuary in Jerusalem and put back in the temple of God

3742
03:05:25,247 --> 03:05:25,759
And quote

3743
03:05:26,783 --> 03:05:32,927
Dr. nicely with that story of the ghostly hand doesn't it because what that guy belshazzar

3744
03:05:33,183 --> 03:05:34,975
Was drinking out of that made

3745
03:05:35,231 --> 03:05:40,863
In a y'all way so mad to begin with her all these sacred vessels from the old Temple in Jerusalem Solomon's Temple

3746
03:05:41,631 --> 03:05:42,399
Cyrus One

3747
03:05:42,655 --> 03:05:43,679
The cream that you rebuild

3748
03:05:43,935 --> 03:05:44,703
Solomon's Temple

3749
03:05:45,215 --> 03:05:46,751
And you pay for it out of the

3750
03:05:47,007 --> 03:05:47,775
King's treasure

3751
03:05:48,543 --> 03:05:51,615
Can you bring back all these things that are still around

3752
03:05:51,871 --> 03:05:54,175
And restock the temple with them

3753
03:05:54,687 --> 03:05:56,223
And then you send the people

3754
03:05:56,479 --> 03:05:58,527
Who has been deported to your back home

3755
03:06:00,319 --> 03:06:01,343
Now here's the thing

3756
03:06:01,855 --> 03:06:03,647
This reconstituted

3757
03:06:03,903 --> 03:06:04,927
You know area

3758
03:06:05,183 --> 03:06:08,767
It will become a satrap by the way does not have its political freedom

3759
03:06:09,023 --> 03:06:10,815
They're not going to be the way they were

3760
03:06:11,071 --> 03:06:13,887
You know when the Babylonians and Egyptians were arguing over them

3761
03:06:14,655 --> 03:06:20,287
But you got to see that they're pretty darn far ahead they went from a people that might have died out

3762
03:06:20,799 --> 03:06:21,823
Religiously

3763
03:06:22,335 --> 03:06:24,639
Defective book I have the places Cyrus has one of the top

3764
03:06:24,895 --> 03:06:29,247
Most 100 influential people of all time says that that's one of the things maybe you credit him with

3765
03:06:29,759 --> 03:06:31,551
The fact that if he doesn't do this

3766
03:06:32,063 --> 03:06:33,599
There's a chance Judaism

3767
03:06:34,111 --> 03:06:35,903
Doesn't continue over the Long Haul

3768
03:06:36,671 --> 03:06:39,231
In this case he builds what's known as the second temple

3769
03:06:39,743 --> 03:06:41,535
And if you want to see continuity

3770
03:06:41,791 --> 03:06:47,167
The wall that is still one of the holiest did not be holy ass I get the Temple Mount would be Holier but but it's

3771
03:06:47,423 --> 03:06:48,191
Part of the Temple mount

3772
03:06:48,703 --> 03:06:51,007
It is the famous in the Western Wall

3773
03:06:51,263 --> 03:06:52,543
The Western Wall

3774
03:06:52,799 --> 03:06:55,103
Is a Roman era Edition

3775
03:06:55,615 --> 03:06:57,151
To the second temple

3776
03:06:57,663 --> 03:06:58,431
Which Cyrus

3777
03:06:58,687 --> 03:07:00,735
Allegedly according to the Bible

3778
03:07:00,991 --> 03:07:02,783
Paid for an authorized

3779
03:07:04,063 --> 03:07:05,087
So interesting isn't it

3780
03:07:05,343 --> 03:07:05,855
Considerate

3781
03:07:06,367 --> 03:07:10,207
How connected the stories of the ancient at Ronnies ancient Persians are

3782
03:07:10,719 --> 03:07:11,743
To the ancient Jewish

3783
03:07:11,999 --> 03:07:14,047
Especially considering the current

3784
03:07:14,303 --> 03:07:15,839
Antagonism between them

3785
03:07:16,351 --> 03:07:19,423
As late as the 1970s the Shah of Iran was was

3786
03:07:19,679 --> 03:07:21,471
Touting this ancient closeness

3787
03:07:21,727 --> 03:07:23,263
Between the peoples in their relationship

3788
03:07:24,799 --> 03:07:29,407
If not for the ancient Persians and Iranians there's a chance there wouldn't be Judaism today

3789
03:07:30,175 --> 03:07:34,015
And depending on when it died out there's a very good chance you wouldn't have had their religions

3790
03:07:34,527 --> 03:07:35,039
That

3791
03:07:35,295 --> 03:07:39,647
Sprouted off that Branch you into had Christianity you probably wouldn't that Islam in other words

3792
03:07:40,159 --> 03:07:42,463
Is Cyrus the Great actually did do this

3793
03:07:43,231 --> 03:07:45,023
And he had never lived to do it

3794
03:07:45,535 --> 03:07:46,815
What would the world look like today

3795
03:07:47,583 --> 03:07:48,863
Another thing of session that

3796
03:07:49,119 --> 03:07:51,935
100 most influential people of all time that I thought was interesting is that

3797
03:07:52,191 --> 03:07:54,751
Many of the people that get credited as being very important

3798
03:07:55,007 --> 03:07:56,287
And dynamic and

3799
03:07:56,543 --> 03:07:57,567
Instrumental

3800
03:07:58,079 --> 03:08:00,383
Human beings in terms of their effect on history

3801
03:08:00,639 --> 03:08:02,431
It's something that would have been done anyway

3802
03:08:03,455 --> 03:08:05,503
I got a big-time or that way

3803
03:08:05,759 --> 03:08:09,087
But a lot of this stuff would have happened someone else would've discovered the light bulb probably

3804
03:08:09,855 --> 03:08:10,623
The author Thoreau

3805
03:08:10,879 --> 03:08:11,391
Likely

3806
03:08:11,903 --> 03:08:13,439
That if Cyrus the Great that never live

3807
03:08:14,207 --> 03:08:14,975
None of this stuff

3808
03:08:16,511 --> 03:08:17,279
He was a

3809
03:08:17,791 --> 03:08:18,559
Unique individual

3810
03:08:19,071 --> 03:08:22,143
Even though you can't get your mind around the specifics of how he was a unique individual

3811
03:08:22,655 --> 03:08:24,191
You can sort of look at what buildup

3812
03:08:24,703 --> 03:08:30,591
Even appear Brianna's right and you have to assume that there was a lot of foundation bubbling up under the surface for Cyrus to work with

3813
03:08:31,359 --> 03:08:32,383
Is it still a pretty incredible

3814
03:08:32,639 --> 03:08:33,151
Human being

3815
03:08:34,431 --> 03:08:35,967
I think you could probably say

3816
03:08:36,735 --> 03:08:37,503
With a decent

3817
03:08:37,759 --> 03:08:38,783
Chance of being right

3818
03:08:39,551 --> 03:08:40,575
But he is

3819
03:08:40,831 --> 03:08:43,391
In the 5:30 is BCE the greatest

3820
03:08:43,647 --> 03:08:45,183
Geopolitical figure

3821
03:08:45,439 --> 03:08:46,207
Who's ever lived

3822
03:08:48,255 --> 03:08:49,023
Which makes

3823
03:08:49,279 --> 03:08:51,071
The next thing I'm going to say

3824
03:08:52,095 --> 03:08:53,375
Is it hard to believe

3825
03:08:53,631 --> 03:08:54,655
You know why should I say

3826
03:08:54,911 --> 03:08:55,423
How about

3827
03:08:55,679 --> 03:08:56,191
Letting

3828
03:08:56,447 --> 03:08:57,471
Historian 80 homes

3829
03:08:57,983 --> 03:08:59,519
Getting a book published in 1940

3830
03:09:01,055 --> 03:09:01,567
Say it

3831
03:09:02,079 --> 03:09:02,847
And again

3832
03:09:03,103 --> 03:09:04,895
Is there any more of a telling

3833
03:09:05,407 --> 03:09:06,431
Example that

3834
03:09:06,943 --> 03:09:08,735
These people live at the very tail end

3835
03:09:08,991 --> 03:09:13,855
Black and white era of recording of human history has how can this guy be as big as he is

3836
03:09:14,367 --> 03:09:15,903
And yet this next line be true

3837
03:09:16,159 --> 03:09:16,927
Homestead said

3838
03:09:17,183 --> 03:09:17,695
Quote

3839
03:09:19,231 --> 03:09:20,511
Here we must leave Cyrus

3840
03:09:20,767 --> 03:09:22,815
For suddenly and without warning

3841
03:09:23,071 --> 03:09:24,607
Our information comes to an end

3842
03:09:26,143 --> 03:09:26,655
And quote

3843
03:09:27,679 --> 03:09:28,703
200 years after

3844
03:09:30,495 --> 03:09:33,567
We will know Alexander the Great's symptoms

3845
03:09:33,823 --> 03:09:39,967
To such a degree the doctor's today try to diagnose what he may have died up and they still don't know I'm not saying everything's

3846
03:09:40,735 --> 03:09:43,551
But you know where when the house the wise

3847
03:09:44,319 --> 03:09:45,343
How can you not know

3848
03:09:45,599 --> 03:09:46,367
How does guy die

3849
03:09:48,159 --> 03:09:51,743
I like number for in his life as portrayed by Herodotus

3850
03:09:52,511 --> 03:09:56,607
Is Herodotus a story of how he dies and I love the fact that Herodotus goes to

3851
03:09:56,863 --> 03:10:03,007
You know the trouble to point out that he's heard several different versions of the story but the one he's going to give you as the one he thinks his MO

3852
03:10:03,263 --> 03:10:03,775
Most likely

3853
03:10:04,799 --> 03:10:06,335
And maybe it's just a coincidence

3854
03:10:06,847 --> 03:10:10,175
That the story that Herodotus thinks is most likely

3855
03:10:10,431 --> 03:10:12,479
Is the one with the most exotic

3856
03:10:13,247 --> 03:10:14,271
Interesting

3857
03:10:14,527 --> 03:10:18,623
Movie like elements to it you can imagine I can't imagine he left a better

3858
03:10:18,879 --> 03:10:21,695
Version on the table somewhere say nope you know I just don't be

3859
03:10:22,975 --> 03:10:24,511
Because the one he used is so awesome

3860
03:10:24,767 --> 03:10:26,047
Now is it believable

3861
03:10:26,559 --> 03:10:28,863
That's the problem here nobody knows what to believe

3862
03:10:29,887 --> 03:10:32,447
Off the top of my head if you ask me what percentage

3863
03:10:32,703 --> 03:10:36,287
Bought into the general idea of Herodotus a story I think it's like 80

3864
03:10:37,823 --> 03:10:43,967
Most of them don't believe any of the details but the broad idea that in 5:30 BCE Cyrus the Great died so

3865
03:10:44,223 --> 03:10:48,831
Somewhere out in this step area as Herodotus said details probably

3866
03:10:49,343 --> 03:10:49,855
Unknown

3867
03:10:50,879 --> 03:10:54,719
About 20% I'd say of the historians don't think he died a completely different way

3868
03:10:55,231 --> 03:11:01,375
Something against different tribes in Herodotus says different areas others that he didn't die that way at all xenophon writing a couples

3869
03:11:01,631 --> 03:11:03,167
Afterwards he died in bed

3870
03:11:03,423 --> 03:11:03,935
Peacefully

3871
03:11:04,959 --> 03:11:11,103
So there's a mystery to buy that you hit it wrong it's a generally I think a higher percentage of historians think he didn't die the way Herodotus

3872
03:11:11,359 --> 03:11:11,871
Says

3873
03:11:12,639 --> 03:11:14,431
You could understand why

3874
03:11:14,687 --> 03:11:18,015
You be a little skeptical it's just too darn interesting the way erotica

3875
03:11:19,039 --> 03:11:19,807
You can see

3876
03:11:20,319 --> 03:11:23,903
You're the admonition that I got when I was starting in journalism the one that said

3877
03:11:24,159 --> 03:11:25,951
Natal what really happened

3878
03:11:26,463 --> 03:11:28,511
In the most interesting way possible

3879
03:11:29,023 --> 03:11:31,583
What happens to an admonition like that

3880
03:11:31,839 --> 03:11:34,655
If there's no way you could possibly know what really hot

3881
03:11:35,679 --> 03:11:36,703
But you have to tell it anyway

3882
03:11:37,471 --> 03:11:42,847
What are your standards then you pretty much left with the most interesting way you can at that point right

3883
03:11:44,383 --> 03:11:46,175
Drop the story as Herodotus tells it

3884
03:11:46,431 --> 03:11:47,199
Involves this

3885
03:11:47,455 --> 03:11:51,807
Little twist you're going to end up leaving his theatrical presentation with a deeper message

3886
03:11:52,575 --> 03:11:58,719
Again the deeper message may or may not be true Herodotus couches the story now into the idea of ovary

3887
03:11:59,743 --> 03:12:02,815
Maybe the idea of absolute power corrupting absolutely

3888
03:12:03,071 --> 03:12:04,607
And before we write this off

3889
03:12:05,119 --> 03:12:09,727
As many historians do right away because it's just such an obvious moral message remember you can make that

3890
03:12:09,983 --> 03:12:11,263
Case about Hitler

3891
03:12:11,775 --> 03:12:13,567
You know what the absolute power

3892
03:12:13,823 --> 03:12:18,687
Turning you mad after a while with Alexander you can make that case I mean I guess there are historical figures

3893
03:12:19,455 --> 03:12:23,039
Where this is both of motif cuz it's this recurring theme you see all the time

3894
03:12:23,295 --> 03:12:24,831
But it also happens to be true

3895
03:12:25,599 --> 03:12:26,623
Maybe

3896
03:12:26,879 --> 03:12:29,439
After years of being King of the universe

3897
03:12:29,951 --> 03:12:35,071
Cyrus got a little full of himself who knows but that's the way this is portrayed right is going to be the object lesson here

3898
03:12:35,327 --> 03:12:36,863
And the person that is going to stick it

3899
03:12:37,375 --> 03:12:40,447
To Cyrus and teach him this lesson is going to be a queen

3900
03:12:41,471 --> 03:12:46,335
Yeah but you have to think of it like an Amazonian Queen this isn't some woman who's walking around in velvet

3901
03:12:46,847 --> 03:12:52,479
You don't want a throne being fan I mean this is a person who probably Once Upon a Time was killing men

3902
03:12:53,247 --> 03:12:54,271
In hand-to-hand combat

3903
03:12:56,063 --> 03:12:57,855
Got it this woman really exist

3904
03:12:58,623 --> 03:13:01,695
Who the heck knows there's no historical confirmation that I've ever seen

3905
03:13:01,951 --> 03:13:03,743
It says that they found anything that proves

3906
03:13:03,999 --> 03:13:07,839
This queen is named by the way I used to call it to Mira's when I was growing up but I've seen

3907
03:13:08,351 --> 03:13:09,631
Timorous timorous

3908
03:13:09,887 --> 03:13:11,167
Number different pronunciation

3909
03:13:11,935 --> 03:13:13,727
I think Shakespeare might have used her as a character

3910
03:13:14,239 --> 03:13:14,751
His place

3911
03:13:16,031 --> 03:13:18,335
None the less you can say couple of things one

3912
03:13:18,591 --> 03:13:23,967
It wouldn't have been outrageous to think of her is a Female warrior because these tribes actually had them

3913
03:13:25,759 --> 03:13:28,063
It may have been the actual root of the

3914
03:13:28,319 --> 03:13:29,343
Idea of

3915
03:13:29,855 --> 03:13:31,903
Amazon's inside of a mythology

3916
03:13:32,927 --> 03:13:34,207
So she could have actually been

3917
03:13:34,975 --> 03:13:36,511
A killer Warrior

3918
03:13:37,791 --> 03:13:40,607
And also the tribes he was supposed to have led

3919
03:13:41,119 --> 03:13:41,631
Was real

3920
03:13:41,887 --> 03:13:43,167
All too real to some people

3921
03:13:43,423 --> 03:13:45,983
They were called the mastic Italian the message tie

3922
03:13:48,287 --> 03:13:48,799
Dangerous

3923
03:13:49,055 --> 03:13:50,079
Powerful numeracy

3924
03:13:50,335 --> 03:13:51,103
Tribal

3925
03:13:51,359 --> 03:13:52,127
Coalition

3926
03:13:52,895 --> 03:13:53,407
That

3927
03:13:54,175 --> 03:14:00,319
Urologist in his writings he have to set it up and tell you what he knows which isn't much he says I hear there was Skippy and Peep

3928
03:14:00,575 --> 03:14:01,599
But we kind of were

3929
03:14:03,391 --> 03:14:04,159
You have to think of

3930
03:14:04,671 --> 03:14:05,951
Mangol type

3931
03:14:06,207 --> 03:14:06,719
Culture

3932
03:14:07,487 --> 03:14:11,839
But with people who were probably predominantly light-skinned

3933
03:14:12,351 --> 03:14:12,863
And

3934
03:14:13,119 --> 03:14:15,935
Ranging on the scale of looks from like a turkey

3935
03:14:16,191 --> 03:14:16,703
It's kind of look

3936
03:14:16,959 --> 03:14:20,543
All the way up to people with blond and red hair

3937
03:14:20,799 --> 03:14:22,847
Blue and green eyes tall

3938
03:14:23,359 --> 03:14:24,639
Is a little Viking site

3939
03:14:25,407 --> 03:14:26,687
A little bit of the Viking ethos

3940
03:14:26,943 --> 03:14:28,479
Bella Thorne worshipping

3941
03:14:28,735 --> 03:14:30,527
And things like that supposedly once a year

3942
03:14:30,783 --> 03:14:31,807
These people would have a

3943
03:14:32,063 --> 03:14:34,367
Scaffold erected they put a sword on top of

3944
03:14:34,623 --> 03:14:40,767
The scaffold and then they would mark underneath the scaffold one out of every 100 prisoners that they captured over the year and execute them

3945
03:14:41,279 --> 03:14:42,047
Sacrificed

3946
03:14:42,815 --> 03:14:43,583
Sky Go

3947
03:14:43,839 --> 03:14:44,351
God the son God

3948
03:14:44,863 --> 03:14:45,375
Miss right

3949
03:14:47,167 --> 03:14:48,191
These are colorful

3950
03:14:48,703 --> 03:14:51,263
Scary people just what you wanted a story like this

3951
03:14:51,519 --> 03:14:54,335
Herodotus is already talked about their head hunting

3952
03:14:54,847 --> 03:14:55,871
The fact that they make

3953
03:14:56,383 --> 03:15:00,735
You know drinking cups out of skulls and the really nasty Warriors are the ones with the most

3954
03:15:00,991 --> 03:15:01,503
Cups

3955
03:15:02,527 --> 03:15:07,391
He talks about their cannabis you so again this is the Exotic Barbarian you want to hear what they do

3956
03:15:07,647 --> 03:15:08,415
He says they found this

3957
03:15:08,671 --> 03:15:09,951
Fruit that they can burn

3958
03:15:10,207 --> 03:15:15,071
And then they sit around the fire burning the fruit and it gets them intoxicated like wine gets Greeks and talks

3959
03:15:15,327 --> 03:15:15,839
Educated

3960
03:15:16,095 --> 03:15:16,607
So another little bit

3961
03:15:16,863 --> 03:15:18,655
Barbarian color to throw in

3962
03:15:19,167 --> 03:15:20,959
He also points out according to him

3963
03:15:21,471 --> 03:15:26,335
They're very promiscuous you might call them free-love types or swingers Maybe

3964
03:15:26,847 --> 03:15:28,639
Anybody can sleep with anybody else's wife he just

3965
03:15:28,895 --> 03:15:30,175
Had to put his bow

3966
03:15:30,431 --> 03:15:32,735
You know alongside their 10 to let him know

3967
03:15:33,503 --> 03:15:34,271
You're interested I guess

3968
03:15:35,295 --> 03:15:35,807
So

3969
03:15:36,063 --> 03:15:37,087
Weed smoking

3970
03:15:37,343 --> 03:15:38,367
Headhunting

3971
03:15:38,623 --> 03:15:40,415
Blood drinking white sharing bike

3972
03:15:40,927 --> 03:15:47,071
Who would not want that in a good story if you don't know anything you just trying to make the best story make sure you include these

3973
03:15:48,351 --> 03:15:50,655
Herodotus says that Cyrus leads an army

3974
03:15:51,167 --> 03:15:52,959
Up to this Queen's territory

3975
03:15:53,471 --> 03:15:55,519
And then basically proposes marriage to

3976
03:15:56,031 --> 03:15:57,823
So would be like a diplomatic Alliance

3977
03:15:58,847 --> 03:15:59,615
Herodotus says that

3978
03:16:00,127 --> 03:16:02,431
She sees through this ruse immediately saying

3979
03:16:02,687 --> 03:16:05,247
He just wants to conquer her people by marrying her

3980
03:16:06,527 --> 03:16:08,063
So then when she says no

3981
03:16:08,319 --> 03:16:09,855
He begins to try

3982
03:16:10,111 --> 03:16:12,415
To set up what we would call today in amphibious

3983
03:16:12,671 --> 03:16:13,439
River Crossing

3984
03:16:13,695 --> 03:16:14,207
Is a big river

3985
03:16:14,463 --> 03:16:16,255
The divide the territory he's coming from

3986
03:16:16,767 --> 03:16:17,791
From the territory of these

3987
03:16:18,303 --> 03:16:20,607
Central Asian horse Nomads up in places like

3988
03:16:20,863 --> 03:16:21,375
Like you know

3989
03:16:21,631 --> 03:16:22,143
Kha'zix

3990
03:16:22,655 --> 03:16:23,935
Any places like that today

3991
03:16:25,215 --> 03:16:28,287
And as Cyrus and the Persians were told her building these boats

3992
03:16:28,543 --> 03:16:30,079
Some of which have like Towers

3993
03:16:30,335 --> 03:16:31,615
Fighting Towers on them

3994
03:16:32,127 --> 03:16:33,151
She sends him a message

3995
03:16:33,407 --> 03:16:37,759
Remember she's going to be like the voice of avenging Karma here

3996
03:16:38,271 --> 03:16:40,575
In teaching Cyrus a lesson

3997
03:16:40,831 --> 03:16:46,207
So her voice in the words that Herodotus puts in her mouth from a screenwriter showrunners point of view

3998
03:16:46,463 --> 03:16:49,791
Are designed to naset this idea up right

3999
03:16:50,047 --> 03:16:54,399
You should know but you don't you know you're going to get what's coming to you here's what Herodotus says

4000
03:16:54,911 --> 03:16:55,935
This is the de selincourt

4001
03:16:58,239 --> 03:16:58,751
Quote

4002
03:16:59,263 --> 03:17:00,287
King of the medes

4003
03:17:00,543 --> 03:17:02,847
I advise you to abandon this Enterprise

4004
03:17:03,359 --> 03:17:06,175
But you cannot know if in the end it will do you any good

4005
03:17:06,687 --> 03:17:07,711
Rule your own peep

4006
03:17:08,223 --> 03:17:10,527
And try to Bear the sight of me ruling mine

4007
03:17:11,039 --> 03:17:15,391
But of course you will refuse my advice as the last thing you wish for us to live in peace

4008
03:17:15,903 --> 03:17:16,415
Listen that

4009
03:17:16,927 --> 03:17:20,511
If you are so bent upon trying your strength against domestic a tie

4010
03:17:20,767 --> 03:17:23,327
Give up the laborious task of building that bridge

4011
03:17:23,839 --> 03:17:26,911
And let my Army withdraw three days March from the river

4012
03:17:27,167 --> 03:17:28,447
And then you come over yourself

4013
03:17:28,959 --> 03:17:32,031
Or if you prefer red retire the same distance yourself

4014
03:17:32,287 --> 03:17:34,079
And let us meet you on your side of the river

4015
03:17:35,103 --> 03:17:35,615
And quote

4016
03:17:36,895 --> 03:17:37,407
This

4017
03:17:37,919 --> 03:17:40,479
Barbarian Warrior Queen

4018
03:17:41,503 --> 03:17:47,391
Is basically saying to a guy whose title includes king of kings and King of the universe

4019
03:17:48,671 --> 03:17:49,439
To come and get it

4020
03:17:50,207 --> 03:17:51,999
Or I'll come over and take it from you

4021
03:17:54,047 --> 03:17:56,607
That's a pretty strong female character isn't

4022
03:17:57,119 --> 03:18:03,263
I was thinking that it makes Herodotus a X look a little pro-feminist right like you like he's been looking for a good strong fee

4023
03:18:03,519 --> 03:18:04,031
Female character

4024
03:18:05,055 --> 03:18:07,359
Doesn't know the reason maybe that would play well

4025
03:18:07,871 --> 03:18:10,431
Maybe some of the people in his audience are women

4026
03:18:10,687 --> 03:18:14,271
And it would be good to have a character that they could both relate to in cheer for

4027
03:18:15,295 --> 03:18:17,343
Finally it might just be a dig

4028
03:18:17,599 --> 03:18:19,391
@the manliness of the Persian

4029
03:18:19,647 --> 03:18:20,415
It's right I mean

4030
03:18:20,671 --> 03:18:23,487
Here's the greatest King that Asia has ever produced

4031
03:18:23,999 --> 03:18:26,559
And he's about to be beaten and killed by a woman

4032
03:18:27,839 --> 03:18:32,447
Nonetheless in the story when she says you know do you want it over here do you want it over there

4033
03:18:32,703 --> 03:18:33,727
Cyrus and his

4034
03:18:33,983 --> 03:18:40,127
In a general and whatnot sit down have a conference about this what do we do Which choice do we take in all his advisers they let her come to our side of

4035
03:18:40,895 --> 03:18:43,711
One adviser though says None of my go over to her side

4036
03:18:44,223 --> 03:18:45,247
That advisor

4037
03:18:45,503 --> 03:18:48,319
Is our Old Friend the King of Lydia croesus

4038
03:18:49,343 --> 03:18:51,391
Instead of being killed Herodotus has

4039
03:18:51,647 --> 03:18:55,231
You know going in the stories of acting is advisor to Cyrus all the way through

4040
03:18:57,279 --> 03:18:59,071
Increase his advice is totally different

4041
03:18:59,839 --> 03:19:01,119
Personal he says you can't

4042
03:19:01,375 --> 03:19:05,471
Let her come over here and get branded front of her it's a woman it would look terrible so

4043
03:19:05,727 --> 03:19:07,007
Is that other little dig

4044
03:19:07,519 --> 03:19:09,311
He says go over to her side

4045
03:19:10,079 --> 03:19:11,103
And then he says

4046
03:19:11,615 --> 03:19:13,151
And how about we do

4047
03:19:13,407 --> 03:19:14,175
A little trick

4048
03:19:14,943 --> 03:19:16,735
Any precedes to tell

4049
03:19:17,247 --> 03:19:18,015
Cyrus

4050
03:19:18,527 --> 03:19:21,087
Did they should have essentially do the same thing

4051
03:19:21,343 --> 03:19:24,159
To these people that the medes did to

4052
03:19:24,415 --> 03:19:29,279
Either these people or their cousins a generation before in a store you may recall

4053
03:19:30,047 --> 03:19:31,839
Get them all drunk and kill them

4054
03:19:33,119 --> 03:19:34,911
Midas ellincourt translation

4055
03:19:35,423 --> 03:19:37,471
As croesus telling Cyrus

4056
03:19:37,727 --> 03:19:38,495
To do it this way

4057
03:19:39,007 --> 03:19:39,519
Quote

4058
03:19:40,031 --> 03:19:41,567
Here then is my advice

4059
03:19:41,823 --> 03:19:42,591
Cross the river

4060
03:19:42,847 --> 03:19:45,151
Advance to the limit of the enemy's withdrawal

4061
03:19:45,407 --> 03:19:47,967
And then get the better of them by a piece of strategy

4062
03:19:48,479 --> 03:19:53,087
I have heard that these people have no experience of such luxuries as the Persians enjoy

4063
03:19:53,343 --> 03:19:55,391
I know nothing about the pleasures of life

4064
03:19:55,903 --> 03:19:57,695
What is take advantage of this fact

4065
03:19:58,207 --> 03:19:59,231
And set out of bank

4066
03:19:59,487 --> 03:20:00,255
Narcan

4067
03:20:00,511 --> 03:20:02,047
On the most generous scale

4068
03:20:02,303 --> 03:20:04,607
With a great many sheep slaughtered and dressed

4069
03:20:04,863 --> 03:20:06,399
All sorts of other dishes

4070
03:20:06,655 --> 03:20:09,727
And bowls of strong wine in Liberal quantities

4071
03:20:10,495 --> 03:20:12,287
Then when the banquet is all prepared

4072
03:20:12,543 --> 03:20:13,055
He says

4073
03:20:13,567 --> 03:20:15,103
Let us March back to the river

4074
03:20:15,359 --> 03:20:18,431
Leaving only a Detachment of inferior troops behind

4075
03:20:18,943 --> 03:20:20,479
Unless I'm very much mistaken

4076
03:20:20,735 --> 03:20:23,039
When our enemies see all those good things

4077
03:20:23,295 --> 03:20:24,575
They will set to work upon them

4078
03:20:25,087 --> 03:20:28,159
And that will be our chance to distinguish ourselves by a bold stroke

4079
03:20:28,927 --> 03:20:29,439
And quote

4080
03:20:31,231 --> 03:20:34,047
Again is that a recurring Motif or is that just a

4081
03:20:34,303 --> 03:20:36,863
Tactic that seems to work quite a bit who knows

4082
03:20:37,375 --> 03:20:39,167
But in the story we're told

4083
03:20:39,423 --> 03:20:40,703
That the author

4084
03:20:40,959 --> 03:20:41,983
Of the army

4085
03:20:42,239 --> 03:20:43,007
Chose up

4086
03:20:43,263 --> 03:20:45,055
Chills the inferior troops

4087
03:20:45,311 --> 03:20:47,871
Cease all the food in the wine precedes to get

4088
03:20:48,383 --> 03:20:54,527
In a very full and very drunk and then the Persians come in kill a bunch of them and capture some others about a third of the army

4089
03:20:54,783 --> 03:20:55,807
According to Herodotus

4090
03:20:56,575 --> 03:20:58,879
Included amongst the prisoners

4091
03:20:59,391 --> 03:21:00,159
A general

4092
03:21:00,415 --> 03:21:03,743
Who also happens to be this Barbarian Queen's son

4093
03:21:06,047 --> 03:21:12,191
So now in this scenario Herodotus is playing with his movies turned into a little bit of a thriller with a little chess match and all the

4094
03:21:12,447 --> 03:21:14,495
Sunday Cyrus's side is captured a major

4095
03:21:14,751 --> 03:21:15,263
Peace

4096
03:21:15,775 --> 03:21:16,543
Son of the queen

4097
03:21:18,079 --> 03:21:19,615
Sochi issues one of these

4098
03:21:20,383 --> 03:21:21,663
I'll let you go now if

4099
03:21:21,919 --> 03:21:23,199
Give me back my son

4100
03:21:23,711 --> 03:21:24,223
Kinds of spy

4101
03:21:25,503 --> 03:21:27,039
From the Purvis translation

4102
03:21:29,087 --> 03:21:32,159
Went to Mira's learned what had happened to her Army and her son

4103
03:21:32,415 --> 03:21:34,975
You sent a Herald to Cyrus with this message

4104
03:21:35,487 --> 03:21:36,767
Bloodthirsty Cyrus

4105
03:21:37,023 --> 03:21:39,327
Do not gloat over what has happened here

4106
03:21:39,583 --> 03:21:43,423
You Persians indulge yourself with the fruit of the vine to the point of Madness

4107
03:21:43,935 --> 03:21:46,239
So that the wind descends into your body

4108
03:21:46,495 --> 03:21:50,591
Ugly words flow up and out of you by such means you have tricked me

4109
03:21:50,847 --> 03:21:52,383
Are you taking my son prisoner

4110
03:21:52,639 --> 03:21:54,431
But not by shoepremacy in battle

4111
03:21:54,943 --> 03:21:55,455
Well then

4112
03:21:55,711 --> 03:21:57,247
I heard you to follow this advice

4113
03:21:57,759 --> 03:21:59,295
Return my son to me

4114
03:21:59,551 --> 03:22:04,159
And despite the damage you have cunningly wreaked upon a third part of the army of the message that I

4115
03:22:04,415 --> 03:22:06,207
You may leave this land on our

4116
03:22:06,719 --> 03:22:07,999
If you do not do this

4117
03:22:08,255 --> 03:22:10,815
I swear by the Sun the lord.of.the masakit I

4118
03:22:11,071 --> 03:22:13,119
Did I will satisfy your thirst for blood

4119
03:22:13,375 --> 03:22:14,655
Insatiable As You Are

4120
03:22:15,935 --> 03:22:16,447
And quote

4121
03:22:17,471 --> 03:22:19,007
So was Cyrus going to do

4122
03:22:19,263 --> 03:22:20,031
With this interesting

4123
03:22:20,287 --> 03:22:20,799
Powerful

4124
03:22:21,567 --> 03:22:22,079
Chest piece

4125
03:22:23,871 --> 03:22:25,151
He doesn't get the chance to decide

4126
03:22:25,919 --> 03:22:28,991
Because we're told that as soon as the Queen's Sons sobers up

4127
03:22:29,759 --> 03:22:30,527
Finds himself

4128
03:22:31,039 --> 03:22:32,831
You know hands tied or bound

4129
03:22:33,343 --> 03:22:35,903
He beseeches Cyrus to undo his hands

4130
03:22:36,671 --> 03:22:37,695
Somehow Cyrus's

4131
03:22:37,951 --> 03:22:38,719
Convinced and

4132
03:22:39,231 --> 03:22:41,791
I like the way my Rawlinson translation puts it

4133
03:22:42,047 --> 03:22:44,351
The minute his hands were free rawlinson's

4134
03:22:44,607 --> 03:22:46,143
Herodotus says he destroyed

4135
03:22:48,447 --> 03:22:49,471
3 committed suicide

4136
03:22:50,239 --> 03:22:51,519
Now all of a sudden

4137
03:22:51,775 --> 03:22:53,055
Cyrus just lost his pay

4138
03:22:55,359 --> 03:22:57,407
And this is when we're told the Battle app

4139
03:22:59,455 --> 03:23:00,479
This from the desellum

4140
03:23:00,991 --> 03:23:01,759
Translation quote

4141
03:23:02,783 --> 03:23:08,927
The queen on hearing that Cyrus ignored her terms engaged him in the field with all the forces she possess

4142
03:23:09,695 --> 03:23:14,815
The battle which followed I judge you have been more violent than any other fought between foreign Nations

4143
03:23:15,327 --> 03:23:17,119
According to the information that I have

4144
03:23:17,375 --> 03:23:23,519
The engagement began with the two armies coming to a halt within range of each other and exchanging shots with bows and

4145
03:23:23,775 --> 03:23:25,823
Narrows until their arrows were used up

4146
03:23:26,079 --> 03:23:28,639
After which there was a long period of close fighting

4147
03:23:28,895 --> 03:23:30,175
With Spears and daggers

4148
03:23:30,431 --> 03:23:32,479
Neither side being willing to retreat

4149
03:23:32,735 --> 03:23:35,551
Finally however the masakit I got the upper hand

4150
03:23:36,063 --> 03:23:39,391
The greater part of the Persian army was destroyed where it stood

4151
03:23:39,647 --> 03:23:41,183
And Cyrus himself was killed

4152
03:23:41,695 --> 03:23:43,743
He'd been on the throne for 29 years

4153
03:23:45,023 --> 03:23:45,535
And quote

4154
03:23:47,071 --> 03:23:47,583
Of course

4155
03:23:48,095 --> 03:23:49,119
That doesn't quite

4156
03:23:49,375 --> 03:23:50,911
Twist the knife enough

4157
03:23:51,935 --> 03:23:54,751
Have you leaving the performance really thinking

4158
03:23:55,007 --> 03:23:57,055
Thinking about some of the greater things in life

4159
03:23:58,335 --> 03:23:59,615
Socarrat is from my

4160
03:23:59,871 --> 03:24:01,407
Purvis translation

4161
03:24:02,175 --> 03:24:02,943
Add the code

4162
03:24:03,455 --> 03:24:03,967
The story

4163
03:24:04,991 --> 03:24:05,759
Price quote

4164
03:24:06,783 --> 03:24:09,855
Queen Tamara Stanfield a wineskin with human blood

4165
03:24:10,111 --> 03:24:13,183
And search for the corpse of Cyrus amongst the Persian dead

4166
03:24:13,695 --> 03:24:14,719
When she found him

4167
03:24:14,975 --> 03:24:17,023
He thrusts his head into the wineskin

4168
03:24:17,279 --> 03:24:18,815
Unless she does abused the Corp

4169
03:24:19,071 --> 03:24:20,351
She declared to it

4170
03:24:20,607 --> 03:24:21,375
I am alive

4171
03:24:21,631 --> 03:24:23,167
Concord Yuan battle

4172
03:24:23,423 --> 03:24:26,495
But you have ruined Me by taking my son through dial

4173
03:24:26,751 --> 03:24:28,543
Well then just as I threatened

4174
03:24:28,799 --> 03:24:30,847
I will slake your thirst for blood

4175
03:24:31,871 --> 03:24:32,383
And quote

4176
03:24:34,175 --> 03:24:34,943
So if

4177
03:24:35,199 --> 03:24:35,967
As the

4178
03:24:36,223 --> 03:24:40,831
Recurring Greek Motif will later show that the Persians are serial over Reacher's

4179
03:24:42,367 --> 03:24:46,463
I'm sure her audit is his attitude here's that they should have learned their lesson with Cyrus

4180
03:24:48,511 --> 03:24:49,791
By the time Cyrus exits

4181
03:24:50,047 --> 03:24:50,559
The scene though

4182
03:24:51,839 --> 03:24:52,607
Built an Empire

4183
03:24:53,631 --> 03:24:54,399
Stretches from

4184
03:24:55,167 --> 03:24:58,495
The modern-day Pakistan all the way to the Mediterranean

4185
03:24:59,775 --> 03:25:03,103
I've been to Turkey down by the Red Sea to the borders of Egypt

4186
03:25:03,359 --> 03:25:05,151
Can out to the Central Asian steppe

4187
03:25:06,943 --> 03:25:07,967
He's taken

4188
03:25:08,735 --> 03:25:11,807
Your efforts in and spent years organizing it

4189
03:25:12,063 --> 03:25:13,343
Putting it in a form

4190
03:25:13,855 --> 03:25:16,415
Word has a chance to live on after he's gone

4191
03:25:17,695 --> 03:25:19,231
None the less you cannot lose

4192
03:25:19,487 --> 03:25:19,999
Person

4193
03:25:20,255 --> 03:25:25,631
Of that magnitude you cannot lose in Alexander you cannot lose in upholding you cannot lose and have these people from

4194
03:25:26,143 --> 03:25:29,983
Such lofty Heights removed from the scene without there being this huge vacuum

4195
03:25:32,031 --> 03:25:33,055
A couple hundred years

4196
03:25:34,079 --> 03:25:35,359
After this time.

4197
03:25:36,639 --> 03:25:38,431
One of the people who will fill a vac

4198
03:25:39,455 --> 03:25:40,479
Play a similar role

4199
03:25:41,247 --> 03:25:42,783
And maybe eclipse this

4200
03:25:43,039 --> 03:25:43,551
Person

4201
03:25:44,831 --> 03:25:45,855
Visit his tomb

4202
03:25:46,623 --> 03:25:47,647
Alexander the Great

4203
03:25:48,671 --> 03:25:50,719
Along with some influential colleagues

4204
03:25:51,743 --> 03:25:53,023
We'll go to the spa

4205
03:25:53,279 --> 03:25:55,071
Not in the building that is assumed

4206
03:25:55,327 --> 03:25:56,351
To be the tomb of Cyrus

4207
03:25:58,911 --> 03:26:00,703
That tomb is still standing

4208
03:26:01,215 --> 03:26:02,751
The way in Modern Day Iran

4209
03:26:04,543 --> 03:26:05,055
Interesting to think

4210
03:26:07,103 --> 03:26:07,615
Climbing up the

4211
03:26:08,895 --> 03:26:15,039
In a fully colorized historical era now by the way bringing with him people who will write about it afterwards we actually have

4212
03:26:15,551 --> 03:26:20,159
Through another guy the writings of someone who's with Alexander and kind of describes what the tune look like

4213
03:26:21,951 --> 03:26:26,303
Lot of clothing lot of souvenirs lot of things that just sort of helped the guy into the Afterlife sort of deal

4214
03:26:27,071 --> 03:26:27,839
And then a body

4215
03:26:29,375 --> 03:26:30,143
It was preserved in

4216
03:26:30,399 --> 03:26:30,911
Wax

4217
03:26:31,935 --> 03:26:33,983
This was this was kind of a Persian custom to

4218
03:26:36,031 --> 03:26:37,567
This might just be me but I had to

4219
03:26:37,823 --> 03:26:38,335
Is feeling better

4220
03:26:38,847 --> 03:26:41,663
Queen of the message either the message Atty

4221
03:26:41,919 --> 03:26:43,711
I have taken his head or something

4222
03:26:43,967 --> 03:26:44,479
That's a

4223
03:26:45,247 --> 03:26:46,783
Mutilation that they would have

4224
03:26:47,039 --> 03:26:47,807
Probably told us a

4225
03:26:48,319 --> 03:26:51,391
It's probable that the body look pretty darn good cuz no one talked about it

4226
03:26:51,647 --> 03:26:52,159
Working any other way

4227
03:26:53,951 --> 03:26:54,975
We told that there was a man

4228
03:26:57,023 --> 03:26:59,583
On the tune out some historians think it must have been

4229
03:26:59,839 --> 03:27:01,887
In front of the team cuz it's missing but they were a couple of different

4230
03:27:02,655 --> 03:27:03,167
Descriptions

4231
03:27:03,679 --> 03:27:04,703
Some people who supposedly saw

4232
03:27:05,727 --> 03:27:07,007
Summer more flowery than other

4233
03:27:07,775 --> 03:27:09,055
One that I like this

4234
03:27:11,359 --> 03:27:11,871
Says

4235
03:27:12,639 --> 03:27:13,151
Quote

4236
03:27:13,663 --> 03:27:14,175
Mortal

4237
03:27:14,687 --> 03:27:16,735
I am Cyrus son of cambyses

4238
03:27:16,991 --> 03:27:20,319
Who founded the Persian Empire and was king of Asia

4239
03:27:20,831 --> 03:27:22,367
Grudge me not then my money

4240
03:27:26,207 --> 03:27:27,231
But there are other

4241
03:27:27,487 --> 03:27:27,999
Tradition

4242
03:27:28,767 --> 03:27:31,071
Also from eyewitness accounts of region

4243
03:27:32,863 --> 03:27:33,631
The record of very

4244
03:27:34,399 --> 03:27:34,911
Sodapoppin

4245
03:27:36,703 --> 03:27:37,727
Some of the historians I like

4246
03:27:38,239 --> 03:27:38,751
Much more

4247
03:27:39,007 --> 03:27:41,055
Traditional Iranian to it's much more pissed

4248
03:27:41,567 --> 03:27:42,079
Right to the point

4249
03:27:43,103 --> 03:27:45,151
The Persians when they were leading the Empire could

4250
03:27:45,407 --> 03:27:49,247
Put on the airs as well as any Mesopotamian Dynasty ever did they could

4251
03:27:49,503 --> 03:27:51,807
He Ballin all the traditional titles

4252
03:27:53,087 --> 03:27:55,135
Queen Victoria as the Empress of India

4253
03:27:55,647 --> 03:27:57,951
The kings of this area had King of the universe

4254
03:27:58,719 --> 03:28:01,535
King of the four corners of the earth king of lands

4255
03:28:01,791 --> 03:28:02,559
The Persians could do that

4256
03:28:04,095 --> 03:28:05,631
Sometimes when they were just recording

4257
03:28:06,655 --> 03:28:07,423
For eternity

4258
03:28:08,447 --> 03:28:09,727
Which is what a tomb inscription like

4259
03:28:09,983 --> 03:28:10,495
This is

4260
03:28:12,543 --> 03:28:13,311
They adopted if

4261
03:28:13,567 --> 03:28:14,079
Different style

4262
03:28:15,871 --> 03:28:16,895
The tomb inscription

4263
03:28:17,151 --> 03:28:18,175
Supposedly from an eyewitness

4264
03:28:18,431 --> 03:28:20,223
That's what I like the most likely to use services

4265
03:28:20,479 --> 03:28:21,759
Pershing Pre-K

4266
03:28:22,015 --> 03:28:22,527
Forum

4267
03:28:22,783 --> 03:28:23,551
The name Cora

4268
03:28:25,855 --> 03:28:26,367
It says

4269
03:28:27,903 --> 03:28:28,415
Here I lie

4270
03:28:29,951 --> 03:28:30,463
CoolROM

4271
03:28:40,703 --> 03:28:42,239
The Persians grew up

4272
03:28:42,495 --> 03:28:44,287
Can you quit Melinda potop neighbor

4273
03:28:46,591 --> 03:28:48,639
The show you just heard involved a lot of

4274
03:28:49,151 --> 03:28:49,919
Student worried

4275
03:28:50,175 --> 03:28:50,943
Discuss the background

4276
03:28:51,199 --> 03:28:51,711
Where they

4277
03:28:51,967 --> 03:28:52,991
Sprung from

4278
03:28:53,503 --> 03:28:57,599
Because this does a bunch of things one it makes their achievements all the more sound

4279
03:28:59,135 --> 03:29:01,439
I mean they arose in this world with all these

4280
03:29:02,207 --> 03:29:04,767
Amazing competitors and managed to

4281
03:29:05,279 --> 03:29:05,791
Neclimbs

4282
03:29:06,047 --> 03:29:06,815
Top of the Heap anyway

4283
03:29:08,095 --> 03:29:10,399
It also helps us set of Baseline for

4284
03:29:10,911 --> 03:29:13,215
Harrison when we say things like the Persians are

4285
03:29:13,727 --> 03:29:15,263
Tolerant or lenient

4286
03:29:16,031 --> 03:29:18,079
You want to immediately say compared to what

4287
03:29:19,615 --> 03:29:21,407
You just heard gives us some idea

4288
03:29:22,175 --> 03:29:23,711
What they might be compared to

4289
03:29:26,527 --> 03:29:32,671
Finally it's a fantastic story the story that usually relegated to dead are between two other stories right

4290
03:29:32,927 --> 03:29:35,999
Somewhere between the fall of Assyria and the rise of Persia

4291
03:29:36,511 --> 03:29:37,279
Is the

4292
03:29:37,535 --> 03:29:39,327
Your latter part of the 600

4293
03:29:40,095 --> 03:29:45,215
And the high 580-590-5585 what's going on during that era

4294
03:29:45,471 --> 03:29:47,775
Normally it sort of just a transition point

4295
03:29:48,031 --> 03:29:48,543
Between

4296
03:29:48,799 --> 03:29:50,079
The two chapters in a book

4297
03:29:50,591 --> 03:29:51,359
Where is all by itself

4298
03:29:51,615 --> 03:29:52,639
Twisted in fastener

4299
03:29:53,663 --> 03:29:56,991
I love the idea of the great power like the US and the Soviet Union

4300
03:29:57,503 --> 03:30:00,319
Collapsing in the rest of the world sort of looking at each other over the

4301
03:30:00,831 --> 03:30:02,623
In a smoking ruin trying to figure out

4302
03:30:03,135 --> 03:30:05,183
Who gets what and what do things look like that

4303
03:30:05,439 --> 03:30:05,951
I love that

4304
03:30:07,999 --> 03:30:10,047
The key to this whole story this point is

4305
03:30:10,559 --> 03:30:14,399
You know what it took such a singular figure to put this improbable

4306
03:30:15,167 --> 03:30:16,191
Event together

4307
03:30:16,447 --> 03:30:18,751
What happens when that figure exits the scene

4308
03:30:19,263 --> 03:30:23,871
What are the odds of getting to Cyrus the Great in the same family one right after another

4309
03:30:25,919 --> 03:30:30,527
Remember this is the largest Empire in world history the distance from one part to another is Dante

4310
03:30:31,551 --> 03:30:37,695
You have all these different people people that are very independent-minded and fractious and who gave the aesir

4311
03:30:37,951 --> 03:30:38,463
Syrians

4312
03:30:39,487 --> 03:30:40,255
All the time

4313
03:30:41,535 --> 03:30:44,607
So many different religion so many different languages how is

4314
03:30:44,863 --> 03:30:45,887
In one

4315
03:30:46,143 --> 03:30:52,287
Small minority of people going to rule this giant entity especially without the specially gifted guy who bill

4316
03:30:52,543 --> 03:30:53,055
Built the whole thing

4317
03:30:54,079 --> 03:30:55,871
In the next episode will examine how

4318
03:30:56,895 --> 03:30:57,663
Can buy

4319
03:30:58,431 --> 03:30:59,967
Son of Cyrus manages all

4320
03:31:01,759 --> 03:31:05,855
And it will be Coos and they will potentially be armies disappearing and sandstorms

4321
03:31:06,111 --> 03:31:10,463
There will be far too many Greeks probably for what the story really warrants

4322
03:31:11,231 --> 03:31:15,583
But you have to understand while we all know instinctively there important things going on

4323
03:31:15,839 --> 03:31:19,679
In the east in the North in the other parts of the Persian Empire that don't touch Greek lands

4324
03:31:20,191 --> 03:31:22,495
The only people writing about it in any sort of extended

4325
03:31:22,751 --> 03:31:23,775
Colorful way

4326
03:31:24,287 --> 03:31:26,079
Are the Greek so just like everyone else will

4327
03:31:26,591 --> 03:31:30,943
Talk about the Greek and Persian Wars will get some context of that Battle of Thermopylae

4328
03:31:31,199 --> 03:31:34,527
Movie scene with a Spartan say come and take them

4329
03:31:37,087 --> 03:31:38,111
And then we'll deal

4330
03:31:38,879 --> 03:31:39,647
The guy

4331
03:31:40,415 --> 03:31:44,255
The next guy really in the story whose personal talents are such that

4332
03:31:44,767 --> 03:31:47,071
He's a game-changer all by himself

4333
03:31:48,095 --> 03:31:50,655
The natural successor to Cyrus the Great and

4334
03:31:50,911 --> 03:31:51,935
The person who finally put

4335
03:31:52,447 --> 03:31:53,983
Stake in the heart

4336
03:31:54,751 --> 03:31:56,031
The black and white world

4337
03:31:58,847 --> 03:32:00,127
The son of Philip of Macedon

4338
03:32:01,407 --> 03:32:01,919
All that

4339
03:32:02,943 --> 03:32:03,455
Amor

4340
03:32:04,735 --> 03:32:05,503
The next episode

4341
03:32:06,783 --> 03:32:07,295
Kings of Kings

4342
03:32:12,671 --> 03:32:14,719
If you think the show you this hurt is worth a dollar
