What you're about to hear is part 6 of a six part series on the second world war in the Asia Pacific theater.

If you have not heard the earlier the segments, please go check those out.

00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:37,740
You probably want to hear this in order, but there's a few of you out there who don't care about that sort of stuff, in which case well catch up in join us, won't you, for part 6 of the light and the airy story that is supernova in the east December 17th history.

00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:46,490
A date which will live in infamy, it's hardcore.

00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,300
History.

00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,450
People who are knowledgeable.

9
00:00:52,450 --> 00:01:00,180
About the second world war and many people are it's one of those subjects that fascinates human beings the world over, understandably sew.

10
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,270
[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

11
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:09,850
People who are a fishing noodles of the second world war knows that the rhythm of the second world war reminds you of an opera.

12
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:18,710
Or a musical theater production where the end is going to be like the end of the world, a Ragnarok, the regatta damn around in the whole last year of the war is whipping.

13
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:23,290
Yourself up like a roller coaster going up hill, waiting for that giant dip where you're.

14
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:38,240
Building up to that horrific the last year, the second world war is the worst year of the second world war and the kind of numbers that demonstrate that are, for example, casualties, killings, look at the German deaths, for example, in January.

15
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,180

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,100

00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:41,420
The.

19
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,950
Germans will have more than 400000 of their soldiers.

20
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,170
Maybe close at a 450000 of their soldiers die.

21
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,980
In that month alone, for comparison purposes.

22
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,320
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

23
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,600
That is, more military deaths than the United States suffered.

24
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:14,530
All branches of service all cause of mortality for the whole war, historian Neil Ferguson says the German military loses more soldiers in the last year of the war than the entire rest of the war put together, and some of the latest estimates of casualty numbers suggest the Germans were losing on average.

25
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:29,680
10000 soldiers every day in 1945, so from January 1st to May 8th, when the war ended in Europe 10000 a day on average, that is almost twice as many people as the United States lost at the battle of Antietam.

26
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,700
Which many military historians consider to be the worst day in US military history, and the Germans were getting a day after day after.

[ SPACE 4.0 secs ]

28
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,210
If you think to yourself and if this would be totally understandable, who cares.

29
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,770
Right, the Germans are reaping what they sowed.

30
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,430
Oh, that would be fine, except it's hardly just the Germans.

In his book.

How wars and Arthur Gideon rose says that every month in 1945.

34
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:00,710
Between 100000 and 250 on combatants.

35
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,940
In Asia were dying.

[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

37
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,220
Again, every month.

38
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,480
Due to the actions of Japanese forces.

[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

40
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:12,760
These are data points, but you have to add all the other data points up to and see the conveyor belt of death.

41
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,840
The factory assembly line.

42
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,850
Of human destruction that's going on in 1945 or really the last year of the war.

43
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,340
I mean, you don't have to.

44
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,810
Really imagine too much to just know that the holocaust is going on during this time period in Europe.

45
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,550
And people are dying in those camps every day.

46
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:33,220
So every day the war continues, that tally goes up reliably.

47
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,460
[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

48
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:38,490
I'm reminded of a song by the rock band the M C 5 from the late 1960 s.

49
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,940
Early nineteen seventies, they wrote a song which I think is about the Vietnam War.

00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:47,300

And to me.

54
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,890
The imagery as horrific as it is.

55
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,160
Works better for the second world war and especially the.

56
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,800
End of the second world war than it does for Vietnam.

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:15,494
A lawn mower that cuts human beings of blades of grass or an assembly line that's reliably heading towards a furnace or a chopping machine with people on it, and when the lead singer would say the words, the human being lawnmower, he would emphasize what was going on by then saying.

00:04:15,494 --> 00:04:17,309
Chop, chop, chop chop chop human being.

00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,690
That's what's going on in the last year of the war.

63
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:37,710
So why is the last year of the war still going on, Neil Ferguson in his book the war of the world, quotes an aide to US general Omar Bradley, who is fighting the third rike in Europe, and the aid made this statement, Ferguson says at the end of 1944.

64
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,440
And the statement was quote, if we were fighting.

65
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,010
Reasonable people.

66
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:48,640
They would have surrendered long ago, but they're not fighting reasonable people.

67
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,510
Clearly, they're fighting.

68
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,300
A fanatical regime in the third rank, which is committed.

And in the Japanese situation, their military is planning for a last ditch stand.

On the home islands, if it comes to that.

The army thinks they can put two and a half million Japanese soldiers into Japan's built up cities.

And then add to those numbers with a.

What's the goal.

What's the end game while both the Germans and the Japanese are hoping to inflict a last.

93
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,270
Big blow against their enemies.

94
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,270

[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

96
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:17,070
Because as you know, even a cursory understanding of the second world war makes.

97
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,330
Clear the peace terms are unconditional.

98
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,930
Surrender and the.

99
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,580
Reason we know that is, the allies made.

100
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,550
And attempt.

101
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,380
To broadcast this.

102
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,530
Make it known to everybody the terms are you give up.

00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,910
And then we decide what we're going to do to you.

105

Now this.

106
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,550
Is controversial after all.

107
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,760
If the terms of surrender are going to be that harsh.

108

You know, more day, I mean, it's controversial, but there's an attitude if you.

115
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:04,280
Look at the sources that you need an unconditional surrender.

If you're going to finally end this recurring problem.

117
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,540

123
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:37,950
Fight in wars that destabilize the international system, Franklin Roosevelt thought it was Prussian or yonker militarism that was at fault, and that countries needed to have this tendency.

124

Rooted out of them and to do that.

125
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,580
A free hand would be necessary.

00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,860
You couldn't have some sort of deal like.

The deal that ended the first war of war United the.

Ability to remake these societies.

129
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,400
To finally end the repeat offender status of some of these places, right, who would upset.

130
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:03,630
The piece of the world, so for many people, it was this view's that the entire sacrifice of all three of those wars.

131
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,500
But especially the second world war would be in vain.

132
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,280
If it didn't end the right way, there's a quote from.

133
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,670
Assistant US secretary of state Breckenridge.

134
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,720
[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

135
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:25,830
That's used in Gideon rose as a book where he says quote, we are fighting this war because we did not have an unconditional surrender at the end of the last one, and it's controversial, though.

136
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:31,200
And people like Winston Churchill sometimes seem to vary.

137
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:44,110
In his views that you find on whether or not he was for it or open to some sort of conditional piece in his book series the second world war, which cannot be taken as gospel truth, you know.

138
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:49,190
You take it with a grand assault because he's he's bolstering his own post war image.

139
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,700
But he knows that unconditional surrenders controversial.

140
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,400
So he tries to defend it, and he says that they.

141
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,100
Tried to sit down and come up with conditional terms, right.

142
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,110
If if it was not gonna be unconditional.

143
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,350
Should the surrender terms be.

144
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:13,760
And he wrote quote they looked so terrible when set forth on paper, and so far exceeded what was in fact done that their publication would only have stimulated German resistance.

145
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,660
They had in fact only to be written.

146
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:25,100
Out to be withdrawn and quote, we should also recall that there were political reasons in the allied alliance for doing this to.

147
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,810
The soviets were very suspicious that the western allies would cut a separate deal with Germany.

[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

149
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,720
And sort of leave them in the lurch.

150
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:40,830
A an announced public pledge for an unconditional surrender helped bind all the allies together United cause right?

151
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,640
No one's going to make a separate piece.

[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

153
00:09:43,340 --> 00:10:00,130
But it meant the war would go on longer, and both Japan and Germany were hoping for some sort of last ditch punch in the nose that would wake the allies up to the fact that you know this worker continue for years if you didn't come up with a better peace deal.

154
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,250
I mean, that's really.

155
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,410
What's something like the battle of the bulls, the second.

156
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:12,360
Battle of the ardan in that could be the only reason to do that because there was no war winning element, the whole point was to do.

157
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:19,620
Such damage and maybe have a whole bunch of allied troops sort of surrounded and endangered, so you could maybe bargain with them.

158
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,600
And in Japan.

159
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:30,090
They were continually looking for the last great battle that would help wake the allies up to the idea that unconditional surrender was a bridge too far.

00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,820
When last we spoke, we were talking about.

162
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,250
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

163
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,410
The battle of Saipan in July well.

164
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:44,420
The navy, the Japanese Navy, had thought that the war had been decided some of the naval experts after the battle of Guangzhou.

165
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,670
[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

166
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:50,870
And most of the rest, at least after the battle of midway in the Japanese war.

167
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:58,110
Journal of imperial headquarters, quoted in Richard bee frank's book downfall, they.

168
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,110
Were very open, and this is official.

169
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,670
That the war was over in terms of who was going to win.

170
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,230
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

171
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:08,790
And it said, quote, we can no longer direct the war with any hope of success.

172
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:17,500
The only course left is for Japan's 100 million people to sacrifice their lives by charging the enemy to make them lose the will to fight.

173
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,900
And a quote that is an amazing statement.

174
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:35,600
We will sacrifice all the people in this country to get a better deal than unconditional surrender, and what was it that the Japanese really were holding out for the emperor.

175
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,560
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

176
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:36,810
They.

177
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,280
Were worried that an unconditional surrender might.

178
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,690
Mean that the emperor and the entire imperial system.

179
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:46,690
Would be tossed out, and this was something they could not live with.

180
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,200
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

181
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:57,510
What's more, the idea that the emperor might be treated as a war criminal and might be hung or something after the war was intolerable to a ton of Japanese people.

182
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,830
Including a ton of civilians.

183
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,150
I mean, remember that.

184
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,600
A decent number of Japanese folk who consider this person.

185
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,640
To live in god.

186
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,120
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

187
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,810
His voice has never even been heard by the public.

188
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:11,580
I mean, there's a whole lot of stuff that makes this an almost superhuman figure in the idea.

189
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:11,950
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

190
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,810
That the country might have to lose.

191
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,790
There really weren't 100 million people in Japan.

192
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,980
It's more like 70 or 75 million, but I mean.

193
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,990
You might have to sacrifice that to keep one guy on the throne.

194
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,310
[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]

195
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:29,310
Wow, that's well, if we were fighting reasonable people, it would have been over already of.

196
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:29,840
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

197
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,100
This is not reasonable.

198
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,610
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

199
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:36,260
I read a couple different takes on this that suggested it was a lot more than the emperor.

200
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:41,090
This is the imperial system, which includes a lot of what we would call the oligarchy or the old guard.

201
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:46,940
There's a lot of people who have a stake in the imperial system, and they would all be thrown to the wolves if this went away.

202
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,980
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

203
00:12:47,980 --> 00:13:05,150
But it would seem to be the kind of thing where you're going to keep the human being lawnmower operating at breakneck speed to keep a single guy from the gallows after the war may the problem Japan has is different than Germany.

204
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:12,460
Because one of the things we said at the end of the last segment was that the famous plot against Adolf Hitler on July 20th, operation valkyrie.

205
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,750
Where a bomb exploded in.

206
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,910
[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

207
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:24,380
Attempting to take Hitler out, well, that's an attempt to get rid of the fanatic in chief, right, I mean, as I said, if we were fighting reasonable people, the war would be over long ago, but in Germany, you got rid.

208
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,880
You have to get rid of the unreasonable person at the top to have a chance to do that.

209
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,710
Japan's government's very different.

210
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,540
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

211
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:37,020
It's hard to put your finger on who's in charge, and we we dealt with this extensively in the first segment of the program, pointing out.

212
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:43,910
That Japan's system was one that outsiders certainly, but even insiders sometimes could have a tough time figuring where.

213
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,430
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

214
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,750
Luck stops author e and w toll.

215
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,340
Had written um a line that just.

216
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,750
I think was a perfect summation of that, where he said quote.

217
00:13:54,750 --> 00:14:01,660
The same institutional defects that had produced Japan's irrational decision to launch the war in 1941.

218
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:07,420
Now prevented a rational decision to end it and s.

219
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,920
C m pain in his book the wars for Asia 1911, 1945.

220
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:19,830
Had said that Japan's government had been called a government by acquiescence or a system of irresponsibility.

221
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,050
And he said quote because.

222
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:28,310
If everyone is responsible for policy, that policy formation becomes anonymous so that no one is actually held accountable.

223
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:28,660
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

224
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:34,720
The primary value emphasized in decision making was a consensus reached through informal procedures.

225
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,920
And quote a consensus that required the most die hard, fanatical elements of.

226
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,220
The military to be on board and at least the army.

227
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,260
[ SPACE 2.0 secs ]

228
00:14:45,260 --> 00:15:01,930
And this about the way is why everybody spends so much time talking about the 19th century development of the Japanese constitutional system design and everything to get us to the second world war because the second world wars were a couple of years, major things happen when you just go.

229
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:02,280
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

230
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:16,280
Um, it's almost like a tragic flaw in Greek theater where there it was built into the Japanese system a long time ago, and it only comes out when the systems under massive stress like you know, a world war, but the fact that the army and navy.

231
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:21,690
For example, have an outsize amount of control, and influence tends to bend the decision making.

232
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,770
In a more hard line sort of way.

233
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,190
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

234
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:30,260
And people who want to talk about peace actually put their own lives in danger to do so.

235
00:15:30,260 --> 00:16:02,160
So in both Germany and Japan, as the war starts to grind in to the last year, anybody who tries to bring up the idea of peace or who suggests that the war may be lost are enemies of the regime in Germany and last year, the war between 10 and 20000 people I read were hung or executed in some other way soldiers and civilians alike on charges of what was called defeatism in Japan, Marius B.

236
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,060
Jensen, the historian.

237
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:15,770
Says that the military was watching the people and had jailed some people for high level defeatism as it was called, and Subaru i anaga in his book the Pacific war.

238
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:19,520
Talked about how careful those were his translated words.

239
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:19,880
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

240
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,380
Peace advocates and the government had to be.

241
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:22,700
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

242
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:29,440
He says that they faced assassination or a coup when he blames the army, but that's who he blames for a lot of things.

243
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:29,840
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

244
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,400
The point being that even bringing up.

245
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,070
What might be a rational question?

246
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:46,210
Like do we have to have armageddon, is that the way this thing has to go could get you charged as an enemy of the state and in a place like Germany could get you hung, so rationality isn't just in short supply.

247
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,130
It's actively punished by deaf.

248
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,010
[ SPACE 1.9 secs ]

249
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:56,640
I keep thinking of both the average Japanese person who may or may not have wanted to die for the emperor.

250
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,360
[ SPACE 1.7 secs ]

251
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,670
Are they looking forward to actually taking up arms with their their.

252
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:08,810
Their women and children and fighting alongside the Japanese army in the built up areas of Japan and house to house.

253
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:20,540
Hand to hand combat against the allied forces and something tells me they're gonna be a lot of regular Japanese folks who would see that as a failure of and once again.

254
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,680
There are gonna be people who say.

255
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,030
Well, then they shouldn't have started the war.

256
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,300
They shouldn't have mistreated all of the populations they dealt with.

257
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:26,530
So.

258
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:29,320
Much, which is a fair point, but let's remember that.

259
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,410
If the Japanese are going to die.

260
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:35,170
Because they're going to have to be rooted out of all these buildings, somebody's going to have to.

261
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:51,040
Do the rooting out, and this is what my stepfather was referring to ones when he he talked to me about how it was a kind of a double edge sword reading in the newspapers about how well the war was going because my stepdad's.

262
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,080
A guy who got into the second world war at the real tail end of it.

263
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,610
So had there been a 1946 continuation of the war, that's when he would have been in the thick of it.

264
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,130
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

265
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:04,700
So like a lot of people, by the end of the war, he was kind of trying to time it out in his head, right?

266
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,720
Is this thing going to be over before i'm on the front line areas?

267
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,240
He was a naval guy, but the front line areas was right off the coast of Japan.

268
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:17,690
If there was 1946 fighting and he said every time there'd be another victory.

269
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:18,420
In another island.

270
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:25,860
Taking another closer hop to Japan, you know, and more of the shrinking of the blast radius of Japan supernova, he said, that's the.

271
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:31,350
Same as saying we're one step closer to the final battles for Japan's home islands.

272
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:31,670
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

273
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,530
The ragnarok right.

274
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,530
And he's thinking to himself, you know, everybody already.

275
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,480
Knows how.

276
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,880
Die hard the Japanese were on all these islands.

277
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,320
We've already had to take from them that they don't care about as much as the home islands.

278
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,850
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

279
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,010
And we still have to go to.

280
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,580
I mean, nobody was looking.

281
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,700
Forward to this.

282
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,560
[ SPACE 1.9 secs ]

283
00:18:52,560 --> 00:19:06,970
I just keep thinking about how unnerving the previews to it all would be if I were a nearly fighting age young man in the United States in, say, April early.

284
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:18,550
May 1945 and i'm reading about the battle of Berlin, right, the last assault, the red army launches on Hitler's capital city with Hitler in it.

285
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,890
The last big battle, right, that's going to end.

286
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:26,230
Right here, Ragnarok in Berlin, if i'm reading about that, something that turns.

287
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:33,100
Into arguably the worst urban combat in human history, the red army loses more than 80000 men in 16th.

288
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,110
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

289
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,960
The Germans lose more, more than 20000 civilians.

290
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:47,580
Hitler kills himself in the bunker with the Soviet troops yards away, the only way it could have been more or less ditches if a Soviet soldier had broken down the bunker doors and stabbed Hitler with a ban.

291
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,230
[ SPACE 1.7 secs ]

292
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:55,920
And Hitler is not perceived as any more fanatical than Japanese leadership, and may be your average Japanese.

293
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:01,690
Loyal soldier and maybe even his wife and child, who knows.

294
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:02,140
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

295
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,370
But to somebody like yours truly reading the paper this.

296
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:32,790
Would have looked like a horrible preview of what the Tokyo situation is going to look like in a few months when we get to that, and yet the alternative to ragnarok is to let the human being lawnmower continue to rack up obscene monthly death totals until it's there are no good choices are there, and choices are where people like yours truly.

297
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,620
I know many of you, too.

298
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,460
We we just we can't help but look at the choices and become fascinated.

299
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,760
With, I mean.

300
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,600
It's it's tempting always for a person.

301
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,310
Who's into war games and chess and all that stuff to think about it.

302
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:51,550
This is in terms of a game like a geostrategic card game and the danger with that is all the decisions look so much easier.

303
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,300
When you're looking at them now, you have no idea all the little.

304
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:54,700
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

305
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,640

[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]

307
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,690
Inhibitors and pressures and everything else that was.

308
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:10,070
Working on the historical figure, I always have this image of them coming back in a time machine and hearing someone like yours truly say, well, here's what you should have done, and.

309
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,900
And having them say, oh, yeah, sure.

310
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,350
You don't think I would have done that if I could.

311
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:17,200
But I couldn't have because of all these things that are not even in your history books that were acting on me.

313
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,270
So with that.

314
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,350
Having been said.

315
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:22,930
It's still hard for me to not look at this sometimes like a card game.

316
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,730
And in 1944, what's fascinating of that year.

317

[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

318
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:31,150
Is that the Germans and the Japanese only have a few meaningful cards left to play.

00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,360
[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

320

Stockpiled.

323
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,030
Strength.

324
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,480
Little bit of rocket fuel, if you will, that they've kept.

325
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,300
Aside.

326
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,120
For just this time, so what do you do with it.

327
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,150
What do you use it for?

328
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,770
What is it worthy goal.

329
00:21:47,770 --> 00:22:01,590
To use some of your last remaining strength for if winning the war probably isn't on the table, I never like to say it's never on the table because war is full of weirdness to the degree you just ever you can't ever say ever.

330
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,100
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

331
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,760
Somebody's always pulling victory out of the jaws of defeat, but basically.

332
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,480
There are no war winning cards left to play, at least no obvious war winning cards left to play.

333
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,470
So how do you play what cards you still have left.

334
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,690
That's fascinating to me.

335
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,710
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

336
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:20,010
The Germans offensive in late 1944, the one in the second.

337
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,810
Ardent as it's called, we Americans call it the battle of the bulge.

338
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:25,510
That's an example of Hitler playing one of those last cars.

339
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,090
I've got the stockpile of stuff.

340
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,150
Let's use it here.

341
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,560
What was he trying to do?

342
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:34,000
Historians and armchair generals ever since have been critiquing that decision.

343
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,880
There were a lot of people, even at the time that maybe would have liked to have seen all of that stock.

344
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,480
Piled strength used.

345
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,870
Against the red army instead, to maybe forestall what happened in Berlin.

346
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,320
Long enough to let the allies get.

[ SPACE 2.0 secs ]

348
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:58,150
The western allies would be a better way to put it right because the Soviet unions and allies as well, but regardless, you know, hindsight's 20 right the Japanese cards.

349
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,850
That they have to play.

350
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:00,610
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

351
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:04,620
They're playing early on in 1944.

352
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:09,340
I mean, they launch an offensive in the Burma India theater.

353
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:14,210
In March 1944, and then a month later, they launched the largest offensive.

354
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:19,860
The war on their part, and I think I read the largest offensive in imperial Japanese army history.

355
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,050
With the itchy go campaign in China.

356
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:22,760
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

357
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:31,992
We mentioned both these campaigns actually uh briefly in the last segment, but the itchy go campaign is the kind where you look at and you don't even know how the Japanese do it.

358
00:23:31,992 --> 00:23:33,838
We mentioned a long time ago that, that.

359
00:23:33,838 --> 00:23:38,140
To me, the Japanese look like one of the peoples on the planet that punch above their weight.

360
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,630
[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]

361
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:53,300
Because they are able to pull off stuff where you would look at their population numbers and their geographical questions and their history and think that they're they're they're not gonna be able to do that, and then they achieve it anyway.

362
00:23:53,300 --> 00:24:16,010
And I sometimes wonder, looking at their history if maybe they we've talked about the limitation of their somewhat dysfunctional subpar, usually in terms of outcome government design, we've talked about the problems that they have with the organization of the military and how you have this issue with mid level officers able to exert an undue.

363
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:23,520
Amount of control and influence over military policy, these are all things that put the Japanese into very tough situations and time and again.

364
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:23,870
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

365
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,690
Somehow, despite all of the impediments in the odds against them.

366
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:36,430
The Japanese people managed to pull the fat out of the fire more times than I read somewhere there for the itchy go offence of the Japanese stockpiled.

367
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:43,440
Ammunition for two years an aviation air-fuel for eight months and when they launch.

368
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:51,150
This multi stage offensive that will go from April uh 1944 to at least December 1944.

369
00:24:51,150 --> 00:25:03,410
I believe there's still significant fighting going on in January 1945, the half a million Japanese troops, more than 15000 vehicles, more than 100 animals launched.

370
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,820
This assault on China that is ferocious.

371
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,480
And you know.

372
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,640
We should point out that nowhere in the Pacific was anybody facing armies like 500000 Japanese soldiers.

373
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,180
These are land war.

374
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:21,480
Asia sized armies, okay, I mean, the the big battles in the Pacific later on are going to be fractions of.

00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,340
[ SPACE 1.9 secs ]

376
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,450
The only exception I can think of is the Philippines campaign.

377
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,160
Which is still to come, but even then.

378
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,580
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

379
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,300
The Japanese are more on the defensive there, whereas in China on the itchy.

380
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,280
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

381
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,430
Offensive, it is a massive many.

382

Months long assault.

383
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:43,410
But when you're fighting Chinese armies, which are traditionally very large, and in this campaign.

384
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:43,720
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

385
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:49,110
The Japanese are often outnumbered in fighting multiple Chinese armies, which means lots of troops.

386
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,590
You better have lots of troops.

387
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,650
[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

388
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:56,620
The irony of the whole thing is that the Japanese will in large part.

[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

390
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,110
Succeed in many ways in this offensive.

391
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:10,710
If you were judging this offensive outside of the context of the war, you go wow, and they pulled off a lot of sets here, almost knocked the nationalists out of the war, did retake the American airbases they wanted.

392
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,080
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

393
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,070
Eliminated, did connect these territories.

394
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,800
They wanted to connect it, but there's so many historians.

395
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:20,270
I was reading pointed out, so you took this giant amount of remaining rocket.

396
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:25,320
Fuel you'd stored up and saved to use somehow, and you did it in a way that won't slow.

397
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:25,670
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

398
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:30,170
The allied advance across the Pacific islands and toward the Japanese homeland at.

[ SPACE 1.7 secs ]

400
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,200
Right.

401
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,570
Was that a wasted card, you actually achieved a lot of what you wanted to achieve.

402
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,590
It actually worked out pretty well, judging by.

403
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:51,360
You know, a non contextual sort of standard, but in a contextual sort of standard didn't do anything to slow down the losing of the needless to say, it keeps the human being lawn lower working overtime.

404
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,630
I mean, 750000 Chinese soldiers may have been killed.

405
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,960
[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]

406
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,010
I've seen like 100000 Japanese is as a death toll.

407
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:24,730
Sometimes the numbers are hard to trust and differ source to source, and the methodology is different, and I bet there may have been 200000 Chinese civilian deaths due to this offensive, and in the same way that there are critics of Hitler's decision to use some of his last precious rocket fuel against the western allies instead of against the soviets.

408
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:29,810
Saying that he was essentially a boon for communism and attract more of central Europe.

409
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:37,130
Behind the iron curtain, a similar charge is sometimes made against the Japanese for the ichigo campaign.

00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:41,070
For example, Japanese military historian hierarchy Keshi writing in.

412
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:46,710
The battle for China proclaims the itchy go campaign to have been a disaster for both the Japanese.

413
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:47,170
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

414
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:55,890
And the nationalist Chinese, he says the only winners were the communists because they sat back and watched their two worst enemies, the Japanese and.

415
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,470
The nationalist Chinese kill each other off.

416
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,230
[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]

417
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:07,220
The nationalist and the communist Chinese, of course, had been fighting a civil war when the Japanese invasion.

418
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:13,990
Of China, sort of temporarily put a damper on that, but it will spring into new life after the Japanese are defeated.

419
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,510
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

420
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:27,850
And because perhaps of the damage that was was done to the nationalist, the nationalist will lose that civil war and well, of course, we have a communist China today, so there are some historians who suggest that the Japanese helped give us a communist.

421
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:30,750
China today, it's interesting and fascinating to contemplate, isn't it?

422
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,290
[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]

423
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:40,590
Considering that in Japan was probably the most anti communist country in the world, there's some historical irony to do.

424
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:50,880
It isn't it to talk about not getting what you wished for, I happened to find much more intrigue in the Japanese offensive.

425
00:28:50,880 --> 00:29:04,960
In Burma, the one that kicks off a month before itchy go and was supposed to act sort of in tandem with to me, it's much more interesting because there's a wild card involved, and if you're where the Japanese are at this time in the war, wild.

426
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,190
Cards look good.

428
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:28,140
How about playing a joker card in a campaign right introduced a little chaos um where it might do some good for your war effort, and if you can't win the war, what can you do the Japanese offensive in central Burma is known as the yugo campaign from the Japanese view point in Anglo American histories.

429
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:32,420
It's often referred to as the invasion of India in 1944.

State the sort of goals.

434
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:49,850
That also don't really do a whole to keep Japan from losing the war doesn't even really do much to.

435
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:50,440
Slow it down.

436
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:56,900
I mean, you know, I love the encyclopedia of military history by our earnest deputy and Trevor deputy.

437
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,900
They described the Japanese goals this way.

438
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,510
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

439
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:04,220
By the way, kawabe and a moody Gucci are two Japanese generals.

440
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,000
Quote.

441
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:12,810
Kawabe had directed muda Gucci to prepare for an offensive across the mountains into with three of his divisions.

442
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:20,210
Which with attached units, totaled nearly 100000 veteran combat troops, the objective was twofold.

443
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:37,870
They right first to seize the infall CO heme of plane of Manipur, the logical assembly area and base for any allied invasion of central Burma from India to cut the railroad line into a sum which passed through Manipur and which carried almost all the supplies.

[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

447

So this doesn't sound a whole lot different than the itchy go campaign, does it.

448
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:52,220
The sort of uh sound military objectives that won't keep you from losing the war.

450

[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

452
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,530
A lot of my history books will call it a secondary objective.

453
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:09,070
Sometimes they'll have a whole paragraph outline the seizing of the rail heads and all these military things, and then add like a couple of words or or a single sentence at the end of the paragraph and say something to the effect of oh.

454
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,980
Yeah, and maybe prompt some sort of a rebellion in India.

Is the most interesting part of this plan to me.

And the most scary.

460
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,730
To a dedicated imperialist like Winston Churchill.

00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:46,010
Churchill doesn't talk at all about seizing this rail head of this, he lays out what a um, the head of the greatest colonial power in human history.

468
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:46,840
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

469
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,830
His worry is.

470
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:50,130
And he he puts it this way, he says, quote.

471
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:50,790
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

472
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:56,860
They, meaning the Japanese, proposed to invade eastern India and raise the flag.

473
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:03,730
Of rebellion against the British and the raise the flag of rebellion against the British.

474
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:07,530
What would that even mean, well, first.

475
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:12,450
We have to recall the global situation in 1944.

476
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:17,290
A ton of the world are colonial possessions during this time period.

477
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,010
I mean, go, look at a map.

478
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:23,250
And a lot of the the the places that aren't colonial possessions are are defacto.

479
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,240
Ones where they're sort of under the control.

480
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:25,870
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

481
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:28,960
Of of other people, I mean, but almost all of Africa.

482
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,200
Is colonized during this.

483
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,440
[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

484
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,430
Most of the places that the Japanese took over after the Pearl Harbor attacks.

485
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,920
They didn't take from the indigenous peoples.

486
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:45,090
They conquered those places from the colonial countries that had taken them over a long time ago.

487
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,690
I mean, the Japanese throughout the.

488
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:50,770
Dutch who were controlling places like java, Sumatra.

489
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:51,830
[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

490
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:55,390
They threw out the French who were in indochina, right Laos.

491
00:32:55,390 --> 00:33:00,170
Cambodia, Vietnam, to day they threw the British out of Burma and the.

492
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,870
Now the British were in India and.

493
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:03,460
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

494
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,800
What if the Japanese could have cloud seated a revolution there.

495
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,220
[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]

496
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:14,280
It's a weird thought isn't a cloud seeding a revolution, but if you look at the histories of the.

497
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:20,000
The late nineteen forties, after the second world war, the nineteen fifties, the nineteen sixties really into the nineteen seventies.

498
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,320
There are so many wars and struggles and political problems that one could broadly classify.

499
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,960
As the unraveling of colonialism.

500
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,590
In the Vietnam War is as the result of the unraveling of colonialism.

501
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:32,950
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

502
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,910
And so many of these places that will.

503
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:35,270
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

504
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:43,740
Fall into these categories in the decades after the second world war, have the seeds and the nucleus of those things in existence already.

505
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,010
[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]

506
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:45,310
I.

507
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:49,380
Remember a history professor pointing out that one of the the key amplifiers.

508
00:33:49,380 --> 00:34:06,310
And accelerators of this process was that the Japanese didn't just throw out these colonial powers when they took over these countries from them, they threw them out quickly, and at the same time, so instead of the Dutch having to leave the indies.

509
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:06,840
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

510
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,430
And then ten years later, the French.

511
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:12,540
Having to leave indochina and then ten years after that, the British having to leave India.

512
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:12,910
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

513
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:15,250
The Japanese threw them all out in a matter of months.

514
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:15,700
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

515
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,200
And kept them out of those territories for years.

516
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:19,560
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

517
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:29,920
And so when those countries evicted the Japanese and retook their colonial possessions, those colonial possessions had not had their colonial masters there for some time.

518
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,310
Tough to put those genies back in the bottle.

519
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:32,650
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

520
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:40,280
Especially when those areas weren't too happy with the colonial masters already, India is a perfect example of that.

521
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:46,740
By 1944, there are some seriously angry Indians, and they're angry at the British shoe.

522
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,020
[ SPACE 2.3 secs ]

523
00:34:49,020 --> 00:35:00,140
Recall our conversation earlier on when we had talked about how the Indians who already were were for years before this time, um advocating.

524
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:05,160
For independence from Britain, how they even found themselves in the second world war was a slap in the face.

525
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,300
The British viceroy just said, wherein.

526
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:12,930
Didn't ask Indian leadership were the top people in India at all in 1942.

527
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,670
When talks broke down on Indian Independence.

528
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,600
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

529
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,580
Muhammad is Gandhi called Mahatma Gandhi the great soul.

530
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,050
He.

531
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:20,710
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

532
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,840
Starts to quit India campaign, which is we're not going to cooperate with the war.

533
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,940
[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

534
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,700
For his troubles.

535
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,710
He gets thrown into jail along with most of the leadership of his political party.

536
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,320
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

537
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,000
There will be something like 100000 Indians thrown into prison during this time period.

538
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,620
There will be riots, rebellions, protest.

539
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:40,770
That some of these protest troops will open fire and hundreds if not.

540
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:43,810
Thousands, those numbers are debatable, will be killed.

541
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,100
[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]

542
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,860
There is a famine in.

543
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:53,600
Bengal in 1943, which we also mentioned, which will stretch into 1944, which um it's a very controversial issue.

544
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:59,860
It's often blamed on war related things, and a guy who gets the lion share of the blame on the people's Winston Churchill.

545
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,790
And he's called genocidal by some Indians today.

546
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,870
But millions will die in this.

547
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,310
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

548
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,180
It contributes to the mood.

549
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:07,610
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

550
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:08,840
Brigadier Peter Young.

551
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,520
Who wrote a book in the 1970 s called a dictionary of battles claims.

552
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,800
That it was taking 100000 British.

553
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,240
And Indian soldiers to keep the lid on unrest in India during this time period.

554
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,910
So this is even before the Japanese make their move.

555
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:25,140
[ SPACE 2.2 secs ]

556
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:32,150
Worth pointing out that India is not the kind of place no country is, but especially not India, that is of like mind about anything.

557
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:44,330
It is an enormous country and potentially the most diverse country i've ever seen top to bottom side to side, and it was even bigger in this period than it is now because its territories included the modern.

558
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:44,650
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

559
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:50,130
States of Pakistan and Bangladesh as well some of these.

560
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,480
People support the British are princely.

561
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,110
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

562
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,030
Groups, for example.

563
00:36:54,030 --> 00:37:00,150
That have an arrangement with the colonial powers, the muslims and the hindus have different opinions on thinking.

564
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:00,850
We'd mentioned earlier.

565
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:04,660
There's two and a half million Indian soldiers fighting for the allies.

566
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,080
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

567
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:09,180
But there's also Indian soldiers fighting with the Japanese against the allies.

568
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:17,420
It's a much smaller, but in this campaign, this invasion of India in 1944, they're going to play.

569
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,730
An important role.

570
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:19,430
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

571
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:21,070
If they're led by A A.

572
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,590
A charismatic Indian figure.

573
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,410
His name is Subhas yonder bose.

574
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:24,920
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

575
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:31,130
And you know if you wanted to make a really poor analogy, and I apologize for this, but but Gandhi and Martin Luther King.

576
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:37,620
Has some similarities because Martin, if the king modeled some of his tactics on gandhi's nonviolent approach.

577
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,060
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

578
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:44,430
Well, if if you want to equate those two, then Subhash Chandra bose is more like an unreformed version of Malcolm acts.

579
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:54,340
His attitude is much more of by any means necessary, and whereas Gandhi issues violence to get the British out of India, bows.

580
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:58,080
Embraces it, and he's leading a bunch of Indian troops.

581
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,770
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

582
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,170
I think the Indian Army.

583
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,770
Fighting with the Japanese is like 1617 people.

584
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:05,990
I think he's leading seven or 8 in this assault on India.

585
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:08,170
A lot of these Indians were P O W S.

586
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:08,550
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

587
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,710
And they were offered the chance, you know, when Singapore fell.

588
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,020
A lot of them fell into Japanese hands.

589
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:12,590
They were offered this.

590
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,550
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

591
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:17,380
Horrific POW conditions were joined this army.

592
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:17,970
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

593
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:20,110
And a lot of the month, surprisingly did, but.

594
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:23,830
Bose is involved in trying to tell the Japanese commander listen.

595
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:26,840
You've defeated the British military forces here.

596
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,860
And I will go into India with these.

597
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:34,620
Indians will carry Indian flags of independence and will raise India to rebel.

598
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,350
[ SPACE 1.7 secs ]

599
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:38,940
What would happen if that actually occurred?

600
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,230
[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]

601
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:44,890
I mean, I can't think of any card the Japanese could play at this point in the war.

602
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:45,300
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

603
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,810
That would create more if you're part of the Star Wars reference, but.

604
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:55,510
More of a disturbance in the allied force then prompting a rebellion in India.

605
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,820
Now, because India is not of one mind.

606
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,070
I don't think you'd ever see anything like India, just.

607
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:08,420
Lip to the axis powers, but you could easily see India descend into chaos because you'll see it after the second world war during the the.

608
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:08,760
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

609
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:15,330
Chaos involved in independence and and India is one of those countries that five minutes after it descends into chaos, you have.

610
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:18,280
A humanitarian catastrophe on your hands.

611
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,740
If it's taken 100000 British and Indian troops to keep Indian unrest under control.

612
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:26,710
Without any of that, what you're going to take if India goes sideways on the allies.

613
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,210
[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]

614
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:31,370
What's more, if you really want to start talking about uh.

615
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,950
Fascinating, what if or counterfactuals.

616
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:37,690
Why would this stop at India?

617
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:48,270
Those of you who remember the Arab Spring, not that long ago will recall how amazing it is to see how quickly an idea and a and a mood.

618
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:59,950
If you will can spread, we once described ideas like an intellectual contagion, and there were many people who said that the Arab Spring was only made possible because of modern day community.

619
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:00,360
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

620
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,100
But that's happened many times in the past.

621
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:10,550
Those of you who look at the famous year of eighteen forty eighth the so-called year of revolutions and how many revolutions sprung up in so many different countries at once.

622
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:10,880
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

623
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:18,060
I mean, what if the Japanese could cloud seed a revolution here on the part of a bunch of these colonially.

624
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:18,840
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

625
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,630
Oppressed, is that a good way to put it, subject peoples.

626
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,400
[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]

627
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,920
It's a joker card right to introduce a little chaos into the equation and see what happens.

628
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,420
And let's recall that the Japanese propaganda has been laying the groundwork.

629
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:40,190
For this for years, that's why we brought it up much earlier in this conversation.

630
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:46,710
But I think maybe in the very first segment where we talked about pan Asian ism, which is an intellectual doctrine with a with.

631
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:50,400
A long history and many countries have their own version of it, but the Japanese took a.

[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

633
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:55,480
That and injected it into their concept of an economic union.

634
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:08,660
The famous greater east Asia co prosperity sphere, they were consistently saying things like their troops were pushing for Asia for the asiatics we had quoted again in the first show.

635
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:14,260
I think uh that Japanese soldier who said that he was fired up by his teacher back in.

636
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:21,510
I think it was their version of high school who was talking about the white man and what he was doing in in Asia to asians.

637
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:25,330
And that same teacher talked about black folks in the United States.

638
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:28,060
Native Americans in the United States and this Japanese soldiers.

639
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,400
Said he was fired up to free all these people.

640

[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]

641
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:39,260
In 1943, the Japanese make a big show of giving independence to a bunch of these countries like Burma, for example.

642
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:43,030
Although they're not really giving it, it's a great propaganda tool.

643
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:46,380
And back in 1941 to to name just one example, the Japanese Foreign.

644
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:50,960
Minister said quote Japan is determined to shatter the white man's mastery.

645
00:41:50,960 --> 00:42:16,250
Over all the orient and quote, if you are a British man in London reading the London Times in the morning or a Frenchman in Paris doing the equivalent that sends a chill up your spine, but if you're a Vietnamese person in French, Hindu China or a Burmese person in Burma or an Indian person in India and and many of those people.

646
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:23,060
If you look at the rules, sometimes not all places were the same, but they're living under rules that make them seem like second class citizens.

647
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:27,930
Some of the rules i've seen remind one of the Jim Crow south or apartheid South Africa.

[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

653
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:50,880
And if the Japanese had only been able to walk the walk a little bit better and live up to their hype a little bit, who knows what they might have accomplished, but as we said over and over.

654
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,230
They didn't, and I don't know if that's because it the entire thing was nothing.

655
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,560
And this is what I learned growing up, by the way.

656
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:03,580
But nothing but a fig leaf for Japanese brutal imperialism the whole time, or whether it was a case.

Caring what the Japanese left hand was doing.

00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,160
Oftentimes, the military people seem a lot.

661
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,400
More dismissive of this idea of.

662
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,700
Asia for the asiatics and the Japanese is the tip of the spear.

663
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:27,980
For Asian independence than Japanese intellectuals, citizens or soldiers do, it's a cause worth dying for.

664
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,330

The good guy side and the bad guy side and a whole lot of wars think they're fighting for good reasons.

668
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:53,550
I'll never forget the nazi daggers in emblazoned with the phrase god is with us bottom line, though, is that even though something like that is a huge long shot, the Japanese might be trying to cloud.

669
00:43:53,550 --> 00:44:04,590
See the revolution here, and that's a fascinating concept when you're down to your last few cards, if India went side on the on the British, you would have a circumstance where.

Now is a guy who'd who'd rather swing for the fences at this point in the war.

676
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:28,790
If i'm the one playing the Japanese geostrategic card hand or.

677
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:31,900
Throw a hail Mary, pass or put all my chips.

678
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:38,060
On one last roll of the die or one spin of the roulette wheel, this idea appeals to me a lot more than the itchy go offensive.

679
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:48,020
The problem, of course, is the ways carried out the Japanese do something here that once again, I try to figure out an American equivalent.

[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

681
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,980
If an American army went into battle without.

682
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:57,560
Enough supplies and the plan was to take a chance on them starving to death.

683
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:04,830
I wonder how the American people would react to that, and the reason I bring it up is because the Japanese are going to do this multiple times in Burma.

[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

685
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:16,130
There's a diversionary attack that they launched before the yugo campaign in a place called ang icon and the Japanese planned on not providing enough supplies for their troops.

00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,550
I guess that's a good way to get a get away.

00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,880
From a supply problem, right, just don't supply enough, but.

689
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,450
But the country's difficult.

00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:43,660
Is to take what you need to live.

The bullet, you need to fight the food you need to eat, the medical supplies.

698
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:52,660
You need to take care of your wounded from the enemy after you defeat them.

699
00:45:52,660 --> 00:46:01,340
Which of course, leads the very interesting question, what happens if you don't or what happens if you don't defeat them in time.

700
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:04,130
To have what you need before the supplies run out.

Miracles apart, everyone is likely to lose his life in this operation.

It isn't simply a question of the enemy's bullets.

Real like dying from hunger, starvation amongst modern armies, but in fairness to the Japanese part of the problem here is the terrain is awful.

So you get these 7000 foot mountains with heavy jungle and the jungle is so heavy, the British commander makes a mistake in thinking that the Japanese won't be able to get large numbers of troops through it.

The Japanese did make an ambitious incursion into Indian territory, but by 1944 the allies were fully prepared for it in March 1944.

781
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:58,030
The Japanese pushed into the northeast and advanced along the infall dimmable road in an attempt to cut infall supply lines, and it captured the strategically pivotal CO hema, the 14th army, an eclectic collection of nearly half a million troops, including British infantry men, Canadian and American pilots.

782
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:04,560
The Assam rifles, the African rifles and troops from the Gold Coast had been trained.

783
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:18,510
Equipped and honed into a modern fighting force by now among the infantry morale was high and there was an effective organizational esprit accord and a powerful air support gave the allies a distinct advantage.

784
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:42,520
Nonetheless, the Japanese made a massive sending in 85000 men, far more than had been expected, and for a time it looked as if they might cut off and occupy northeast India at CO hema, but in stark contrast, in 1940, she writes, the Japanese quickly became overstretched as their supply lines were bogged down over hundreds of miles of difficult terrain.

785
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:49,150
Winding back into southeast Asia, basically, what happens.

786
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:58,150
Is the British are ready for this assault, but it just happens sooner than they thought it was going to happen in greater strength than they expected and more quickly than they had accounted for.

787
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:00,190
Which puts them at a disadvantage.

788
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:05,500
Initially, the Japanese are able to get around the flanks of of of a bunch of units they cut.

789
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,470
One major force off that has to fight its way out.

790
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:10,400
And then they basically surrounded.

791
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,790
There are two areas that thereafter infall and.

792
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:22,330
CO hema CO hema is a mountain village that's that's heavily jungled, about 80 miles north of infall, and the infall plane is is a large.

793
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:24,300
Relatively open area.

794
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,070
Um.

795
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:29,270
The Japanese will basically put both of them under siege, and several times tried to.

796
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:29,800
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

797
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,290
Assault them and overrun.

798
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:31,860
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

799
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:39,100
Part of the reason for the heroism here is that not only are they cut off, but the the British imperial forces are badly outnumbered.

800
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:43,280
I think there's 15 to 20000 Japanese attacking CO hema, for example.

801
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,440
And something like 1800 defenders at CO hema.

802
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,240
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

803
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,540
This is actually it's funny.

804
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:50,970
This is both a little known affair, especially.

805
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:54,960
Outside the British Empire in the Japanese homeland.

806
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:55,870
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

807
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:57,600
And yet it was voted in.

808
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,430
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

809
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:00,180
I believe, Britain's.

810
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:07,020
Greatest battle of the modern era beating out such famous encounters as napoleon's defeat at Waterloo.

811
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,900
And the British landings at Normandy on d i day.

812
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:10,220
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

813
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:14,990
And yet the victory was won by an army that's known as the forgotten army.

814
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:15,670
So does that tell you.

815
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:17,920
[ SPACE 2.2 secs ]

816
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:24,090
There's a couple of reasons that might explain this, starting with the terrain, I mean.

817
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:37,480
Jungle and mountain terrain has a way of frustrating large forces being used, and in an earlier discussion, when we were talking about Guadalcanal and places like that, we quoted from Eric burger, his book.

818
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:43,120
Touched with fire where he talks about how so much of the fighting devolves down to like squads.

819
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:49,150
And companies and patrols and things like that that are very different than what the large armies in, say.

820
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:58,370
North Africa or the western or eastern front in Europe or even in Italy, are dealing with in his book Japan's last bid for victory.

821
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:03,320
The invasion of India in 1944, Arthur Robert Lyman describes it this way.

822
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,390
[ SPACE 2.1 secs ]

823
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:13,700
When field Marshall Sir Archibald Wavell, the viceroy of India, visited headquarters 14th army in August 1944.

824
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:24,520
He was perplexed by the nature of the fight, describing it in a letter to London as taking place strangely in what he called penny packets, he was right.

825
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:37,090
The battle did not involve mast brigades and divisions fighting in carefully choreographed coherence on a perhaps traditional model if a normally chaotic battlefield could ever be described thus.

826
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:58,820
But was instead, limon writes a confused and disparate section and platoon, sometimes company level struggle fought at many different points of the compass in the jungle, matted hills and valleys encircling the infall plane and the swampy terrain around Bishan poor, none of the land battles were directly interconnected.

827
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:07,630
The struggles north and northeast, the south and southeast, being conducted largely independent by both attacker.

828
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:10,030
And defender and quote.

829
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:11,110
[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

830
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:14,720
Add to that the fact that battle is a very strange.

831
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,340
Term.

832
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:22,130
To use for twentieth century large scale conflict because it's so different than all the previous errors.

833
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:34,850
That came before it when a battle usually and one really horrible, the really terrible battles in human history up until the modern era are two or three days long.

834
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:35,650
Now we're not talking about.

835
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:38,020
Sieges which can go on for month or even.

836
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:38,950
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

837
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:44,980
But a battle is generally something on a small enough area where if you can get above the fray and the dust and the commotion.

838
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:49,100
And the chaos get up to a hill, maybe with a a little spy glass.

839
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,110
You can usually see the whole thing.

840
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:54,160
Not here, not in the twentieth century.

841
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,850
You're better off referring to these things to avoid confusion, and they.

842
00:56:57,850 --> 00:57:04,970
Often are referred to instead of battles as operations operations that.

843
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:14,920
Are the sum total of thousands of potentially fatal tasks, so when you read the accounts of a veteran in these modern operations.

844
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:20,520
Their entire war experience may be when they ran into a concealed gun.

845
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:29,780
In a hill a mile away from the road that they're on, that shuts down road traffic until they can figure out a way to out flank the gun and take it out, right?

846
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,230
That's one of those.

847
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:36,660
You know, thousands of little potentially fatal tasks that when you add them all together equals.

848
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:40,100
An operation like the EMF all CO hema campaign.

849
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:41,680
But it sure makes it less.

850
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:45,030
Dramatic in the big picture sense and much harder to follow.

851
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:45,540
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

852
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:53,430
But in the small unit sense, it is as dramatic and horrifying as any encounter you'll find in the war may be worse.

853
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:54,970
[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]

854
00:57:54,970 --> 00:58:00,140
If you look at the big picture timeline in the first week of March, the Japan.

855
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:07,210
He's crossed the win river, as we had said, they blow past the flanks of one major units surrounded.

856
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:10,990
And it has to fight its way out, then they advance on, involve and CO.

857
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:16,610
Hema and manage to put those places under seeds you if this had been.

858
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:17,240
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

859
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,680
An earlier war.

860
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:19,980
[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]

861
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:22,160
Those places would be cut off.

862
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:27,240
And the British and imperial troops in those places would begin to run out of ammunition.

863
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:30,410
They wouldn't have any reinforcements they would run out of medical supplies.

864
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:33,090
They would run out of food, and that would be that.

865
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:33,910
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

866
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,250
The difference here though.

867
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:37,970
Is, and this is what frustrates the Japanese.

868
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:38,600
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

869
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,140
The allies have the ability to supply the cutoff.

870
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:44,020
Areas by air.

871
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:44,530
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

872
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:48,230
This is huge and it's a new development, right, and it.

873
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:53,050
Was only really in the second world war that the capability existed even tried this.

874
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:54,960
And past attempts had been hit.

875
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:05,730
Or missed to say the least, I mean, when the German army is surrounded by the so yeah, it's at stolen grad, the lift welfare tries to fly in supplies.

876
00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:22,550
And they can't manage to provide anywhere near enough for a starving army running out of ammunition that has to surrender, but here there are American air assets that have been flying supplies over what's called the hump, which.

877
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:24,920
Are a bunch of mountain ranges into China.

878
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,090
It's also called the.

879
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:30,090
Skyway to hell and the British are able to borrow some of these.

880
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:46,850
Big heavy supply planes to add to their spitfire and hurricane fighters, which they're using in a mostly ground attack, roll to change the entire equation and begin to supply their cut off troops with what they need to keep fighting and recall.

881
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:50,960
The Japanese have only a limited amount of this stuffed themselves.

882
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:51,340
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

883
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:53,610
They can't do the air supply thing.

884
00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:54,450
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

885
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:57,970
And if they can't take the supplies of the people that they.

886
00:59:57,970 --> 01:00:02,860
Cut off and are fighting it in falling off, they're gonna run out of supplies themselves.

887
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:03,230
I liked.

888
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:10,090
The way the British general in charge of this operation describes it his name, by the way, is a lieutenant general William slim.

889
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:11,560
He's a very fine general.

890
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:11,920
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

891
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:20,670
He cops to his mistakes initially here underestimating the Japanese speed and size, and whether or not they can get through the jungle with their troops.

892
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:21,010
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

893
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:24,470
But then explains really the entire battle.

894
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:28,210
In the terms that will decide it and he says, quote.

895
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:28,800
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

896
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:41,740
As I struggled hard to redress my errors and to speed by rail and air these reinforcements, I knew that all depended on the steadfastness of the troops already meeting the first impetus of attack.

897
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:42,090
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

898
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:46,440
If they could hold until help arrived, all would be well.

899
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:55,490
If not, we were near disaster, so that's what has to happen, and the air supply helps, but bottom line.

900
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:55,960
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

901
01:00:55,960 --> 01:01:00,150
It's a question of heroism, and I am not a glory guy when it comes.

902
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:01,940
Mr war, put me in the camp of.

903
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:02,280
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

904
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:05,400
The William to come to sherman's the American general.

905
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,650
Who had said that wars, glory is all moonshine.

906
01:01:08,650 --> 01:01:10,970
I don't think killing other people's glorious.

907
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:11,390
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

908
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:21,960
But I think surviving against incredible odds, putting up with the privation in the hardship, enduring the unendurable.

909
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:26,860
For the sake of whatever is motivating you to do, so can often be heroic.

910
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:27,420
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

911
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:33,550
And it's a shame that things like the colonial overtones or if you're the Japanese or the Germans, the.

912
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:37,120
Evil cause in which your your fighting.

913
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:48,950
That, that somehow or sometimes overshadows the heroism of the troops involved, um, rarely do you read combat accounts where the troops are talking about things like.

914
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:51,800
Um, you know, a German soldier saying he's ready to fight.

915
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,860
And die for more Lebanese realm for Germany, right.

916
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:55,250
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

917
01:01:55,250 --> 01:02:11,560
Or an American who's fighting and dying for the larger cause of for the world or a Japanese soldier who's fighting and dying to conquer and and control other Asian peoples, or even a British soldier from.

918
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:12,220
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

919
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:14,050
Kent maybe.

920
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:21,590
Or a place like that, ready to lay down his life so Britain can maintain its colonial dominance of a place like India.

921
01:02:21,590 --> 01:02:23,570
That's generally not what.

922
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:24,440
At bottom line.

923
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:27,010
Of course, it's about killer be killed, but.

924
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:29,900
Above that, you will read so many accounts where soldiers are fighting.

925
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:38,190
For their comrades or their unit or the esprit, a core of the group that they belong to or may be just to not let down.

926
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:39,160
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

927
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,210
Those other people that are depending on them, I mean.

928
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:55,060
It's very baseline stuff, your your worldview and your your horizon shrinks and the lens you view things through is very narrow and um immediate, so I don't like the idea that.

929
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:56,230
[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

930
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:57,330
This is a problem in India.

931
01:02:57,330 --> 01:03:04,980
I read that the Indians have a hard time, sometimes trying to fix how to portray this whole affair because it's so overshadowed with the colonial question, we're.

932
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:07,340
Indian troops fighting with the British.

Indian Independence, I mean, it's it's a complicated question, and as.

935

937
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:23,670
Is an ideological and geographic nightmare.

938
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:29,990
But that shouldn't overshadow what was done there by all the soldiers on all sides.

939
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:31,550
I mean, read some of the accounts.

[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]

941
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:48,460
First of all, the Japanese threw themselves at the enemy wave after wave, sometimes suicidally the British general of a slim was very critical of the throwing away of Japanese lives.

942
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:50,500
[ SPACE 2.0 secs ]

943
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:55,350
He also had a true admiration for the Japanese.

[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]

946
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:05,140
Well, let me just quote what's said in um Robert lehman's book Japan's last bid for victory.

947
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:05,540
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

948
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:35,080
Quote with the difficulties posed by the climate came a stark reminder to any British Commonwealth troops who had not yet the toughness of their adversary of just how extraordinarily fit and physically hearty were the Japanese how committed they were to achieving their objectives, how apparently unconcerned they were with regard to human comforts and how determined they were to do with the emperor through their officers demanded or die in the attempt repeated.

949
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:45,010
Fanatical and suicidal attacks were thrown at the British, Indian and Gurkha defenders, and counterattacks had to face the toughest defensive positions imaginable.

950
01:04:45,010 --> 01:05:00,240
Prepared by men whom general slim was to describe as warrior as the days went by, the battlefield became one large charnel house littered with bodies in various states of decomposition, as it was rarely easy to recover.

951
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:07,660
And bury the dead and the you can even look, by the way, at the at the photographs, and as the battle goes on.

953
01:05:08,050 --> 01:05:11,300
The areas that are highly fought over go from you know.

954
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:19,230
Heavy lush jungle where you can't see 5 feet in front of your face to terrain that looks like first world war battlefields.

955
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:33,870
Especially the ones that used to be forests, but have been shelled into wasteland, general slim actually says that the battle for CO hema is the only one he'd seen in the second world war that reminded him of the first war of war.

01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:40,420
The British forces the imperial forces were so badly outnumbered.

961
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:44,700
That they eventually get pushed in onto one hill.

962
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:55,850
Of something like 350 square metres and they will be fighting over and over tennis court and actual, it's called the tennis court where the Japanese are on one side of the tennis court fighting.

963
01:05:55,850 --> 01:06:00,880
British imperial forces on the other side of the tennis court and their throwing grenade at each other.

964
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:18,840
For days and days and days, that's not glorious, but it's heroic on both sides in his book hero h ito's war, Arthur Francis pike tries to give a sense of what the fighting was like and writes.

[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

966
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:35,340
Most famously, there was a five day tussle across the tennis courts belonging to the deputy commissioner's bungalow soldiers dug in on either side had to live through torrential rain and eat shit and sleep in their trenches.

967
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:49,670
The courts were covered in the bloated bodies of slain Japanese soldiers, enormous black flies filled the air, the stench of death was gut wrenching, major John nettlefish observed the place stank.

968
01:06:49,670 --> 01:07:02,830
The ground everywhere was plowed up with shell fire and human remains lay rotting as the battle raged over them, flies swarmed everywhere and multiplied with incredible speed men wretched as they dug in.

969
01:07:02,830 --> 01:07:05,600
And pike continues quote.

971
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:24,990
Hand grenades rather than tennis balls, Chris crossed the courts, the resilience of the defenders proved the moral the general slim had instilled in his troops in one notable engagement, John Harmon, son of the millionaire owner of Lundy island, a lance corporal with the queen's Royal west Kent regiment.

972
01:07:24,990 --> 01:07:32,900
Single handedly charged a Japanese trenched killed its five occupants before being fatally shot, returning to his own lines.

Dying in his company commander's arms.

974
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:37,070
He gave his last words.

975
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:38,440
I got the lot.

976
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:53,360
It was worth it and quote, but this is unsustainable for the Japanese because unlike their opponents, they are running out of supplies and not just food, but ammunition.

977
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:56,070
Bullets, shells, medical stuff, everything.

[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

979
01:07:57,020 --> 01:08:18,850
When you look at the numbers that the Japanese units were reduced to, I have a hard time finding similar numbers in any conflict anywhere because normally units break and run before they hit those kinds of numbers, I mean, situation that pike recalls, one soldier says that the losses had been dreadful.

980
01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:25,370
The regiment had started out 38 hundreds strong and now just had a few hundred men laughed and many of them invalid.

Doesn't care.

996
01:09:18,670 --> 01:09:41,990
He ordered his troops to retreat to right around the same time that the monsoon is open up top the Japanese on the defensive are just as difficult for the allies to deal with as they are on the offensive, and they they have to be dug out position by position.

997
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:48,110
At huge cost to the allied soldiers who have to do this in his book.

998
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:57,100
Japan's last bid for victory Arthur Robert Lyman tries to give a sense of how hard it was to dig the Japanese out of these defensive positions.

999
01:09:57,100 --> 01:10:03,540

[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

1001
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:11,140
Nowhere were sudden gains made, but by gradual perseverance in the application of focused firepower.

1002
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:25,050
The Japanese were destroyed bunker by bunker trench by trench, rarely did the Japanese run or retreat remaining to die where they fought lieutenant linthorne Highgate of the dorsets.

1003
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:41,370
Considered the Japanese to be magnificent trench warriors, every army in the world talks about holding positions to the last man, virtually no other army, including the Germans ever did, but the japs did their positions were well cited.

1004
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:43,320
And they had a good eye for ground.

1005
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:46,220
They relied on rushing and shouting in the attack.

1006
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:50,460
We thought they were formidable fighting insects and savages.

1007
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:54,300
We took few prisoners about one or two in the whole war.

1008

We wanted prisoners, but wounded men would have a primed grenade under them, so stretch your bear.

Whatever his thoughts about the capabilities of Japanese commanders, slim was profuse in his admiration for Japanese troops.

1014
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:30,860
Quote, there can be no question of the supreme courage and hearty hood of the Japanese soldiers who made the attempts I know of no army that could have equaled.

01:16:04,090 --> 01:16:11,550
Architectural heritage of Germans forever into the future is gone, and they're not the only ones who suffer.

1083
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:20,530
It's a cultural monument that we all suffer because it's gone significant than one generation of human beings could cost.

1084
01:16:20,530 --> 01:16:33,890
I mean, it's the same thing Churchill looked at when he saw the films of the German cities and rubble and wondered if this was a bridge too far to win the war, but if you look at how events unfolded, it all is pretty understandable.

1085
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:42,470
You can see how people got sucked into this idea that anything is better than losing this war, total war, and anything means using everything you have.

1086
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:52,510
And there are a lot of people arguing that this bombing stuff shortens wars, and as we've seen the human being lawnmower at work at all times every day, racking up its daily totals.

1087
01:16:52,510 --> 01:17:02,730
If you shut the war down months early, well, that's that many daily totals that don't you know, going to the fiery furnace, it's it's logical.

1088
01:17:02,730 --> 01:17:05,070
Insanity is the way it's been described.

1089
01:17:05,070 --> 01:17:06,440
[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]

1090
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:10,590
If the Japanese were reasonable people, they would surrender.

1091
01:17:10,590 --> 01:17:12,790
Now see there's many points in 1944, you go.

1092
01:17:12,790 --> 01:17:14,850
Okay, now would be a really good time to spare.

1093
01:17:14,850 --> 01:17:18,600
Your cities in the cultural heritage of the Japanese people and all that for the future.

[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

1095
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:23,130
The part of what makes the Japanese so compelling, I mean.

1096
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:24,640
500 years from now when the.

1097
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:24,970
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

1098
01:17:24,970 --> 01:17:28,330
Young people are reading the history and getting interested in the subjects Japan.

1099
01:17:28,330 --> 01:17:28,720
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1100
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:37,740
Is going to be, I think, compelling the way that many other people throughout the the past who were willing to fight for their country, right?

1101
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:47,860
This is a a kind of a patriotic sort of a feeling taken to extremes and then becoming poisonous, and we talked about this earlier in this series, didn't we?

1102
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:48,140
We.

1103
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:49,280
We called it Super patriots.

1104
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:50,450
[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

1105
01:17:50,450 --> 01:17:59,470
The Japanese are going to go to lengths that you admire because it shows how far the human spirit can be pushed.

1106
01:17:59,470 --> 01:18:00,230
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

1107
01:18:00,230 --> 01:18:02,180
Interesting to see some of our extremes.

1108
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:02,630
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1109
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:15,320
At the same time debilitating to watch because it's often being used in a way that seems wasteful, doesn't have to happen, and that's why sometimes you'll read these books.

1110
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:16,200
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

1111
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:39,630
The kama kazi, for example, and they will they will make it beautiful in a Japanese cultural sense and talk about the falling of the cherry blossoms and all these sorts of um in order to put some sort of an artistic or spiritual coating on the idea of a young man with his whole life ahead of implying his airplane extra loaded with bombs into an allied.

1112
01:18:39,630 --> 01:18:42,850
[ SPACE 3.2 secs ]

1113
01:18:42,850 --> 01:19:01,900
Now i've read the letters from comicosity pilots and and you get all sorts of different people who do that for all sorts of different reasons, it's not this monolithic fanatical robot image we thought of them when I was growing up, not at all, but there's a number of people out there that think that this is what you should be doing.

1114
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:03,740
If you love your country right.

1115
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:04,110
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1116
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:07,500
The same thing these Japanese soldiers did when they would strap themselves.

1117
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:10,080
And put a mine on their back and then run under an.

1118
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:13,290
American or or a British tank and blow themselves up.

1119
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:14,280
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

1120
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:16,450
Most armies don't do that.

1121
01:19:16,450 --> 01:19:17,310
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

1122
01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:18,190
The Japanese are.

1123
01:19:18,190 --> 01:19:20,450
Like everyone else, only more so right.

1124
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:21,460
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

1125
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:40,160
And the B 29 countdown has begun once these Marianas Islands have fallen into US hands, the question of what to do next is paramount at this particular time, and the high command of the allies disagrees over what this should be.

1126
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:44,020
And the main disagreement is within the United States chain of command.

1127
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:46,480
The army and the navy have different ideas.

1128
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:51,160
On how the rest of the war should go, both sides would like to sort of end up.

1129
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:54,170
At least off the coast of Japan is the end destination.

1130
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:54,550
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1131
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:56,540
But the path to get there.

1132
01:19:56,540 --> 01:20:04,710
While the navy has one idea under admiral earning Mr, King who's a tough customer and the army.

1133
01:20:04,710 --> 01:20:05,820
In this situation.

1134
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:11,030
He's not the general of the army that would be George Marshall, but but the guy whose opinion matters in this situation.

1135
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:11,530
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

1136
01:20:11,530 --> 01:20:20,450
Is our old friend Douglas the situation mc Arthur, who comes to Hawaii in mid 1944 for a big.

1137
01:20:20,450 --> 01:20:23,130
Strategic conference over what to do next.

1138
01:20:23,130 --> 01:20:23,760
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

1139
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,720
And Franklin Delano roosevelt's gonna be there, which is a huge deal.

1140
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:30,500
I mean, when you look at how really, really sick.

1141
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:35,120
Franklin Roosevelt has been 1940, forming it is not too much to say that he is.

1142
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:42,120
Dying, i've read a bunch of good books lately to talk about how pretty much everyone who hadn't seen him for a while.

1143
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:48,360
He shocked when they do even make Arthur wrote that after seeing him, he just knew he didn't have a long time left.

1144
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:58,200
And by the way, Roosevelt is running for office at this time for his fourth no other president has ever been elected more than twice or run more than twice.

1145
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:01,710
I mean, Roosevelt is dying, and he's going for his fourth term.

1146
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:03,650
[ SPACE 1.9 secs ]

1147
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:09,460
I love the uh, the whole sort of reality series.

1148
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:10,380
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

1149
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:13,200
Mood that is cast when this conference kicks off.

1150
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,460
[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]

1151
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:19,630
Roosevelt arrives, is that the navy's waiting for them, everybody's you know, very because when the president shows up.

1152
01:21:19,630 --> 01:21:23,990
You know, everybody salutes a lot and everybody's been prepared and everybody's ready and um.

1153
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:27,580
And Douglas macarthur is not there at the meeting with the president.

1154
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:28,530
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

1155
01:21:28,530 --> 01:21:29,080
He doesn't show.

1156
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:40,150
He doesn't show up for 40 minutes and I love the way author Jonathan W Jordan describes it in his book American warlords um president Roosevelt is on the USS Baltimore.

1157
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:41,290
With the navy guys.

1158
01:21:41,290 --> 01:21:41,590
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

1159
01:21:41,590 --> 01:21:46,480
And they've been waiting for like 40 minutes, and that's where the narrative picks up quote.

1160
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:47,740
[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]

1161
01:21:47,740 --> 01:22:08,280
40 minutes after Baltimore's gangplank was lowered to the pier, the air was split by the shriek of a police siren, a motorcycle escort appeared, leading what SAM Rosenman remembered as quote the longest open car i've ever seen in front was a chauffeur in khaki, and in the back one lone figure.

1162
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:10,020
And Jordan continues.

1163
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:11,150
[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

1164
01:22:11,150 --> 01:22:15,810
That figure wore a crushed general's hat and A brown leather jacket.

1165
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:18,100
Mister ketch had arrived.

1166
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:25,410
Let me stop the narrative real quick, mister ketch, the code name or something like that for mccarthur that the president and the other side had.

1167
01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:25,800
So.

1168
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:33,860
Miss this was Mr Catch mister catch had arrived, Mick Arthur's car drove to the gang plank to the wild applause of the crowd.

1169
01:22:33,860 --> 01:22:41,080
He bounded up the ramp, stopping halfway to acknowledge another round of applause, then strode onto the cruiser's deck.

1170
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:45,700
He saluted the commander in chief before shaking roosevelt's outstretched hands.

1171
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:46,080
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1172
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:56,090
Hello, Douglas, said, Roosevelt, what are you doing with that leather jacket on, it's darn hot today, well, i've just landed from Australia, macarthur said with a smile.

1173
01:22:56,090 --> 01:23:04,930
It's pretty cold up there, and Jordan points out that mc Arthur had actually had time to shave and get ready in the whole thing.

1174
01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:08,390
He wore the leather jacket for effect.

1175
01:23:08,390 --> 01:23:11,980
That's his branding like the corncob pipe and the crushed had.

1176
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:16,330
And he's in Hawaii, and he shows up in the whole garb.

1177
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:16,700
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1178
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:19,580
Because he's in costume, I mean, uniform.

1179
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:24,650
He's an interesting see, and we said this before, you have to acknowledge, I think.

1180
01:23:24,650 --> 01:23:36,980
Anyway, Douglas macarthur's military talent sometimes he does extraordinary things, but he is an interesting guy, talks about himself in the third person, as we said before.

1181
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:39,240
No one who talks about himself in the third.

1182
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:44,120
Person is your normal kind of customer just going to make a broad brush statement about that.

1183
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,750
[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]

1184
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:55,860
George likes spicy chicken, little sign fell joke there for you sign felt fans, macarthur's favorite pronoun is I.

1185
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:56,800
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

1186
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:02,780
And it's the one he used when he was forced out of the Philippines by the Japanese way.

1187
01:24:02,780 --> 01:24:05,670
Back in, I shall return.

1188
01:24:05,670 --> 01:24:07,720
It's one of the most famous phrases of all.

1189
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:08,940
[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

1190
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:12,690
But as we pointed out at the time, there are a bunch of historians and contemporaries who were saying.

1191
01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:15,670
You know, he should have said the United States will return or.

1192
01:24:15,670 --> 01:24:20,000
What but he made it personal, and because he made it personal.

1193
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:20,370
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1194
01:24:20,370 --> 01:24:20,970
Um, it's.

1195
01:24:20,970 --> 01:24:26,140
One of the things that goes into his argument that he makes at the strategy conference about, you know what should happen next.

1196
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:27,510
Well, he says we should go back to the Philippines.

1197
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:27,680
I'm.

1198
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:28,650
Going to return.

1199
01:24:28,650 --> 01:24:29,700
[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

1200
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:36,010
And he gave a whole host of good reasons why that should be the way you know, sort of to Japan, let's take the Philippines.

1201
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:38,100
And we promise those people we have POW's.

1202
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:42,450
In there that the Japanese will kill a lot of good reasons, but part of it was he, you know.

1203
01:24:42,450 --> 01:24:42,850
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1204
01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:47,420
He'd made a promise and this was wrapped up in his destiny somehow.

1205
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:48,240
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

1206
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:50,070
And he wanted to go through the Philippines.

1207
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:55,160
And then you go up toward Okinawa, which is it's Japanese, but not Japanese.

1208
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:57,060
It depends on who you talk to talk to Nokia now.

1209
01:24:57,060 --> 01:24:59,860
And they have a different opinion sometimes, but it's.

1210
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:00,210
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1211
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:04,980
It's considered a home island, and then from Okinawa, you keep going with what the Americans need is a place.

1212
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:08,620
To conserve the same role that Great Britain serves.

1213

[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

1214
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,650
In the Normandy.

Landings, you know.

1216
01:25:11,050 --> 01:25:12,440
On d day, you had a big place.

1217
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:12,940
Where you could.

1218
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:16,940
You could get all your troops together and all the supplies you need and build up and then boom.

1219
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:24,370
Cross the water and you're there and your supply hubs right off the shore, the problem is there's nothing right off the shore from Japan, so if you take the Philippines.

1220
01:25:24,370 --> 01:25:27,420
And you decide that this is going to be your big supply hub where you can.

1221

1222
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:30,620
Gather troops together for the eventual invasion of Japan.

1223

It's still a long sea ride to Japan.

The navy earnest king Abraham earnest king has sent he wanted to come himself, but maybe the.

Actual face to face meeting at a strategy section between a guy like mc Arthur.

1227
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:53,830
And a guy like king, and we talked about what they were like earlier might have been too many sparks for Franklin Delano Roosevelt to keep from.

Blowing up so he he sends a A subordinate sense Abraham Limits.

01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:00,200
Who he then accuses of not having a spine.

1231
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,870
He'll never represent things against it.

1232
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:02,860
He'll he'll get eaten up by.

1233
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:05,470
Douglas macarthur was basically that just of his.

1234
01:26:05,470 --> 01:26:15,680
Statements and Douglas mccarthur prevails in the strategy session because the navy wants to go take, which is modern day Taiwan and use that as the big supply base.

1235
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:19,250
That they can start the Japan attack from.

1236
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:20,650
[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]

1237
01:26:20,650 --> 01:26:21,700
Macarthur wins out.

1238
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:24,290
Though in in the long run on this deal.

1239
01:26:24,290 --> 01:26:27,560
But that doesn't stop the navy, advance the island hopping that's been.

1240
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:32,500
Going on now for a long time in the mariana's Islands campaign, we just talked about the latest island hop and.

1241
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:37,620
So that's going to continue through the central Pacific too, so think of two routes of approach to Japan.

1242
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:40,220
Mccarthy's going to go up through the Philippines in that route.

1243
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:40,670
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1244
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:44,550
The US fleet and the marines and some army help is gonna go.

1245
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:52,890
Through the central Pacific, you know next major stop on the list equal Gma, but there's going to be a little quick thing that the navy wants to take care of first.

1246
01:26:52,890 --> 01:26:57,490
Or i've actually read a lot about this because it's controversial how an island chain like.

1247
01:26:57,490 --> 01:27:00,170
The island chain that contains the island.

1248
01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:09,130
The Pello how that ends up on the to do list um eventually because there's a lot of history that suggests that it was supposed to be crossed off.

1249
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:10,120
Or that it never should have.

1250
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:17,990
I mean, there's it's interesting, and the reason it actually matters is because what will and on Palau is not what is expected to happen on pellow, and when things.

1251
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:19,810
Go wrong, people ask questions.

1252
01:27:19,810 --> 01:27:21,480
For a long time afterwards, all.

1253
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:24,180
Right, when you lose a lot of marines, people start going.

1254
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:26,450
Wow, was this trip really necessary.

1255
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:30,940
And Pella loose controversial that way, Peller lose a A little island, it's a coral.

1256
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:36,880
Reef basically sort of off the coast of the Philippines a ways.

1257
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:37,290
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1258
01:27:37,290 --> 01:27:43,740
And one of the arguments for why this was necessary as it was going to take these islands, so they couldn't use air bases.

1259
01:27:43,740 --> 01:27:50,670
Against mc Arthur when he lands in the not too distant Philip beans well, the prediction is is that they'll go in there.

1260
01:27:50,670 --> 01:27:51,040
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1261
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,690
They'll take these islands in two days.

1262
01:27:52,690 --> 01:27:55,230
Maybe four days should be a sharp little fight, little like.

1263
01:27:55,230 --> 01:27:56,690
Tarawa, so it's going to be rough.

1264
01:27:56,690 --> 01:27:57,860
For a very short period of time.

1265
01:27:57,860 --> 01:27:58,910
It may be really rough.

1266
01:27:58,910 --> 01:27:59,450
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

1267
01:27:59,450 --> 01:28:03,810
And instead, the situation on pellew turns into a kind of disaster.

1268
01:28:03,810 --> 01:28:04,480
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

1269
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:05,840
It turns into.

1270
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:10,780
Um, i've i've seen it called the worst combat that the US marines ever.

1271
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:12,660
[ SPACE 1.9 secs ]

1272
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:22,170
I think that's arguable, but the invasion of Palau is something that reminds me of what the Japanese had wanted to do, and.

1273
01:28:22,170 --> 01:28:22,520
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1274
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:30,200
In in terms of their grand strategy of taking all these islands and then forcing the Americans and the British and the Australians and the New Zealanders and the South Africans.

1275
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:31,670
And jubilant on and on.

1276
01:28:31,670 --> 01:28:44,370
To take them back at super high cost because the Japanese were gonna reinforce these places have guns everywhere and steel doors, and it was gonna be like something of a James Bond film, but they never really did that on the outer islands very much on Palo.

1277
01:28:44,370 --> 01:28:53,300
Though it's sort of let's call it the model home for what the Japanese would have liked to have seen all these islands built up to a level of, I mean.

1278
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:59,950
When you have when you have metal doors that open up in a gun, pops up and fires and goes back inside of the metal doors clothes, i'm calling that jam.

1279
01:28:59,950 --> 01:29:00,950
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

1280
01:29:00,950 --> 01:29:10,420
That's the kind of stuff that the people who landed on pelado got to deal with that, and the fact that they are on an absolute coral atoll, it is not dirt, it is rock.

1281
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:18,360
It is rock and it is usually around 110 degrees or more in the daytime on a rock.

[ SPACE 2.4 secs ]

1283
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:23,490
This is one of those campaigns, by the way that you wish.

1284
01:29:23,490 --> 01:29:28,130
There was more visual material to see in a photographs movies.

1285
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:29,530
Those kind of things, but I read that.

1286
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:30,030
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

1287
01:29:30,030 --> 01:29:35,090
Because the military had told the media that this was going to be over in 2 or four days, write a quick, short.

1288
01:29:35,090 --> 01:29:38,060
Sharp fight, most of them shows to go elsewhere, right.

1289
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:39,760
There's lots of other stories in the Pacific.

1290
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,267
How about mccarthur planning.

1291
01:29:41,267 --> 01:29:43,056
To come back to the Philippines, right.

1292
01:29:43,056 --> 01:29:45,820
When you go cover that and so you don't get pelo U u cuz you.

1293
01:29:45,820 --> 01:29:46,633
Didn't know pello.

1294
01:29:46,633 --> 01:29:59,640
Who was going to be what pellew is one of the Marine Corps, the US Marine Corps, toughest battles ever, and when you see the lineage of the US marines from the second world war, it is one of those place.

1295
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:02,450
Of honor sorts of battles, but it wasn't supposed to be.

[ SPACE 2.0 secs ]

1297
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:10,370

01:30:10,730 --> 01:30:28,330
1st, Marine Regiment of the 1st marine division, the fifth is there the seventh is there, the 11th is providing artillery support, and they're expecting the Japanese to do what the Japanese have done on the other islands, and the Americans are doing what they've done just better right, pounding the you know.

1300
01:30:28,330 --> 01:30:32,460
Heavy duty weapons from the cruisers offshore and the battleship's offshore.

1301
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:34,160
And then the bombers come in straight.

1302
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:40,660
The beaches bomb the heck out of everything, but the Japanese don't do what they've done in their other battles.

1303
01:30:40,660 --> 01:31:05,700
No bonds I charge, which is on the beach to waste away their strength and that sort of stuff they're going to oppose the American landing on the beach lightly, but then require the Americans to go and get them in their prepared position in what is one of the better fortresses you will ever see that was designed by Japanese engineers more than 500 tunnels on the island.

1304
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:08,860
Many of which had been used for mining purposes, so they're interconnected.

1305
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:11,540
And they go to logical places and they're designed in uh.

[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

1307
01:31:11,870 --> 01:31:17,220
In a sort of strategic sense, there are gonna be times on this island where the Americans can hear and know.

1308
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:18,370
That the Japanese are.

1309
01:31:18,370 --> 01:31:29,710
Under them in the ground, and they just can't even get to them in his book eagle against the sun, Ronald h spectre has a good sort of overview of the start of this thing.

1310
01:31:29,710 --> 01:31:31,450
And he writes quote, by the way.

1311
01:31:31,450 --> 01:31:36,840
The island like two miles wide, I think it's 6 square miles tiny.

[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

1313
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:45,350
Quote the Americans had little information about the terrain on pello lu, except some inadequate aerial photos.

1314
01:31:45,350 --> 01:32:09,180
As a result, they failed to recognize its potential for the northern peninsula of the small island was a series of jagged coral Ridge lines honey combed with natural caves, which the Japanese had improved into almost most impregnable fortresses, blast walls of reinforced concrete or oil drums filled with coral protected the entrances to the caves.

1315
01:32:09,180 --> 01:32:23,820
Which often faced from the sheer walls of twisting gorges and were thus mutually supporting in the larger cave fortresses he writes, the Japanese had installed electric lighting, ventilating systems, stairs.

1316
01:32:23,820 --> 01:32:33,400
Telephones and radio communications one large cave was discovered now is quoting somebody quote to have 9 staggered levels.

1317
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:37,450
And so many entrances that it was all but impossible to count them and quote.

[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

1319
01:32:38,590 --> 01:32:51,970
The marines are going to land an assault right into the teeth of defenses that remind me of the kind of defenses that the British and the French soldiers sometimes had to assault head on on the western.

And crossfire set up and Barbara wire put up.

I mean, this is it's not the sort of fight.

1326
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:12,240
You want marines in necessarily because they're fast moving, lightly armed and equipped people designed to, you know, get in quickly, bypass strong points.

1327
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:14,160
This is going to throw them the right into the.

The the war made them do and live through the most outrageously extreme sledge talks about the hitting the beach moment, which he says is like cinematics as.

1346

The world was a nightmare of flashes and violent explosions and snapping bullets, most of what I saw blurred my mind was benumbed by the shock of it.

It was engulfed in a thick, dirty black smoke as a shell scored a direct hit on bits of debris, flew into the air.

1364
01:35:50,330 --> 01:36:06,000
I watched with that odd detached fascination peculiar to men under fire as a flat metal panel about 2 feet square spun high into the air and then splashed into shallow water like a big pancake, I didn't see any men get out of the duck.

Comrades being slaughtered and it filled me with disgust in Matthew a results book the things our fathers saw where he interviews veterans throughout the book he interviews.

1379
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:23,770
Palau veterans, including a nineteen year old marine Dan Lawler.

1380
01:37:23,770 --> 01:37:27,180
Who was also in the wave that attacked pellerin, says this.

1382
01:37:27,990 --> 01:37:30,070
We hit the island, which was only 4.

01:37:30,070 --> 01:37:32,380
Miles long by two miles wide.

1384
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:34,180
I was in the first assault way.

1386
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:37,000
It was hell and every one was scared.

1387
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:45,380
It was an awful feeling as we disembarked, I looked up and down the beaches and all you could hear was screaming and men were falling and dying.

1388
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:48,930
There was artillery, mortar and machine gunfire constantly.

1389
01:37:48,930 --> 01:37:57,110
We fought all day, and by evening we reached the airstrip about a half mile from the beach we set up for the night along the sides of the airstrip.

1390
01:37:57,110 --> 01:38:05,400
The temperature was from 102 degrees at night to 120 degrees in the daytime, we went in with two canteens of water.

1391
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:05,650
That's.

01:38:05,650 --> 01:38:07,060

By noon time.

01:38:11,380 --> 01:38:20,270
We were out of water and quote the Roselle also quotes another marine from that day named John Murray.

1397
01:38:20,270 --> 01:38:34,380
Who says that the first thing he saw after he landed was a Japanese machine gunner chained to his machine gun, and he says they were not going to give up in the last segment.

1398
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:44,310
We had quoted a line from Paul Fu cell's wonderful book on war called war time, and he had a whole chapter called the real war will never get into the book.

1399

[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

1400
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,820

[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

1404
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:53,720
The problem with the real war getting into the books is that.

1405
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:57,860
No country likes to show their own soldiers getting chewed up.

[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

1407
01:38:58,550 --> 01:39:01,830
I have a book called life goes to war in the second world awards.

1408
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:10,600
This book of all the life magazine photos, and you'll occasionally see dead Americans, you know, tastefully shown, but they have no problem showing thousands and thousands.

1409
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:12,920
Of dead Japanese after a bonsai attack.

[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

1411
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:15,740
But what hit me as a child.

1412
01:39:15,740 --> 01:39:19,560
You know who was interested in war was the first real stuff.

1413
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:35,420
That I ran into that didn't sanitize it from the American side, right, you go round playing in your army helmet, your army clothes, and it looks all glorious, and then you run into some of the artwork of a guy like life magazines Tom Lee Lee's a famous artist.

1414
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:39,880
And he was in the second wave at Palau, so he landed about an hour after the first wave.

1415

[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1416
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:50,080
And Lee had had up until this time been doing the same sort of artwork that we could call today, sort of propaganda artwork.

1417
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:50,660
But.

1418
01:39:50,660 --> 01:39:52,080
Halal who changed him.

1419
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:53,790
I have an account from um.

Author James Jones.

1422
01:39:56,420 --> 01:40:01,160
Who was in the Pacific war, and he's talking about these artists.

1423
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:04,610
And he says, ah, this about Tom Lee quote.

[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

1425
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:23,590
Li was one of the artists put into the field by life magazine after their takeover of the defunct army program, various of his works appeared in the magazine and up until the time he went into pellew, most of them could be pretty well classified as excellently done, but high grade propaganda.

1426
01:40:23,590 --> 01:40:43,940
There was very little American blood, very little tension, very little horror, mostly was what could be called the bravo America, and this is your boy type of war art, his almost photographic style easily lent itself to that type of work, as did the styles of Rockwell and others, but something apparently.

1427
01:40:43,940 --> 01:40:46,280
Happened to li after going into pelleaux.

1428
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:52,270
Jones writes the pictures painted out of his pellew experience show a new approach.

1429
01:40:52,270 --> 01:40:55,370
There is the tension of terror in the bodies here.

1430
01:40:55,370 --> 01:40:57,320
And the distorted facial expressions.

01:40:57,320 --> 01:41:02,900
Of the men under fire show it too, if his propagandistic style has not changed.

1432
01:41:02,900 --> 01:41:13,700
His subject matter certainly has I ran into this as a kid, seeing a couple of Lee's most famous pieces of work.

1433
01:41:13,700 --> 01:41:18,820
1 was called uh the 2000 yards there where Lee had.

1434
01:41:18,820 --> 01:41:27,600
Done a piece of art showing what soldiers look like after combat for a long time today, we would recognize it as as what sometimes called combat neurosis.

[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

1436
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:36,450
Tom Lee wrote about the painting that he did of the marine with the so called 2000 yards stare and said quote.

1437
01:41:36,450 --> 01:41:43,610
He meaning the marine left the states 31 months ago he was wounded in his first campaign.

1438
01:41:43,610 --> 01:41:45,820
He has had tropical diseases.

1439
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:47,600
He half sleeps at night.

He will return to attack this morning.

1446
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:08,930
This was a very controversial piece.

1447
01:42:08,930 --> 01:42:11,410
When it was published by life magazine.

1448
01:42:11,410 --> 01:42:17,340

1451
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:35,660
And Lee was accused of embellishing and and overdramatizing something, which if you think about it, sounds silly, he's overdramatizing war, and Lee fought back, saying every single painting he did showed what he really and the.

1452
01:42:35,660 --> 01:42:41,140
Painting the price i'm not the only guy, by the way I was doing research on this and found that other people were similarly affected.

1453
01:42:41,140 --> 01:42:42,510
If you're not used to seeing.

1454
01:42:42,510 --> 01:42:46,970
Your own side as war victims when an artist paints it.

1455
01:42:46,970 --> 01:42:51,810
And this showed a photo almost photo realistic quality.

Quote I fell flat on my face.

1461

Just as I heard the woosh of a mortar that I knew was too close.

1462
01:43:11,410 --> 01:43:20,330
A red flash stabbed at my eyeballs about 15 yards away on the upper edge of the beach, it smashed down four men from our boat.

1463
01:43:20,330 --> 01:43:24,130
One figure seemed to fly to pieces with terrible clarity.

1464
01:43:24,130 --> 01:43:27,690
I saw the head and 1 leg sail into the air.

1465
01:43:27,690 --> 01:43:42,130
I got up, ran a few steps, and fell into a small hole as another mortar burst through dirt on me, lying there in terror, looking longingly up the slope for better cover, I saw a wounded man near me, staggering in the direction.

1466
01:43:42,130 --> 01:43:44,710
Of the L V T 's, the landing vehicles.

1467
01:43:44,710 --> 01:43:59,870
His face was half bloody pulp and the mangled shreds of what was left of an arm hung down like a stick as he bent over in his stumbling, shocked, crazy the half of his face that was still human, had the most terrifying look of abject.

But to me, this isn't gratuitous.

01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:13,880
To say these things.

1474
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:17,080
This is what makes what these marines did.

1475
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:21,360

It's a different style of a thing, isn't it.

1481
01:44:31,610 --> 01:44:38,810
The reason Peller Louis, it's the kind of admiration and horror that it does is because that's not what happened.

And as I said, i'm not a glory person.

1486
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:58,580
I don't think shooting and killing other people's glorious, but there is something heroic about being able to keep going when assaulted by these sorts of sights.

1487
01:44:58,580 --> 01:45:13,060
Sounds and and and possible damage to yourself, and I break, by the way, the heroism down to two separate categories, the heroism.

1488
01:45:13,060 --> 01:45:16,060
While these soldiers and marines and yes.

1489
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:17,490
Japanese soldiers too.

[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

1494
01:45:34,460 --> 01:45:51,670
As I believe I mentioned earlier, I used to talk to um American veterans of the second world war and specifically the ones that were the most difficult nuts to crack were those from the Pacific and a bunch of them wouldn't talk at all the ones who I was told had seen the most combat.

01:45:55,210 --> 01:45:58,550
And how could they ever explain it to you, the the things in sledge's book.

1498
01:45:58,550 --> 01:46:02,000
There were three or four things that when you read them, you go, okay.

1499
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,560
This is something that's going to stay with you the rest of your life.

And still be in great danger in the second world war, but it's different, and we said this in the last segment last part.

Of the show.

01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:50,230
To be shelled by mast, artillery and mortars is absolutely terrifying.

1515

But to be shelled in the open is terror, compounded beyond the belief of any one who hasn't experienced it.

Under artillery attack was like being tied to a and having somebody swinging at your head with a sledge hammer over and over again and just missing by a little, but you were sure that the next shot of the sledgehammer was going to get surviving that artillery barrage while you run and try to avoid getting hit is the sort of thing that will give you nightmares.

01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:13,180
And they're trying to maintain quiet and secrecy, and then one of their guys cracks up and starts raving and screaming and threatening the whole unit.

1530
01:48:13,180 --> 01:48:13,960
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

1531
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:15,730
And they don't know what to do, they're panicking.

1532
01:48:15,730 --> 01:48:16,720
What do we do with this guy.

1533
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:18,100
He's our friend, he's our buddy.

1534
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:23,070
So first, they try to give him morphine, then they try to knock him out with a punch to the jaw.

1535
01:48:23,070 --> 01:48:25,080
Then more morphine and nothing is working.

1536
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:32,580
And eventually one of officers or the sergeant says using an entrenching tool, knock him out, and they hit him in the head with basically a shovel.

1537
01:48:32,580 --> 01:48:33,240
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

1538
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:38,680
And instead of injuring him, he dies and the person who hit him in the head with a shovel has to live with that.

1539
01:48:38,680 --> 01:48:39,840
The rest of his life, you know.

1540
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:40,580
It's one thing to say.

1541
01:48:40,580 --> 01:48:43,140
I killed the enemy and they were a bunch of fanatical robots.

1542
01:48:43,140 --> 01:48:43,570
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1543
01:48:43,570 --> 01:48:45,940
And they did terrible things to our troops, so I don't feel bad about it.

1544
01:48:45,940 --> 01:48:49,740
It's another thing to hit your own guy in the head with an entrenching tool and kill him.

1545
01:48:49,740 --> 01:48:57,580
Sledge tells a worse story than that later on when he's talking about um, and this is like horror movie stuff like Freddie Cruger jump scare.

1546
01:48:57,580 --> 01:49:04,130
Horror stuff, but the Japanese at night with infiltration tactics drove the Americans crazy and and over and over.

1547
01:49:04,130 --> 01:49:06,070
You read veteran saying I hated the night.

1548
01:49:06,070 --> 01:49:06,540
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

1549
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:09,490
They would be in two man foxhole so one person could sleep.

1550
01:49:09,490 --> 01:49:15,820
While the other person watched and stayed on guards, but the problem is, is that night, you thought you every single sound was the Japanese.

1551
01:49:15,820 --> 01:49:18,730
And they'd come close to the foxholes and scream things at you to keep.

1552
01:49:18,730 --> 01:49:19,800
You on edge.

1553
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:21,850
But sometimes they do more than scream.

1554
01:49:21,850 --> 01:49:22,200
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

1555
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:25,900
They grabbed a couple of edged weapons and jump into some of these fox holes.

1556
01:49:25,900 --> 01:49:28,630
And not only did the people in the fox holes who all of a sudden had.

1557
01:49:28,630 --> 01:49:31,440
Japanese in their foxholes with them have to deal with.

1558
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:32,170
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

1559
01:49:32,170 --> 01:49:35,370
But so did every American around that foxhole.

1560
01:49:35,370 --> 01:49:37,380
Who could hear what was happening.

1561
01:49:37,380 --> 01:49:38,570
[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

1562
01:49:38,570 --> 01:49:44,890
I read this over and over again with different marines in different books, talking about the sounds, I mean.

1563
01:49:44,890 --> 01:49:47,470
What does it sound like when one guy is gouging out another.

1564
01:49:47,470 --> 01:49:49,870
Guy's eyes and kills him by doing that.

1565
01:49:49,870 --> 01:49:50,250
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1566
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:52,370
Miss sledge says quote.

1567
01:49:52,370 --> 01:50:02,610
With a wild yell, the Japanese jumped into the hole with the two marines, a frantic, desperate hand to hand struggle ensued, a need by the most gruesome combination of curses.

1568
01:50:02,610 --> 01:50:06,620
Wild babbling, animalistic, guttural noises and grunts.

1569
01:50:06,620 --> 01:50:10,780
Sounds of men hitting each other and thrashing around came from the fox hole.

1570
01:50:10,780 --> 01:50:11,360
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

1571
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:13,560
And quote, okay, again.

1572
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:17,050
Though, that's combat, right, you're going to wake up with some nightmares from that.

1573
01:50:17,050 --> 01:50:27,390
But it's what happens next that gives a different sort of vibe to the whole thing when sledge says a man jumps out of the fox hole and starts running in the dark toward the other marine fox holes.

1574
01:50:27,390 --> 01:50:33,490
So a marine stands up, uses his gun like a club and smacks the figure in the head, knocking him down.

1575
01:50:33,490 --> 01:50:35,200
That figure stays around in the dark.

1576
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:37,170
Groaning and thrashing around until another.

1577
01:50:37,170 --> 01:50:38,060
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

1578
01:50:38,060 --> 01:50:39,670
Goes up and shoots him in the head.

1579
01:50:39,670 --> 01:50:40,430
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

1580
01:50:40,430 --> 01:50:45,420
And in the morning, they find out that it wasn't a Japanese soldier that they shot in the head.

1581
01:50:45,420 --> 01:50:46,520
It was one of their own.

1582
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:47,550
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

1583
01:50:47,550 --> 01:50:48,900
Sledge, says quote.

1584
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:49,600
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

1585
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:59,170
A few hours later, as objects around me became faintly visible with the dawn, I noticed that the still form lying to my left didn't appear Japanese.

1586
01:50:59,170 --> 01:51:04,000
It was either an Emmy and marine zhiyun g aries or leggings, or it was a marine.

1587
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:09,120
I went over to find out which before I got to the prone body, its identity was obvious.

1588
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:10,070
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

1589
01:51:10,070 --> 01:51:22,760
My god, I said in horror, several men looked at me and asked what was the matter, it's bill by and quote he then is asked by the officer who shot him.

1590
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:24,830
Did he get killed by one of the jobs he said.

1591
01:51:24,830 --> 01:51:30,120
And sledgehammers, which was sledge's nickname, says quote, I didn't answer.

1592
01:51:30,120 --> 01:51:32,200
Just looked at him with a blank stare and felt.

1593
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:37,440
Sick, I looked at the man who had crawled past me to check on the groaning man in the dark.

1594
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:39,440
He had shot bill through the temple.

1595
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:42,060
Mistakenly assuming him to be Japanese.

1596
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:42,850
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

1597
01:51:42,850 --> 01:51:50,830
And then he says, as the realization of his fatal mistake hit him, the man's face turned action, his jaw trembled.

1598
01:51:50,830 --> 01:52:05,550
And he looked as though he were going to cry and quote, this is something above and beyond what you expect when you go to kill the enemy, and I understand so much better after reading sledges book why it was so hard.

1599
01:52:05,550 --> 01:52:09,700
Sometimes impossible to get these Pacific war veterans, especially these marines.

1600
01:52:09,700 --> 01:52:10,220
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

1601
01:52:10,220 --> 01:52:12,430
To tell you much about their experience.

1602
01:52:12,430 --> 01:52:26,210
Because how could you have understood what sort of context did you have to properly assess what this person was trying to make you understand and sledge addresses this too, and says, quote.

1603
01:52:26,210 --> 01:52:26,910
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

1604
01:52:26,910 --> 01:52:30,760
To the non combatants and those on the periphery of action.

1605
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:56,100
The war bent only boredom or occasional excitement, but to those who entered the meat grinder itself, the war was another world of horror from which escape seemed less and less likely as casualties mounted and the fighting drag on and on time had no meaning life had no meaning the fierce struggle for survival in the abyss of Pellew eroded the veneer of civilization.

1606
01:52:56,100 --> 01:52:58,200
And made savages of us all.

1607
01:52:58,200 --> 01:52:59,940
We existed in an environment.

1608
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:00,500
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

1609
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:05,320
Totally incomprehensible to men behind the lines service troops.

1610
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:11,620
And civilians, and when you look at the casualties on Pello.

1611
01:53:11,620 --> 01:53:16,500
It's like 8000 Americans, roughly about 16 or 1700 dead.

1612
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:19,050
Which doesn't sound like a lot until you realized.

1613
01:53:19,050 --> 01:53:19,610
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

1614
01:53:19,610 --> 01:53:22,600
The size of the island, right, just like Tarawa, the.

1615
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:23,530
Numbers of Tarawa.

1616
01:53:23,530 --> 01:53:26,740
The Gilbert islands earlier don't seem like that much until you realize it's like.

1617
01:53:26,740 --> 01:53:32,130
3 days of fighting for another little tiny spit of nothing land wise.

1618
01:53:32,130 --> 01:53:32,500
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1619
01:53:32,500 --> 01:53:40,100
If you could divide the casualties by the square footage of the battlefield, you could see how particularly nasty these Pacific battles were.

1620
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:45,190
And you don't even have to do that for the Japanese because they lose between 11 and 13000.

1621
01:53:45,190 --> 01:53:46,010
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

1622
01:53:46,010 --> 01:53:47,540
Their commanding officer, of course.

1623
01:53:47,540 --> 01:53:53,060
Near the end of the campaign burns the regimental colors um kills himself.

1624
01:53:53,060 --> 01:53:54,420
[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]

1625
01:53:54,420 --> 01:54:01,520
And the only people who surrender are the normal small, small handful of mostly Korean and coconut and laborers.

1626
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:01,830
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

1627
01:54:01,830 --> 01:54:14,120
The last organized Japanese units to surrender on pello don't do so until 1947, two years after the war is over.

1628
01:54:14,120 --> 01:54:19,880
Does I tell you how committed they were resisting and how hard an opponent they were.

1629
01:54:19,880 --> 01:54:21,960
[ SPACE 2.1 secs ]

1630
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:24,730
The first marine division, especially.

1631
01:54:24,730 --> 01:54:25,210
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

1632
01:54:25,210 --> 01:54:28,860
The first regiment severely chewed up the first regimen, I believe.

1633
01:54:28,860 --> 01:54:35,770
Suffers twice as many casualties as is normally considered to be a unit that's just.

1634
01:54:35,770 --> 01:54:38,500
Completely out of commission, it would take the months to recover.

1635
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:39,940
[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]

1636
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:55,390
It's some of the worst, if not the worst casualty rates the marine suffer ever in their history, and palazzo doesn't get enough attention, it's not hard to see how an event like pellom, though.

1637
01:54:55,390 --> 01:54:55,990
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

1638
01:54:55,990 --> 01:55:11,980
Gets downplayed after all, what country in the second world war was not exercising a high level of censorship when it comes to showing their public back home, what the war was really I mean.

1639
01:55:11,980 --> 01:55:24,050
Most Americans got their visual impressions of what the war looked like through news real footage in the movie theaters, right, so often show it in between two halves of a double feature, right?

1640
01:55:24,050 --> 01:55:26,600
You guys, you see your escape, best entertainment.

1641
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:28,060
You buy your popcorn and your coke.

1642
01:55:28,060 --> 01:55:29,280
You sit down in the theater.

1643
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:29,990
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

1644
01:55:29,990 --> 01:55:38,750
And you're confronted with Pella, oi, was that gonna make parents of a marine somewhere in the Pacific that they just get occasional cards from?

1645
01:55:38,750 --> 01:55:55,760
You're wondering how his junior doing, and then you see the footage of palila or you're a 15 or sixteen year old American boy thinking, okay, in the next couple of years, i'm going off to war, and then you show them what a two or three or four day battle estimations, um, what.

1646
01:55:55,760 --> 01:55:59,890
That looks like when it turns into a 73 or 74 day battle and.

1647
01:55:59,890 --> 01:56:00,900
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

1648
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:03,800
With the highest casualty rates marines have seen.

1649
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:10,910
I mean, that's the kind of thing that not only does the public not want to really see that the government doesn't really want to show it to them.

1650
01:56:10,910 --> 01:56:12,190
[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]

1651
01:56:12,190 --> 01:56:16,700
What's more, we should point out that there's a giant giant historical.

1652
01:56:16,700 --> 01:56:19,770
News event happening only about 700 miles away.

1653
01:56:19,770 --> 01:56:21,190
[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]

1654
01:56:21,190 --> 01:56:24,980
Overshadows this whole thing and overlaps it timewise.

1655
01:56:24,980 --> 01:56:27,310
Because wild pellets being fought over.

1656
01:56:27,310 --> 01:56:27,960
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

1657
01:56:27,960 --> 01:56:30,860
Douglas macarthur is returning to the Philippines.

1658
01:56:30,860 --> 01:56:31,220
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1659
01:56:31,220 --> 01:56:54,320
And if you didn't know how big of an historical event this was, Douglas, make Arthur's press relations people would see to it that you, but pello lu is hardly the only thing that gets overshadowed by all of these big, exciting historical occasions that are much more positive and would look much better in the movie theater in the news real between the two halves of the double feature.

1660
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:54,630
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

1661
01:56:54,630 --> 01:56:57,210
I mean, how about submarine wrong fare and what.

1662
01:56:57,210 --> 01:57:07,680
That's doing to the Japanese, the non sexy side of war as we've been calling at the logistics, the supply and what's fascinating to me is not only is.

1663
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:17,990
Is are things like logistics and supply not all that interesting to people like yours truly or the people who want a war game in the second world war, I can honestly tell you i've war game many times, Japanese Naval combat.

1664
01:57:17,990 --> 01:57:23,330
I have never once in my life war gamed a submarine trying to sink a merchant vessel.

1665
01:57:23,330 --> 01:57:24,390
[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

1666
01:57:24,390 --> 01:57:25,400
Um escort ship.

1667
01:57:25,400 --> 01:57:28,980
Tries to catch the submarine first, I mean, not only do I not do that.

1668
01:57:28,980 --> 01:57:31,710
But the Japanese cadets at the naval Academy don't wanna do.

1669
01:57:31,710 --> 01:57:33,540
[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]

1670
01:57:33,540 --> 01:57:35,920
There's a book called the Japanese Navy in world war ii.

1671
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:36,260
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

1672
01:57:36,260 --> 01:57:42,200
Edited by David C Evans and what it really is a sort of a debriefing of the Japanese admirals after the war.

1673
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:45,520
And they all but nobody cared about this.

1674
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:49,520
They blame it on the Japanese pensions for the offense, right.

1675
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:50,580
They want the colorful.

1676
01:57:50,580 --> 01:58:02,960
Offense, they want the the big, decisive naval battles, which by the way, the Americans and the Japanese both subscribe to the to the mayhem idea of the decisive naval battle, so neither one of those countries, navies.

1677
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:12,070
Were really excited about things like commerce writing, but the Japanese didn't put any effort into it at all, one admiral had said.

1678
01:58:12,070 --> 01:58:12,680
That if.

1679
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:18,230
They had thought the United States would use their submarines the way the Germans were using you boats in the Atlantic.

1680
01:58:18,230 --> 01:58:18,530
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

1681
01:58:18,530 --> 01:58:21,400
To go after merchant shipping, they might not have launched the war at all.

1682
01:58:21,400 --> 01:58:23,860
That shows you how unprepared they were to deal with it.

1683
01:58:23,860 --> 01:58:24,480
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

1684
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:28,010
And as we had said earlier, one of the things about naval wrong fare.

1685
01:58:28,010 --> 01:58:29,040
Is in general.

1686
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:32,100
If you find out that you haven't built the right ships.

1687
01:58:32,100 --> 01:58:39,510
That is a problem that takes at least a couple of years to solve, like when you find out because of experience in the second world war.

1688
01:58:39,510 --> 01:58:43,700
The aircraft carriers are going to be the new queen of the season, not battleships well.

1689
01:58:43,700 --> 01:58:45,760
You don't magically have aircraft carriers.

1690
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:48,520
You've got to go and make some in that takes years.

1691
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:53,380
So if you find out that you don't have enough escorts for your merchant ships.

1692
01:58:53,380 --> 01:58:54,250
That's a problem.

1693
01:58:54,250 --> 01:59:04,210
You can't solve all that quickly, and it took the Japanese a while to realize it because it took the Americans and the other allies a to really make a dent in the enemy's commercial shipping.

1694
01:59:04,210 --> 01:59:07,690
There's lots of reasons for this, and we mentioned one of them earlier in the series.

1695
01:59:07,690 --> 01:59:12,370
We talked about the absolute terribleness of American torpedoes.

1696
01:59:12,370 --> 01:59:16,160
And i've read all kinds of accounts where I mean, it's called a scandal, a national disgrace.

1697
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:17,730
People should have gone to jail, I mean.

1698
01:59:17,730 --> 01:59:18,120
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1699
01:59:18,120 --> 01:59:19,950
The stories from the Japanese about.

01:59:19,950 --> 01:59:20,380
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1701
01:59:20,380 --> 01:59:31,380
Ships coming back into port with unexploded American torpedos sticking out of the side of the merchant vessels are all the American pilots who dropped their torpedoes right right close by.

1702
01:59:31,380 --> 01:59:31,680
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

1703
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:36,320
An enticing Japanese naval target only to watch the torpedos go right under it, yeah.

1704
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:36,980
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

1705
01:59:36,980 --> 01:59:38,110
Well, that.

1706
01:59:38,110 --> 01:59:46,030
Will impact your submarine success rate until you fix that, but by mid 1944, the Americans have fixed that.

1707
01:59:46,030 --> 01:59:50,740
And now you start to see the tonnage totals of Japanese merchant shipping skyrocket.

1708
01:59:50,740 --> 01:59:54,910
It and submarines will account for about 60 percent.

1709
01:59:54,910 --> 01:59:59,450
Of the Japanese merchandise that are sent to the bottom of the sea with aircraft.

1710
01:59:59,450 --> 02:00:05,130
Allied aircraft of all kinds from all countries, accounting for most of the rest.

1711
02:00:05,130 --> 02:00:06,200
[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

1712
02:00:06,200 --> 02:00:07,510
But when you look at the numbers.

1713
02:00:07,510 --> 02:00:13,580
You get an idea of how the impact is affecting the Japanese ability to do anything.

1714
02:00:13,580 --> 02:00:16,360
When we had talked about the supply problems in Burma.

1715
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:33,540
How do the Japanese get supplies over those mountains through those jungles on those terrible roads, while the Pacific even worse, the Japanese at the time of the Pearl Harbor tax had about 6 million tons of merchant and no nation in the second world war has enough merchant shipping is always in short supply.

1716
02:00:33,540 --> 02:00:49,820
For everyone, including the United States, who can build merchant ships faster than anyone ever thought possible, the Japanese will build another three and a half million tons of merchant shipping during the war, but by December 1944, even with all that, they're down to 2500000 tons.

1717
02:00:49,820 --> 02:00:54,545
And the Americans are sinking hundreds of thousands of tons a month.

1718
02:00:54,545 --> 02:01:00,760
And the only way that, that number will slow down and you'll start thinking less merchants shipping.

1719
02:01:00,760 --> 02:01:04,850
Is because eventually they're so successful, they run out of targets.

1720
02:01:04,850 --> 02:01:05,890
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

1721
02:01:05,890 --> 02:01:31,310
Essentially by late 1944, American submarines are doing to Japan what German u-boats were hoping to do to Britain, another island nation back during the battle of the Atlantic in 19 starve an island nation of the resources that it needs to continue to fight the war, bring them to their knees.

1722
02:01:31,310 --> 02:01:32,730
[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]

1723
02:01:32,730 --> 02:01:43,550
But the German navy's idea of bringing Britain to its knees in 1942 in the battle of the Atlantic would have involved some sort of peace arrangement.

1724
02:01:43,550 --> 02:01:44,480
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

1725
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:49,450
What if you are dropped to your knees as a nation.

1726
02:01:49,450 --> 02:01:51,130
But you still don't give up.

1727
02:01:51,130 --> 02:01:51,430
Right.

1728
02:01:51,430 --> 02:01:51,940
We know if these.

1729
02:01:51,940 --> 02:01:52,760
Were reasonable people.

1730
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:54,310
They would have surrendered long ago.

1731
02:01:54,310 --> 02:01:56,540
What if you cripple them and they don't.

1732
02:01:56,540 --> 02:02:15,190
Give in any there's fantastic anecdote and E And W told, by the way, as an author is so good at finding these historical anecdotes that helps dramatize both where the supply problem has the Japanese in terms of options, by OC taobao 1944.

1733
02:02:15,190 --> 02:02:15,540
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1734
02:02:15,540 --> 02:02:19,770
But also the mood amongst the leadership and the decision makers.

1735
02:02:19,770 --> 02:02:21,780
And I have to say there's a little bit of a sickness.

1736
02:02:21,780 --> 02:02:27,290
I think it to finding this so interesting, but i've always been fascinated with that mood that you find.

1737
02:02:27,290 --> 02:02:42,870
Well, we always say the extremes of the human experience, but think about the people in Hitler's bunker, you know, as the battle of Berlin is ramping up, so Hitler during the last month and what it's like in that room, and all those people psychotic the logical states under that kind of crushing pressure.

1738
02:02:42,870 --> 02:02:43,200
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

1739
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:44,520
I'm fascinated by that.

1740
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:45,040
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

1741
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:48,050
You have a similar dynamic going on in Japan at this time.

1742
02:02:48,050 --> 02:03:04,620
Period and in this anecdote, N W toll um brings you into a conference between army heads and navy heads in Japan, and these guys are putting the finishing touches on their plan to respond.

1743
02:03:04,620 --> 02:03:09,730
To this great historical event we mentioned earlier, that's going to overshadow Palau, right?

1744
02:03:09,730 --> 02:03:16,080
The return of Douglas mccarthur to the Philippines and the plan is the Americans are gonna land.

1745
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:21,990
October 20th on the Philippine island of late and it's gonna be on right, well.

1746
02:03:21,990 --> 02:03:24,190
The Japanese know by that time.

1747
02:03:24,190 --> 02:03:35,160
That the Americans are going to land in the Philippines and probably on lady, and so they have a plan that's been ready for a little while to go disrupt this, and they're basically going to throw in.

1748
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:35,460
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

1749
02:03:35,460 --> 02:03:51,470
Everything the Japanese fleet has left in order to accomplish this goal, but before the plan can happen, there's this conference that toll talks about and a general in the army satoh, who we mentioned earlier, basically turns to the navy and says.

1750
02:03:51,470 --> 02:03:56,610
You know, how is this going to be worth the fuel that we're going to use.

1751
02:03:56,610 --> 02:03:59,370
For the navy to conduct this operation, right.

1752
02:03:59,370 --> 02:04:00,140
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

1753
02:04:00,140 --> 02:04:01,640
He says that there's a.

1754
02:04:01,640 --> 02:04:02,110
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

1755
02:04:02,110 --> 02:04:05,810
Fleet of merchant ship, six of them carrying 60000.

1756
02:04:05,810 --> 02:04:17,230
Tons of oil to Japan right now and that the fleet would basically use all of that, whereas we could use that 60000 tons of oil to do a lot of things for the civilians for the other war effort areas.

1757
02:04:17,230 --> 02:04:17,690
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

1758
02:04:17,690 --> 02:04:27,440
And it's funny because 60000 tons of oil a couple years ago would not have been anywhere near this important, but we understand that scarcity makes things valuable law of supply and demand and all that.

1759
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:27,750
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

1760
02:04:27,750 --> 02:04:30,880
But when the general says this to the navy.

1761
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:38,700
He essentially exposes the fact that this is less about the Japanese Navy trying to make a war winning difference here, although they'd like to.

1762
02:04:38,700 --> 02:04:39,150
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1763
02:04:39,150 --> 02:04:40,580
Then it is about.

1764
02:04:40,580 --> 02:04:51,010
Making an honorable end, toll says that their plan here boils down to like a naval version of one of those suicidal bonsai attacks.

1765
02:04:51,010 --> 02:05:00,100
The Japanese have been doing on land with thousands of their soldiers will run into machine gunfire with bayonets, but that's where we are.

1766
02:05:00,100 --> 02:05:07,980
In this story and one of the things that tolls anecdote deals with is the fact that these hard bitten old military guys who were.

1767
02:05:07,980 --> 02:05:11,980
In a room with their sister service right in the Japanese Navy army, don't much care for.

So if the one place you don't want to wear your emotions on your sleeve is in a room full of these kind of people, right.

1771
02:05:18,110 --> 02:05:25,340

[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1773
02:05:25,780 --> 02:05:28,840
The Japanese general says to the navy.

1774
02:05:28,840 --> 02:05:33,100
You know how how are you going to be able to accomplish anything worth this fuel, the 60000 tons of oils.

1775
02:05:33,100 --> 02:05:34,530

The speech brought the entire room, including Sato, to the brink of tears he had put Japan's predicament into stark relief, the honour of the once mighty Imperial Japanese Navy, and now mattered less than 6 tankers and the oil that they carried.

1780
02:05:53,900 --> 02:05:59,950

This was the saddest feeling I had ever experienced and quote.

Soto wrote toll then points out that everybody's weeping quote, sobbing.

1784

Freely rear admiral tasuku Nakazawa of the naval general staff replied on behalf of he was grateful to the general for his kindness.

1785
02:06:22,660 --> 02:06:32,450
But now quote unquoting the admiral, now the combined fleet of the empire of Japan wishes to be given a place to end her life and what.

1789

After a choked silence with tears streaming down his face, Sato agreed that the 60000 tons of oil should be offered as a quote and quote parting present to the navy.

Even though they know they're being sent on one of these things, that's probably a one way mission.

Do they rebel, how many fleets around the world in world history would have just rebelled, you know, struck the colors put.

The Japanese sailors have a problem with this too, but for different reasons entirely.

It can do some real damage, put us against the US carriers there, and that the plan calls for them to.

Go after cargo ships and supply vessels and oilers, and the stuff like that, the boring logistical side of war.

If the final effort of our great navy should be spent in engaging a group of empty cargo ships.

02:09:17,300 --> 02:09:21,240
And quote and eto says it prompts.

1827
02:09:21,240 --> 02:09:27,380
The admiral against his will really to call his underlings around him, and he addresses them.

1828
02:09:27,380 --> 02:09:31,180
And he gives another one of these speeches that just to me, it's a tone thing.

1829
02:09:31,180 --> 02:09:33,420
You get a sense of.

1830
02:09:33,420 --> 02:09:33,730
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

1831
02:09:33,730 --> 02:09:36,700
The mood here and as an American, we have no.

1832
02:09:36,700 --> 02:09:37,230
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

1833
02:09:37,230 --> 02:09:46,030
We have no historical analogy, certainly not within living memory to allow us to put ourselves in the emotional shoes, if you will.

1834
02:09:46,030 --> 02:09:51,510
Of someone who's on the losing end of a war that's not necessarily nearer.

1835
02:09:51,510 --> 02:09:56,770
I mean, you have to continue to fight after the decision has happened and how do you do that.

1836
02:09:56,770 --> 02:10:01,730
Well, the emeralds got to rally his sailors, and he said, quote.

1837
02:10:01,730 --> 02:10:02,650
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

1838
02:10:02,650 --> 02:10:10,730
I know that many of you are strongly opposed to this assignment, but the war situation is far more critical than any of you can possibly know.

1839
02:10:10,730 --> 02:10:11,110
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1840
02:10:11,110 --> 02:10:16,740
Would it not be ashamed to have the fleet remain intact while our nation parishes.

1841
02:10:16,740 --> 02:10:22,270
I believe that imperial general headquarters is giving us a glorious opportunity.

1842
02:10:22,270 --> 02:10:26,750
Because I realize how very serious the war situation actually is.

1843
02:10:26,750 --> 02:10:32,150
I am willing to accept even this ultimate assignment to storm into lady gulf.

1844
02:10:32,150 --> 02:10:36,790
You must all remember that there are such things as miracles as.

1845
02:10:36,790 --> 02:10:46,080
What man can say that there is no chance for our fleet to turn the tide of war in a decisive battle, we shall have the chance to meet our enemies.

1846
02:10:46,080 --> 02:10:48,620
We shall engage his task forces.

1847
02:10:48,620 --> 02:10:49,000
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1848
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:52,430
I hope that you will not carry your responsibilities lightly.

1849
02:10:52,430 --> 02:10:57,260
I know that you will act faithfully and well and quote.

1850
02:10:57,260 --> 02:10:57,800
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

1851
02:10:57,800 --> 02:11:11,450
And then eto says the assembled officers raised their arms in unison and yelled ponds eye, well, i'm not going to say that, that admiral is.

1852
02:11:11,450 --> 02:11:13,500
Misinforming his staff.

1853
02:11:13,500 --> 02:11:15,900
But maybe he's being a little disingenuous because.

1854
02:11:15,900 --> 02:11:23,430
The plan is to go after cargo ships and supply ships and those kinds of um non heroic targets.

1855
02:11:23,430 --> 02:11:23,840
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1856
02:11:23,840 --> 02:11:33,910
But there's a an understanding might be a good way to put it that if you run into any American aircraft carriers, you can attack them, so maybe we'll call that an out clause in the plan.

1857
02:11:33,910 --> 02:11:34,530
The plan.

1858
02:11:34,530 --> 02:11:35,370
By the way.

1859
02:11:35,370 --> 02:11:35,890
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

1860
02:11:35,890 --> 02:11:43,080
Is one similar to a naval playing the Japanese tried earlier in the war, essentially in order to get to these cargo ships.

1861
02:11:43,080 --> 02:11:49,110
And these oilers and these supply ships, the Japanese have to lure the warships that are protecting them away.

1862
02:11:49,110 --> 02:12:09,280
So if you think about a defenseless flock of sheep, the Japanese plan here calls for something to be used as bait to try to attract the sheep dog and take them away from the flock, and then the Japanese divided into several separate flotillas coming from several different angles will pounce on the beach head area.

1863
02:12:09,280 --> 02:12:16,610
And each one of these separate flotillas has its own destiny in its own story in the giant battle of lengthy gulf.

1864
02:12:16,610 --> 02:12:16,950
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

1865
02:12:16,950 --> 02:12:21,590
That's why it's really best thought of as 3 to 5, depending on.

1866
02:12:21,590 --> 02:12:22,430
Who you're reading.

1867
02:12:22,430 --> 02:12:23,020
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

1868
02:12:23,020 --> 02:12:25,090
Separate naval battles smaller.

1869
02:12:25,090 --> 02:12:28,240
They all have their own names, by the way, but they're all the separate.

1870
02:12:28,240 --> 02:12:46,080
Leeds and their destinies the Japanese flotilla that is designed to be the bait in this plan is using the very best sort of lure that you can have if you're trying to attract late 1944 admirals.

1871
02:12:46,080 --> 02:12:51,010
Also happens to be the one ship you normally don't want to let the other side find under any conditions.

1872
02:12:51,010 --> 02:12:51,540
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

1873
02:12:51,540 --> 02:12:54,000
It's the Japanese aircraft carriers.

1874
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:54,710
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

1875
02:12:54,710 --> 02:13:21,780
They're going to be the equivalent of the matador's cape in this plan to attract the attention of a bowl, just so happens that the American admiral's nickname is bull admiral bull Halsey, and while if the plan goes as planned, the bull is charging up to the northeast area of Luzon, you know up.

1876
02:13:21,780 --> 02:13:26,750
Far away from the beach heads the other Japanese flip tillers can come in from multiple angles and destroy.

1877
02:13:26,750 --> 02:13:27,180
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1878
02:13:27,180 --> 02:13:29,220
The Americans either you know best.

1879
02:13:29,220 --> 02:13:31,600
Case scenario while they're actually landing.

1880
02:13:31,600 --> 02:13:35,060
But even a couple of days afterwards, you could probably cause great damage, right?

1881
02:13:35,060 --> 02:13:38,590
You got big ships coming in here, although no aircraft carriers.

1882
02:13:38,590 --> 02:13:39,630
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

1883
02:13:39,630 --> 02:13:53,040
But that's the plan, whatever chance these um sailors had in this upcoming event has been whittled away in the previous couple of weeks.

1884
02:13:53,040 --> 02:13:56,570
Because as part of the softening up campaign that.

1885
02:13:56,570 --> 02:13:57,080
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

1886
02:13:57,080 --> 02:13:59,380
Happens before the macarthur landings.

1887
02:13:59,380 --> 02:14:00,110
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

1888
02:14:00,110 --> 02:14:07,060
Can carry your planes have been savaging the entire region, I mean, certainly, everything the floats on the ocean.

1889
02:14:07,060 --> 02:14:26,820
But I mean, going far inland and and hitting facilities, especially airfields, taking out Japanese aircraft at an alarming pace, and it's easy to understand why, by the way, at this point in the war, all of the advantages that the that the Japanese pilots and planes had earlier in the war.

1890
02:14:26,820 --> 02:14:29,830
Our our chip on its head and the Americans have all of those same advantages.

1891
02:14:29,830 --> 02:14:31,180
Now they've got the veteran pilots.

1892
02:14:31,180 --> 02:14:32,970
The Americans have the better machines now.

1893
02:14:32,970 --> 02:14:33,280
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

1894
02:14:33,280 --> 02:14:36,850
So the kill ratios are remarkably one sided, but I mean.

1895
02:14:36,850 --> 02:14:39,570
In one air battle that goes on for several days.

1896
02:14:39,570 --> 02:14:49,980
In the air space above Formosa, which is now Taiwan in the days leading up to macarthur's return to the Philippines, the Japanese lose something like 700 planes.

1897
02:14:49,980 --> 02:14:51,160
[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

1898
02:14:51,160 --> 02:14:55,920
That's according to the encyclopedia of military history in Massachusetts book.

1899
02:14:55,920 --> 02:14:57,970
He quotes one emerald saying, you know.

1900
02:14:57,970 --> 02:15:04,880
We lost 205 planes on Palau right after we lost 345 planes over truck and you.

1901
02:15:04,880 --> 02:15:08,990
Just get this sense of an intense level of grinding at this.

1902
02:15:08,990 --> 02:15:18,700
Point in the war and the Japanese industry can't possibly keep up with these kind of losses and forget about the machines that you're losing for a minute uh in most of these cases, you're losing the pilots.

1903
02:15:18,700 --> 02:15:20,750
[ SPACE 2.1 secs ]

1904
02:15:20,750 --> 02:15:24,480
And the pilots that are going up in these air battles.

1905
02:15:24,480 --> 02:15:25,600
Are often very.

1906
02:15:25,600 --> 02:15:28,560
Very green, and they're going up against American carrier pilots.

1907
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:31,990
That are some of the best aviators the United States has ever produced.

1908
02:15:31,990 --> 02:15:32,470
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

1909
02:15:32,470 --> 02:15:37,680
So when it comes to equipment, the Japanese are now very outclassed in the war.

1910
02:15:37,680 --> 02:15:45,260
The one place they can actually put up a good fight is when it comes to their own people's willingness to fight to the death, and I mean, the land.

1911
02:15:45,260 --> 02:15:51,540
Battles, even with Japanese equipment being inferior with their logistics, a shattered are.

1912
02:15:51,540 --> 02:15:54,410
Still going to be horribly difficult opponents.

1913
02:15:54,410 --> 02:15:56,810
[ SPACE 2.4 secs ]

1914
02:15:56,810 --> 02:16:04,110
But all the batido spirit in the world doesn't make it your aircraft better, right, so they suffer terribly.

1915
02:16:04,110 --> 02:16:14,070
And if the Japanese fleets actions here in the Philippines was a long shot before you lose 700 plains that are supposed to play a very big role in this affair.

1916
02:16:14,070 --> 02:16:24,450
How much more of a long shot is it after you lose them, Winston Churchill in his history, the second world war said that the enemy's air force was broken before the battle of late.

1917
02:16:24,450 --> 02:16:28,070
He was joined speaking of that.

1918
02:16:28,070 --> 02:16:28,560
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

1919
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:40,320
This whole affair is is part of the triphibious operations that surround the the great macarthur returned to the Philippines right, the giant news story that we talked about earlier.

1920
02:16:40,320 --> 02:16:47,130
That happens on October 20th 19, the Americans launched this whole campaign early.

1921
02:16:47,130 --> 02:16:48,980
Make Arthur arrives early the.

1922
02:16:48,980 --> 02:16:53,770
Good news is it catches the Japanese wrong footed, I guess you could say, ah.

1923
02:16:53,770 --> 02:16:56,940
The bad news is the Americans aren't exactly as prepared as they like to be.

1924
02:16:56,940 --> 02:16:58,540
[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]

1925
02:16:58,540 --> 02:17:00,470
But even with all the problems.

1926
02:17:00,470 --> 02:17:04,760
They still manage the absolutely unbelievable task.

1927
02:17:04,760 --> 02:17:07,280
Of landing, more than 100000 people.

1928
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:09,760
By midnight on the first day.

1929
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:10,620
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

1930
02:17:10,620 --> 02:17:11,410
That's amazing.

1931
02:17:11,410 --> 02:17:13,650
I've actually seen a couple of histories, say d plus one.

1932
02:17:13,650 --> 02:17:14,280
Which would be the next.

1933
02:17:14,280 --> 02:17:25,080
Day, but most of them say on the first day, compare and contrast that with the earlier landings in the war, the places like Tarawa, which were a chaotic mess with far fewer.

1934
02:17:25,080 --> 02:17:26,840
People having to be landed.

1935
02:17:26,840 --> 02:17:27,780
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

1936
02:17:27,780 --> 02:17:29,800
Now we should point out there wasn't much.

1937
02:17:29,800 --> 02:17:35,120
Resistance on the beaches the Japanese strategy here is to confront macarthur more inland, where.

1938
02:17:35,120 --> 02:17:37,000
You're out of the range of all the jet, you know.

1939
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:57,920
The big guns that were firing on the beach heads and the plains, but there's some resistance, but 100000 guys by midnight on the first day, that's a well oiled machine at this point in the and the great factory assembly line in the the logistics supply chains and all that boring stuff that the United States is so good at in its corporate peacetime economy.

1940
02:17:57,920 --> 02:18:03,990
Really coming in handy and events like this in mccarthy's total invasion force will.

1941
02:18:03,990 --> 02:18:07,190
Numbers something like 175000 to 200000 men.

1942

[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

1943
02:18:07,810 --> 02:18:11,760
And boy, what a difference a couple of years in the Pacific war, max does it.

[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

1945
02:18:12,100 --> 02:18:16,920
It's no longer the little brother to places like Europe were where the numbers are smaller.

1946
02:18:16,920 --> 02:18:25,240
We're starting to creep up to numbers that they wouldn't sneeze out on the western front, the Japanese resistors, by the way, who are spread out.

1947
02:18:25,240 --> 02:18:31,200
Over a bunch of the different Philippine islands are there, estimated to be between 300 and 350000 men.

1948
02:18:31,200 --> 02:18:32,870
So a large battle indeed.

[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]

1950
02:18:34,250 --> 02:18:42,050
One thing that is worth pointing out is that there are really two kinds of island battles in this war, the kind that have a.

1955
02:18:53,750 --> 02:18:56,390
Not a big civilian population to worry about.

1956
02:18:56,390 --> 02:19:00,570
Saipan, Okinawa, the Philippines just the opposite.

[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

1958
02:19:01,430 --> 02:19:12,180
And we had just talked in the last segment about the disaster, the humanitarian nightmare that Saipan was with civilians jumping off of cliffs and getting caught in the crossfire, and and the high.

1959
02:19:12,180 --> 02:19:13,930
Level of civilian deaths.

Will c y pan's miniature compared to the 15 to 16 million people that live in the Philippines and Okinawa is very.

1962
02:19:22,640 --> 02:19:26,040
Populated in the distance, you can see these.

1963
02:19:26,040 --> 02:19:30,520
Areas that the human being lawnmower is going to just crisscross.

1964
02:19:30,520 --> 02:19:34,050

This is in Asia, but you can see these numbers in the distance, right?

1969
02:19:48,110 --> 02:19:54,050
I mean, wait till the Japanese and the Americans start fighting over the urban center that is, manila in 19.

02:20:14,780 --> 02:20:16,740
Field marshal cap, as he called it.

1976
02:20:16,740 --> 02:20:17,850
[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

1977
02:20:17,850 --> 02:20:25,840
Steps out of the craft gets his pants wet from the knees down in a photo that is so good, you can't believe.

1978
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:26,770
It's not staged.

1979
02:20:26,770 --> 02:20:28,050
I mean, it looks like a poster.

1980
02:20:28,050 --> 02:20:28,410
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

1981
02:20:28,410 --> 02:20:39,930
The camera of people on the shore get him striding back onto Philippine soil a couple of years after he was unceremoniously thrown out of at.

1982
02:20:39,930 --> 02:20:45,670
Some point he'll get his hands on a microphone and say people of the Philippines, I have returned rally.

1983
02:20:45,670 --> 02:20:46,480
To me.

1984
02:20:46,480 --> 02:20:47,470
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

1985
02:20:47,470 --> 02:21:05,550
And he'll begin his campaign to, along with the help of the Filipinos, throw the Japanese out of the Philippines and the first Japanese fleet is not cited for three days and two submarines in the late night hours on October 23rd.

1986
02:21:05,550 --> 02:21:15,730
I think it is spot one of these flotillas, and this is traditionally the beginning of the battle of lati golf, the naval battle of Latin golf.

1987
02:21:15,730 --> 02:21:17,390
[ SPACE 1.7 secs ]

1988
02:21:17,390 --> 02:21:34,690
Put me in the category of those who think that this is a highly overrated battle, although people do for Francis, pike and Hirohito, war says the reason it doesn't get the attention, some of its more vigorous proponents wish that it would is because the stakes aren't that high.

1989
02:21:34,690 --> 02:21:35,480
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

1990
02:21:35,480 --> 02:21:43,750
And he mentioned several other very famous naval battles and that throughout history and talks about how the decision.

1991
02:21:43,750 --> 02:21:45,970
Which way that battle went one way or the other.

1992
02:21:45,970 --> 02:21:48,940
Had huge war changing ramifications.

1993
02:21:48,940 --> 02:21:49,510
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

1994
02:21:49,510 --> 02:21:59,940
And this doesn't I would even suggest that a battle that i've done 45 minutes on before the battle of Jutland, which if it were a boxing match, you would say it ended as a no kind.

1995
02:21:59,940 --> 02:22:01,040
[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

1996
02:22:01,040 --> 02:22:01,250
I.

1997
02:22:01,250 --> 02:22:01,760
Would say that.

1998
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:05,690
That counts as a much more interesting affair, because if one side had.

1999
02:22:05,690 --> 02:22:12,750
Had an overwhelming victory and that was possible, well, that would have been a huge war changing sort of event.

2000
02:22:12,750 --> 02:22:13,790
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

2001
02:22:13,790 --> 02:22:19,120
The best the Japanese can hope for here is to lengthen the war, and if they lengthen the war.

2002
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:29,220
Maybe get a better piece terms, so anybody that is giving their life in this contest is doing this in order to establish well, in this case.

2003
02:22:29,220 --> 02:22:46,020
Keep the imperial system in the emperor right, the imperial policy is it sometimes called because that's the sticking point, but there are a lot of people who look at this battle to something more than an execution, and I don't think i'm one of them, and by that, I mean.

2004
02:22:46,020 --> 02:22:51,030
The battle of lady golf has a couple of things associated with it that sounds really like a big deal.

2005
02:22:51,030 --> 02:23:04,460
For example, you'll hear that it is the greatest naval battle of all time or the largest naval battle of all time, which might be through, but what that kind of conceals is that the United States out numbers the Japanese and warships 4.

2006
02:23:04,460 --> 02:23:06,100
Or 5 to 1.

2007
02:23:06,100 --> 02:23:07,100
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

2008
02:23:07,100 --> 02:23:08,810
They outnumber them in aircraft.

2009
02:23:08,810 --> 02:23:11,540
5 to 1 um.

2010
02:23:11,540 --> 02:23:12,430
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

2011
02:23:12,430 --> 02:23:14,990
The the Japanese have almost no aircraft.

2012
02:23:14,990 --> 02:23:16,080
Capability they.

2013
02:23:16,080 --> 02:23:16,720
Certainly have, oh.

2014
02:23:16,720 --> 02:23:21,660
I mean, it's just this is a very one side of the fair from the get go.

2015
02:23:21,660 --> 02:23:21,940
The.

2016
02:23:21,940 --> 02:23:29,370
Only reason, though it has some drama, you know, it reminds me I have to say i've one of those early Mike Tyson fights where he was knocking out guys in 45 seconds.

2017
02:23:29,370 --> 02:23:38,780
But you bought the paper view, so they always had to have a post fight analysis segment where somebody would have to try to find a way that the other guy might have won.

2018
02:23:38,780 --> 02:23:39,320
You know, oh.

2019
02:23:39,320 --> 02:23:42,550
He tapped him on the chin at the sixteen second mark.

2020
02:23:42,550 --> 02:23:45,520
And if if that had hurt Mike, we had a whole different fight right here.

2021
02:23:45,520 --> 02:23:47,590
And that's kind of how I feel about the battle of late egolf.

2022
02:23:47,590 --> 02:23:48,930
It's a disaster.

2023
02:23:48,930 --> 02:23:50,310
For the Japanese.

2024
02:23:50,310 --> 02:23:52,790
Except a mistake happens at some point.

2025
02:23:52,790 --> 02:23:53,170
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

2026
02:23:53,170 --> 02:23:59,950
In the affair that allows one Japanese flotilla to get into the backfield, you would say if this were football.

2027
02:23:59,950 --> 02:24:00,500
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

2028
02:24:00,500 --> 02:24:09,050
Begin tearing up some escort carriers, and if the escort carriers had all been torn up, could have broken into the a landing area, which might have been vulnerable.

2029
02:24:09,050 --> 02:24:10,020
I mean, there's a lot of mites.

2030
02:24:10,020 --> 02:24:10,480
And what if.

2031
02:24:10,480 --> 02:24:11,090
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

2032
02:24:11,090 --> 02:24:11,930
And that is, history.

2033
02:24:11,930 --> 02:24:18,380
Right, especially military history, but I think sometimes the idea that this would have been catastrophic is overplayed.

2034
02:24:18,380 --> 02:24:19,100
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

2035
02:24:19,100 --> 02:24:28,640
There's a case to be made that if all the worst things that happened in the Japanese fleet started tearing up the beachhead areas, the Duchess would have made them stationary when the American planes eventually.

2036
02:24:28,640 --> 02:24:31,990
Came back and found that and they would have lost even more ships.

2037
02:24:31,990 --> 02:24:33,780
[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]

2038
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:40,970
The bottom line is when the battled lady gulfs over though the Japanese lose four aircraft carriers, three battleships, 10 cruisers, 11 destroyers, and.

2039
02:24:40,970 --> 02:24:41,530
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

2040
02:24:41,530 --> 02:24:42,790
And they sink.

2041
02:24:42,790 --> 02:24:45,400
You know, like a light carrier, they.

2042
02:24:45,400 --> 02:24:48,410
Sink a escort carrier, I mean, it's just a disaster.

2043
02:24:48,410 --> 02:24:51,440
[ SPACE 3.0 secs ]

2044
02:24:51,440 --> 02:24:53,860
One of their fleets gets wiped out in.

2045
02:24:53,860 --> 02:24:55,650
One of the greatest ambush.

2046
02:24:55,650 --> 02:24:59,940
Attacks in naval history were, and it's sort of a little car make retribution a bunch of the.

2047
02:24:59,940 --> 02:25:00,500
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

2048
02:25:00,500 --> 02:25:06,000
Battleships were old world war one type battleships that were damaged at Pearl Harbor were raised.

2049
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:13,730
Refloated, refitted and um, and we're here and and participated in the ambush, I did a lot of damage, but I mean, from.

2050
02:25:13,730 --> 02:25:14,660
An American standpoint.

2051
02:25:14,660 --> 02:25:15,160
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

2052
02:25:15,160 --> 02:25:23,200
You could look at it as a raw, raw moment because it really uh inflicts a defeat on the Japanese Navy that they never recover from in the navy.

2053
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:24,530
The navy will be reduced.

2054
02:25:24,530 --> 02:25:25,360
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

2055
02:25:25,360 --> 02:25:45,970
Um impedence after this, American air power just shredded Japanese naval assets whenever it found it, a lesson that had already been learned several times in this war is reinforced in that by October 1944, if one side has powerful naval assets in the other dozen.

2056
02:25:45,970 --> 02:25:46,790
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

2057
02:25:46,790 --> 02:26:05,940
The way the battle's going to go is pretty much a foregone conclusion, so with the exception of the one fantastic night ambush with the American battleships from Pearl Harbor ended up ah crushing that one Japanese flotilla, the damage is pretty much done by American aircraft.

2058
02:26:05,940 --> 02:26:07,350
[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]

2059
02:26:07,350 --> 02:26:28,160
Just as the Japanese admirals assumed it would be the battle of lay tea, gulf is famous for something else, though it's considered to be the battle where the suicide attacks known as a common cosy attacks first happened in real numbers.

2060
02:26:28,160 --> 02:26:40,620
There may have been some early attacks earlier, and there were definitely suicide attacks with the Japanese all throughout the war, but as an organized, unleashing trained and tactically organized.

2061
02:26:40,620 --> 02:26:45,220
For maximum effect suicide squad, you first see this at lady gulf.

2062
02:26:45,220 --> 02:26:46,230
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

2063
02:26:46,230 --> 02:26:47,570
And John Tolland.

2064
02:26:47,570 --> 02:26:51,020
In his 1970 book the rising sun chronicles.

2065
02:26:51,020 --> 02:27:02,370
One of these early famous attacks, and it's famous because the comicosity came in did some damage, and I try to imagine the Americans watching this as it unfolds, trying to figure out what it is they're seeing and trying to come to grips with.

2066
02:27:02,370 --> 02:27:07,200
Are these guys deliberately trying to smash into us and take their own lives.

2067
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:08,050
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

2068
02:27:08,050 --> 02:27:10,120
The event happens in.

2069
02:27:10,120 --> 02:27:13,700
That one moment in time at the bottle of late gulf.

2070
02:27:13,700 --> 02:27:15,700
Can we say that that the enemy flotillas.

2071
02:27:15,700 --> 02:27:16,150
You know, enemy.

2072
02:27:16,150 --> 02:27:18,960
If you're an American, ah, get into the backfield right there.

2073
02:27:18,960 --> 02:27:19,290
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

2074
02:27:19,290 --> 02:27:21,210
They're they're fighting with these escort carriers.

2075
02:27:21,210 --> 02:27:27,600
And you do have the rather interesting moment where you have the super battleship Yamato for the first time in the war, I believe firing its guns and anger.

2076
02:27:27,600 --> 02:27:28,080
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

2077
02:27:28,080 --> 02:27:35,270
18.1 inch guns shells the size of vaults wagons at American carriers 18 or 19 miles away escort carriers.

2078
02:27:35,270 --> 02:27:37,320
It must be said they were called jeep carriers.

2079
02:27:37,320 --> 02:27:38,620
[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]

2080
02:27:38,620 --> 02:27:43,520
And then about an hour after these Japanese battleships inexplicably.

2081
02:27:43,520 --> 02:27:47,790
Turn away giving the escort carriers after having lost.

2082
02:27:47,790 --> 02:27:48,510
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

2083
02:27:48,510 --> 02:27:55,420
And others damaged a reprieve from the governor, and then something else shows up and Tolland writes quote.

2084
02:27:55,420 --> 02:27:55,950
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

2085
02:27:55,950 --> 02:27:59,930
And by the way, i'm going to add the word escort carrier in front of all these ships that are escort.

2086
02:27:59,930 --> 02:28:00,260
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

2087
02:28:00,260 --> 02:28:03,850
Carriers where he just gives the name it gets confusing quote for.

2088
02:28:03,850 --> 02:28:11,810
Over an hour all was quiet, then at ten fifty general quarters was again sounded on the five surviving jeep carriers.

2089
02:28:11,810 --> 02:28:18,190
9 enemy planes were approaching at mast level, so low that radar had failed to pick them up.

2090
02:28:18,190 --> 02:28:31,440
They climbed to several thousand feet as American fighters tried to intercept 5 0 fighters with bombs lashed to their wings, emerged from the milling mass and slanted down toward the jeeps.

2091
02:28:31,440 --> 02:28:34,400
They were led by a recently married lieutenant commander.

2092
02:28:34,400 --> 02:28:37,370
I hope I pronounce his name correctly Yuki osaki.

2093
02:28:37,370 --> 02:28:37,800
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

2094
02:28:37,800 --> 02:28:48,150
1, 0 toll and rights headed for the bridge of the escort carrier kit coon bay, its machine guns winking onlooker is expected it to pull up.

2095
02:28:48,150 --> 02:29:03,720
Instead, it drove into the port catwalk, exploded and tumbled on into the sea, two others roared straight at the escort carrier fan Shaw bay, also with obvious intent, crashed into her, only to disintegrate at the last moment.

2096
02:29:03,720 --> 02:29:08,240
The final two veered off from the heavy fire thrown up by the escort carrier white.

2097
02:29:08,240 --> 02:29:08,960

Trailing smoke banked toward the escort carrier saint low in a right turn, as if intending to land, but the pilot pushed the little plain over slamming it into the flight deck fire spread throughout the hanger deck, setting off a chain of violent internal explosions after having survived the running battle unscathed, saint low sang.

2101
02:29:33,260 --> 02:29:51,760
And quote, i've been fascinated by this phenomenon of the common causey since I first learned about him as a kid, and I know many of you have been fascinated with them too, and like me, if you've continued to read up on them, your views on them have probably changed 180 degrees too.

2105
02:29:56,090 --> 02:29:58,860
You know, cool aid drinkers who would give.

And now when you read.

Their last letters and their diary entries the whole time that they were training for these missions, but knowing that they were dead.

[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

2116

First of all.

2117
02:30:24,570 --> 02:30:28,890
These are not your hard bitten military men, which I found very interesting when.

2118
02:30:28,890 --> 02:30:30,820
The program was first developed.

2119
02:30:30,820 --> 02:30:35,170
They asked military men to volunteer and do you know how many military men dead.

Who wrote the fabulous book kama kazi, cherry blossoms and nationalisms.

2123
02:30:43,470 --> 02:30:46,270
The number of hard bitten military men that said, yeah.

2124
02:30:46,270 --> 02:30:49,170
I'll volunteer for that suicide mission was none.

2125
02:30:49,170 --> 02:30:50,290
[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

2126
02:30:50,290 --> 02:30:53,170
And she italicized of the word none.

2127
02:30:53,170 --> 02:30:54,210
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

2128
02:30:54,210 --> 02:30:58,650
This is a bit of a problem if you're trying to kick start a brand new program and get people interested in it.

2129
02:30:58,650 --> 02:31:04,450
So apparently, the military just decided to then point to some people and say, okay, you're volunteering, you're volunteering.

2130
02:31:04,450 --> 02:31:12,250
You're volunteering, and one of them was this pilot John Tolland had used in his book Yuki portrayed as this willing, you know.

2131
02:31:12,250 --> 02:31:14,670
Ready to die for the emperor guy turns out.

2132
02:31:14,670 --> 02:31:16,040
Not so willing.

2133
02:31:16,040 --> 02:31:19,430
But that was not news that made it into the propaganda at the time.

2134
02:31:19,430 --> 02:31:22,510
Before he flies off to crash his plane into an enemy.

2135
02:31:22,510 --> 02:31:23,050
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

2136
02:31:23,050 --> 02:31:24,670
He does an interview with a reporter.

2137
02:31:24,670 --> 02:31:30,760
Whose job it is to get the good story for the Japanese propaganda and instead gets a whole bunch of stuff from this pilot.

2138
02:31:30,760 --> 02:31:35,900
That he can't release, he talks about it in a letter decades later.

2139
02:31:35,900 --> 02:31:36,230
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

2140
02:31:36,230 --> 02:31:39,650
But the great Yuki osaki.

2141
02:31:39,650 --> 02:31:41,500
Early comicosity pilot.

2142
02:31:41,500 --> 02:31:44,570
Spat this out to the reporter at the time quote.

2143
02:31:44,570 --> 02:31:45,100
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

2144
02:31:45,100 --> 02:31:58,350
There is no more hope for Japan if it has to kill such a skillful pilot like myself, I can hit an aircraft carrier with an 1102 pound bomb and return alive without having to make a suicidal plunge.

2145
02:31:58,350 --> 02:31:58,680
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

2146
02:31:58,680 --> 02:32:07,000
A new key tyranny then said at that time seckey had been married for only six months to a woman with whom he was passionately in love.

2147
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,030
He explained to the reporter.

2148
02:32:09,030 --> 02:32:10,070
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

2149
02:32:10,070 --> 02:32:18,650
If it is an order, I will go, but I am not going to die for the emperor or for imperial Japan, I am going for my beloved wife.

2150
02:32:18,650 --> 02:32:22,190
If Japan loses, she might be raped by Americans.

2151
02:32:22,190 --> 02:32:27,550
I am dying for some 1 I love most to protect her and quote.

2152
02:32:27,550 --> 02:32:28,920
[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]

2153
02:32:28,920 --> 02:32:32,190
This mirrors what you read from a lot of these pilots.

2154
02:32:32,190 --> 02:32:34,490
Although it should be noted, there were thousands.

2155
02:32:34,490 --> 02:32:39,320
Of them, and they run the gamut in terms of the differences in their background.

2156
02:32:39,320 --> 02:32:49,860
And some of them do seem a little the robotic figures who seem to have been brainwashed into just dying for the emperor and happy to do some of those people fit that mold, but most of them don't.

2157
02:32:49,860 --> 02:32:50,550
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

2158
02:32:50,550 --> 02:32:51,690
What's more.

2159
02:32:51,690 --> 02:32:57,100
Since they can't get the professionals to volunteer to do this, they go after like.

2160
02:32:57,100 --> 02:33:02,110
Cadets and and training pilots and students at the university.

2161
02:33:02,110 --> 02:33:04,490
This is one of the really weird things about this program.

2162
02:33:04,490 --> 02:33:04,810
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

2163
02:33:04,810 --> 02:33:07,210
You can see the nazi Germany regime for.

2164
02:33:07,210 --> 02:33:19,940
Example maybe picking up the Darryl x off the or the people, the undesirables that they've thrown into concentration camps or those kinds of the discredited people and making them the suicide pilots, the Japanese.

2165
02:33:19,940 --> 02:33:21,040
[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

2166
02:33:21,040 --> 02:33:23,510
A lot of these suicide pilots come from.

2167
02:33:23,510 --> 02:33:27,180
Their best and their brightest, the kids at the elite.

2168
02:33:27,180 --> 02:33:41,160
Colleges, really, if you look at them and you read the accounts, they almost seemed like the people that were picked on by all these macho and you know, military types who when they finally show up to become a causes are picked on even more treated like nerds, the four eyes, the.

2169
02:33:41,160 --> 02:33:43,020
Brainy acts of I mean, it's.

2170
02:33:43,020 --> 02:33:44,610
[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]

2171
02:33:44,610 --> 02:33:51,690
It's interesting to read who these people were, though an E And W toll in his book twilight of the gods has a quick rundown, and he writes quote.

2172
02:33:51,690 --> 02:33:52,880
[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

2173
02:33:52,880 --> 02:33:59,180
About half of the comicosity pilots of 1945 have been drawn from the ranks of university students.

2174
02:33:59,180 --> 02:34:07,990
Many were kind, cosmopolitan intellectuals who had been exposed to foreign ideas and influences, including western philosophy and literature.

2175
02:34:07,990 --> 02:34:08,360
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

2176
02:34:08,360 --> 02:34:13,580
These traits had not endeared them to their officers and ncos in military training camps.

2177
02:34:13,580 --> 02:34:35,620
Many young scholars had been singled out for special abuse, including vicious beatings, leaving them with feelings of contempt and loathing for military authority and for the tyrannical regime that held the nation's fate in its grip in diaries and letters, many of these future comic causes identified themselves as political liberals and democrats.

2178
02:34:35,620 --> 02:34:43,960
Some found much to admire in the American model of society and government, others harboured radical utopian pacifist.

2179
02:34:43,960 --> 02:34:46,990
Or even marxist views and quote.

2180
02:34:46,990 --> 02:34:48,760
[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]

2181
02:34:48,760 --> 02:34:52,090
Oh, nuki tyranny runs down the backgrounds of a lot of these people.

2182
02:34:52,090 --> 02:34:52,900
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

2183
02:34:52,900 --> 02:34:55,930
Most of them speak multiple languages, their.

2184
02:34:55,930 --> 02:34:57,230
Reading list would.

2185
02:34:57,230 --> 02:34:59,440
Shame an English professor.

2186
02:34:59,440 --> 02:35:00,010
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

2187
02:35:00,010 --> 02:35:04,730
This is these are the very people you look at is the people who are going to have to rebuild Japan, right?

2188
02:35:04,730 --> 02:35:05,170
If.

2189
02:35:05,170 --> 02:35:11,640
And instead, they're being thrown into the meat grinder, reading the accounts.

2190
02:35:11,640 --> 02:35:12,240
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

2191
02:35:12,240 --> 02:35:14,900
From these people's fascinating first of all.

2192
02:35:14,900 --> 02:35:18,610
They all seem to be patriots, even if they disagree with the government.

2193
02:35:18,610 --> 02:35:19,600
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

2194
02:35:19,600 --> 02:35:21,640
Some of them specifically are.

2195
02:35:21,640 --> 02:35:25,670
Looking forward to helping the postwar Japan emerge.

2196
02:35:25,670 --> 02:35:32,340
A lot of them think about themselves as helping their families back home and trying to make a difference to see that they don't end up bombed or occupied.

2197
02:35:32,340 --> 02:35:33,790
[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]

2198
02:35:33,790 --> 02:35:36,290
Some of the pilots expressed.

2199
02:35:36,290 --> 02:35:39,700
All sorts of worry and remorse about the way their own army.

2200
02:35:39,700 --> 02:35:40,800
Were treating captive.

2201
02:35:40,800 --> 02:35:43,680
Populations, this is not what you'd expect.

2202
02:35:43,680 --> 02:35:45,640
[ SPACE 2.0 secs ]

2203
02:35:45,640 --> 02:35:46,760
I was thinking how.

2204
02:35:46,760 --> 02:35:47,550
Very different.

2205
02:35:47,550 --> 02:35:48,240
This is right.

2206
02:35:48,240 --> 02:35:53,120
How you couldn't expect any other military major military in the second world war to do something like this.

2207
02:35:53,120 --> 02:35:53,500
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

2208
02:35:53,500 --> 02:35:55,760
But the then I was doing some research and I came across.

2209
02:35:55,760 --> 02:36:00,080
I think it was like a letter to the editor or something like that by a person who identified themselves as.

2210
02:36:00,080 --> 02:36:04,450
US marine they didn't say in what era all they had written, though.

2211
02:36:04,450 --> 02:36:11,920
Was if they had found themselves in a situation where their country was about to be occupied, where their government or their military superiors said that they could.

2212
02:36:11,920 --> 02:36:14,160
Reduce the chances of that happening if they be.

2213
02:36:14,160 --> 02:36:21,210
Willing to sacrifice their lives flying their plane into an enemy ship, this person who identified as a US marine, said he would be happy.

2214
02:36:21,210 --> 02:36:21,850
To do that.

2215
02:36:21,850 --> 02:36:26,870
And then I thought to myself, the Japanese are just like everyone else, only more so right, I mean.

2216
02:36:26,870 --> 02:36:28,870
You can kind of see we're all tails from.

2217
02:36:28,870 --> 02:36:29,220
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

2218
02:36:29,220 --> 02:36:31,520
They just took it to levels that in most.

2219
02:36:31,520 --> 02:36:33,830
Societies are theoretical.

2220
02:36:33,830 --> 02:36:34,840
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

2221
02:36:34,840 --> 02:36:38,670
The one part that really got to me the most um.

2222
02:36:38,670 --> 02:36:41,320
Well, there were several, I mean, there was the one about the Christian pilot.

2223
02:36:41,320 --> 02:36:58,290
You forget that there's a sizable Christian population in Japan and and you think of suicide as being prohibited by the religion, but there were Japanese k a makasi pilots who brought their bibles into the cockpit with them tape the photo of their mother to their *****, and when I was reading about this.

2224
02:36:58,290 --> 02:37:03,680
One person that said, what isn't suicide frowned upon by the church, and someone else explained that they just didn't see it as suicide.

2225
02:37:03,680 --> 02:37:04,920
They look at it as.

2226
02:37:04,920 --> 02:37:08,870
The war bringing death to them rather than they seeking it out some.

2227
02:37:08,870 --> 02:37:13,850
Of these, other people were making very rational calculations, because as another historian pointed out.

2228
02:37:13,850 --> 02:37:19,990
They weren't making a choice between a suicide attack that killed them and a wonderful world of rainbows and unicorns, right.

2229
02:37:19,990 --> 02:37:21,050
That wasn't their other option.

2230
02:37:21,050 --> 02:37:22,170
Their other option was probably.

2231
02:37:22,170 --> 02:37:26,440
Dying somewhere else, maybe, um, anonymously your corpse.

2232
02:37:26,440 --> 02:37:30,040
Left in a decaying jungle somewhere, your family never known.

2233
02:37:30,040 --> 02:37:32,680
What even happens to you or you could die a hero.

2234
02:37:32,680 --> 02:37:35,230
And I think I read don't quote me on this that they got the.

2235
02:37:35,230 --> 02:37:37,350
Comicosity products got an immediate increase.

2236
02:37:37,350 --> 02:37:37,660
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

2237
02:37:37,660 --> 02:37:38,760
In two ranks.

2238
02:37:38,760 --> 02:37:40,860
2 military ranks, and if that's the case.

2239
02:37:40,860 --> 02:37:41,200
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

2240
02:37:41,200 --> 02:37:42,940
Well, now it's even a financial decision.

2241
02:37:42,940 --> 02:37:51,050
Right, you can die in a jungle somewhere and your families at one level of poverty, or you could increase the amount of money that the state pays to.

2242
02:37:51,050 --> 02:37:55,350
You know, grieving families and widows for upkeep and all that sort of stuff, um, if.

2243
02:37:55,350 --> 02:37:56,460
You get your rank right, I mean.

2244
02:37:56,460 --> 02:37:58,680
So you start to see actual.

2245
02:37:58,680 --> 02:37:59,620
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

2246
02:37:59,620 --> 02:38:10,940
Maybe thinking going on in some of these decisions, and then one other thing that just moved me was how the the they were supposed to be volunteers, but many historians will use the word volunteer with quotation marks because the circumstances.

2247
02:38:10,940 --> 02:38:11,360
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

2248
02:38:11,360 --> 02:38:17,240
These 20 to 24 year old guys were put in were such that they were forced into moral quandaries.

2249
02:38:17,240 --> 02:38:21,390
And the only people that passed the moral quandaries and became the comicosity pilots.

2250
02:38:21,390 --> 02:38:21,700
In other words.

2251
02:38:21,700 --> 02:38:36,180
The only ones that this strategy worked on, we're sort of the most moral amongst them, for example, that a lot of these volunteer sessions were framed in a way that you understood that if you said no, that you wouldn't volunteer, that meant that your refusal was consigning some.

2252
02:38:36,180 --> 02:38:50,500
Other person to death and a lot of these people couldn't handle that, but the part that moved me the most because it's one of those things I wonder about, I wondered in a show we did on executions once what goes through your mind the night before your own execution.

2253
02:38:50,500 --> 02:38:51,620
This is similar.

2254
02:38:51,620 --> 02:38:52,450
You wonder, okay.

2255
02:38:52,450 --> 02:38:56,660
If you're a comic cozy pilot and you, you know tomorrow's go time.

2256
02:38:56,660 --> 02:38:58,460
What's your last night like.

2257
02:38:58,460 --> 02:39:01,060
And apparently, the last night, we're not spent alone.

2258
02:39:01,060 --> 02:39:03,470
You spent it with the other people that were gonna go with you.

2259
02:39:03,470 --> 02:39:03,770
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

2260
02:39:03,770 --> 02:39:07,240
And in um, oh nuki tierney's book.

2261
02:39:07,240 --> 02:39:15,150
She quotes a guy who wrote all this in a letter decades later to somebody else whose job it was to cater to these pilots on their last night of life.

2262
02:39:15,150 --> 02:39:15,730
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

2263
02:39:15,730 --> 02:39:17,790
And he writes what that was like.

2264
02:39:17,790 --> 02:39:19,650
[ SPACE 1.9 secs ]

2265
02:39:19,650 --> 02:39:23,650
He is identified by the way, as kasuga Takeo.

2266
02:39:23,650 --> 02:39:38,340
And he wrote quote at the hall where their farewell parties were held, the young student officers drank cold socci the night before their flight, some gulped the socket in one swallow, others kept gulping down a large amount.

2267
02:39:38,340 --> 02:39:49,390
The whole place degenerated into chaos, some broke hanging lightbulbs with their swords, some lifted chairs to break and tore white table cloths.

2268
02:39:49,390 --> 02:39:56,920
A mixture of military songs and curses filled the air while some shouted in rage, others cried aloud.

2269
02:39:56,920 --> 02:40:23,930
It was their last night of life they thought of their parents, their faces and images, lovers, faces and their smiles a sad farewell to their fiancees all went through their minds like a running horse lantern, although they were supposedly ready to sacrifice their precious youth the next morning for imperial Japan and for the emperor, they were torn beyond what words can express some putting their heads on the table.

2270
02:40:23,930 --> 02:40:33,980
Some writing their wills, some folding their hands in meditation, some leaving the hall and some dancing in frenzy while breaking flower faces.

2271
02:40:33,980 --> 02:40:41,830
They all took off with the rising sun headband the next morning, but the scene of utter desperation has hardly been reported.

2272
02:40:41,830 --> 02:40:44,770
I observed it with my own eyes as I took care of their daily.

2273
02:40:44,770 --> 02:40:46,190
[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]

2274
02:40:46,190 --> 02:40:51,980
And quote, now I don't know how representative that account is.

2275
02:40:51,980 --> 02:40:52,440
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

2276
02:40:52,440 --> 02:40:55,370
Of the comic cozy last night experiences.

2277
02:40:55,370 --> 02:40:56,450
[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

2278
02:40:56,450 --> 02:40:58,110
There may be different experiences.

2279
02:40:58,110 --> 02:41:05,940
I would imagine there were, and we should also point out that it was hardly just as pilots that these young people.

2280
02:41:05,940 --> 02:41:06,260
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

2281
02:41:06,260 --> 02:41:12,060
Who the government could count on to reliably kill themselves, trying to kill the enemy wasn't just airplanes.

2282
02:41:12,060 --> 02:41:15,830
I mean, they had something known as a human torpedo.

2283
02:41:15,830 --> 02:41:16,270
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

2284
02:41:16,270 --> 02:41:18,200
They had bombs that they dropped.

2285
02:41:18,200 --> 02:41:19,820
I think they may be rocket propelled bombs.

2286
02:41:19,820 --> 02:41:22,560
They dropped from from aircraft that have a human pilot.

2287
02:41:22,560 --> 02:41:29,030
They have motor boats that they load with explosives that designed to be driven into the enemy ships.

2288
02:41:29,030 --> 02:41:35,930
I mean, there's a whole bunch of ingenious ways to utilize the willingness of your young men to kill themselves for the cause.

2289
02:41:35,930 --> 02:41:36,890
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

2290
02:41:36,890 --> 02:41:47,370
But it's this regardless of their positions on the issues and regardless of how much they might dislike the government or whatever it might be, there's a strain of patriotism that runs through these people.

2291
02:41:47,370 --> 02:41:53,820
That's noticeable in all their writings, a love of country that did not always mean a love of emperor or a government or any of these things.

2292
02:41:53,820 --> 02:41:56,120
Sometimes it was just a concept of Japan.

2293
02:41:56,120 --> 02:42:00,210
Or what Japan might be in the future after the war, but one.

2294
02:42:00,210 --> 02:42:11,030
Comicosity, quoted in um omeka or Nokia tyranny book, said that he found quote our love of country to be of frightening intensity.

2295
02:42:11,030 --> 02:42:11,850
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

2296
02:42:11,850 --> 02:42:14,890
And I think that's a great way to put frightening intensity.

2297
02:42:14,890 --> 02:42:17,560
What what happens when you take something that most countries have.

2298
02:42:17,560 --> 02:42:23,880
You know, patriotism on the part of their people and turn it up to an above maximum level, turn it up to 11.

2299
02:42:23,880 --> 02:42:26,190
[ SPACE 2.3 secs ]

2300
02:42:26,190 --> 02:42:33,200
The fact that you would embark on this program, though in 1944 late a sign of the desperate times.

2301
02:42:33,200 --> 02:42:33,700
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

2302
02:42:33,700 --> 02:42:36,870
If you needed to be reminded of that in late November.

2303
02:42:36,870 --> 02:42:58,090
1944 the Japanese will be when the clock finally runs out on them on the Marianas Islands airfield construction timeline because the Cbs working on air fields in the recently conquered islands in the Marianas gets them operational and B 29 super fortresses, the new bombers that are so new.

2304
02:42:58,090 --> 02:43:00,530
They've not been used in Europe or other reasons.

2305
02:43:00,530 --> 02:43:02,830
They were not used in Europe and not used in Europe.

2306
02:43:02,830 --> 02:43:07,460
They will land on these islands and the bombing attacks begin.

2307
02:43:07,460 --> 02:43:08,670
[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

2308
02:43:08,670 --> 02:43:25,360
Japan has been bombed before the due little raids were more of a pin prick for morale purposes, but the B 29 were taking off from areas around the end of China theater, but just barely able to reach the edge of Japanese soil, the raids were not enormous.

2309
02:43:25,360 --> 02:43:26,190
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

2310
02:43:26,190 --> 02:43:27,240
In late November.

2311
02:43:27,240 --> 02:43:35,480
The attacks began and the Japanese will find themselves bombed at times in the capital by more than 100 of these big planes at a time.

2312
02:43:35,480 --> 02:43:37,060
[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]

2313
02:43:37,060 --> 02:43:42,710
These are not known to be particularly effective attacks going after airplane.

2314
02:43:42,710 --> 02:43:45,320
Facilities and things like that, sometimes they get lucky, but most of the.

2315
02:43:45,320 --> 02:43:46,300
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

2316
02:43:46,300 --> 02:43:48,210
Ah, the bombing is inaccurate, but here's.

2317
02:43:48,210 --> 02:43:50,900
Here's the thing from a civilian standpoint.

2318
02:43:50,900 --> 02:43:52,560
Let's just acknowledge something.

2319
02:43:52,560 --> 02:43:54,190
I don't think any of us, well.

2320
02:43:54,190 --> 02:43:57,180
There's probably some of us actually have been under a bombing attack.

2321
02:43:57,180 --> 02:43:59,770
Before and these kind of bombing attacks.

2322
02:43:59,770 --> 02:44:00,150
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

2323
02:44:00,150 --> 02:44:04,190
Some way scarier than ones you might face today, although it depends on whether you're the target.

2324
02:44:04,190 --> 02:44:07,260
Or not, because these bombing attacks have a lot more planes.

2325
02:44:07,260 --> 02:44:09,550
And a lot less accuracy and.

2326
02:44:09,550 --> 02:44:13,600
Part of the reason you have so many more planes is because you are so much less accurate, you.

2327
02:44:13,600 --> 02:44:14,180
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

2328
02:44:14,180 --> 02:44:17,170
Lots of planes and lots of bombs over a wide area to.

2329
02:44:17,170 --> 02:44:18,790
Even hope to hit your target.

2330
02:44:18,790 --> 02:44:19,350
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

2331
02:44:19,350 --> 02:44:24,270
Which they don't often for all sorts of reasons, the jet stream and a bunch of other ones included.

2332
02:44:24,270 --> 02:44:33,190
But that doesn't lessen the fact that if you're a Japanese civilian, maybe a Japanese civilian who's heavily filtered news reports about how the war is going.

2333
02:44:33,190 --> 02:44:33,520
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

2334
02:44:33,520 --> 02:44:38,630
If you have bombs, all of a sudden falling on your capital city and most of the planes that drop.

2335
02:44:38,630 --> 02:45:00,980
Those bombs are getting that puts the credibility of the government's accounts on how the war is going, and rather stark relief, doesn't it, that having been said in terms of concrete results, the early air war here from the Marianas, the bombing of Japan somewhat underwhelming in terms of results.

2336
02:45:00,980 --> 02:45:10,960
The US idea about precision bombing seems to founder on the rocks of Japan's cloudy weather and high winds.

2337
02:45:10,960 --> 02:45:11,770
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

2338
02:45:11,770 --> 02:45:14,746
There's all sorts of reasons that, that might be an issue.

2339
02:45:14,746 --> 02:45:18,280
And in addition to that, they're losing a decent number of planes.

2340
02:45:18,280 --> 02:45:19,180
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

2341
02:45:19,180 --> 02:45:19,700
So.

2342
02:45:19,700 --> 02:45:20,020
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

2343
02:45:20,020 --> 02:45:26,280
Early on, a lot of pressure on the air service to be more effective because things are heating up.

2344
02:45:26,280 --> 02:45:29,750
As you know, we transition from the year 1944 to that terrible year.

2345
02:45:29,750 --> 02:45:32,350
Half year really of 1945.

2346
02:45:32,350 --> 02:45:35,110
The monthly totals of which we led.

2347
02:45:35,110 --> 02:45:37,150
This segment off with, if you recall.

2348
02:45:37,150 --> 02:45:39,160
Because they were so awful, a.

2349
02:45:39,160 --> 02:45:39,610
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

2350
02:45:39,610 --> 02:45:41,990
Lot of pressure on the air service to figure out a way to.

2351
02:45:41,990 --> 02:45:42,300
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

2352
02:45:42,300 --> 02:45:47,720
Increase the pressure on the Japanese to put an end to something that's already over.

2353
02:45:47,720 --> 02:45:53,640
They just have an admitted yet, and the problem here is that even though it's almost over, it's.

2354
02:45:53,640 --> 02:45:57,390
Getting worse, and this defies what's supposed to happen when you have an enemy.

2355
02:45:57,390 --> 02:45:59,230
Who's for all intents and purposes, beaten.

2356
02:45:59,230 --> 02:46:00,150
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

2357
02:46:00,150 --> 02:46:04,140
Who's devoted the natural resources they need, whose troops I mean.

2358
02:46:04,140 --> 02:46:05,980
Starving troops, I mean, all all.

2359
02:46:05,980 --> 02:46:07,500
Over the place you look the Japanese.

2360
02:46:07,500 --> 02:46:11,600
Just look like they're just been battered from pillar to post.

2361
02:46:11,600 --> 02:46:14,180
So this should be getting easier for the.

2362
02:46:14,180 --> 02:46:15,540
I was fighting them, but it's not.

2363
02:46:15,540 --> 02:46:17,700
[ SPACE 2.2 secs ]

2364
02:46:17,700 --> 02:46:30,690
The casualties are getting worse, the civilian casualties are starting to absolutely go through the roof, and if we wanted to think of what's about to happen here in 1945, it's worth thinking about as a whole.

2365
02:46:30,690 --> 02:46:32,370
Instead of this happened, then this happened.

2366
02:46:32,370 --> 02:46:37,240
And this happened because if you're waking up reading your morning paper in the middle of Iowa one day.

2367
02:46:37,240 --> 02:46:39,240
And you're trying to get a handle on the world situation.

2368
02:46:39,240 --> 02:46:53,464
You're going to have updates on the front page from each of these places, either something about to begin and preparations going on or fighting, continuing in this other spot or mopping up operations in this other place, there's there's there's a bunch of things that are not only happening at the same time.

2369
02:46:53,464 --> 02:47:00,850
But drawing and and competing for resources with each other, they're there will never be enough US fleet assets in the area.

2370
02:47:00,850 --> 02:47:04,120
Macarthur will be wanting them just where there will be wanting them in the central Pacific.

2371
02:47:04,120 --> 02:47:08,580
I mean, so all of this is happening at the same time, if you're in the Japanese high command.

2372
02:47:08,580 --> 02:47:17,780
You are being bad incident after incident after incident, and it seems to be having no effect on the main leadership's opinion on.

2373
02:47:17,780 --> 02:47:21,460
Whether or not the worship continue, which is surprising to say the least.

2374
02:47:21,460 --> 02:47:22,430
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

2375
02:47:22,430 --> 02:47:25,400
Start with mc Arthur at the beginning of 1945.

2376
02:47:25,400 --> 02:47:29,800
Mc Arthur makes the leap to the island of Luzon, which is where manila is in the Philippines.

2377
02:47:29,800 --> 02:47:31,000
[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

2378
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:31,240
Nick.

2379
02:47:31,240 --> 02:47:34,950
Arthur is moving quickly because he's convinced and he appears to be right.

2380
02:47:34,950 --> 02:47:35,930
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

2381
02:47:35,930 --> 02:47:51,700
That there are pow camps on the Philippines that have had American and Filipino troops there since macarthur left years before, who are waiting for him to come back, and he wants to rescue them before the Japanese killed their prisoners, which they are doing once again with alarming frequency.

2382
02:47:51,700 --> 02:47:52,790
[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

2383
02:47:52,790 --> 02:47:58,870
The situation in manila will become an unbelievable nightmare that Japanese general who is awesome.

2384
02:47:58,870 --> 02:47:59,240
By the way.

2385
02:47:59,240 --> 02:48:03,480
Mc Arthur up against a good god, but he decides not to defend the city, but.

2386
02:48:03,480 --> 02:48:14,480
There's a naval commander there who's got what we would call if they were United States Marines, they'd be marines, a naval infantry there, something like 15000 of them, and he says, well, i'm staying, and he defends the old city.

2387
02:48:14,480 --> 02:48:18,660
Which is, you know, sort of a colonial concrete stone?

2388
02:48:18,660 --> 02:48:19,380
I mean, it's a.

2389
02:48:19,380 --> 02:48:21,660
It's a rather impregnable place and.

2390
02:48:21,660 --> 02:48:21,970
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

2391
02:48:21,970 --> 02:48:25,570
He gets nailed down in there and.

2392
02:48:25,570 --> 02:48:28,800
We'll have the US fighting house to house in urban.

2393
02:48:28,800 --> 02:48:34,120
Combat of the sort they have not seen in this war at all, and we'll not see again.

2394
02:48:34,120 --> 02:48:34,690
It's probably.

2395
02:48:34,690 --> 02:48:41,910
The sort of fighting they could have expected, though had they gone into Japan in 1946 and invaded the home island.

2396
02:48:41,910 --> 02:48:44,650
[ SPACE 2.7 secs ]

2397
02:48:44,650 --> 02:48:50,270
Forget about the military side of this for a minute, because as expected, right, the US will win here.

2398
02:48:50,270 --> 02:48:56,570
The Japanese will die almost the last man and something like 100000.

2399
02:48:56,570 --> 02:48:58,940
Filipino civilians will die.

2400
02:48:58,940 --> 02:49:00,840
[ SPACE 1.9 secs ]

2401
02:49:00,840 --> 02:49:03,340
When I first saw that number, I knew that knew it was large.

2402
02:49:03,340 --> 02:49:05,680
I thought they were talking about maybe all the civilians.

2403
02:49:05,680 --> 02:49:06,110
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

2404
02:49:06,110 --> 02:49:12,450
That died in the Philippines during this time period, and I actually have seen an account or two that sort of insinuates that, but most of them.

2405
02:49:12,450 --> 02:49:13,380
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

2406
02:49:13,380 --> 02:49:23,180
In this fighting over the the the city of manila, hundred thousand Philippine civilians, ladies and gentlemen, um, that's in a month.

2407
02:49:23,180 --> 02:49:24,500
[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]

2408
02:49:24,500 --> 02:49:29,150
And the stories are amongst some of worst i've ever encountered.

2409
02:49:29,150 --> 02:49:30,500
There's one that I it's.

2410
02:49:30,500 --> 02:49:31,010
Funny, you know.

2411
02:49:31,010 --> 02:49:32,250
I mean, I know we're all a little weird.

2412
02:49:32,250 --> 02:49:39,160
If we listen to this, maybe I don't know, but I have certain eyewitness stories that stay with me and they stay with me.

2413
02:49:39,160 --> 02:49:40,270
[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

2414
02:49:40,270 --> 02:49:44,530
Regularly, I have to go back and reread them, and I have no idea why there's one.

2415
02:49:44,530 --> 02:49:46,720
Story, and i'll have to do a show on this someday.

2416
02:49:46,720 --> 02:49:47,980
If you know the the.

2417
02:49:47,980 --> 02:49:50,310
Mental health will allow me to get through something like that.

2418
02:49:50,310 --> 02:49:54,140
But there's a story involving the einstein's arts group and an eyewitness.

2419
02:49:54,140 --> 02:49:59,790
Who was watching lots and lots and lots of Jewish civilians being lined up and killed over and over.

2420
02:49:59,790 --> 02:50:00,500
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

2421
02:50:00,500 --> 02:50:08,210
And it involved a young woman, and as she passes by the eye witness on the way to her death, she just says to him while pointing to herself.

2422
02:50:08,210 --> 02:50:11,380
24, meaning i'm 24 years old that one kills me.

2423
02:50:11,380 --> 02:50:16,730
I I looked it up last month ago, but there are some scenes from the Philippines that just as a.

2424
02:50:16,730 --> 02:50:17,280
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

2425
02:50:17,280 --> 02:50:21,040
Listen, as a human being, I was gonna say as a father, but let's not patronize everyone else.

2426
02:50:21,040 --> 02:50:29,970
There were certain experiences one can imagine living through and then ones that one can't imagine going on afterwards and the best way to describe.

2427
02:50:29,970 --> 02:50:31,930
And and I don't mean this forum.

2428
02:50:31,930 --> 02:50:32,560
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

2429
02:50:32,560 --> 02:50:35,800
I'm not trying to be gratuitous here.

2430
02:50:35,800 --> 02:50:40,750
It's important to understand what's going on though, and when we use that euphemism of the human.

2431
02:50:40,750 --> 02:50:44,190
Being lawnmower what that means in reality.

2432
02:50:44,190 --> 02:50:44,880
Because this is.

2433
02:50:44,880 --> 02:50:48,010
As we said, something that is remorseless, it's month to month.

2434
02:50:48,010 --> 02:50:59,500
It's uh, it's a reliable tally of people, and this is what those statistics boiled down to on the ground in the book rampage, John M Scott tells the story of.

2435
02:50:59,500 --> 02:51:00,220
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

2436
02:51:00,220 --> 02:51:08,870
Well, I guess ultimately of a family who are rounded up by the Japanese right as their troops are starting to torch the city of manila.

2437
02:51:08,870 --> 02:51:09,240
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

2438
02:51:09,240 --> 02:51:14,710
And this is the sort of stuff mccarthy was worried when he was worried about the pow having something happened to them.

2439
02:51:14,710 --> 02:51:20,160
So Scott's piece starts with these men being rounded up, um taken to this school.

2440
02:51:20,160 --> 02:51:25,830
And then eventually moved out to this canal at night, and they had their hands tied behind their back.

2441
02:51:25,830 --> 02:51:36,310
And the Japanese has a flashlight and they start cutting off the heads of the people in this group has been taken to the canal by flashlight.

2442
02:51:36,310 --> 02:51:40,110
And then when it is the turn of this gentleman that in Scott's book um.

2443
02:51:40,110 --> 02:51:44,990
He's identified as twenty five year old Ricardo San Juan when they get to him.

2444
02:51:44,990 --> 02:51:45,720
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

2445
02:51:45,720 --> 02:51:46,950
They chopped his head.

2446
02:51:46,950 --> 02:51:50,730
Off, but not quite, and I have a picture of him.

2447
02:51:50,730 --> 02:51:59,320
I believe it's him in the book showing you um him years later, and he clearly looks like somebody whose head was almost chopped off.

2448
02:51:59,320 --> 02:52:11,900
That's what it looks like after it heals, but he plays daddy and he lays there and you're thinking to yourself as he's laying around a lot of other decapitated people who were with him alive just one second ago, you're thinking, okay, this is the kind of experience that we'll ruin the rest of your life.

2449
02:52:11,900 --> 02:52:12,400
Don't you.

2450
02:52:12,400 --> 02:52:13,410
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

2451
02:52:13,410 --> 02:52:19,120
But this is where his experience begins to get horrific, and like I said, this is not meant to be gratuitous.

2452
02:52:19,120 --> 02:52:27,530
This is meant to put some context on these enormous numbers like 100000 civilians die in a month while manila is being fought over.

2453
02:52:27,530 --> 02:52:29,290
[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]

2454
02:52:29,290 --> 02:52:34,460
And I do not count these sorts of incidents as collateral damage at all.

2455
02:52:34,460 --> 02:52:35,940
[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]

2456
02:52:35,940 --> 02:52:49,650
This is intentional on someone's part at some level of the command structure, so Scott talks about everything that this poor guy goes through personally and then says quote.

2457
02:52:49,650 --> 02:52:50,220
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

2458
02:52:50,220 --> 02:53:00,190
But the night's terror had only begun the Japanese returned to the same spot with a second group of captives on his belly in the brush recovery.

2459
02:53:00,190 --> 02:53:06,780
San Juan counted 19 women and 27 children among them he saw his 20 five year old wife.

2460
02:53:06,780 --> 02:53:16,880
Virginia, and the couple's three children, four months pregnant at the time, Virginia held the couple's youngest child in her arms, one year old Jose.

2461
02:53:16,880 --> 02:53:24,030
The Japanese had tied the adults together with a long strand of rope looped around the upper left arm of each woman guards.

2462
02:53:24,030 --> 02:53:27,970
Herded the woman into a circle around the children, the Japanese then formed.

2463
02:53:27,970 --> 02:53:29,000
A perimeter around.

2464
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:30,430
[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]

2465
02:53:30,430 --> 02:53:39,620
To San Juan's horror, Scott writes, the soldiers began to bayonet the children and even the infants, including two months old Celia Farda.

2466
02:53:39,620 --> 02:53:41,970
Wrapped in a gray flannel sleep suit.

2467
02:53:41,970 --> 02:53:50,550
Now quoting the eyewitness quote, some of the babies were grabbed from the arms of their mothers and were held by their two hands in mid air by one of the Japanese.

2468
02:53:50,550 --> 02:53:53,390
Soldiers, he later told investigators.

2469
02:53:53,390 --> 02:53:54,340
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

2470
02:53:54,340 --> 02:53:55,480
At that instant.

2471
02:53:55,480 --> 02:53:59,270
He says the executioner would stab them in that position.

2472
02:53:59,270 --> 02:54:11,820
Scott continues quote the origin of violence escalated, hidden in the dark thicket, barely 8 feet away, San Juan watched a soldier plunged his bayonet into the ***** of his five year old son chrysal.

2473
02:54:11,820 --> 02:54:12,780
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

2474
02:54:12,780 --> 02:54:26,840
He heard the boy cry out before he collapsed and died the same soldier then snatched up his infant son Jose that baby of mine, San Juan recalls, was thrown into the air and then caught with the point of a bayonet.

2475
02:54:26,840 --> 02:54:30,300
Those were his words the author continues quote soldiers.

2476
02:54:30,300 --> 02:54:37,780
Likewise killed his three year old daughter chorizo, her name Spanish for heart, but San Juan did not see it.

2477
02:54:37,780 --> 02:54:46,720
That was the only mercy he experienced that night, with the children littered on the ground dead, the Japanese pounced on the mothers with blood soaked bayonet.

2478
02:54:46,720 --> 02:54:52,530
The same soldier who had tried to cut off his head ran his blade through the belly of San Juan pregnant.

2479
02:54:52,530 --> 02:54:54,670
Wife and quote.

[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]

2481
02:54:56,470 --> 02:55:01,320
So if one death is a tragedy and a million deaths.

2482
02:55:01,320 --> 02:55:09,660
A statistic stories like that put a little bit more flashback on the bones of who these numbers were.

2484
02:55:10,720 --> 02:55:16,220

2486
02:55:17,220 --> 02:55:27,090
They're all too common both in your history books and amongst the Japanese, and here's the thing is, if we were talking about something that happened in the biblical era and you said that one.

2487
02:55:27,090 --> 02:55:34,050
Army treated the civilians in areas that had held captive or other soldiers that fell into its hands.

2488
02:55:34,050 --> 02:55:49,350
This way, you'd you'd hardly blink, but its very unusual behaviour in the mid twentieth century by a major power, and while you can certainly find examples that are easily as off the charts as.

2489
02:55:49,350 --> 02:55:55,900
This, with, say the Germans certainly, but I mean, even the red army, maybe even the allies in certain circumstances, the non Soviet allies.

2493
02:56:00,090 --> 02:56:09,270
The Japanese do this over and over and over again in Scott's book, he has a section you know in the index and under the heading of.

2494
02:56:09,270 --> 02:56:17,150
Massacres and atrocities it goes down a whole page in small prints it, and this is just mostly in the Philippines.

There was a massacre behind the shell service station against civilian suspected of guerrilla ties de la salle massacre, fort Santiago seal dungeon.

Over and over and over again, it's fascinating to wonder about this, isn't it.

2503
02:56:48,190 --> 02:56:51,490
There's a book called embracing defeat that is about Japan's coming.

2506
02:56:57,490 --> 02:57:09,520
And one of the things I found interesting when reading was that there was a big backlash amongst the civilians to returning soldiers when these sorts of stories of this kind of behaviour filtered down to the public after.

2507
02:57:09,520 --> 02:57:13,400
The war, obviously they were not getting this during the and.

2508
02:57:13,400 --> 02:57:19,030
There was a backlash that one might compared to the way some Vietnam Veterans were treated.

Mc Arthur will find himself occupied in liberating the Philippines for the rest of the war, now he will declare at certain times that the fighting has ceased in order to basically say I have liberated the Philippines.

2517
02:57:41,240 --> 02:57:42,950
But when the war actually ends.

2518
02:57:42,950 --> 02:57:44,110
There's tens of thousands.

2519
02:57:44,110 --> 02:57:50,730
I think it's like 50000 men still under the same Japanese general who have to give up their arms and surrender, so I would.

2520
02:57:50,730 --> 02:58:10,050
Say that the island wasn't pacified, but mccarthy will continually be fighting there in hard slogging for the rest of the war, as I said, so while that's going on, you now have the determination to take the island of Eugenie, and right afterwards, Okinawa, these places.

2521
02:58:10,050 --> 02:58:19,000
If you look in a mapper are the Japanese um in Hirohito, swore Herbert bick K says that the emperor looked at those areas as a moat.

2523
02:58:19,480 --> 02:58:20,230
And the idea.

2524
02:58:20,230 --> 02:58:27,460
Of course, of the moat is absorb the force of your enemies, charge and weaken them before they get to the castle walls.

2525
02:58:27,460 --> 02:58:29,860
And Okinawa is like a southern area.

2526
02:58:29,860 --> 02:58:37,540
Of the moat and Eugene was like eastern area of the moat, he was a tiny little place.

Having or not having an airfield can make a huge difference.

They're the ultimate strategic location in the middle of the.

2535

It was always hot, meaning active gunfire all the time and explosions going off, people getting killed, left and right, we should remind ourselves that these people had been to other places that are considered to be very bad fights as well, so when they're saying that eugenia's on another level.

I mean, you know, in many ways, everyone's critical of Japanese strategy during the or many other things, but they kind of did keep your eyes on the goal of making the allies have to take these islands position to position to position and take huge casualties.

2574
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:14,820
Doing it in the hopes that they'd get tired of it.

2575
03:02:14,820 --> 03:02:30,440
After all, how many Americans even could find evil jima on a map, how many American boys is it worth to take a place like that, especially if the people back home aren't thinking of many of the larger strategic implications, I mean.

2576
03:02:30,440 --> 03:02:35,580
Eugene is halfway between Saipan and Tokyo, great place for an airfield, lots of reasons.

2577
03:02:35,580 --> 03:02:36,570
You might want it.

2578
03:02:36,570 --> 03:02:38,370
How many boys is it worth?

2579
03:02:38,370 --> 03:02:40,370
[ SPACE 2.0 secs ]

2580
03:02:40,370 --> 03:02:49,180
The marines are going to give more than they thought they would have to, and that's partly why it becomes this great battle in their history.

2581
03:02:49,180 --> 03:02:50,200
It's a crucible.

2582
03:02:50,200 --> 03:02:51,420
[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

2583
03:02:51,420 --> 03:02:55,720
The island has more than 800 positions.

2584
03:02:55,720 --> 03:03:06,100
Pillboxes, bunkers, gun employments, um the tunnels on this island stretch from miles underground, and i've read different accounts.

2585
03:03:06,100 --> 03:03:41,150
I've heard 3 miles 7 miles 10 miles 16 miles, I have no idea which of those is true, but some of them are big enough to drive a fully loaded truck into the commanders is 75 feet deep, has electric lights, is completely protected from all those giant battlefield shells, and his plan is to let the Americans get on the beaches with their three divisions and something like 70000 plus man, and then when everything was crammed and crowded into what would become one of the most congested battlefields in world history.

2586
03:03:41,150 --> 03:03:49,820
If you look at the numbers, right, how many people are on an island 8 miles square ah, then you start dropping giant Mortar rounds on these crowded beaches.

2587
03:03:49,820 --> 03:03:50,480
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

2588
03:03:50,480 --> 03:04:00,480
Which have sand so fine and volcanic that no one can dig in it to give themselves a little shelter, and you start tearing up the people on the beaches.

2589
03:04:00,480 --> 03:04:03,950
I mean, it's something like 2000 casualties right away, bam.

2590
03:04:03,950 --> 03:04:06,060
[ SPACE 2.1 secs ]

2591
03:04:06,060 --> 03:04:10,400
The marines are going to suffer 8000 casualties in the first week.

2592
03:04:10,400 --> 03:04:16,230
Remember, casualties means a wounded, missing, killed prisoners, right, all of it.

2593
03:04:16,230 --> 03:04:17,280
Here's the thing.

2594
03:04:17,280 --> 03:04:29,780
It's easy to sort of forget the whole wounded thing until you start reading these accounts of these veterans and you realize how long ago they're talking about when they talk about being wounded in a place like iwojima.

2595
03:04:29,780 --> 03:04:30,140
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

2596
03:04:30,140 --> 03:04:37,200
And yet they're still blind or they're still in a wheelchair or whatever the injury back then did to them.

2597
03:04:37,200 --> 03:04:59,080
They've lived with the rest of their lives, so whereas one might think about killed and wounded on a very different level and whereas wounded, might mean anything from slightly wounded to grievously did, we should recall the toll that, that takes on people's lives forever afterwards also, and in addition to that, and they mean, needless to say.

2598
03:04:59,080 --> 03:05:05,130
When you think about it for two seconds, but combat produces all sorts of injuries.

2599
03:05:05,130 --> 03:05:05,850
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

2600
03:05:05,850 --> 03:05:30,480
From the physical to the emotional to the spiritual, and often all of them together in Patrick hale of Donald's into the rising sun, he quotes ewa Jim, A veteran from the 5th marine division d, who talks about some fighting that goes on, and then he begins to talk about the next day when he says quote the next day we were attacked again.

2601
03:05:30,480 --> 03:05:37,680
Losing several men killed or wounded every hundred yards, there was another canyon where you had to dig the enemy out.

2602
03:05:37,680 --> 03:05:46,300
One of our comrades was captured by the Japanese and pulled into a cave where they tortured him by splitting his finger webs up to his wrists.

2603
03:05:46,300 --> 03:05:46,670
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

2604
03:05:46,670 --> 03:05:48,880
He was screaming uncontrollably.

2605
03:05:48,880 --> 03:05:57,300
Our lieutenant got so angry, he went in after him and was killed in the process, there was hardly any of us left in the entire company.

2606
03:05:57,300 --> 03:05:58,100
For me.

2607
03:05:58,100 --> 03:06:06,610
I was hit on March 14, my hip joint was shot all the pieces four marines from the Marine Corps band were moving me to the rear.

2608
03:06:06,610 --> 03:06:11,360
And one of the men was killed in the process since the war, he says.

2609
03:06:11,360 --> 03:06:15,200
I've been confined to a wheelchair and have tried to live a good life.

2610
03:06:15,200 --> 03:06:19,430
However, I relive the war every day and the quote.

2611
03:06:19,430 --> 03:06:23,070
[ SPACE 3.6 secs ]

2612
03:06:23,070 --> 03:06:32,130
That's an example of what the wounded in action statistic often boils down to worth bearing in mind.

2613
03:06:32,130 --> 03:06:33,710
[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]

2614
03:06:33,710 --> 03:06:39,180
That's a man who thinks about the war, a war from 70 plus years ago.

2615
03:06:39,180 --> 03:06:39,590
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

2616
03:06:39,590 --> 03:06:50,460
Every single day, right when he wakes up, if you read a lot about these various battles in the Pacific.

2617
03:06:50,460 --> 03:07:00,820
As many of you have, I know you begin to notice similarities and differences, and the differences begin to stand out, so you can differentiate one battle from at e.

2618
03:07:00,820 --> 03:07:09,870
Wow, it's interesting how many of the people on both sides talk about how terrible the wounds are and how, unlike many of these other island battles.

2619
03:07:09,870 --> 03:07:11,190
[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]

2620
03:07:11,190 --> 03:07:16,910
And i've seen all sorts of reasons suggesting why that might be a lot of mortars used, for example.

2621
03:07:16,910 --> 03:07:19,610
In the Japanese, we're using these massive ones.

2622
03:07:19,610 --> 03:07:20,210
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

2623
03:07:20,210 --> 03:07:21,130
I mean, a lot of times.

2624
03:07:21,130 --> 03:07:24,580
Mortars are like 60 millimeter motors, which are they're kind of light mortars.

2625
03:07:24,580 --> 03:07:35,760
These Japanese are using ones that are like 12 inch mortars shooting 750 pound projectiles that have been declared of ash cans.

2626
03:07:35,760 --> 03:07:46,100
Flying ash cans is the way lecture described many refrigerators going so slow as they arc up in the air, you can see them and watch them.

2627
03:07:46,100 --> 03:07:46,770
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

2628
03:07:46,770 --> 03:07:56,260
And then when they blow up, they leave a giant hole in the ground and whatever was anywhere nearby is gone, and there's no place to hide on an island.

2629
03:07:56,260 --> 03:08:13,350
This small everything's within range at no time does the commander allow, although there are some people who do it anyway, the suicidal charges that the Japanese have launched all throughout the war that used up so much of their manpower for no good reason.

2630
03:08:13,350 --> 03:08:13,750
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

2631
03:08:13,750 --> 03:08:23,090
He's keeping his people hiding and their job is to kill Americans, not to get killed charging them.

2632
03:08:23,090 --> 03:08:24,520
[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]

2633
03:08:24,520 --> 03:08:27,570
They have to be methodically taken out.

2634
03:08:27,570 --> 03:08:28,390
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

2635
03:08:28,390 --> 03:08:34,270
One Japanese survivor had said that it was like watching people try to exterminate insects.

2636
03:08:34,270 --> 03:08:39,290
It was just methodical, and if you ever watch film, I was going to say video a film with this stuff.

2637
03:08:39,290 --> 03:08:40,110
That's what it looks like.

2638
03:08:40,110 --> 03:08:45,290
It looks like workmen, a lot of the time, ceiling up caves, blowing up stuff.

2639
03:08:45,290 --> 03:08:52,530
Lots and lots of flame thrower usage um, which turned out to be very important for this because a lot of the time.

2640
03:08:52,530 --> 03:09:14,260
You couldn't get the Japanese out any other way, but the wounds caused by all this equipment are terrible and remarked upon a life magazine reporter, bob Sharad had said, and he's quoted in many of my sources, E And W toll adds some context, though when he writes a quote in the first five days of the battle.

2641
03:09:14,260 --> 03:09:19,050
The marine suffered an average of more than 1200 casualties per day.

2642
03:09:19,050 --> 03:09:40,680
The beaches in the flat terrain around the air fields were strewn with dead shell craters left records of direct hits, some contained the mashed up remains of 10 or 12 marines exploring the terraces above red bob Sharratt observed quote nowhere in the Pacific war had I seen such badly mangled bodies.

2643
03:09:40,680 --> 03:09:51,100
Many were cut squarely in half legs and arms lay 50 feet away from in one spot on the sand, far from the nearest cluster of dead.

2644
03:09:51,100 --> 03:10:14,400
I saw a string of guts 15 feet long, another Sheridan narrative or the same one later I don't know is picked up by Francis pike and Hirohito war Francis pike's account, by the way, picks up after the marines get off the beach on the first day and start moving inland.

2645
03:10:14,400 --> 03:10:32,110
And pike used the word i'd never seen before, so I looked it up, and i'm substituting the ah, the more commonly used term, let's put that way, um, and pike gives his own version of context on the first day and writes quote advancing towards shadowy airport.

2646
03:10:32,110 --> 03:10:40,610
The leading marines were suddenly cut down by concealed underground positions general kuribayashi death machine roared into action.

2647
03:10:40,610 --> 03:11:03,500
It turned into a battle like no other in world war two, Japan's defenders had the advantage over attackers mobility, which characterized the advantage usually afforded the attacker in this situation was entirely nullified in a fight that had to be one hole by hole pill box by pillbox by cave by the end of the first day of fighting.

2648
03:11:03,500 --> 03:11:32,400
600 Americans lay dead and a further 2000 more had been wounded, unusually so some of the highest casualties were engineers of the hundred and 30 third cbs, the western beaches, he writes, were strewn with wrecked machines, body parts and mangled bodies at 5 P M A sickened Keith wheeler told Robert Sherrod of life magazine there's more Helen there than i've seen in the rest of the war put together.

2649
03:11:32,400 --> 03:11:47,500
And quote the noise was almost unbearable, Sherod noted, now quoting sharad, who was an eyewitness to this as the shells burst as they crashed and shrieked one of the wounded rose from his stretcher.

2650
03:11:47,500 --> 03:11:50,570
He rose slowly, bending at the waist.

2651
03:11:50,570 --> 03:11:59,640
His head was bare and his arms were straight and rigid at his side, he sat mouth open and screamed, oh, my god.

2652
03:11:59,640 --> 03:12:11,890
My god, good god almighty, the corporal sobbed into the dirt and the in the book a tomb called iwojima by Dan King.

2653
03:12:11,890 --> 03:12:12,260
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

2654
03:12:12,260 --> 03:12:32,010
Oh, he quotes a Japanese veteran name omagari, who comments on the fact that the marines named one part of Eugene of the meat grind, and king says that, oh, my god could easily understand why the marines called it that saying quote men didn't just die on Eugenia.

2655
03:12:32,010 --> 03:12:32,570
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

2656
03:12:32,570 --> 03:12:36,040
They were ripped apart, torn to shreds and scattered.

2657
03:12:36,040 --> 03:12:40,880
I saw torsos with no limbs, dismembered legs, arms and hands.

2658
03:12:40,880 --> 03:12:45,860
And internal organs splashed onto the rocks and quote the author.

2659
03:12:45,860 --> 03:13:03,760
Then says captain Fred Haynes, later major general Fred hanes, the operations officer for the 28th combat team ah, he says he may have summed it up best when he said quote each day, we learn new ways to die, and these are the American accounts.

2660
03:13:03,760 --> 03:13:17,020
The Japanese accounts are of people who are living, and this is the word you'll see so often like troubled ites underground with virtually no water, the island has virtually no water.

2661
03:13:17,020 --> 03:13:17,680
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

2662
03:13:17,680 --> 03:13:29,820
People who know they're going to die are living amongst the dead and are dealing with any time they come out of their holes, just absolutely overwhelming firepower, but their job.

2663
03:13:29,820 --> 03:13:52,510
We should recall, was always to die, and victory or defeat will be measured by how many Americans they are able to take with them, and they take enough Americans with them to influence public opinion back in the United States, which was a large part of their goal right to get the home front.

2664
03:13:52,510 --> 03:13:55,280
Asking the questions of whether or not all this is worth.

2665
03:13:55,280 --> 03:14:04,080
It reminds me of the Ted offensive in the Vietnam War that wasn't intended to have some stunning victory over South Vietnamese and US forces in the field.

2666
03:14:04,080 --> 03:14:12,370
It was intended to influence public opinion back on the home front to tell those people that you've been told the war is almost over.

2667
03:14:12,370 --> 03:14:15,650
Well, you've been lied to, otherwise how could we do this.

2668
03:14:15,650 --> 03:14:17,240
[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]

2669
03:14:17,240 --> 03:14:25,520
The Japanese are kind of sending the same message back to the United States and the Americans on the home front are hearing it loud and clear.

2670
03:14:25,520 --> 03:14:27,680
[ SPACE 2.2 secs ]

2671
03:14:27,680 --> 03:14:43,000
The Americans take almost 29000 casualties and need more than a month to take an island that's 4 1/2 miles long and two miles wide that most Americans don't even know where it is.

2672
03:14:43,000 --> 03:14:45,060
[ SPACE 2.1 secs ]

2673
03:14:45,060 --> 03:15:08,480
The Japanese, of course, as is their trademark now, and that something that no one else does on a regular basis, lose almost every one again, and between 21 and 22 guys on the island, slightly over 200 will be taken prisoner, and most of those, as usual, are Korean and Taiwanese workers who are generally impressed into service and don't want to be there to begin with.

2674
03:15:08,480 --> 03:15:11,510
[ SPACE 3.0 secs ]

2675
03:15:11,510 --> 03:15:14,000
So here we are with the war seemingly.

2676
03:15:14,000 --> 03:15:35,390
You know, certainly in the end stages here, right, we're approaching Japan proper, and yet the fighting is getting harder and the people back home notice, and they want answers in the wonderful book, implacable photos, historians Waldo henricks and mark olivio write this.

2677
03:15:35,390 --> 03:15:37,840
[ SPACE 2.5 secs ]

2678
03:15:37,840 --> 03:16:01,860
The toll in lives lost on iwojima produced a strong reaction at home and weighed heavily on the minds of those who directed the war on March 15th in the midst of the battle, the navy released an anguished letter it had received from an unidentified woman pleading quote, please, for god's sake, stop sending our finest youth to be murdered places like E O G ma.

2679
03:16:01,860 --> 03:16:03,800
She continued in the latter quote.

2680
03:16:03,800 --> 03:16:12,020
It is too much for boys to stand, she wrote too much for mothers and homes to take it is driving some mothers crazy.

2681
03:16:12,020 --> 03:16:17,360
Why can't objectives be taken in some other way, it is most inhuman and awful.

2682
03:16:17,360 --> 03:16:20,970
Stop, stop end quote.

03:16:20,970 --> 03:16:22,650
[ SPACE 1.7 secs ]

2684
03:16:22,650 --> 03:16:50,720
It's interesting that the navy released that isn't it, but according to these historians and others, a lot of it has to do with an effort to begin to guard the public for what is to come to, they are starting to almost celebrate in advance because the war in Europe against nazi Germany is clearly winding up right, and the defeat is imminent over there, so the tendency is to think yeah.

2685
03:16:50,720 --> 03:16:55,840
Victories near and we can celebrate, and we can stop all this rationing and the boys can come home and the killing can stop, and all that.

2686
03:16:55,840 --> 03:16:56,300
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

2687
03:16:56,300 --> 03:17:05,730
Not the Japanese just inflicted 29000 casualties for tiny little volcanic rock in the middle of nowhere.

2688
03:17:05,730 --> 03:17:08,930
And are not showing any signs of being willing to surrender.

[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]

2690
03:17:10,300 --> 03:17:41,370
And henrickson galaxy right quote, and by the way for a stall, is the secretary of the navy forest stalls willingness to publish the unidentified woman's letter at his acknowledgment that many others like him had been received, suggests that he and his advisers recognized that they were reaching a critical moment in the war as the letters made clear a significant segment of the public was beginning to find the wars caused intolerable just as American forces were drawing closer to Japan.

2691
03:17:41,370 --> 03:17:46,210
Harder fighting lay ahead and that reality had to be confronted directly.

2692
03:17:46,210 --> 03:17:48,330
Forest all seemed to say.

2693
03:17:48,330 --> 03:18:08,460
Towards that end, they write, the armed forces were aiding news real companies in producing more realistic reports of the fighting in Europe and the Pacific during the battle for Eugenie, raw footage was dispatched back to the news real companies in New York and was ready for distribution within two weeks of the initial landings.

The news reels produce from the film displayed the horror of war with disturbing candor Bosley Crowthorne, a writer for the New York Times, observed that the news reels thank heaven are getting tougher.

2696
03:18:22,610 --> 03:18:40,010
They're letting us have it right between the eyes and quote the historians finished by saying quote of particular note crawler added was Pacific fury, the name of a film, a forthcoming film on the capture of PP elle and near by Angkor.

2697
03:18:40,010 --> 03:19:04,690
I think it's anger that looked closely into the faces of the men who fought these battles and thus personalized the strain and suffering they endured, and that was a long quote, and I apologize for that, but I wanted to get the historians to weigh in on this, trying to gauge what a public mood might have been like at a time.

2698
03:19:04,690 --> 03:19:19,690
Like this is something that historians are particularly well suited to do, and um, you know, it's funny how this dovetails, though to the original Japanese concept here when you factored it down to the basic question of who was going to win the war, it was going to be.

2699
03:19:19,690 --> 03:19:26,120
Whoever was willing to suck up more casualties for a bunch of places that really didn't mean that much to Americans.

2700
03:19:26,120 --> 03:19:31,910
It's not like we're talking about the Japanese conquering a US state in North America right then.

2701
03:19:31,910 --> 03:19:35,650
You're going to fight to the death for that, but do Americans care about Eugenie.

2702
03:19:35,650 --> 03:19:38,060
But that much because the Japanese care for it a lot.

2703
03:19:38,060 --> 03:19:42,500
But it's a lot closer to them, isn't it, not only is it the American public, by the way.

2704
03:19:42,500 --> 03:19:46,080
Who's starting to fume a little bit about this and and get a little impatient.

2705
03:19:46,080 --> 03:19:56,410
Especially among people who've lost people or people who are going to lose people in the future of this continues, you're starting to see discord being sound loaded by some of the media outlets.

2706
03:19:56,410 --> 03:20:01,130
I mean, the San Francisco Examiner and newspaper of its own bible, William Randolph hurst.

2707
03:20:01,130 --> 03:20:10,420
Makes the predictable criticism here that this is bad leadership runs a little Monday morning corner backing where they're saying with macarthur was in charge, right?

2708
03:20:10,420 --> 03:20:11,040
He's a genius.

2709
03:20:11,040 --> 03:20:12,530
He's known for saving his troops lives.

2710
03:20:12,530 --> 03:20:14,440
If if he was here, you know.

2711
03:20:14,440 --> 03:20:14,810
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

2712
03:20:14,810 --> 03:20:21,540
In other words, sort of casting blame on this idea that command should have been divided at all, and then anybody but mccarthy should have been in command.

2713
03:20:21,540 --> 03:20:38,650
Now we should point out, though hurst, as a guy who would probably gladly support Douglas mccarthur for the republican nomination for president in the next election, so this is maybe not all it appears to be on the surface, but it's a to sign that people aren't happy with the level of casualties that are being taken.

2714
03:20:38,650 --> 03:20:41,100
And people are wondering whether or not it's worth it either.

2715
03:20:41,100 --> 03:20:43,290
We're not fighting it right, or maybe we shouldn't be fighting it.

[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]

2717
03:20:44,660 --> 03:20:59,590
This is a worrying sign for a country about to see a skyrocketing and the amount of casualties that you have to have in this theater to get this over with, look at what the Russians are starting to take the soviets in their last push towards Berlin.

2718
03:20:59,590 --> 03:21:04,760
It's horrifying, and what the Germans take in the process as well.

2719
03:21:04,760 --> 03:21:06,770
That's what those numbers we started off this segment.

2720
03:21:06,770 --> 03:21:07,640
We're all about.

2721
03:21:07,640 --> 03:21:29,800
It's a meat grinder and um, and they're getting it done in the European theater a couple of months before it's going to happen here in the Pacific, is there a way out of hell here, well, maybe maybe is the key word here because there are different views on ways that the war can be shortened.

2722
03:21:29,800 --> 03:21:30,590
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

2723
03:21:30,590 --> 03:21:51,740
But because there's not enough data for one side or another to whip out there in support of their argument that it becomes sort of a, he said, she said wartime situation, there's a group of people who believe that a weapon already exists that would make the dreaded 1946 invasion of Japan scenario go up in a puff of smoke.

2724
03:21:51,740 --> 03:21:56,060
Become moot instantly, and you wouldn't have to have any more those Ewood gyms.

2725
03:21:56,060 --> 03:22:04,830
This is the sort of weapon that the mother writing that wouldn't take any more of sending our flower of our youth to go die for these meaningless places, well.

2726
03:22:04,830 --> 03:22:24,400
What if you had a way around that problem, what would that be worth to you or to your country or to the allies, there are people who are proponents of the idea that bombing from the air can be decisive in a war, the theory can go either way.

2727
03:22:24,400 --> 03:22:43,270
It's got proponents and opponents, but the best short enunciation of the hypothesis i've ever seen I ran across in g wendy's book war, and he quotes the British head of bomber commands or Arthur Harris, who said during the war, there are a lot of people who say that bombing can never win a war.

2728
03:22:43,270 --> 03:22:43,590
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

2729
03:22:43,590 --> 03:23:02,130
Well, my answer to that is that it has never been tried yet, and we shall see and quote aerial theorists in multiple countries, both axis and allied, have been thinking about this sort of stuff for a now in Germany.

2730
03:23:02,130 --> 03:23:04,980
You're starting to finally see bombing, make a difference.

2731
03:23:04,980 --> 03:23:08,810
It kind of looks in the statistics, and these arguments are still ongoing to that.

2732
03:23:08,810 --> 03:23:24,460
The bombing was sort of something that was a pinprick for Germany for a long time, or that they could work around and then all of a sudden late 1944 early 1945, you reach, like all of us, a cap size moment where it starts to be having a huge impact on things, which let's be fair.

2733
03:23:24,460 --> 03:23:30,190
There were other things happening to the German military that that also would have played into what turns out to be like a.

2734
03:23:30,190 --> 03:23:53,730
You know, systemic failure at a certain point, but let's remember for contextual reasons, what aerial weaponry is doing to Germany laid in the in the book choices under fire a moral dimensions of world war two historian Michael bass rights on February 3rd 1945.

2735
03:23:53,730 --> 03:24:09,510
The US 8 therefore sent 937 bombers and 613 escorting fighters over Berlin, they leveled large parts of the city and killed some 25000 persons on February 14th and 15th.

2736
03:24:09,510 --> 03:24:21,790
800 British and 400 American bombers flew in over Dresden, igniting a firestorm that burned for a week and killed at least 60000 non-combatants and quote.

2737
03:24:21,790 --> 03:24:23,100
[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]

2738
03:24:23,100 --> 03:24:36,940
Now i've seen a much lower casualty figure for Dresden than that, but even if it only killed 25000, only 25000 and this in a country that has relatively sophisticated civil defence facilities, I mean.

2739
03:24:36,940 --> 03:24:38,860
These people are mostly in bomb shelters.

2740
03:24:38,860 --> 03:24:40,020
And you get those kind of casualties.

2741
03:24:40,020 --> 03:24:48,270
How horrible would they be, they were running out in the open, Germany's getting hit multiple times a week.

2742
03:24:48,270 --> 03:24:49,690
And by the end of the war.

2743
03:24:49,690 --> 03:24:58,210
I believe Heidelberg is the only mid to large sized German that isn't decimated by the bomb damage or really completely wiped off the map.

2744
03:24:58,210 --> 03:25:00,360
Go look at photos, it is shocking.

2746
03:25:02,390 --> 03:25:09,680

[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

2748
03:25:10,550 --> 03:25:14,960
This is how total war turns things morally topsy turvy, right.

2749
03:25:14,960 --> 03:25:23,020
Is that the people who are running the B 29 Superfortress is out of the Marianas Island since 1944 bombing Japan.

2750
03:25:23,020 --> 03:25:23,330
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

2751
03:25:23,330 --> 03:25:27,910
They're in trouble for not doing the sort of damage that we just mentioned in Europe.

2752
03:25:27,910 --> 03:25:32,840
But today, people look on that is horrifying, but in a war, if you had.

2753
03:25:32,840 --> 03:25:33,370
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

2754
03:25:33,370 --> 03:25:46,090
I mean, I guarantee you when the allied populations woke up in their newspaper and read about those bombing raids in Germany that I just quoted from Michael bass's book, those are good things to not bad things.

2755
03:25:46,090 --> 03:25:46,430
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

2756
03:25:46,430 --> 03:26:13,810
There's a difference between, you know, they say, in cold blood or in hot blood with murders and crimes wars, hot blood us today, trying to make sense of their decision making is done in cold blood, and it's a A different the idea that the commanders of the American air assets in the marijuana are in trouble for not doing more damage to Japan and not being more effective gives you an idea though of what the priorities are in January 19.

2757
03:26:13,810 --> 03:26:16,220

[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

2759
03:26:16,660 --> 03:26:24,070
You know, shake up the results here and the guy who comes in to do that is one of the famous proponents of aerial bombing.

2760
03:26:24,070 --> 03:26:31,030
He is a guy who is much who is as much of a caricature as Mick Arthur is or general Patton is, and he's not like patent.

2761
03:26:31,030 --> 03:26:31,790
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

2762
03:26:31,790 --> 03:26:40,490
The kind of guy who has those sort of can do um almost heartless toward the enemy sorts of attitudes in war time.

2763
03:26:40,490 --> 03:26:42,830
And then when we go from hot blood to cold blood.

2764
03:26:42,830 --> 03:26:44,260
They look horribly out of place.

2765

[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

2766
03:26:44,810 --> 03:26:50,220
There are a couple of figures in the famous movie doctor strange love mash them together.

2767
03:26:50,220 --> 03:26:57,820
You get one general Curtis lemay, and that's who gets brought in to shake things up with the B 29 super fortresses.

2768
03:26:57,820 --> 03:27:04,310
Oh, incidentally, the most expensive weapon the us paid for for this war.

2769
03:27:04,310 --> 03:27:06,570
I mean, it's the most expensive weapons programming.

2770
03:27:06,570 --> 03:27:22,170
You'll win a trivia contest against people with a line like that, but that puts a lot of pressure on the people that we're out there, risking their reputations to promote this thin right, this is going to this is going to have a decisive impact on the war well in a couple of months of bombing Japan, it hasn't done.

2771
03:27:22,170 --> 03:27:25,430
[ SPACE 3.3 secs ]

2772
03:27:25,430 --> 03:27:44,090
Lumet said after he took over the air assets in the Marianas quote, this outfit has been getting a lot of publicity without having really accomplished a hell of a lot in bombing results, so he changes strategies, adopts doctrines and ideas that have been percolating in the us.

2773
03:27:44,090 --> 03:27:45,160
[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

2774
03:27:45,160 --> 03:27:54,880
Air thinking might be a good way to put it for years now, all the way back to 1939, they were noticing that Japan might be extra vulnerable to the setting of fires from the air.

2775
03:27:54,880 --> 03:27:55,340
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

2776
03:27:55,340 --> 03:28:01,460
They do experiments in 1943, where they build mock up cities of both German and Japanese, so they can test stuff out.

2780
03:28:07,800 --> 03:28:13,570
Who was a proponent of incendiaries right using the mixing in Sunday areas in your in your bomb loads.

2781
03:28:13,570 --> 03:28:29,450
Which is a pretty common thing for most countries to do, by the way, and they burned down the Chinese city of Hankow to deny it to the Japanese and and learned quite a bit about how the Asian construction materials like lots of wood, for example.

2782
03:28:29,450 --> 03:28:43,150
How they could best be set on fire, so when lemay gets to the Marianna and sees the meagre results and the high casualty rates that they've been suffering on these raids to Japan, he changes things up, being he puts a bunch of different things in place.

2783
03:28:43,150 --> 03:28:49,590
Some his own sorts of ideas, others that he grabbed from years of thinking about this amongst American thinkers.

2784

[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

2785
03:28:50,730 --> 03:28:59,470
And he launched a couple of preliminary raids using these new methods, and then he puts it together, uh looks at the data from those smaller raids.

2786
03:28:59,470 --> 03:29:05,330
And then launches one in that is what nightmares are made of.

2790
03:29:15,490 --> 03:29:29,750
About 330 sum B 29 super fortresses take off from the Marianas Islands, heading for Tokyo, they carry a bomb load that it would take 1000 b 17 flying fortresses.

2791
03:29:29,750 --> 03:29:50,690
The big American bomber that flew over Europe, it would take 1000 of them to carry the bomb load of these 330 ish B 20 nines and the bomb load has been tweaked a lot more incendiaries added a certain particular incendiaries with nay palm, which is a relatively new development, certainly in terms of deployment.

2792
03:29:50,690 --> 03:29:52,090
I think they discovered it back in.

2793
03:29:52,090 --> 03:29:53,680
[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]

2794
03:29:53,680 --> 03:30:13,170
But it's jellied gasoline kind of and like so many of the incendiaries used by the major powers in the city second world war, if it splashes on, you just continues to burn, phosphorus is like that, too, you can't put it out very difficult, so these planes are going to come in low.

2795
03:30:13,170 --> 03:30:16,570
Which is against everything they were designed to do.

2796
03:30:16,570 --> 03:30:19,160
This is a fantastically high level bomber.

2797
03:30:19,160 --> 03:30:29,870
The B 29 that offers protection in all kinds of other benefits to bring them in low is to go against the design ideas, but the winds over Japan are crazy.

2798
03:30:29,870 --> 03:30:36,290
The cloud cover is almost constant, and if the planes going at 5000 feet instead of 25000 feet.

2799
03:30:36,290 --> 03:30:59,300
You avoid all those problems the Americans had learned that it is suicidal to do that in a place like Germany with their air defenses, but lame believes you can do it in Japan, especially if you do it at night, because the Japanese Air defenses at night are significantly worse than they are in the daytime.

2800
03:30:59,300 --> 03:31:10,330
The problem with going in at night is you kind of expose the fallacy of the basic idea that Americans celebrate with their bombing doctor, and the Americans are a precision bomber.

2801
03:31:10,330 --> 03:31:11,820
[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]

2802
03:31:11,820 --> 03:31:25,690
They have these great bomb sites and optics, and these tactics that have been developed to try to hit installations and factories and railway yards and infrastructure and things that help the war effort, but not target civilians not bombed indiscriminately over whole areas.

2803
03:31:25,690 --> 03:31:26,310
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

2804
03:31:26,310 --> 03:31:31,520
But in the mid 20th century, precision bombing in the daytime is hit or miss.

2805
03:31:31,520 --> 03:31:37,220
If you'll pardon the pun at night, you're just kidding yourself.

2806
03:31:37,220 --> 03:31:38,320
I mean, you're not even trying.

2807
03:31:38,320 --> 03:31:57,800
It's an area attack at night and to use incendiaries in an area attack at night is to decide that you want to burn down a city, how do you measure the effectiveness, what's a good outcome for you if you launch a bombing raid on a city with the goal of burning it down, you get congratulated.

2808
03:31:57,800 --> 03:32:09,150
If you burn it down, there's not a country in the war that would use in their propaganda or their public statements, the idea that they're deliberately trying to kill civilians.

2809
03:32:09,150 --> 03:32:15,150
Everybody has you know, it's sort of a rationale, logical insanity.

2810
03:32:15,150 --> 03:32:19,860
I think we called it for why they do what they do and what they're targeting.

2811
03:32:19,860 --> 03:32:27,290
The Americans never ever waiver from the public pronouncement that they're going after military targets.

2812
03:32:27,290 --> 03:32:32,690
And they can defend that in Japan because the military targets have all been decentralized.

2813
03:32:32,690 --> 03:32:47,270
I mean, they have a lot of little workshops aiding the defense effort mixed all over Tokyo, one author that I read had called the bombing raid target a classic mixed target, meaning that you had infrastructure.

2814
03:32:47,270 --> 03:33:03,080
Industry and civilians with homes and schools and hospitals all mix together, but in a flammable city, if you can set it on fire and burn everything down, you'll get all those military targets, but you get everything else too.

2815
03:33:03,080 --> 03:33:04,370
[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]

2816
03:33:04,370 --> 03:33:15,210
The March 9th, which will continue into March 10th almost three hour raid by these more than 300 bombers, takes out 16 square miles of Tokyo.

2817
03:33:15,210 --> 03:33:15,880
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

2818
03:33:15,880 --> 03:33:21,240
Remember, this is an experiment, wondering how this is all going to work, I mean.

2819
03:33:21,240 --> 03:33:29,580
For all the main nose, he's going to get tons of planes shot down, and when the results come back in, everyone's overjoyed because this is the most.

2820
03:33:29,580 --> 03:33:30,030
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

2821
03:33:30,030 --> 03:33:33,280
In fact, these B 20 nines have been able to have so far.

2822
03:33:33,280 --> 03:33:39,290
I think in all the raids up till now, they had killed less than 2000 people in Tokyo.

2823
03:33:39,290 --> 03:33:39,770
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

2824
03:33:39,770 --> 03:34:04,000
But in this three hour less than three hour raid, they kill 100000 the US Strategic bombing survey said that quote probably more persons lost their lives by fire in Tokyo in a 6 hour period than at any equivalent period of time in the history of man and court.

03:34:05,140 --> 03:34:06,710
Let that sink in for a minute.

2827
03:34:06,710 --> 03:34:07,600
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

2828
03:34:07,600 --> 03:34:15,780
The worst military attack ever, the most costly, the most damaging and that hundred thousand number is an estimate.

2829
03:34:15,780 --> 03:34:17,220
[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]

2830
03:34:17,220 --> 03:34:20,490
Marius b Jensen thinks it's closer to 120000.

2831
03:34:20,490 --> 03:34:27,610
No one knows the very records that might help shed some light on that burned up in the very fire that took all those lives.

2832
03:34:27,610 --> 03:34:27,930
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

2833
03:34:27,930 --> 03:34:34,870
The number, official injuries of people seeking help and document it was over 40000.

2834
03:34:34,870 --> 03:34:44,870
Many of the statistical surveys I was looking at triple that number, and if you look at photographs of the 16 square miles.

2835
03:34:44,870 --> 03:34:49,010
Something like 40 percent of Tokyo's main area, it's ash.

2836
03:34:49,010 --> 03:34:57,030
I mean, you have brick and stone and metal buildings sprinkled here and there, and you can see the outlines of the roads.

2837
03:34:57,030 --> 03:35:08,610
But everything else looks like the bottom of your barbecue, including the people, the people inside those buildings, by the way, did not find sanctuary.

2838
03:35:08,610 --> 03:35:16,420
Those buildings turned into ovens, and the accounts that are available.

03:35:16,420 --> 03:35:17,070
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

2840
03:35:17,070 --> 03:35:20,490
I mean, sounds like gratuitous stuff to even mention it.

2841
03:35:20,490 --> 03:35:28,920
Uh, i've always wondered about what I always like to call the worst places to be in the world at any given time, right, this battlefield, that disaster site.

2842
03:35:28,920 --> 03:35:43,690
Whatever it might be, and I always, you know, darkly joke that the worst place to be is like a tie for 100 different incidents, but how is this not on in his biography of general Curtis lemay.

2843
03:35:43,690 --> 03:35:58,060
Author Warren CO Zac gives you the rundown of how this goes and the weapons and the technical side of this right, because remember, the Americans are trying to figure out how to be effective with this weapon system.

2844
03:35:58,060 --> 03:36:03,590
They're trying out different um of things, different tactics, strategies, altitudes.

2845
03:36:03,590 --> 03:36:04,110
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

2846
03:36:04,110 --> 03:36:16,730
Bomb loads and and the composition thereof and Kozak rights quote each plane would fly individually in three staggered lines between 5000 and 7000 feet.

2847
03:36:16,730 --> 03:36:42,280
The first planes to take off would fly at slower speeds in order for the later planes to catch up, it would be unlike anything yet seen in the war 3 long lines of bombers coming in at very low altitude, the bombardier's job would be greatly simplified because a small group of plains coming from a different direction would drop incendiaries in the front and back of the target zone before the lines of.

2848
03:36:42,280 --> 03:36:57,660
Bombers arrived similar to lighting up both ends of a football field at night, the plains coming after them from another direction would see the fires that the lead bombers had set and then bombed the area in between the plan, he writes.

2849
03:36:57,660 --> 03:37:01,080
Was brilliant in its simplicity, the human cost.

2850
03:37:01,080 --> 03:37:11,500
He says, would be determined later and quote he continues, lemay decided to drop e 46 clusters, meaning cluster bomb.

2851
03:37:11,500 --> 03:37:20,290
Let's the witnesses said they look like bananas, all clustered on a tree, and then when they were dropped, all the bananas would split off separately.

2852
03:37:20,290 --> 03:37:26,770
I'm sorry, he says, let me decided to drop e 46 clusters that would explode at 2000 feet above the ground.

2853
03:37:26,770 --> 03:37:55,660
Each cluster would release 38 incendiary bombs of napalm and phosphorus, creating a rain of fire over the city in all 8519 clusters would be dropped, releasing 496000 individual cylinder weighing 6 pounds each, resulting in 1665 tons of incendiaries to be dropped on Tokyo that night, and quote.

2854
03:37:55,660 --> 03:37:57,670
[ SPACE 2.0 secs ]

2855
03:37:57,670 --> 03:38:11,970
If there's one thing that has been learned about strategic bombing to this point in the war is that sometimes you get lucky or unlucky, depending on whose point of view we're looking at this.

2856
03:38:11,970 --> 03:38:12,700
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

2857
03:38:12,700 --> 03:38:16,430
Sometimes the climatic conditions are perfect.

2858
03:38:16,430 --> 03:38:19,170
Sometimes you have some wind in the region.

2859
03:38:19,170 --> 03:38:19,590
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

2860
03:38:19,590 --> 03:38:24,680
If everything were to conspire against the civilians in the city.

2861
03:38:24,680 --> 03:38:25,350
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

2862
03:38:25,350 --> 03:38:31,110
The bombs mixed with the wind mixed with the climate and all that could create something called a fire storm.

2863
03:38:31,110 --> 03:38:32,580
[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]

2864
03:38:32,580 --> 03:38:35,680
This happened in Germany several times Dresden.

2865
03:38:35,680 --> 03:39:11,770
We just mentioned hamburg's a famous one, and what that does is take the casualties from something that might be a 6000 or an 8000 or a 12000 dead civilian knight, which sounds horrible and converted into something amplified into something like a 25030 or 35000 dead civilian in his book war military historian Gwen dire had said that if the British bomber command could reliably create these firestorms whenever.

2866
03:39:11,770 --> 03:39:14,180
They wanted to the war would be over in six months.

2867
03:39:14,180 --> 03:39:15,530
[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]

2868
03:39:15,530 --> 03:39:24,820
That sounds like an opinion to me, but it's an interesting idea being able to create these equivalents of a natural disaster writer.

2869
03:39:24,820 --> 03:39:29,630
A global weather oriented disaster, for example.

2870
03:39:29,630 --> 03:39:36,490
A flood of volcanic eruption, a tsunami, something like that right of of a freeze.

2871
03:39:36,490 --> 03:39:46,640
Whatever it might be um to be able to do this as a weapon of war, well, it's interesting to speculate what that might mean for the war effort.

2872
03:39:46,640 --> 03:39:50,600
And that's exactly what people do mean.

2873
03:39:50,600 --> 03:40:06,930
How do you order a raid that might kill 100000 people, how does one live with oneself the way you do it, though, is by telling yourself that you saved even more than that now.

2874
03:40:06,930 --> 03:40:07,750
As in the side.

2875
03:40:07,750 --> 03:40:19,870
Here, i've done more than 10 hours of talking about the logical insanity, ah, the moral logic of strategic bombing as the proponents of that theory, see it.

2876
03:40:19,870 --> 03:40:32,650
I would suggest that the jury is still out that nothing has been decided yet on whether the people who suggest that a shorter war that is nasty or is actually more merciful in humanitarian than a longer war.

2877
03:40:32,650 --> 03:40:33,640
That isn't right.

2878
03:40:33,640 --> 03:40:34,110
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

2879
03:40:34,110 --> 03:40:56,110
The idea being throwing the monkey wrench into the human being lawnmower, right, that anything that short circuits the ever functioning conveyor belt of death here is the greater good in the minds who can manage to sleep at night, ordering the deaths of that many blame said over and over.

2880
03:40:56,110 --> 03:41:03,250
As did a lot of the people he worked with that this was gonna shorten the war and shortening the war was the most important thing.

2881
03:41:03,250 --> 03:41:04,700
[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]

2882
03:41:04,700 --> 03:41:18,210
It is so hard to not judge this sort of action by the standards of now, but what I constantly try to remind myself is that 1945.

2883
03:41:18,210 --> 03:41:18,620
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

2884
03:41:18,620 --> 03:41:22,900
By then, they're not operating by our moral standards anymore.

2885
03:41:22,900 --> 03:41:41,160
There's six years into total war, a war of survival extermination that the very highest possible stakes and all sorts of terrible things done up until this point, I mean, how do you order to burn 100000 people, will you know a little at a time, you work your way up to it.

2886
03:41:41,160 --> 03:41:49,630
We shouldn't forget that the side that's being bombed here were some of the early proponents of bombing cities mean the Germans did it to Warsaw.

2887
03:41:49,630 --> 03:41:50,820
They did it to Rotterdam.

2888
03:41:50,820 --> 03:41:51,180
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

2889
03:41:51,180 --> 03:42:06,380
They did it to Britain for 9 solid heavy months and killed more than 40000 noncombatants in Britain earlier in the war, in 1945, they're launching v 2 rockets at Britain, killing more than or sometime we're around 10000 people with the v 2 s, add the v ones.

2890
03:42:06,380 --> 03:42:07,630
It is more than 10000 people.

2891
03:42:07,630 --> 03:42:17,400
So nothing has stopped the jack bombing Chinese cities and chilling civilians before the second world war even started for most countries, and they were dropping.

2892
03:42:17,400 --> 03:42:33,460
That's remember, I mean, this is a war where the Japanese are infecting fleas with the plague, the plague Basilica, and then dropping that on Chinese cities from the air to see what happens when someone says, how can you drop in sandy areas, they kill 100000 civilians.

2893
03:42:33,460 --> 03:42:38,110
You say you work up to it by 1945.

2894
03:42:38,110 --> 03:42:38,650
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

2895
03:42:38,650 --> 03:42:42,150
The war is at a kind of insane sort of level.

2896
03:42:42,150 --> 03:42:42,540
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

2897
03:42:42,540 --> 03:42:57,890
But nobody feels that all of a sudden killing 100000 people in Tokyo is, you know, tons worse than killing 60000 in Hamburg or 35000 in Dresden and see what happens when when it gets insane.

2898
03:42:57,890 --> 03:43:12,820
We're in crazy territory by 1945, it's easy to forget to that these numbers, which are impossible to conceptualize, involve real people with human experiences on the ground of the sort that are unimaginable.

2899
03:43:12,820 --> 03:43:24,490
Listen to the eye witness accounts or what the historians have to say, historian Conrad c crane in his book bombs, cities and civilians, writes about operation meeting house.

2900
03:43:24,490 --> 03:43:40,420
The March 9th 10th raid on Japan and says quote the selected zone of attack covered six important industrial targets and numerous smaller factories, railroad yards, home industries and cable plants.

2901
03:43:40,420 --> 03:43:50,920
But it also included one of the most densely populated areas in the world, and he goes on to say 135000 people per square mile.

2902
03:43:50,920 --> 03:43:58,980
He continues before operation meeting house was over between 90000 and 100000 people had been killed.

2903
03:43:58,980 --> 03:44:10,560
Most died home horribly as intense heat from the firestorm consumed the oxygen boiled water and canals, and sent liquid glass rolling down the streets.

2904
03:44:10,560 --> 03:44:29,240
Thousands suffocated in shelters or parks, panic crowds crushed victims who had fallen in the streets as they surged towards waterways to escape the flames, perhaps the most terrible incident, he writes, came when 1 b 29 dropped seven tons of incendiaries on and around the crowded.

2905
03:44:29,240 --> 03:44:31,660
I believe it is crocodile bridge.

2906
03:44:31,660 --> 03:44:39,790
Hundreds of people were turned into fiery torches and splashed into the river below in sizzling hisses and quote.

2907
03:44:39,790 --> 03:44:59,440
That's from an eyewitness, one writer, crane says, describe the falling bodies as resembling tent caterpillars that had been burned out of a three tail gunners, crane says were sickened by the sight of hundreds of people burning to death in flaming nail on the surface of the Sumida river.

2908
03:44:59,440 --> 03:45:18,940
A doctor who observed the carnage there later said, quote, you couldn't even tell if the objects floating by were arms and legs or pieces of burnt wood and crane, then says quote B 29 crews fought superheated up drafts that destroyed at least 10 aircraft.

2909
03:45:18,940 --> 03:45:42,150
And wore oxygen masks to avoid vomiting from the stench of burning flesh by the time the attack had ended, almost 16 square miles of Tokyo were burned out, and over 1 million people were homeless, and quote Gwen dire had quoted an eyewitness of one of the fire storms in Germany.

2910
03:45:42,150 --> 03:45:58,530
Who had said that the sound that you hear during it was like an old church organ that was very loud and playing all the notes at once, as we said.

2911
03:45:58,530 --> 03:46:17,610
Generally, the conditions have to contribute to create these sorts of firestorms, and there was already something like a 30 gusting maybe to 40 mile per hour wind in Tokyo when this happens, so that makes it a fire danger already in Tokyo was known as a city prone to fires.

2912
03:46:17,610 --> 03:46:19,330
And Japan had a problem with that.

2913
03:46:19,330 --> 03:46:21,130
Tokyo had a very specific problem with that.

2914
03:46:21,130 --> 03:46:27,460
That's why the US had identified a years before is prone to incendiaries, and it really burns.

2915

[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]

2916
03:46:29,050 --> 03:46:37,350
It creates its own weather just like the firestorms in Dresden and in Hamburg, where the winds start turning into almost a tornado.

2917
03:46:37,350 --> 03:46:50,420
When you read account after account of people being swept away by an invisible hand of wind that just pulls them away and it's it's so bad that you can't see anything because it's blowing pebbles and rocks into your face.

2918
03:46:50,420 --> 03:46:53,250
[ SPACE 2.8 secs ]

2919
03:46:53,250 --> 03:47:06,200
The accounts from some of these German attacks talk about the asphalt melting, and that happens everywhere, so you try to run down the streets and you find yourself sinking in molten asphalt.

2920
03:47:06,200 --> 03:47:09,730
They talk about the wind sucking all the oxygen out of things.

2921
03:47:09,730 --> 03:47:23,270
You'll find these uh air raid shelters in Germany, where everybody's just suffocated the temperature reaches 1800 degrees in the center of some of this fire area.

2922
03:47:23,270 --> 03:47:26,090
And people just start exploding in flame.

2923
03:47:26,090 --> 03:47:35,490
You'll read over and over about people just like matchsticks, explode a lot of people who found them their their avenue escape cut off in every direction.

2924
03:47:35,490 --> 03:47:43,920
Just sat down in the um, one of my sources said faced the imperial palace and waited to die and were found there.

2925
03:47:43,920 --> 03:47:48,890
The photographs are there are not many, but it and the photographs, to be honest.

2926
03:47:48,890 --> 03:47:50,420
The photographs of the bombing ah ah.

2927
03:47:50,420 --> 03:47:54,670
Bodies in in in Europe too are hard to handle.

2928
03:47:54,670 --> 03:47:56,720
We're talking about large piles of bodies.

2929
03:47:56,720 --> 03:48:02,470
And in the Tokyo array, they're all burned, carbonized in the rising sun.

Something that he hopes will protect them from the fire, and they take off trying to get away and tolerance quote, they pushed their way across the bridge to escape the roaring blaze that was pursuing them quote and quote, and like a wild animal, a strong wind sucked into the flames.

2933
03:48:25,480 --> 03:48:42,710
Swept a stinging storm of pebbles into their faces, they turned back to the gale and plodded slowly away from the conflagration, fascinated at the sight of oil drums rocketing through the roof of a cable factory near the river and exploding into balls of fire 100 feet in the air.

2934
03:48:42,710 --> 03:48:52,310
The center of Tokyo, he writes, was as incandescent as the sun billowing clouds of smoke surged up, illuminated below by orange flames.

2938

He wrote a book, um the night Tokyo burned many years ago, where he took some eyewitness accounts and put them together of people who have visualize something that I don't think any of us can imagine.

2942
03:49:34,200 --> 03:49:52,020
The author says they had just gone to this bridge to check out conditions because people were running towards water wherever they could find it, and the author says quote and there they were stunned by the sight of countless dead bodies that lay everywhere they were in a forest of corpses in every direction.

2943
03:49:52,020 --> 03:49:57,060
Bodies were crumpled so closely together that they must have been touching when they died.

2944
03:49:57,060 --> 03:50:03,360
They lay there now mute evidence of the fury, the American attack on Tokyo civil population.

The captain looked out over the echo river and shook his head, what a pitiful situation.

2947
03:50:09,430 --> 03:50:14,920
It was so appalling that it exceeded the imagination's ability to deal with it.

2948
03:50:14,920 --> 03:50:18,090
What could rescuers do in a situation like this.

2949
03:50:18,090 --> 03:50:34,490
There was no one to rescue touch one of the roasted bodies in the flesh would crumble in the hand, humanity reduced to the essential, turned into carbon, and quote the account continues, and this is not to be gratuitous.

2951
03:50:34,930 --> 03:50:49,830
This is to give us an idea of exactly what mankind's capabilities, what our human capabilities have finally achieved, what levels now of damage we can do.

2952
03:50:49,830 --> 03:50:59,880
This is the sort of thing you read about after a giant, you know, act of god, natural disaster type thing, not something that someone targeted at someone.

He then talks about the captain looking at the bank of the river and seeing how the waves that had been wind driven had pushed all of the corpses, he says tens of thousands of them up against the beach and stacked them like cordwood.

2955
03:51:19,680 --> 03:51:42,120
It was this weird sight when you read the accounts of operation meeting house, and the result afterwards, it sounds like the American secretary of war, Henry Stimpson, and the general of the army, George Marshall, were both, who quite bothered by the civilian casualties in the bombings in Europe and the Pacific.

But they seem to be amongst a very small group of people who are not only is this considered to be a better than expected result, but limei will turn the bombers around two days later and do it again and then turn him round a couple of days after that and do him again and will continue to fire bomb Japanese cities until he runs out of incendiaries to use on them.

2958
03:52:11,430 --> 03:52:14,710
And there's a temporary law while they try to, you know.

Get more to his plane, they'd underestimated how many bombing runs that he could do, but he's a taskmaster.

2960
03:52:22,060 --> 03:52:30,010
And he's a guy who gets things done, but he's also very blunt about what war, especially modern war.

2961
03:52:30,010 --> 03:52:35,680
Mid twentieth century war boils down to and he's um again.

03:52:35,680 --> 03:52:52,310
I said earlier a caricature, but not a caricature like a cartoon character, a caricature like a two dimensional figure that doesn't seem like a fully fleshed out human being because the caricature isn't, but the caricature said about the bombing in Tokyo quote.

03:52:53,480 --> 03:52:55,810
This is quoted in Conrad crane's book.

2965
03:52:55,810 --> 03:53:03,440
By the way, a quote we were going after military targets point in slaughtering civilians for the mere sake of slaughter.

2966
03:53:03,440 --> 03:53:07,940
Of course, there's a pretty thin veneer in Japan, but the veneer was there.

2967
03:53:07,940 --> 03:53:11,110
It was their system of dispersal of industry.

2968
03:53:11,110 --> 03:53:30,150
All you had to do was visit one of those targets after we'd roasted it and see the ruins of a multitude of tiny houses with a drill press sticking up through the wreckage of the entire population, got into the act and worked to make those airplanes or munitions of war men, women, children.

2969
03:53:30,150 --> 03:53:44,760
We knew we were going to kill a lot of women and kids when we burned that town had to be done and quote, so how do people that order those kind of things done sleep at night, well.

2970
03:53:44,760 --> 03:54:03,680
Maybe if they have a problem sleeping at night, if they don't figure out some way to end this whole thing by throwing a monkey wrench into the assembly line of death, Warren CO sex biography le mae, he describes a letter that lame described in his memoirs.

2971
03:54:03,680 --> 03:54:06,770
A sticking in his head, something he thought about and ah.

2972
03:54:06,770 --> 03:54:17,240
Kozak says quote in his memoirs, lemay makes more than one reference to a letter that continually wait on him, now quoting the letter quote dear general.

2973
03:54:17,240 --> 03:54:24,150
This is the anniversary of my son Nicky being killed over Hamburg, Berlin, Tokyo, you killed him general.

2974
03:54:24,150 --> 03:54:25,880
I just wanted to remind you of it.

2975
03:54:25,880 --> 03:54:41,920
I'm going to send you a letter each year on the same date, the anniversary of his death to remind you, CO sexton says this quote lima's only way to stop these types of letters from coming was to end the war.

2976
03:54:41,920 --> 03:54:53,250
He rationalized the potentially significant loss of Japanese life on the ground with the following logic, marines were suffering horrendous casualties on i Wajima in a slow.

2977
03:54:53,250 --> 03:54:58,370
Agonizing fighting evidence that the Japanese were becoming even more ferocious.

03:54:58,370 --> 03:55:01,070
The closer Americans came to home islands.

2979
03:55:01,070 --> 03:55:08,820
And unlike the U S or German industry, which was factory centered, Japanese manufacturing was greatly decentralized.

2980
03:55:08,820 --> 03:55:21,940
Individual parts for airplanes, tanks and bombs were produced in homes and in backyards quote this is lemay talking now, no matter how you slice it, you're going to kill an awful lot of civilians.

2981
03:55:21,940 --> 03:55:35,600
Thousands and thousands, but if you don't destroy Japan's capacity to wage war, we're going to have to invade Japan and how many Americans will be killed in an invasion of Japan, 500000 seems to be the lowest estimate.

2982
03:55:35,600 --> 03:55:39,190
Some say a million, we're at war with Japan.

2983
03:55:39,190 --> 03:55:55,910
We were attacked by Japan in 1939, pretty much every major country in the second world war decried the idea of bombing civilians by 1945.

2984
03:55:55,910 --> 03:56:08,160
None of those countries have a moral leg to stand on anymore because either they've already done it themselves or they've done things you might even see and call worse now.

2985
03:56:08,160 --> 03:56:16,740
It is unfair to judge the moral sensibilities of a guy like Curtis Lamai in a vacuum.

2986
03:56:16,740 --> 03:56:36,230
I mean, you have to really try to figure out where he was on the scale of his age and day, how did the general public in the United States feel about this, they overwhelmingly supported it, just like the British public, overwhelmingly supported their bombing campaigns.

2987
03:56:36,230 --> 03:56:43,440
Just like the German public overwhelmingly supported their bombing campaigns, just like the Japanese public, overwhelming supported their bombing campaign.

All of these populations, of course, are having their information constantly pruned and redacted and filters, so that they just get what the government wants them to see, and they're being heavily propagandized to feel a certain way and adopt a certain view that's uniform.

They don't play that side of it up.

They may not even know how many people died.

2996
03:57:23,240 --> 03:57:29,970
It's all about how many structures were burned, how much damage was done to the war effort and all those kind, how many of our own planes got home safe.

What's more, we have to recall the amount of propaganda out there, making sure that people were prepared for this level of commitment and um, nastiness in his book bombs, cities and civilians, Conrad crane quotes a little bit of the dialogue from one of these movies they made in 1944.

[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

3002
03:58:00,180 --> 03:58:03,770
One of those partnership deals between Hollywood and the government, right.

3003
03:58:03,770 --> 03:58:15,790
These are propaganda films or films that have a message that bolsters up the you know home front, and it involved a film with Dana Andrews, who was playing a due little pilot.

3004
03:58:15,790 --> 03:58:29,830
One of those pilots that symbolically bombed Japan back in, got captured and was going to be executed, and so they put these words into his mouth just before they're leading him away to have, I guess, his head cut off the film.

3005
03:58:29,830 --> 03:58:40,420
By the way, was called the purple heart, and this is the kind of dialogue that perhaps one for an air campaign like this, it's true.

3006
03:58:40,420 --> 03:58:46,620
We Americans don't know very much about you Japanese and never did, and now I realize you know.

3007
03:58:46,620 --> 03:58:51,770
Even less about us, you can kill us all of us or part of us.

3008
03:58:51,770 --> 03:59:09,510
But if you think that's going to put the fear of god into the United States of America and stop them from sending other flyers to bomb you, you're wrong dead, wrong, they'll black in your skies and burn down your cities to the ground and make you get down on your knees and beg for mercy.

03:59:09,510 --> 03:59:11,220
This is your war.

And then they lead the hero off, execute him, make you feel extra angry, and you're ready to go.

3015
03:59:27,560 --> 03:59:37,460
Burn down some Japanese cities yourself, those who actually had to do that, though, are to be pitied, there are a lot.

3016
03:59:37,460 --> 03:59:51,330
You know, you never get the stories of people who return just fine, never thought another day about it and moved on, but you do hear the stories of those who were traumatized by lots of tales of people returning back to their base with their clothes.

Gave expression to a feeling that was widely held by Japan's ruling elite at this time, namely, Japan had to be patient and resists surrender no matter what shitty harra had earlier advised, foreign minister shiga meets you that the people would gradually get used to being bomb daily in time.

3028

If we continue to fight back bravely, even if hundreds of thousands of non combatants are killed, injured or starved, even if millions of buildings are destroyed or burned, and then Biggs finishes his thought by saying there would be room to produce a more advantageous international situation for Japan and quote.

We can go to the negotiating table then and not be without something to use to bargain with, right, but way back in February.

3034

Some of the people who um, it's very hard to divine.

3035
04:02:53,840 --> 04:03:11,050
Who was really for peace and who wasn't, but some of the people that are often credited with being more in the peace faction had tried to sway the hardliners, knowing that the hard liner's biggest fear over any eventuality was communism by saying if this keeps up.

3036
04:03:11,050 --> 04:03:15,290
You're going to get the people overthrowing the government and the emperor and everything else.

3037

Allied troops land on Japanese soil on the island of Okinawa and not only the Americans are in on it this time, but elements of the British navy, the British Pacific fleet are there now.

3043
04:03:56,070 --> 04:04:01,200
I mean, Germany almost had it no reason to keep the fleet in the Mediterranean.

3044
04:04:01,200 --> 04:04:25,540
Italy's out of the war, no reason to keep it in the North Sea or the Atlantic, bring it here to the Pacific with those aircraft carriers with the armored flight decks that'll be useful against comicosity attack and help us take the first of the Japanese home islands, although it's you know if he whether you would consider Okinawa one of the home islands, some of the Okinawans wouldn't consider it one of the home islands.

3045
04:04:25,540 --> 04:04:43,390
But it turns out to be a battle that acts as a preview, a version in miniature of what the allies can expect as they continue to move toward Japan, and um, you know, islands like cue shoe.

3048
04:05:00,950 --> 04:05:03,460
They're not fleeing to another part of the country.

3049
04:05:03,460 --> 04:05:20,300
They are stuck there on an island 60 miles long, but only about 10 to 12 miles wide in some spots, and you're talking hundreds of thousands of people more than 100000 Japanese soldiers, more than 100000 American troops.

Staying away from where the big guns can hurt you and are planning to let the Americans come to them, and then they're going to take as many of them with them as they can, but for four or five days, the Americans don't run into anyone by and large.

3062
04:06:29,130 --> 04:06:44,640
I mean, the marines will sweep up toward the north of the island and take a little few of the smaller islands just offshore of okina, the army units, for the most part, will sweep south, and it's not until like the fourth of the 5th of April till they run into the prepared defenses on both ends of the island.

3063
04:06:44,640 --> 04:06:58,110
Especially the south and around the time they do is when the big Japanese suicide air and naval suicide attack, that's meant to be the answer.

3064
04:06:58,110 --> 04:07:08,550
The response to this US Okino invasion hits you get a chance to see how things are going to be amplified as you get closer to the Japanese homeland.

3065
04:07:08,550 --> 04:07:24,310
Which is less than 400 miles away from Okinawa by and what was a trickle, for example, of suicide planes earlier in the war, when they first showed up, becomes an absolute flood at Okinawa, and there's all kinds of suicide things ready at Okinawa.

3066
04:07:24,310 --> 04:07:40,360
The find several hundred speed boats loaded with explosives before they can be used against the Americans, the Japanese will be using a guided bomb um where a person guides the bomb after they drop it from a giant aircraft in this encounter.

3067
04:07:40,360 --> 04:07:55,150
But but the main assaults and damage is going to be carried out by your standard comicosity planes and the new tactics going to be or the tactic, i'm not sure how new it is to mix comma cozy planes in with planes that are doing conventional attacks.

3068
04:07:55,150 --> 04:08:01,910
You know, normal bombers, and so if you're an American anti aircraft gunner, how do you know the difference in who do you shoot at?

3069
04:08:01,910 --> 04:08:04,990
It becomes confusing and there's going to be.

3070
04:08:04,990 --> 04:08:15,710
I think, 10 full on comicosity assaults during the whole Okinawan campaign, but in between the big assaults, you have a single comicosity here or there.

A couple of the pack and in one forty day period.

3072

The US sleep will be hit by some comicosity attack every single day, can't relax for one minute, and it's hard not to look at this as perhaps the first real test of what modern naval combat is going to look like because there hasn't been modern naval combat between 2 first rate naval power since the second world war.

[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

3078
04:08:58,350 --> 04:09:09,020
You know, off the coast of oak when sometimes hundreds of common causes mixed in with hundreds of bombers will show up and attempt to get through the American defensive screen and sink American ships.

3079
04:09:09,020 --> 04:09:10,790
[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]

3080
04:09:10,790 --> 04:09:28,590
They have far more success, setting them on fire than outright sinking them, but they begin to whittle down the American strength and not in a way where you have a danger of the whole fleet being sunk or anything like that, but it's costing a lot of sailors lives who are getting horribly burned, the ones who survive.

3081
04:09:28,590 --> 04:09:36,230
It's taking out a lot of smaller ship and a bunch of American carriers end up getting injured enough to go back for repairs.

3082
04:09:36,230 --> 04:09:37,250
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

3083
04:09:37,250 --> 04:09:45,900
I read one observer who was comparing the fact that the most countries have wooden flight decks, including the Japanese and the Americans, but the British who we had just mentioned.

3084
04:09:45,900 --> 04:09:52,530
Had shown up here with their fleet or one of their fleets, their Pacific fleet and their aircraft carriers have armored flight decks.

3085
04:09:52,530 --> 04:10:00,150
Which cuts down, I guess, on the number of aircraft you can keep on board, so that's a downside, but when the common causes hit it.

3086
04:10:00,150 --> 04:10:05,080
The observer had said that if this happens to an American vessel, it's back to port for six months of repair.

3087
04:10:05,080 --> 04:10:13,900
If it happens to an English British vessel, you just call the sweeper squadron on like i'm going to just hose off the deck here and send this comic cozy.

3088
04:10:13,900 --> 04:10:16,410
What's left of this comic cosy plane right into the ocean.

3089
04:10:16,410 --> 04:10:18,370
[ SPACE 2.0 secs ]

3090
04:10:18,370 --> 04:10:24,840
The Japanese will lose thousands upon thousands of aircraft in the Okinawan campaign.

3091
04:10:24,840 --> 04:10:29,910
I've seen numbers all over the map just going by the encyclopedia of military history.

3092
04:10:29,910 --> 04:10:37,110
Though they claim somewhere north of 7000 somewhere south of 8000 aircraft chewed up in this campaign.

3093
04:10:37,110 --> 04:10:38,310
[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

3094
04:10:38,310 --> 04:10:49,200
But they also manage to sink 36 of the US 5th fleet's ships and damage another 368 more that is not insignificant.

3095
04:10:49,200 --> 04:10:50,170
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

3096
04:10:50,170 --> 04:10:57,930
And we should recall that the Japanese are stockpiling all these kind of things on the home islands for future assaults.

3097
04:10:57,930 --> 04:11:00,100
[ SPACE 2.2 secs ]

3098
04:11:00,100 --> 04:11:17,760
There was a surface component that was supposed to work with these common cosy attacks and the interesting aspect of that is that it involved the super battleship Yamato, whose sistership was sunk a few battles ago, the musashi and neither ship having done much in this war.

3099
04:11:17,760 --> 04:11:39,690
Both ships had every right to be the queen of the seas when they were launched and commissioned only the technological wheel of fortune had passed them by and over the course of several hours, the American aircraft, sometimes 100 at a time, will sink her just as easily as they sunk her sister ship to musashi lots of bombs.

3100
04:11:39,690 --> 04:11:42,520
Lots of torpedoes, but there was nothing to it.

3101
04:11:42,520 --> 04:11:43,720
[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

3102
04:11:43,720 --> 04:11:58,480
The Americans lose between 10 and 15 aircraft, sinking not just the Imada, but the cruiser and the destroyers with it, it's nothing you look at the disparity between what those 10 or 15 aircraft costs the United States in time, labor resources.

3103
04:11:58,480 --> 04:12:02,150
Opportunity cost everything else versus what the Yamato cost.

3104
04:12:02,150 --> 04:12:25,200
The Japanese technology has a way, doesn't it, of taking something that was very valuable not that long ago and making it practically worthless now on April 12, just as things are really starting to get nasty on Okinawa itself in the land combat the American president.

3105
04:12:25,200 --> 04:12:32,990
Who has served more time in office than any other president in American history, dies in that office.

3106
04:12:32,990 --> 04:12:35,130
[ SPACE 2.1 secs ]

3107
04:12:35,130 --> 04:12:40,900
The Roosevelt was famously trying to get little of his strength back in warm springs.

3108
04:12:40,900 --> 04:12:52,150
Georgia when he's having his portrait painted and tells the people in the room that he's got a terrible headache and succumbs very quickly to a cerebral hemorrhage stroke type incident.

3109
04:12:52,150 --> 04:12:53,530
[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]

3110
04:12:53,530 --> 04:12:58,490
This is not a surprise to anyone who was around the man at all.

3111
04:12:58,490 --> 04:13:06,280
You read account after a count after account for a good year before his death that he looks like death is at his door.

3112
04:13:06,280 --> 04:13:18,700
A lot of people thought it was irresponsible for the man to run for his fourth term in office as sick as he obviously, what's more, if you're in the middle of a war, especially.

3113
04:13:18,700 --> 04:13:27,530
And you're a world leader, and you know how sick you are, wouldn't you be really concerned with who your successor that's part of the interesting angle here.

3114
04:13:27,530 --> 04:13:27,830
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

3115
04:13:27,830 --> 04:13:42,460
The president of the United States has only recently picked a new vice president or guys in office for four terms, so long that most of the soldiers on the ground have no memory of any other president in their lives.

3116
04:13:42,460 --> 04:13:42,940
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

3117
04:13:42,940 --> 04:13:50,020
Um, he's got a new vice president as of January 1945, so it's April something like 82 or 83 days.

3118
04:13:50,020 --> 04:13:58,000
He's had this guy, and he's not someone that really anyone knows his name is Harry Truman, and it's interesting.

3119
04:13:58,000 --> 04:13:58,340
Isn't it?

3120
04:13:58,340 --> 04:14:05,670
That of the so called big three allied commanders in the war, you know, allied leaders ah Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin.

3121
04:14:05,670 --> 04:14:15,520
Only Stalin is still in power at the end of the World, Churchill famously gets what he loses the election in July 1945.

3122
04:14:15,520 --> 04:14:16,120
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

3123
04:14:16,120 --> 04:14:22,870
So he has to give up power and Roosevelt dies, and so Harry Truman, who was said to have cried on someone's shoulder.

3124
04:14:22,870 --> 04:14:27,520
Saying, you know that he's not big enough for the job when he hears that it is his job.

3125
04:14:27,520 --> 04:14:29,560
He'll he'll say to Eleanor Roosevelt Franklin.

3126
04:14:29,560 --> 04:14:30,080
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

3127
04:14:30,080 --> 04:14:39,990
So is there anything I can do for you, and she says, is there anything I can do for you, you're the one in trouble now, and Truman himself is written that when he found out he was president.

3128
04:14:39,990 --> 04:14:44,450
And it felt like the whole world stars moon universe fell on top of him.

3129
04:14:44,450 --> 04:14:46,520
[ SPACE 2.1 secs ]

3130
04:14:46,520 --> 04:14:58,780
This is a guy who in his 82 or 83 days as vice president of the United States, met alone with the president of the United States a mere two times.

3131
04:14:58,780 --> 04:15:09,950
And oh, yes, that guy, the guy dying where everyone knew he was dying didn't even mention to the vice president that they've been working on a secret weapon that he might now inherit.

3132
04:15:09,950 --> 04:15:11,040
[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

3133
04:15:11,040 --> 04:15:18,740
It's borderline negligent, and Truman is no Roosevelt.

3134
04:15:18,740 --> 04:15:33,710
If you're gonna take over in war time and especially if you're going to take over at this kind of a critical moment in war time, you'd like to think you have some really August figure and truman's opponents and and people who didn't like him would often call him a failed habitat.

3135
04:15:33,710 --> 04:15:52,220
Sure, he is not someone that when you look at him, you think, okay, this is gonna be one of the really powerful August movers and shakers, but it's going to be up to him on what to do for the rest of the war, and there's going to be some pretty darn big decision.

3136
04:15:52,220 --> 04:15:53,690
As you can imagine.

3137
04:15:53,690 --> 04:15:55,660
[ SPACE 2.0 secs ]

3138
04:15:55,660 --> 04:16:03,410
Actually, the end stages of the second world war, not a good time to be one of the leaders in the second world war on either side.

3139
04:16:03,410 --> 04:16:07,600
Yeah, as we said, Churchill loses an election, he's gone from power.

3140
04:16:07,600 --> 04:16:18,820
Roosevelt dies moose eleni will be executed by partisans on April 28th, Hitler will die um in early may, and Germany will surrender.

3141
04:16:18,820 --> 04:16:23,300
By the way, in early May May 7th May 8th, and there May 8th, really.

3142
04:16:23,300 --> 04:16:25,030
[ SPACE 1.7 secs ]

3143
04:16:25,030 --> 04:16:47,390
So things are clearly winding down, but what this means is in the middle of the Okinawan battle, Japan becomes the only one still fighting the only major power still on the axis side fighting and the fighting is getting more vicious all the time.

3144
04:16:47,390 --> 04:16:47,760
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

3145
04:16:47,760 --> 04:17:04,140
The Japanese have several lines cut across the width of the island, and they're forcing the Americans to take them on head on when you begin to see the kind of combat that reminds one more of the first world war than the second.

3146
04:17:04,140 --> 04:17:10,990
In fact, I think it was E And W toll that referred to Okinawa as a Pacific for done.

3147
04:17:10,990 --> 04:17:13,660
[ SPACE 2.7 secs ]

3148
04:17:13,660 --> 04:17:33,120
If you look at a picture of the Okinawan campaign, especially one taken over at the shoreline in the south, after the fighting has been going on for a while, you'd be hard pressed to say that wasn't the first or battlefield, and that just looks like giant piles of dirt with some roads cut through it, I mean.

3149
04:17:33,120 --> 04:17:37,360
There's nothing green left anywhere, no trees, no stumps, no grass.

3150
04:17:37,360 --> 04:17:49,050
No nothing holes in the ground where the troops are trying desperately not be killed by mortars or artillery shells, and just like the first world war.

3151
04:17:49,050 --> 04:17:58,580
Because the situation is so dangerous that people can't go about their business, including things like going to the latrine in the rear area.

3152
04:17:58,580 --> 04:17:59,130
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

3153
04:17:59,130 --> 04:18:09,910
Everything's stays where it is excrement, trash bodies, and that contributes to something which well.

3154
04:18:09,910 --> 04:18:19,400
In the first world war, it shattered the sensibilities of a lot of the people forced to live in those circumstances and um in with the old breed at pello, Louis and Okinawa.

3155
04:18:19,400 --> 04:18:19,850
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

3156
04:18:19,850 --> 04:18:27,250
EB sledge Eugene sledge was at Okinawa and describes just what it was like over on the and remember.

3157
04:18:27,250 --> 04:18:37,970
Sometime in this conflict, the rain starts and makes everything worse if you're already living in a latrine, what happens when you add water, right?

3158
04:18:37,970 --> 04:18:38,290
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

3159
04:18:38,290 --> 04:18:39,170
And sledge writes.

3160
04:18:39,170 --> 04:18:53,070
Quote everywhere lay Japanese corpses killed in the heavy fighting infantry equipment of every type U S and Japanese was scattered about helmets, rifles, B A R S hacks, cartridge belts.

3161
04:18:53,070 --> 04:18:57,320
Canteen shoes, ammo boxes, shell cases, machine gun.

3162
04:18:57,320 --> 04:19:20,060
Ammo belts, all were strewn up to and all over half moon, that's one of the battle areas, he says, quote the mud was knee deep in some places, probably deeper in others, if one dared venture there for several feet around every corpse, maggots crawled about in the muck and then were washed away by the runoff of the rain.

3163
04:19:20,060 --> 04:19:22,430
There wasn't a tree or Bush left.

3164
04:19:22,430 --> 04:19:29,930
All was open country shells had torn up the turf so completely he writes that ground cover was non-existent.

3165
04:19:29,930 --> 04:19:32,960
The rain poured down on us as evening approached.

3166
04:19:32,960 --> 04:19:50,070
The scene was nothing but mud shell fire flooded craters with their silent, pathetic, rotting occupants, knocked out tanks and amtrak's and discarded equipment uttered desolation, the stench of death, he writes, was overpowering, and quote.

3167
04:19:50,070 --> 04:19:51,310
[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

3168
04:19:51,310 --> 04:20:00,230
How does one deal with that, while sledge says, quote I existed from moment to moment, sometimes thinking death would have been preferable.

3169
04:20:00,230 --> 04:20:16,740
We were in the depths of the abyss, the ultimate horror of war during the fighting around Umar broggle pocket on pello, I had been depressed by the wastage of human lives, but in the mud and driving rain before, surely we were surrounded by maggots and decay.

3170
04:20:16,740 --> 04:20:17,500
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

3171
04:20:17,500 --> 04:20:21,620
Men struggled and fought and bled in an environment so degrading.

3172
04:20:21,620 --> 04:20:34,870
I believed we had been flung into hell's own cesspool, and sledge also describes what happens when they're out there, killing lots of Japanese, which they were.

3173
04:20:34,870 --> 04:20:50,700
And then the shells come in and chew up the bodies that were laying on the ground, which is the environment that the marines and the army groups have to actually live in, and he writes, quote, the situation was bad enough, but when enemy artillery shells exploded in the area.

3174
04:20:50,700 --> 04:21:00,200
The eruptions of soil and mud uncovered previously buried Japanese dead and scattered chunks of corpses like the area around our gun pits.

3175
04:21:00,200 --> 04:21:08,110
The ridge was a stinking compost pile if a marine slipped and slid down the back slope of the muddy ridge, he writes.

3176
04:21:08,110 --> 04:21:10,490
He was apt to reach the bottom vomiting.

3177
04:21:10,490 --> 04:21:21,770
He was I saw more than one man loses footing and slip and slide all the way to the bottom, only to stand up horror stricken as he watched in disbelief, while fat maggots tumbled out of his muddy zhiyun.

3178
04:21:21,770 --> 04:21:31,760
Gary pockets, cartridge belt leggings, lacings and the like, then he and a buddy would shake or scrape them away with a piece of ammo box or a knife blade.

3179
04:21:31,760 --> 04:21:32,130
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

3180
04:21:32,130 --> 04:21:34,290
We didn't talk about such things.

3181
04:21:34,290 --> 04:21:34,800
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

3182
04:21:34,800 --> 04:21:58,340
They were too horrible and obscene, even for hardened veterans, the conditions taxed the toughest I knew almost to the point of screaming, nor do authors normally write about such violence unless they've seen it with their own eyes, it is too preposterous to think that men could actually live and fight for days and nights on end under such terrible conditions and not be driven insane.

3183
04:21:58,340 --> 04:21:58,760
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

3184
04:21:58,760 --> 04:22:11,260
But I saw much of it there on Okinawa, and to me the war was insanity and quote the actual fighting and trying to get people out of caves and defensive positions.

3185
04:22:11,260 --> 04:22:22,270
If you weren't actively involved in the kind of combat, sledge was just talking about was a kind of horrific and extremely dangerous tediousness.

3186
04:22:22,270 --> 04:22:25,060
And E And W toll says quote.

3187
04:22:25,060 --> 04:22:26,140
[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

3188
04:22:26,140 --> 04:22:37,460
It was slow, bloody, treacherous work involving flame throwers, grenades, satchel charges, small arms, bayonets and even knives and bare hands.

3189
04:22:37,460 --> 04:22:44,420
General Buckner, the American commander, referred to these tactics as the blow torch and corkscrew method.

3190
04:22:44,420 --> 04:22:46,740
[ SPACE 2.3 secs ]

3191
04:22:46,740 --> 04:22:57,010
He then goes on to talk about how unbelievably brave and tenacious both sides were in fighting for things like high ground positions.

3192
04:22:57,010 --> 04:23:14,930
Which would often change hands, then change hands has been changed hands again, sometimes ten twelve tall rights quote naval gunfire and air support were valuable in Okinawa, but they never superseded the bravery, initiative and grit of individual infantry units.

3193
04:23:14,930 --> 04:23:20,170
In the end, the soldiers and marines had to dig their enemies out of the ground and kill them.

3194
04:23:20,170 --> 04:23:22,100
There was no other way.

3195
04:23:22,100 --> 04:23:28,960
Rarely could they gain an advantage through flanking maneuvers on the constricted terrain around the shuri ridges.

3196
04:23:28,960 --> 04:23:40,800
Each battalion was wedged into a densely populated section of the line on average 1000 troops for every 600 yards, and the only way to hit the enemy was by frontal assault.

3197
04:23:40,800 --> 04:23:53,080
They might briefly seize control of the top of a facing ridge, but then be driven back by heavy artillery fire from positions farther south or by Japanese infantry counterattack in superior force.

3198
04:23:53,080 --> 04:23:55,060
That was a recurring pattern on Okinawa.

3199
04:23:55,060 --> 04:23:55,430
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

3200
04:23:55,430 --> 04:24:08,540
The high ground often changed hands in a succession of attacks and counterattacks, sometimes as many as a dozen times American and Japanese dead, he writes, were splayed side by side on the battlefield.

3201
04:24:08,540 --> 04:24:21,120
All foliage had been blasted or burned away from the once verdant landscape and the zones between the opposing lines were scarred and denuded wasteland artillery and mortar shells fell relentlessly.

3202
04:24:21,120 --> 04:24:46,960
Shaking the walls of the trenches and foxholes Japanese infiltration attacks were a nightly horror more than on any previous Pacific battlefield infantry men suffered psychotic brakes and had to be evacuated as quote and quote psycho cases, the war correspondent John lardner saw a soldier led away from the front line by two medical Corman, he was uninjured but wide eyed and shrink.

3203
04:24:46,960 --> 04:24:47,720
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

3204
04:24:47,720 --> 04:24:49,210
They'll get every one of you.

3205
04:24:49,210 --> 04:24:57,620
They'll get every one of you and quote, but it's not just the conditions that will drive you crazy here.

3206
04:24:57,620 --> 04:25:07,719
I mean, the soldiers are put in the kind of position that I remember, and I think i've mentioned before the the Vietnam class, which was all the rage when I was in college, they were taught on a lot of campuses.

3207
04:25:07,719 --> 04:25:13,650
And they would bring in these Vietnam Veterans to talk to us military history majors, we military history majors.

3208
04:25:13,650 --> 04:25:14,000
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

3209
04:25:14,000 --> 04:25:28,610
And i'll never forget how often the problems happened when the soldiers were forced to deal with civilians or people that did not fit the mold of what one is preparing themselves to fight in boot camp, and all these other things right.

3210
04:25:28,610 --> 04:25:31,160
And an enemy soldier killer be killed.

3211
04:25:31,160 --> 04:25:52,450
It's different when the enemy soldier is 12 years old or a woman and the hundreds of thousands of civilians on Okinawa made it absolutely impossible to avoid hurting, and I had said earlier that there was nowhere to run that they hadn't been evacuated.

3212
04:25:52,450 --> 04:25:54,130
Actually, some had been evacuated.

3213
04:25:54,130 --> 04:25:56,260
Sometimes something like 80000 have been evacuated.

3214
04:25:56,260 --> 04:25:56,850
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

3215
04:25:56,850 --> 04:26:14,240
There'd been others moved to other parts of the island by the considered to be safer, but several hundred thousand were still in the way and in caves and trying to stay away from the combat, others had been drafted by the Japanese because remembers far as they're concerned, okay now has been under Japanese control for a generation.

3216
04:26:14,240 --> 04:26:18,490
So they impress people into the sort of the home guard.

3217
04:26:18,490 --> 04:26:19,560
[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

3218
04:26:19,560 --> 04:26:22,800
They have a calling them Hitler youth is perhaps not ripe.

3219
04:26:22,800 --> 04:26:28,500
But they have sort of a militant youth organization that has boys 14 to 17 years old, and they get thrown into things.

3220
04:26:28,500 --> 04:26:28,820
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

3221
04:26:28,820 --> 04:26:50,210
Girls 14 to 17 year old who are nurses, nursing students get thrown into this and everybody's going to take casualties in his book the battle for Okinawa survivor and a higher command official, colonel Hiromichi yahara describes running into some of these and girls is the young women.

3222
04:26:50,210 --> 04:26:56,990
I don't know what you would call somebody 1415 16 running into them who are doing work in one of these caves.

3223
04:26:56,990 --> 04:26:57,600
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

3224
04:26:57,600 --> 04:27:23,740
All of them very aware that they're probably on a kind of a suicide mission here, and colonel yahara writes quote during the construction meaning of one of these places, I often visited su casen to encourage the workers young civilians, including many boys and girls, had been conscripted to work on the tunnels and the airfield deep in the tunnel on one of my visits.

3225
04:27:23,740 --> 04:27:38,140
I found several girls repairing a water leak when I praise their effort, one girl stood and said, sweetly quote, we'll do our best until the end and quote, I was deeply touched, he writes by their devotion to duty.

3226
04:27:38,140 --> 04:27:39,350
[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

3227
04:27:39,350 --> 04:27:53,170
The end, of course, means when they all die, a lot of those people will end up being killed by being stuck in the crossfire, just like the soldiers right, dying from artillery or mortars.

3228
04:27:53,170 --> 04:27:53,620
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

3229
04:27:53,620 --> 04:27:59,520
Ah, they will sometimes be trapped in caves with military people, and so everyone dies.

3230
04:27:59,520 --> 04:28:00,150
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

3231
04:28:00,150 --> 04:28:08,010
Sometimes they will be trapped in caves and too afraid that the civilian population is absolutely terrified, just like the people on Saipan were the Americans.

3232
04:28:08,010 --> 04:28:12,770
They've been fed this idea that they're going to be tortured and raped and killed in the most horrible.

3233
04:28:12,770 --> 04:28:13,670
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

3234
04:28:13,670 --> 04:28:26,960
And so they're trying not to surrender to the Americans, but that means that when some American calls out into a cave and says, you know, come on out with your hands up, and no one does they throw a grenade into the cave and keep going a lot of people die that way.

3235
04:28:26,960 --> 04:28:27,400
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

3236
04:28:27,400 --> 04:28:31,440
But the worst is when the civilians.

3237
04:28:31,440 --> 04:28:45,130
Sometimes with Japanese, using them as human shield, sometimes with the Japanese dressed up as civilians trying to get away in a crowd of civilians, we'll usually at night rush American lines, and these soldiers had orders not to let anybody do that.

3238
04:28:45,130 --> 04:28:50,490
For obvious reasons, you might be able to live with yourself for a long time.

3239
04:28:50,490 --> 04:29:16,400
Knowing that you killed an enemy soldier who was trying to kill you, it's a lot harder, as I said about the Vietnam Veterans, when it's someone you're not ready to ever think of yourself, having practiced dissipated in snuffing the lives out of, it's one of the things that creates the extra in Patrick heo Donald's book into the rising sun heat reviews a bunch of marine veterans who talk about these incidents that they remember.

3240
04:29:16,400 --> 04:29:33,600
And you can just see the killing of civilians can sometimes get through the psychological defenses that these soldiers have that might have protected them had they've been able to you know, it was it was me against the other soldier, fair fight.

3241
04:29:33,600 --> 04:29:44,210
It's a little different when something like what happened to Joe mcnamara from the 6th marine division happens, and he's quoted in the book as saying one night, there was a bunch of firing.

3242
04:29:44,210 --> 04:29:46,360
They passed the word, be alert.

3243
04:29:46,360 --> 04:29:48,830
They're coming through the lines the next morning.

3244
04:29:48,830 --> 04:29:54,500
We found out it was the civilians that had tried to come through the lines and they were out in this open field.

3245
04:29:54,500 --> 04:29:59,770
All killed Jesus Christ, dead children, women, old men, they said there.

3246
04:29:59,770 --> 04:30:00,180
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

3247
04:30:00,180 --> 04:30:02,600
Japanese among them, forcing them to go.

3248
04:30:02,600 --> 04:30:10,890
We're putting out pamphlets every day telling them the Okinawan civilians to stay on the main road and not to come through our lines.

3249
04:30:10,890 --> 04:30:12,570
There were a lot of them killed.

3250
04:30:12,570 --> 04:30:15,670
It was horrifying to see dead babies, dead children.

3251
04:30:15,670 --> 04:30:16,000
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

3252
04:30:16,000 --> 04:30:17,790
We didn't have anything to do with it.

3253
04:30:17,790 --> 04:30:21,780
Another group accidentally did it, just the thought of all those people.

3254
04:30:21,780 --> 04:30:22,090
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

3255
04:30:22,090 --> 04:30:27,920
You try to get them the civilians out of the caves also, as we were advancing, we knew they were in there.

3256
04:30:27,920 --> 04:30:29,330
We tried to get them out.

3257
04:30:29,330 --> 04:30:30,480
If we couldn't.

3258
04:30:30,480 --> 04:30:35,020
We didn't know if there were soldiers in there and tossed in hand grenades in a cave.

3259
04:30:35,020 --> 04:30:45,140
You don't know who's in there or what they're doing and what Elmer Mapes of the 6th marine divisions also quoted similar situation.

3260
04:30:45,140 --> 04:30:49,460
Says that they told the people from our Okinawa stay away from the lines you're going to get hurt.

3261
04:30:49,460 --> 04:30:56,550
But he says that the Japanese would put on civilian clothes and try to blend in with the crowds or use them as human shields, as we said, and he says.

3262
04:30:56,550 --> 04:31:04,600
Quote things were quiet for a while when all of a sudden just everything started machine guns, rifles, you could hear the screams.

3263
04:31:04,600 --> 04:31:05,890
I wasn't right next to it.

3264
04:31:05,890 --> 04:31:10,340
I was in a fox hole 20 yards or so away after everything quieted down.

3265
04:31:10,340 --> 04:31:17,340
There was a solitary baby crying just a little tiny baby, no other sound, the baby was crying in the night.

3266
04:31:17,340 --> 04:31:39,850
Every one was dead except his poor little baby there, the mother was probably dead and quote Patrick almond is also quoted and also remembered that same baby, you can see how something like that might pierce the normal psychological defenses that any one who has to face another soldier in combat may have put up right.

3267
04:31:39,850 --> 04:31:50,220
It has a way to get through your emotional armor, one of the things almond said, though, was running into a sniper who was just a child.

3268
04:31:50,220 --> 04:31:56,780
And he says, quote, the only thing I really vividly remember was this particular sniper.

3269
04:31:56,780 --> 04:31:58,960
He killed three or four of my men.

3270
04:31:58,960 --> 04:32:04,010
We located him by the sound of the bolt on his rifle, they flushed him out with a grenade.

3271
04:32:04,010 --> 04:32:05,670
He was a twelve year old boy.

3272
04:32:05,670 --> 04:32:06,000
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

3273
04:32:06,000 --> 04:32:11,060
His magazine spring was broken, so he was only able to slowly fire one shot at a time.

3274
04:32:11,060 --> 04:32:11,380
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

3275
04:32:11,380 --> 04:32:22,230
He was a damn good shot, o'donnell says he sighs now and then says the range was only 50 feet the Japanese had left him there, and he did what they left him to do.

3276
04:32:22,230 --> 04:32:51,070
We shot him and the quote, how does one deal with this, I was trying to figure out how I would deal with it, and then while I was reading soldiers' remembrances of the situation, I came across one who basically said he had to he couldn't continue to exist like this and kill like this without something to numb his emotions.

3277
04:32:51,070 --> 04:32:55,050
And in the mammoth book of eyewitness were a war 2.

3278
04:32:55,050 --> 04:32:56,090
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

3279
04:32:56,090 --> 04:33:02,430
Edited by Johnny Lewis, he quotes John Garcia from the 7th division of the US infantry, so this is an army soldier.

3280
04:33:02,430 --> 04:33:03,260
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

3281
04:33:03,260 --> 04:33:14,180
By the way, he's talking about the Japanese general who had committed suicide by the time the fighting is over, and he writes quote, we buried general u shijimi and his men inside a cave.

3282
04:33:14,180 --> 04:33:17,670
This was the worst part of the war, which I didn't like about Okinawa.

3283
04:33:17,670 --> 04:33:18,070
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

3284
04:33:18,070 --> 04:33:22,200
They were hiding in caves all the time, women, children, soldiers.

3285
04:33:22,200 --> 04:33:29,650
We get up on a cliff and lower down barrels of gasoline and then shoot at it, it would explode and just bury them to death.

3286
04:33:29,650 --> 04:33:30,170
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

3287
04:33:30,170 --> 04:33:37,530
He continues quote, I personally shot one Japanese woman because she was coming across a field at night.

3288
04:33:37,530 --> 04:33:43,280
We kept dropping leaflets not to cross the field at night because we couldn't tell if they were soldiers.

3289
04:33:43,280 --> 04:33:47,360
We would set up a perimeter, anything in front, we'd shoot at it.

3290
04:33:47,360 --> 04:34:03,040
This one night, I shot, and when it came daylight, it was a woman there and a baby tied to her back, the bullet had gone through her and out the baby's back that still bothers me that how I still feel I committed murder.

3291
04:34:03,040 --> 04:34:05,670
You see a figure in the dark, it stooped over.

3292
04:34:05,670 --> 04:34:21,770
You don't know if it's a soldier or a civilian and quote, he continues right from that point, I was drinking about a fifth and a half of whiskey every day, sometimes homemade, sometimes what I could buy it was the only way I could kill.

3293
04:34:21,770 --> 04:34:33,020
I had friends who were Japanese, and I kept thinking every time I pulled a trigger on a man or pushed a flame thrower down into a hole, what is this person's family going to say when he doesn't come back.

3294
04:34:33,020 --> 04:34:40,490
He's got a wife, he's got children, somebody and quote he continues a quote.

3295
04:34:40,490 --> 04:34:45,740
Oh, I still lose nights of sleep because of that woman I shot, I still lose a lot of sleep.

3296
04:34:45,740 --> 04:34:47,490
I still dream about her.

3297
04:34:47,490 --> 04:34:56,280
I dreamed about it perhaps two weeks and quote, and then the interviewer says he let out a deep breath.

3298
04:34:56,280 --> 04:35:13,620
Something more turbulent than a sigh of those are the remembrances of a man who may have come home with no visible wounds on his body, but is clearly bearing some scars for the rest of his days.

3299
04:35:13,620 --> 04:35:14,870
[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

3300
04:35:14,870 --> 04:35:33,130
How many more of those people are you going to have when you have to invade the Japanese home islands, and maybe a better question to ask, although i'm not sure is what is an invasion of the home islands going to do to the civilians, because when you look at what it did to them on Okinawa.

3301
04:35:33,130 --> 04:35:33,440
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

3302
04:35:33,440 --> 04:35:37,430
You stand back and the hair on the back of your neck stands.

3303
04:35:37,430 --> 04:35:40,010
[ SPACE 2.6 secs ]

3304
04:35:40,010 --> 04:35:42,180
No one knows how many died by the way, I mean.

3305
04:35:42,180 --> 04:35:46,650
No canal has got slightly less than half a million people during this time period.

3306
04:35:46,650 --> 04:35:50,450
And there may have been as many as 150000 of them killed.

3307
04:35:50,450 --> 04:35:51,920
The loan numbers are weighed down by.

3308
04:35:51,920 --> 04:35:52,940
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

3309
04:35:52,940 --> 04:36:06,640
So that shows you the range here, but so many of them die in circumstances that absolutely break, and if you wanna read a very disturbing book in the early nineteen eighties, that's my audience, right, I want to read a very disturbing book.

3310
04:36:06,640 --> 04:36:18,030
Yes, of course, we do in the early eighties, 8 in Okinawan newspaper went around and collected the stories survivors sort of piecing together little bits of the mosaic.

3311
04:36:18,030 --> 04:36:22,190
That is, this whole affair on a memory by memory basis.

3312
04:36:22,190 --> 04:36:44,930
And the results are horrific, and every story, its own personal readers digest survival or not story the story of the nurses, 1415 16 years old nursing students and what they went through and how many of them died in the horror of that the killing of their own wounded.

3313
04:36:44,930 --> 04:36:59,280
Which was happening on a widespread basis, and again, maybe that's a little glimpse of the future here when the Japanese home islands are invaded, and one of the survivors, um, one of these nurses quoted uh talks about one of those incidents.

3314
04:36:59,280 --> 04:37:10,260
And in the book, it's as, quote the American artillery bombardment continued throughout April and may, so at the end of may, the naval units moved temporarily down south.

3315
04:37:10,260 --> 04:37:18,790
There were many seriously wounded men in the shelter, and those who were unable to move by themselves were euthanized with potassium cyanide.

3316
04:37:18,790 --> 04:37:19,090
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

3317
04:37:19,090 --> 04:37:41,790
At the start, it was mixed in with their food, the wounded just lay there riding in agony after one of the group ate some of the food and died, none of the others would eat it, so the next method they tried was injection many men dying from what were passed off as injections for quote the good of your health and quote after watching one of the wounded men die from his injection.

3318
04:37:41,790 --> 04:37:42,660
The other patient.

3319
04:37:42,660 --> 04:37:48,020
Struggled violently and were held down by several staff while they were given their injections.

3320
04:37:48,020 --> 04:37:48,710
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

3321
04:37:48,710 --> 04:37:55,490
Toshiko, who's one of the nurses who witnessed all this, talked about this, is the most horrific of her war experiences.

3322
04:37:55,490 --> 04:37:56,190
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

3323
04:37:56,190 --> 04:37:59,300
They died almost immediately after the injection.

3324
04:37:59,300 --> 04:38:08,660
They just let out a little sigh or groan before both hands started to twist and contort and quote this was happening all over the island.

3325
04:38:08,660 --> 04:38:15,360
And in other circumstances, the soldiers are being recorded as being resigned to this fate.

3326
04:38:15,360 --> 04:38:16,870
[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]

3327
04:38:16,870 --> 04:38:25,470
But the part that if you're looking at Okinawa as a preview of the Japanese home islands, that most takes your breath away.

3328
04:38:25,470 --> 04:38:30,620
It's the group suicides, and I should point out that you can find examples of.

3329
04:38:30,620 --> 04:38:40,790
I mean, there's a lot of people in Germany killing themselves as the red army approaches their territories, and there's whole books on that, but the experience in the Pacific is different.

3330
04:38:40,790 --> 04:38:43,730
Those responsiveness in the Pacific.

3331
04:38:43,730 --> 04:39:07,350
It's not always clear whether this is what the people who are killing themselves want to do, whether they feel compelled to, but would rather live, whether they've been fed a bunch of propaganda that makes them think they have no choice, but one of the most horrific things i've ever read in life involves one of these caves where these civilians are hold up the Japanese soldiers.

3332
04:39:07,350 --> 04:39:19,780
Give them all a bunch of grenades to kill themselves, but there's not enough grenades and a bunch of the ones they they get our duds, so they have to figure out a way without any weapons, how they're all going to kill each other, and they're all relate.

3333
04:39:19,780 --> 04:39:29,100
These are family members and just to make matters worse, by the way, as soon as the first grenades do go often, these people start committing suicide.

3334
04:39:29,100 --> 04:39:42,570
Americans outside the cave, think that they're being attacked, so they start shooting into the cave, so the civilians are caught between people blowing themselves up in one part of the cave and Americans shooting into the cave, thinking that they are being attacked the man's name.

3335
04:39:42,570 --> 04:39:42,910
By the way.

3336
04:39:42,910 --> 04:40:03,670
Is Kinjo, who's having this memory, and he says that between the American shooting from one side and people blowing themselves up from the other, and he was sort of in a state of shock, but then as his eyes clear, he notices a former official who had picked up a piece of wood and who had started bashing his wife and children with it.

3337
04:40:03,670 --> 04:40:04,710
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

3338
04:40:04,710 --> 04:40:21,360
Saying that the bizarre suicidal environment in that cave had obviously turned that man into a mad man that he would bash his own wife and children to death with a piece of wood, but then they all realized that they need something if they don't have a grenade to kill themselves and their loved ones with.

3339
04:40:21,360 --> 04:40:24,860
And this is where it gets mind boggling.

3340
04:40:24,860 --> 04:40:25,400
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

3341
04:40:25,400 --> 04:40:27,750
I mean, can you imagine having to kill your family members.

3342
04:40:27,750 --> 04:40:40,490
Can you imagine having to do by hand, can you imagine how hard it would be if they just sat there, told you they loved you and then waited patiently for you to do, quoting from the account in descent into hell.

3343
04:40:40,490 --> 04:40:48,140
Now those people who had not been able to take their own lives with grenades were worried about being left alive.

3344
04:40:48,140 --> 04:41:00,150
They had to find other ways to kill themselves and the former ward chairman's behaviour of the guy who bashed his family had set the example, some used sides and razor blades to slash themselves.

3345
04:41:00,150 --> 04:41:10,890
While others strangled themselves with lengths of rope as the mayhem unfolded, they found all sorts of ways to kill, including bashing others to death with rocks and sticks.

3346
04:41:10,890 --> 04:41:14,940
Men bashed their wives, and parents, bashed their children.

3347
04:41:14,940 --> 04:41:33,490
Young people killed the elderly and the strong killed the week what they all felt in common was the belief that they were doing this out of love and compassion, and quote, then Kinjo and his brother have to do the same thing to their family members.

3348
04:41:33,490 --> 04:41:47,700
Quote Kinjo and his elder brother also had to fulfil their role, everything that was happening around them made them understand that they had to carry out their duty as well, kinjo said, quote, I think it was our mother.

3349
04:41:47,700 --> 04:42:09,660
We hit first and quote as he and his brother began bashing her in the head, kinjo screamed out until she became a blur through the tears flowing from his own eyes for the first time in life, he wept uncontrollably, quote, I have never wailed like that sense, and quote the account.

3350
04:42:09,660 --> 04:42:15,760
Then, says quote the brothers used sticks to rain blow after blow on their mother.

3351
04:42:15,760 --> 04:42:24,400
Watching her from behind as their pounding sent her step by step towards her death is still a vivid image in king Joe's mind.

3352
04:42:24,400 --> 04:42:49,860
However, it says he has no recollection of what he did to his sister and brother after that and quote, imagine finding yourself in a situation like that and now think about how many more people are going to find themselves in that situation, are we to believe that this is going to somehow end on Okinawa.

3353
04:42:49,860 --> 04:42:50,940
[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

3354
04:42:50,940 --> 04:42:57,710
Or is this a nostradamus like view of what's still to come for every one.

3355
04:42:57,710 --> 04:42:59,480
[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]

3356
04:42:59,480 --> 04:43:06,730
I was fascinated by some comments in the Hiromichi yahaira book the battle for Okinawa.

3357
04:43:06,730 --> 04:43:20,120
He was a colonel, and he in the book started to ask really angry questions about Japan's leadership and how they can let this happen, and all throughout this series, we've been talking about that too.

3358
04:43:20,120 --> 04:43:27,320
This idea of the leadership as just immune, sometimes to the suffering of their own people, their own soldiers.

3359
04:43:27,320 --> 04:43:28,850
[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]

3360
04:43:28,850 --> 04:43:33,990
Johor talks about how this idea of the Japanese not surrendering.

3361
04:43:33,990 --> 04:43:53,180
But killing themselves instead developed and then says by the second world war, the greater east Asia wars they call it, this was sort of ingrained, and you were ordered to not be taken prisoner, but he's asking what the point is, and he writes, quote, Japan had never lost a war.

3362
04:43:53,180 --> 04:44:31,120
We had also never waged a war in which large forces were isolated from mainland support, thus not to taken prisoner became a fixed principle part of our military education since the middle of the greater east Asia war, most Japanese garrisons in the Pacific islands adhere to the supreme Japanese principle, never surrendered to the enemy officers and men, he writes, usually committed suicide as a last resort to avoid the ultimate shame of capture, our 32nd army was now faced with this situation, must 100000 soldiers die because of tradition.

3363
04:44:31,120 --> 04:44:31,690
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

3364
04:44:31,690 --> 04:44:38,330
From this point on, he writes, it was but a battle to kill the remaining Japanese soldiers for nothing.

3365
04:44:38,330 --> 04:44:40,850
We could cause the enemy little damage.

3366
04:44:40,850 --> 04:44:43,440
They could walk freely on the field of battle.

3367
04:44:43,440 --> 04:44:50,940
The war of attrition was over, and we would simply be asking the enemy to use his formidable power to kill us all.

3368
04:44:50,940 --> 04:45:07,070
Indeed, he writes, it is a high ideal to fight to the end to maintain national morale, but were our leaders worth the sacrifice of an entire people with the end of the war in sight, they shouted us, millions of people must die for our nation.

3369
04:45:07,070 --> 04:45:14,150
Why are they really aware of the entire war situation, it was foolish, he writes.

3370
04:45:14,150 --> 04:45:35,370
To force everyone to die simply because Japan had never before lost a war and quote, he says, the decision to surrender should have been made as quickly as possible, he says at least before Okinawa was last, colonel yahara also mentions the American propaganda efforts.

3371
04:45:35,370 --> 04:45:47,180
The attempts to get Okinawans and Japanese to surrender to convince them that you know that that the Americans are not the terrible monsters they've been told to be that everyone will be safe.

3372
04:45:47,180 --> 04:45:48,380
[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

3373
04:45:48,380 --> 04:45:55,830
You may recall that these efforts were done on Saipan, and they're going to be stepped up here in w toll.

3374
04:45:55,830 --> 04:46:02,810
Says more than on any other previous Pacific battlefield, the Americans are trying to persuade their enemies to give up.

3375
04:46:02,810 --> 04:46:04,190
[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]

3376
04:46:04,190 --> 04:46:14,040
He says they'll drop tons of leaflets 30000 in one day alone that they will mount loudspeakers on jeeps, trucks, patrol boats.

3377
04:46:14,040 --> 04:46:22,290
They'll drop loud speakers with parachutes, hoping that the broadcast before it hits the ground, reach people in caves.

3378
04:46:22,290 --> 04:46:23,760
[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]

3379
04:46:23,760 --> 04:46:30,310
He even says that they're using American Japanese citizens to create really good translations.

3380
04:46:30,310 --> 04:46:38,820
They're using cultural sensitivities to realize how the word surrender might be a sort of a trigger might be the modern term for it, so they don't use the word surrender.

3381
04:46:38,820 --> 04:46:39,830
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

3382
04:46:39,830 --> 04:46:41,430
And colonel yahara writes.

3383
04:46:41,430 --> 04:46:50,460
Quote American propaganda was transmitted from small craft offshore, there were daily broadcasts influent Japanese.

3384
04:46:50,460 --> 04:46:55,660
Now he's quoting the broadcast Okinawan civilians, we will guarantee your lives.

3385
04:46:55,660 --> 04:46:57,650
We will give you food and medicine.

3386
04:46:57,650 --> 04:47:01,500
Please move toward mini togo before it is too late.

3387
04:47:01,500 --> 04:47:12,700
Alternatively, Japanese soldiers, you fought well and proudly for the cause of Japan, but now the issue of victory or defeat has been decided to continue.

3388
04:47:12,700 --> 04:47:14,440
The battle is meaningless.

3389
04:47:14,440 --> 04:47:16,430
We'll guarantee your lives.

3390
04:47:16,430 --> 04:47:19,160
Please come down to the beach and swim out to us.

3391
04:47:19,160 --> 04:47:36,870
End quote yahara continues by saying thus the enemy struck not only with broadcasts and shells, but also with countless propaganda leaflets dropped from the sky, none of it showed the viciousness so typical of propaganda, they said candidly.

3392
04:47:36,870 --> 04:47:53,320
The Japan's defeat was inevitable they spoke of Japan's leaders and their indifference to the lives of subordinates, and perhaps one could argue that on Okinawa, they're working.

3393
04:47:53,320 --> 04:47:53,720
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

3394
04:47:53,720 --> 04:48:05,180
At least by the really tough standards the Japanese have for the first time, you're gonna a decent number of Japanese soldiers surrendering.

3395
04:48:05,180 --> 04:48:14,160
And sometimes as units, this is unheard of in the Pacific war, I think it's something like 11000 or so Japanese surrender.

3396
04:48:14,160 --> 04:48:28,880
But as usual, and a nice proportion of those are really Korean and Taiwanese laborers impressed into service, but it's like 7000 Japanese soldiers, which is significant, and you want to say that this is a sign that, as we've pointed out.

3397
04:48:28,880 --> 04:48:44,330
The Japanese are like everyone else, only more so it took them longer to get to the point of morale collapse, but here, but other historians will point out that maybe that's the backwards way of looking at it rather than noticing how many you managed to get to surrender.

3398
04:48:44,330 --> 04:48:56,440
Look how many didn't the Japanese suffer something like 110000 casualties in Okinawa and 100000 of those are people that either fought to the death or took their own lives.

3399
04:48:56,440 --> 04:48:58,200
[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]

3400
04:48:58,200 --> 04:48:59,080
That's terrifying.

3401
04:48:59,080 --> 04:49:12,440
If you're trying to extrapolate data on what an invasion of Japan's casualty rate might look like, maybe you think to yourself that you don't care what the enemy's casualty rate is.

3402
04:49:12,440 --> 04:49:25,100
What about the civilians, the numbers of Okinawans who died range anywhere from 30000 to i've seen a hundred and fifty hundred sixty thousand is numbers thrown out there.

3403
04:49:25,100 --> 04:49:27,620
[ SPACE 2.5 secs ]

3404
04:49:27,620 --> 04:49:33,960
Extrapolate that out for Japanese civilians, and maybe you say, well, listen, once again, this is the enemy side.

3405
04:49:33,960 --> 04:49:36,090
I'm not gonna worry too much about their people.

3406
04:49:36,090 --> 04:49:58,280
Okay, what about your people and I don't know how many non Americans were going to participate in the eventual invasion of Japan, but the American casualties on Okinawa are frightful, the worst in the Pacific war so far, 50000 casualties basically almost 13000 dead.

3407
04:49:58,280 --> 04:50:22,630
5000 sailors dead Arthur Richard b frank had said that the navy and marine losses at Okinawa by themselves constituted about 17 percent of all the casualties sustained by the navy and the for the whole war, so there's an idea of how nasty things are.

3408
04:50:22,630 --> 04:50:24,340
[ SPACE 1.7 secs ]

3409
04:50:24,340 --> 04:50:48,670
Oh yeah, another sign may be of sort of war fatigue is that you can see the casualties, the psychological casualties on the us side, spike, i've heard all sorts of possible reasons for this sum, saying that the battlefield in Okinawa was sometimes so like a first world war battlefield that you started to see a lot of the same combat fatigue battle fatigue.

3410
04:50:48,670 --> 04:50:49,940
[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]

3411
04:50:49,940 --> 04:50:59,950
Psychological casualties that they saw in the first world war, i've seen others blame it on the flood of replacement soldiers that the terrible casualties necessary.

3412
04:50:59,950 --> 04:51:00,410
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

3413
04:51:00,410 --> 04:51:02,900
I mean, the stories are legendary.

3414
04:51:02,900 --> 04:51:22,720
If you read them about how quickly those people tend to die when they arrive in battle, the first time they haven't acquired the skills necessary to survive, they always remind me when you read the stories of those of those sea turtles that have to hatch on the shore and then run the gauntlet of predators and threats to make it to the safety of the sea.

3415
04:51:22,720 --> 04:51:24,150
Well, those replacement soldiers, if they if.

3416
04:51:24,150 --> 04:51:31,660
They can last a little bit in combat, will develop the skills necessary to survive the competitors so unforgiving that tons of them get wiped out.

3417
04:51:31,660 --> 04:51:36,940
You know very quickly, and the old soldiers don't ever want to get to know them very well because they die so fast.

3418
04:51:36,940 --> 04:51:39,060
[ SPACE 2.1 secs ]

3419
04:51:39,060 --> 04:51:46,560
But it's not just in a military sense at all that you're starting to see the the psychological tension mounting um.

3420
04:51:46,560 --> 04:52:06,010
Earlier, we quoted a letter from a mother that navy secretary forestall had released to the public, which you know it cuts right through the emotion of a personal letter like that cuts right through the names and dates and places, and and all the other narrative uh and somehow re-establishes a little bit of the emotional connection to the story.

3421
04:52:06,010 --> 04:52:06,500
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

3422
04:52:06,500 --> 04:52:19,260
And in ah implacable photos of historians Waldo henricks and mark glacio do the same thing, they use a letter as part of trying to give a sense of how done with this.

3423
04:52:19,260 --> 04:52:20,710
The American people are.

3424
04:52:20,710 --> 04:52:23,640
I mean, Okinawa comes after iwojima, which comes after Pello.

3425
04:52:23,640 --> 04:52:46,820
I mean, these are um body blows in terms of a war that listen, if you've never been through a pandemic and you're just ready to take the mask off and go back to normal and not have a lot of deaths, that's how Americans and a lot of people in the rest of the world are feeling by 1945 and henrickson Galligan writing this by the way.

3426
04:52:46,820 --> 04:53:23,160
While the Okinawan battle is still the battle for Okinawa dragged on as the casualties mounted, so did the questioning of American strategy in mid-may following one of his daily war journal broadcasts radio commentator Martin at grand ski received an angry letter from a missus, C J H the mother of a soldier on Okinawa asking why the army war department and American leaders generally were not being held accountable for quote all this slaughter of American boys and quote an.

3427
04:53:23,160 --> 04:53:34,800
Anguished string of questions followed, now quoting the questions from the letter, why haven't reinforcements reached those boys on Okinawa, why must the same troops fight for 45 days?

3428
04:53:34,800 --> 04:53:43,330
Why only six divisions in the first place, why must every battle in the Pacific be bloody, it was bloody Tarawa, bloody siphon.

3429
04:53:43,330 --> 04:53:43,780
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

3430
04:53:43,780 --> 04:53:48,410
Bloody Peller loo, bloody lady, bloody Eugenie, bloody okay.

3431
04:53:48,410 --> 04:53:56,710
Now I bloody Mindanao all of three divisions there, she writes bloody lose on, not finished, and it will be bloody Borneo.

3432
04:53:56,710 --> 04:54:07,690
Doesn't it ever enter anyone's mind that we are paying a needless, too high a price in human blood in the Pacific and quote, and once again.

3433
04:54:07,690 --> 04:54:12,270
You get the questions over strategy over the which leader should be in charge.

3434
04:54:12,270 --> 04:54:13,810
[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]

3435
04:54:13,810 --> 04:54:34,590
People go after general Buckner and his decision to go head on into the defenses of the Japanese and Okinawa rather than try an amphibious assault around the flanks, Buckner can't much really respond to that because he becomes the highest American general in the war to die in combat when he's killed in an artillery attack.

3436
04:54:34,590 --> 04:54:36,070
[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]

3437
04:54:36,070 --> 04:54:46,900
And of course, the Japanese generals die too, they all kill themselves before the fighting on Okinawa is even completed.

3438
04:54:46,900 --> 04:54:55,760
The brand new American president still on the job for less than two months at this point, gives a speech to the news media.

3439
04:54:55,760 --> 04:54:57,320
[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]

3440
04:54:57,320 --> 04:55:06,120
You can tell that he seems uncomfortable at this point, still with scripted announcements and cameras, and as we recalled earlier, I mean.

3441
04:55:06,120 --> 04:55:16,710
He's the first American president without the initials fdr that anyone's experience in a dozen years, but he gives a warning to Japan, the Japanese people.

3442
04:55:16,710 --> 04:55:24,140
In fact, the entire world, then if you don't want to have the same thing happen to you that happened to Germany, give up now.

3443
04:55:24,140 --> 04:55:24,860
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

3444
04:55:24,860 --> 04:55:36,830
There can be no peace in the world until the military power of Japan is destroyed with the same completeness as was the power of European dictators.

3445
04:55:36,830 --> 04:55:38,030
[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

3446
04:55:38,030 --> 04:56:06,490
To do that, we are now engaged in the process of deploying millions of our armed forces against Japan in a mass movement of troops and supplies and weapons over 14000 miles, a military and naval feet unequalled in all history, substantial portions of Japan's key industrial centers have been leveled to the ground in a series of record incendiary raids.

[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

3448
04:56:07,500 --> 04:56:16,440
What has already happened to Tokyo will happen to every Japanese city whose industries feed the Japanese war machine.

04:56:16,440 --> 04:56:17,080
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

3450
04:56:17,080 --> 04:56:38,280
If the Japanese insists on continuing resistance beyond the point of reason, their country will suffer the same destruction as Germany, our blows will destroy their whole modern industrial plant and organization, which they have built up during the past century and which they are now devoting to our hopeless cause.

3451
04:56:38,280 --> 04:56:39,330
[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

3452
04:56:39,330 --> 04:56:56,060
We have no desire, our intention to destroy it are enslaved the Japanese people, but only surrender can prevent the kind of ruin which they have seen come to Germany as a result of continued useless resistance.

3453
04:56:56,060 --> 04:56:56,390
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

3454
04:56:56,390 --> 04:57:03,330
The whole situation in Germany is creating all sorts of very interesting societal and economic problems around the world.

3455
04:57:03,330 --> 04:57:04,600
And especially in the United States.

3456
04:57:04,600 --> 04:57:11,800
I mean, when you have a war ending in Europe with millions of men under arms there, what happens to them do some fight.

3457
04:57:11,800 --> 04:57:29,480
The Japanese do some get demobilized and what happens to all the domestic political concerns and labor and management issues and all these things that have been put on hold as part of the unifying efforts that the country and many countries did the same thing put together for the war effort.

3458
04:57:29,480 --> 04:57:37,800
A lot of this stuff is starting to rise up to the surface again before the Americans and the allies have reached the wars finished line here.

3459
04:57:37,800 --> 04:57:53,030
Right, just because Germany's defeated doesn't mean Japan is, and as we've said earlier, the Americans really have to gird themselves for what's to come because the plans for the invasion of Japan are harrowing, slated to start in late 1945.

3460
04:57:53,030 --> 04:58:02,600
Moved to the to the more important islands where places like Tokyo are by 1946, and the casualty limits are horrific.

3461
04:58:02,600 --> 04:58:13,480
I'm not sure what the proper adjective to use is when the high numbers begin to look like a million men will be casualties worth pointing out, though that even today.

3462
04:58:13,480 --> 04:58:15,910
We argue over what the casualty numbers would have been.

3463
04:58:15,910 --> 04:58:24,900
No one knew what's more, the tendency in the Pacific on the allies part has been to underestimate the casualties that they'll suffer.

3464
04:58:24,900 --> 04:58:32,530
So no one knows the basic plans, though that are being batted around, boil down to two main ideas.

3465
04:58:32,530 --> 04:58:43,380
Some people want to blockade the country, which is already under a naval blockade to some degree, but tighten that, have ships, just keep everything from coming in fuel, medicine, food.

3466
04:58:43,380 --> 04:58:48,540
Everything starving to death, and then keep bombing them the way you're bombing them.

3467
04:58:48,540 --> 04:59:07,880
This may sound, by the way, like a merciful strategy, blockades often do sound like the lesser of two evils, but ask anyone who's ever lived through 1 um when you start denying food and medicine people, you have a horrific circumstance without any bombs exploding and in the blockade and bombing scenario.

3468
04:59:07,880 --> 04:59:10,590
You're still gonna have Japanese cities burned out.

3469
04:59:10,590 --> 04:59:18,040
The other idea is to bomb them the way you're bombing them and then invade both of those ideas downsides.

3470
04:59:18,040 --> 04:59:18,460
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

3471
04:59:18,460 --> 04:59:35,220
The navy certainly understands after Okinawa that they're going to be facing constant and withering attacks from common causes when they invade the home islands, maybe they had 40 straight days at one point on okan, that's going to be something that whittles down strength and kills a lot of sailors over a long period of time.

3472
04:59:35,220 --> 04:59:36,600
[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]

3473
04:59:36,600 --> 04:59:42,010
But an invasion with ground troops, this is a terrifying concept.

3474
04:59:42,010 --> 04:59:45,870
And no one knows how many people might die in something like that.

3475
04:59:45,870 --> 04:59:47,730
[ SPACE 1.9 secs ]

3476
04:59:47,730 --> 04:59:54,620
In July, a bunch of things happened that changed the situation somewhat and clarify it somewhat.

3477
04:59:54,620 --> 04:59:56,110
[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]

3478
04:59:56,110 --> 04:59:57,620
Two of these things overlap.

3479
04:59:57,620 --> 04:59:58,060
By the way.

3480
04:59:58,060 --> 04:59:59,660
There's going to be a very big conference.

3482
05:00:00,110 --> 05:00:02,550
In Potsdam, outside of Berlin in Germany.

3483
05:00:02,550 --> 05:00:10,660
The now you know in ruins Germany, where the leaders of the allied camp stolen treatment now in his first one of these things.

3484
05:00:10,660 --> 05:00:17,700
And Churchill and his last one, he will actually lose the election during and be replaced by a successor midway through the conference.

3485
05:00:17,700 --> 05:00:18,620
They had this conference.

3486
05:00:18,620 --> 05:00:20,310
That's mostly about what we do in Europe.

3487
05:00:20,310 --> 05:00:21,940
What's the postwar situation looked like?

3488
05:00:21,940 --> 05:00:34,240
Oh, yeah, and what about the Japanese who are still fighting when the conference is ongoing, something happens back in the United States that changes the whole equation in Churchill has to be informed about this.

3489
05:00:34,240 --> 05:00:34,980
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

3490
05:00:34,980 --> 05:00:40,600
The Manhattan Project proves to be successful in a atomic bomb test in New Mexico.

3491
05:00:40,600 --> 05:00:48,610
Goes off without a hitch, and the world enters into the nuclear era with very.

3492
05:00:48,610 --> 05:00:58,980
Very few human beings on the planet earth realizing it, Churchill finds out afterwards that the test, which no one knew how it was going to turn out how it went.

3493
05:00:58,980 --> 05:01:04,600
And he wrote about it in his history of the second world war and said this quote, the president.

3494
05:01:04,600 --> 05:01:12,700
Meaning Truman invited me to confer with him forthwith he had with him general Marshall and and emerald lady up to this moment.

3495
05:01:12,700 --> 05:01:30,450
We had shaped our ideas towards an assault upon the homeland of Japan by terrific air bombing and by the invasion of very large armies, we had contemplated the desperate resistance of the Japanese fighting to the death with samurai devotion not only in pitched battles.

3496
05:01:30,450 --> 05:01:33,890
But in every cave and dug I had in my mind.

3497
05:01:33,890 --> 05:01:40,140
He writes the spectacle of Okinawa island, where many thousands of Japanese rather than surrender.

3498
05:01:40,140 --> 05:02:02,340
Had drawn up in line and destroyed themselves by hand grenades after their leaders had solemnly performed the right of suicide is what he means to quell the Japanese resistance man by man and conquer the country yard by yard might well require the loss of 1 million American lives, and half that number of British or more.

3499
05:02:02,340 --> 05:02:06,500
If we could get them there for we were resolved to share the agony.

3500
05:02:06,500 --> 05:02:13,260
Now all this nightmare picture had vanished in its place was the vision fair and bright.

3501
05:02:13,260 --> 05:02:18,600
Indeed, it seemed of the end of the whole war in one or two violent shocks.

3502
05:02:18,600 --> 05:02:19,000
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

3503
05:02:19,000 --> 05:02:44,980
I thought immediately myself of how the Japanese people whose courage I had always admired might find in the apparition of this almost supernatural weapon, an excuse which would save their honour and release them from their obligation of being killed to the last fighting man and quote, I have a hard time here in the 21st century.

3504
05:02:44,980 --> 05:02:45,510
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

3505
05:02:45,510 --> 05:02:57,000
Squaring the moral circle between the idea of a fair and bright vision as Churchill terms it and dropping atomic bombs on people.

3506
05:02:57,000 --> 05:02:58,030
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

3507
05:02:58,030 --> 05:03:24,470
But perhaps this should be taken into account that i'm not living in the world where cities are being bombed and incinerated multiple times a week, and Churchill and these allied leaders making these decisions what to them might seem a an incremental step up in nastiness to us seems like something that should never ever ever be done.

3508
05:03:24,470 --> 05:03:25,420
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

3509
05:03:25,420 --> 05:03:35,720
Now someone might say we're reacting to this emotionally and in the time period where they're operating, they're using logic, right, this is the human being lawn mower logic, isn't it.

3510
05:03:35,720 --> 05:03:48,670
The idea that anything puts a halt to the conveyor belt of death and saves more lives long term is the greater moral good, but you've got to do some really horrific things to get there.

3511
05:03:48,670 --> 05:03:55,640
I mean, look how it perverts the entire goals of this atomic bomb, I mean.

3512
05:03:55,640 --> 05:04:08,160
In a way, if the goal here and it is is to shock, a stubborn Japanese leadership been definitely seen the light here that they've lost the war, a little like slapping the hysterical patients to get them to calm down enough to take in reality.

3513
05:04:08,160 --> 05:04:12,480
You want this bomb to be as horrible and terrible as possible, the worse it.

3514
05:04:12,480 --> 05:04:13,270
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

3515
05:04:13,270 --> 05:04:27,480
The more likely it is that it's going to do its job of being a monkey wrench into the gears of this conveyor belt of it's a really weird place that the logical chain of thinking can get you to arrive at.

3516
05:04:27,480 --> 05:04:36,340
Isn't it, we called it logical insanity in the shows that we did on this evolution of the logic of things like strategic bombing, but this is a lot bigger than that.

3517
05:04:36,340 --> 05:04:38,920
This goes to the human experience on so many levels.

3518
05:04:38,920 --> 05:04:48,200
I mean, Gwen dire in his book war said that what's being done with things like atomic bombings and fire bombs that this is just the natural extension of what human beings have always done.

3519
05:04:48,200 --> 05:04:48,730
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

3520
05:04:48,730 --> 05:05:07,250
The weapons are just a lot more horrific than they used to be, but I can't stop thinking about the idea about personally experience all these people making these decisions are doing so from a theoretical background, as far as I know.

3521
05:05:07,250 --> 05:05:12,480
None of them have ever lived through a fire bombing, or god forbid an atomic attack.

3522
05:05:12,480 --> 05:05:13,160
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

3523
05:05:13,160 --> 05:05:22,590
What if they had, would they still feel like this was the right decision to make, would they still feel like this was a bright and fair vision.

3524
05:05:22,590 --> 05:05:24,670
[ SPACE 2.1 secs ]

3525
05:05:24,670 --> 05:05:44,900
And I can hear people saying, well, you know, then you're just making decisions from emotion rather than logic, but look where logic has gotten us the emotional reactions to something like an atomic bombing when you read them today, they are the ones that sound saying it's the logical decisions that seem crazy.

3526
05:05:44,900 --> 05:05:46,400
[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]

3527
05:05:46,400 --> 05:06:09,500
Historian Michael best in his book choices under fire moral dimensions of world war ii reminds us not to forget the equivalent of being on the ground rather than making this two international electoral of a discussion, and he writes quote, sometimes as we engage in the intellectual exercise of trying to understand the complexities of the war.

3528
05:06:09,500 --> 05:06:12,550
We can become inure to the underlying realities.

3529
05:06:12,550 --> 05:06:12,910
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

3530
05:06:12,910 --> 05:06:32,970
This psychological distancing from our subject no doubt reflects in a small way the manner in which the wartime leaders themselves gradually became callous to the dreadful acts that were being perpetrated all around them and that they themselves were perpetrating as we analyze the wartime decisions.

3531
05:06:32,970 --> 05:06:45,150
We catch ourselves to our shock, tossing around numbers of dead human beings 10000 here 100000 there, almost as unfeelingly as the participants themselves.

3532
05:06:45,150 --> 05:06:53,650
This tendency towards psychological numbing is understandable and perhaps unavoidable, but we need to resist it as vigorously as we can.

3533
05:06:53,650 --> 05:06:53,950
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

3534
05:06:53,950 --> 05:07:13,860
We must keep reminding ourselves what it really means in practice to speak the world words, fire, storm or Hiroshima for hidden beneath the abstraction of the words words grown customary from heavy use, lie the unimaginable cruelty and madness of what happened.

3535
05:07:13,860 --> 05:07:31,670
End, quote N W toll in his book twilight of the gods gives one of the better overall descriptions of this when, on August 6th 1945, the first atomic bombing attack in human history occurs.

3536
05:07:31,670 --> 05:07:37,600
And he writes quote little boy, the Iranian bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

3537
05:07:37,600 --> 05:07:59,950
That's the nickname little boy exploded at 8:16 AM 18:00 and seventy feet above the ground and only 550 feet wide of its aiming point, the nuclear chain reaction it triggered created a core temperature of about 1 million degrees celsius, igniting the air around it to a diameter of nearly a kilometer.

3538
05:07:59,950 --> 05:08:00,380
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

3539
05:08:00,380 --> 05:08:22,010
The fire ball engulfed the center of the city, vaporizing about 20000 people on the ground thermal and ionizing radiation, killed virtually all people within a kilometer of the surface of the fire, burning them to death, or rupturing their internal organs farther out in successive concentric circles around the epicenter.

3540
05:08:22,010 --> 05:08:25,990
People were exposed to gamma rays, neutron radiation.

3541
05:08:25,990 --> 05:08:46,320
Flash burns, the blast wave and fire storms the initial shock wave, he writes, raced away from the epicenter at greater than the speed of sound some 984 miles per hour street cars were lifted from their tracks and scattered like toys, clothing was torn from bodies.

3542
05:08:46,320 --> 05:09:04,130
Nearly all wooden buildings within 2.3 kilometers were completely level, and about half of all such buildings to a radius of 3.2 kilometers later, investigators found the shadows of people caught with in the inner radius around the hypocenter they had been vaporized.

3543
05:09:04,130 --> 05:09:09,260
But their bodies had left faint silhouettes on the pavement run near by walls.

3544
05:09:09,260 --> 05:09:11,250
[ SPACE 2.0 secs ]

3545
05:09:11,250 --> 05:09:42,020
Basically the atomic attack combined the bad side of the firestorms because the fires um from the superheated everything exploded very quickly with horrific concussive blast damage like you would have in major bombings and then added just as a sprinkling of extra specialness on top horrible dispersion of radioactivity, the stories all sound like people who are living through a natural disaster.

3546
05:09:42,020 --> 05:09:45,940
But now human beings can create the equivalent of natural disasters.

3547
05:09:45,940 --> 05:09:47,170
[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

3548
05:09:47,170 --> 05:09:54,050
The effects of the bomb managed to take out most of the first responders, the hospitals.

3549
05:09:54,050 --> 05:10:08,980
The doctors, the firefighters, everyone who might actually go out and improve the situation, which leaves the people in a horrific situation for weeks afterwards as they die from radiation and the heartbreaking stories, this is what I mean about.

3550
05:10:08,980 --> 05:10:26,010
If you could take these, who saw this as such a wonderful logical way to get the Japanese to end the war, if you could have put Winston Churchill on the ground there and let him watch the scene going on as people trapped in burning buildings with their loved ones.

3551
05:10:26,010 --> 05:10:37,650
Trying to get them out had to be abandoned because the flames were coming, one of the most horrific stories connected with the Hiroshima bombing involves kids who are caught in the rubble as the fires approach.

3552
05:10:37,650 --> 05:10:40,090
And the parents don't even know what to do.

3553
05:10:40,090 --> 05:10:40,400
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

3554
05:10:40,400 --> 05:10:58,440
I mean, there's the theoretical understanding what it means to drop a bomb on a city, and then there's the reality of something like this in the book hibakusha survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which is just remembrance as by people and one of these survivors.

3555
05:10:58,440 --> 05:11:12,690
Shiga hiraku talks about the bombs exploding and says quote just then a brilliant flash like lightning appeared in the thunderous roar of an explosion reverberated around us in a moment.

3556
05:11:12,690 --> 05:11:19,090
Our house collapsed, and we found ourselves buried in its rubble as my husband and I worked frantically to free ourselves.

3557
05:11:19,090 --> 05:11:21,850
I heard a cry for help from the woman next door.

3558
05:11:21,850 --> 05:11:23,290
I called back to her.

3559
05:11:23,290 --> 05:11:31,840
If we get out before you, we'll come and help you when we did finally pull ourselves free, we saw the city of Hiroshima in ruins around us.

3560
05:11:31,840 --> 05:11:39,170
Nowhere was a building left intact, and in several places tongues of fire had begun licking outward, suddenly panicked.

3561
05:11:39,170 --> 05:11:44,160
Stricken and completely forgetting about our neighbour, I began searching for my children.

3562
05:11:44,160 --> 05:11:50,900
She continues as I was calling their names, a voice emerged from a spot 2 or 3 meters away help mummy.

3563
05:11:50,900 --> 05:11:51,500
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

3564
05:11:51,500 --> 05:11:59,780
It was my six year old daughter Kazuko, hurrying to the spot I found her tightly wedged from the ***** down by fallen plaster and timber.

3565
05:11:59,780 --> 05:12:00,150
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

3566
05:12:00,150 --> 05:12:07,670
I screamed to my husband to come quickly and do something he, however, could hardly move, being badly bruised and bleeding from the shoulder.

3567
05:12:07,670 --> 05:12:08,170
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

3568
05:12:08,170 --> 05:12:09,730
He had no strength left.

3569
05:12:09,730 --> 05:12:11,250
It was all he could do to walk.

3570
05:12:11,250 --> 05:12:11,840
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

3571
05:12:11,840 --> 05:12:22,980
She continues, and once again, I imagine Winston Churchill and all the other decision-makers standing to the side watching this unfold, my daughter kept calling to me.

3572
05:12:22,980 --> 05:12:23,730
It hurts mommy.

3573
05:12:23,730 --> 05:12:26,900
My legs hurt, I can't move, hurry and get me out.

3574
05:12:26,900 --> 05:12:32,150
I tugged her, but could not move her, no matter how desperately I tried, I just could not free her.

3575
05:12:32,150 --> 05:12:34,610
The fires were moving closer and closer.

3576
05:12:34,610 --> 05:12:37,010
We would not be able to stay there much longer.

3577
05:12:37,010 --> 05:12:43,640
Finally, when the flames began to lap around us, we were stirred into moving, no longer able to stand the intense heat.

3578
05:12:43,640 --> 05:12:46,060
I realized I was afraid to die.

3579
05:12:46,060 --> 05:12:50,330
I could not let myself be burned alive, tears streaming from my eyes.

3580
05:12:50,330 --> 05:12:57,470
I placed my hands together as if in prayer and ask my daughter to forgive me, Kazu, I am a bad mother to you.

3581
05:12:57,470 --> 05:12:58,730
But please forgive me.

3582
05:12:58,730 --> 05:13:00,180
You don't want to die either.

3583
05:13:00,180 --> 05:13:03,740
I know mommy isn't brave enough to stay here and die with you.

3584
05:13:03,740 --> 05:13:06,060
I'm afraid of the fire Kazu, forgive me.

3585
05:13:06,060 --> 05:13:15,830
Forgive me, then I chose an area that seemed to be safe from fire and fled towards it, pulling my husband along by the hand I kept looking back at the ruins of our house.

3586
05:13:15,830 --> 05:13:18,810
As if I were being dragged by the hair from behind.

3587
05:13:18,810 --> 05:13:21,790
There had been no time to rescue our other child either.

3588
05:13:21,790 --> 05:13:22,530
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

3589
05:13:22,530 --> 05:13:30,770
And quote she spent the rest of the evening uttering apologies to her dead children.

[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

3591
05:13:31,520 --> 05:13:33,040
And then her husband died.

[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]

3593
05:13:34,880 --> 05:13:37,060
This is one of many.

3594
05:13:37,060 --> 05:13:38,820
I always describe it as a mosaic.

3595
05:13:38,820 --> 05:13:44,020
Right, and everybody's individual story of how they dealt with this human caused version of a natural disaster.

3596
05:13:44,020 --> 05:13:46,650
When you put them together into the mosaic, you get a picture.

3597
05:13:46,650 --> 05:14:06,660
It's a lot of individual stories, but look at the stories and imagine if maybe emotion could have stirred the decision makers rather than logic, but once again, to what end to allow a blockade to happen to starve people to allow an invasion to happen.

3598
05:14:06,660 --> 05:14:14,370
Where the citizens of Japan are killed in house to house fighting, what you're really getting here.

3599
05:14:14,370 --> 05:14:16,840
If we wanted to look at this through the long term.

3600
05:14:16,840 --> 05:14:42,440
Lens is a vision of a future to be avoided in that same book, hibakusha a Kira nagasaka quoted, he tries to go back home and find his house and his relatives after the bombing and describes what is not that hard to imagine our future looking like.

3601
05:14:42,440 --> 05:14:44,930
If everything goes poorly and he writes.

3602
05:14:44,930 --> 05:14:52,810
Quote the area around urrea comic cathedral was completely burned out and the heat prevented me from approaching.

3603
05:14:52,810 --> 05:14:57,860
It was not until early the next morning that I made my way to what appeared to be the ruins of our house.

3604
05:14:57,860 --> 05:14:58,180
[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

3605
05:14:58,180 --> 05:15:12,320
The whole area was a fire black desolation, there was not even a charred remnant of the huge camphor tree that it stood behind our house all around me were strewn skeletons, scattered bones and torsos of ebony ash.

3606
05:15:12,320 --> 05:15:19,510
I sank down exhausted when I had recovered somewhat, I began looking for my mother or rather her bones.

3607
05:15:19,510 --> 05:15:22,750
All I had to go by was the fact that she had gold teeth.

3608
05:15:22,750 --> 05:15:27,350
I held skull after skull in my hands and peered into the jaw area.

3609
05:15:27,350 --> 05:15:33,340
I wonder how many people skulls I picked up during my search, I continued searching frantically.

3610
05:15:33,340 --> 05:15:40,460
There were times when squatting, I even raised fire, blackened heads to look at the teeth I spent that whole day.

3611
05:15:40,460 --> 05:15:56,830
The 10th picking up skulls and putting them down again and quote them, it is absolutely obvious that it is impossible for us to conceptualize what this is really like.

3612
05:15:56,830 --> 05:15:58,040
[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

3613
05:15:58,040 --> 05:16:22,620
You can make movies about it and people have you can read survivor accounts, and i've read a ton of those, and yet there's this distance between what they experienced and what you can glean from it just by hearing about it, and when read the accounts of survivors, they'll often refer to that one way or another that there's no way for you sitting here in a peaceful room to understand what i'm saying this is why I think.

3614
05:16:22,620 --> 05:16:25,150
I'm so attracted to the idea of bringing in.

3615
05:16:25,150 --> 05:16:31,740
You know, the leaders who will have to decide to use these weapons, and i'd like to add to the group the leaders on the Japanese side.

3616
05:16:31,740 --> 05:16:48,210
Who are resistant to surrendering when it's clearly over in this war, i'd like to bring them too, and in an Ebenezer scrooge like ghost of Christmas past, present or future observer to allow them to see what we're really talking about here.

3617
05:16:48,210 --> 05:17:05,200
And I remember in reading Michael bess's book choices under fire that even with all this stuff that i've read, even with the hours, we've talked about questions that there's always something you didn't think about like he mentions about the other things that are destroyed when the bomb goes off.

3618
05:17:05,200 --> 05:17:05,630
And he says.

3619
05:17:05,630 --> 05:17:11,200
Quote at the same instant meaning when the bomb went off.

3620
05:17:11,200 --> 05:17:19,030
Birds ignited in mid air, mosquitoes and flies, squirrels, family pets crackled and were gone.

3621
05:17:19,030 --> 05:17:22,370
And it's obvious.

3622
05:17:22,370 --> 05:17:25,870
But I didn't think about all the insect life instantly being wiped out.

3623
05:17:25,870 --> 05:17:44,440
It's a crazy kind of weapon, isn't it, and while there's burning corpses in the foreground, it is absolutely understandable that you would miss the things in the background that you might have lost, but those are considerable, and when somebody starts rattling off, what lose in an attack like this.

3624
05:17:44,440 --> 05:18:00,990
A nuclear explosion, while one history professor who was on the ground at Hiroshima and just marveled at the fact that the city was just, he said of the atomic bomb that such a weapon has the power to make everything into nothing.

3625
05:18:00,990 --> 05:18:02,740
Well, what's everything.

3626
05:18:02,740 --> 05:18:03,140
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

3627
05:18:03,140 --> 05:18:13,620
Richard Rhodes, quoted by bess, who had a study on this very subject, tried to sum up some of the things besides the obvious things of burning corpses in the foreground.

3628
05:18:13,620 --> 05:18:14,160
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

3629
05:18:14,160 --> 05:18:21,180
He wrote quote destroyed that is, were not only men, women and thousands of children.

3630
05:18:21,180 --> 05:18:26,150
But also restaurants and inns, laundries, theater groups.

3631
05:18:26,150 --> 05:18:30,190
Sports clubs, sewing clubs, boys clubs, girls clubs.

3632
05:18:30,190 --> 05:18:39,120
Love affairs, trees and gardens, grass gates, gravestones, temples and shrines, family, air looms, radios.

3633
05:18:39,120 --> 05:18:48,760
Classmates, books, courts of law, pets, groceries and markets, telephones, personal letters, automobiles, bicycles, horses.

3634
05:18:48,760 --> 05:18:50,400
120 war horses.

3635
05:18:50,400 --> 05:18:56,910
He points out musical instruments, medicines and medical equipment, life savings, eyeglasses.

3636
05:18:56,910 --> 05:19:18,340
City records, sidewalks, family scrapbooks, monuments, engagements, marriages, employees, clocks and watches, public transportation, street signs, parents, works of art such a weapon has the power to make everything into nothing, and still does.

3637
05:19:18,340 --> 05:19:26,460
By the way, the nuclear sort of damocles that hangs over our heads now starts.

3638
05:19:26,460 --> 05:19:51,000
Then it is perhaps a sign of something that even after this ferocious attack at Hiroshima, the Japanese government still isn't ready to surrender, and before they can even come up with some decent conversation about the matter, they get hit with another hammer blow two days later when the Soviet Union declares war on Japan.

3639
05:19:51,000 --> 05:19:52,110
[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

3640
05:19:52,110 --> 05:20:07,560
This is extra nasty because the Japanese hardliners were living in this fantasy world where they thought they could use the soviets as a way to get it better deal from the allies, but when the soviets declare war on you well, hard to deny that that deals now dead.

3641
05:20:07,560 --> 05:20:07,920
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

3642
05:20:07,920 --> 05:20:13,070
And then the day after that, while the Japanese government is still figuring out how to respond to these.

3643
05:20:13,070 --> 05:20:28,030
You know, we have an atomic bomb dropped on us, and two days later, the Soviet Union declares war on us, and then on August 9th, we get hit with another atomic bomb attack at the if you get 100080 to 100000 people killed in Hiroshima.

3644
05:20:28,030 --> 05:20:32,610
The numbers at Nagasaki are lower because of the way the terrain is laid out in some other things.

3645
05:20:32,610 --> 05:20:53,830
But you know 45 to 65000, these are not insignificant numbers, needless to say, and even after Nagasaki, you can't get the army ministers on board to surrender unless they can have four conditions, and all four conditions are a unacceptable to the allies.

3646
05:20:53,830 --> 05:20:57,100
I mean, there are things like you can't occupy Japan.

3647
05:20:57,100 --> 05:21:00,070
We'll try our own war criminals, all kinds of I mean.

3648
05:21:00,070 --> 05:21:07,330
Wasn't going to happen, but they're not going to surrender till it does, and the US and the allies are not going to stop attacking until they do.

3649
05:21:07,330 --> 05:21:16,490
In fact, there are bombing raids launched on Japan after the two atomic bombs are dropped, going to stop until the surrender happens.

3650
05:21:16,490 --> 05:21:31,770
And finally and famously and in a way that's hard to figure out what really happened because the cold war made it in the interest of certain countries like the United States, to maybe hide some of the emperor's decision making in the second world war.

3651
05:21:31,770 --> 05:21:51,900
But the emperor steps in and famously says we have to endure the unendurable and breaks the tie between the officials and and says we're going to surrender the moment the emperor steps in is one of those times that a lot of people are focused on ever since, understandably, because it brings up all sorts of questions.

3652
05:21:51,900 --> 05:21:55,830
First, one is is is if the emperor had this kind of power all along.

3653

[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

3654
05:21:56,420 --> 05:22:11,400
Why did he wait till now to use it, when did things have to get this bad before he exercised it, the Japanese system, as we've said all along, as everyone says is a government that's opaque by design.

3655
05:22:11,400 --> 05:22:23,400
The decision making is veiled, and you know if you've seen through a gazi lens and isn't always following, you know, the western idea of written down rules and for every, I mean.

3656
05:22:23,400 --> 05:22:27,280
There's there's some as a vibe to it as a feel to it.

3657
05:22:27,280 --> 05:22:34,700
There's protocol and stuff that's deeply embedded in Japanese cultural traditions and imperial traditions hard for outsiders to grasp.

3658
05:22:34,700 --> 05:22:35,740
[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

3659
05:22:35,740 --> 05:22:48,600
And then there's also the hardcore real politic, machiavellian people who will say things like if the emperor does something that we don't like, we'll just get rid of him and get another emperor.

3660
05:22:48,600 --> 05:22:49,530
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

3661
05:22:49,530 --> 05:22:53,920

[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

3663
05:22:54,290 --> 05:23:12,470
There were Japanese higher government officials right now, right in this room with the emperor who carry bullets in their bodies from being assassination, attempted assassination victims for policy decisions that we're not nationalistic or right wing enough, not super patriotic enough.

3665
05:23:14,480 --> 05:23:25,220
One of the people who's key to this whole thing, one of the people who's involved in the standoff is a general name a Naomi, and he says Francis pike mentions it mentions it in his book he or he does war.

3666
05:23:25,220 --> 05:23:29,430
He's contemplating maybe the alternate reality from surrender, and he says.

3667
05:23:29,430 --> 05:23:36,980
Quote, would it not be wondrous for the whole nation to be destroyed like a beautiful flower and quote.

[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

3671
05:23:45,620 --> 05:24:18,230
Did it seem beautiful at Hiroshima with the descriptions there or Nagasaki or Tokyo, but if that's the kind of cultural blinders you're working with here on a certain segment of the military community in Japan, and they have a veto power over policy, what's the kind of tragedy sort of when you look at how it turned out and it is with almost a sense of resignation that when the emperor decides that we're going to finally give in here.

3672
05:24:18,230 --> 05:24:29,320
In surrender, a coup is attempted by the same mid-level military guise who've had an inordinate amount of impact over policy all along.

3673
05:24:29,320 --> 05:24:38,990
Right, we talked about them, these lieutenant colonels and these mid-level guys who actually bully and scare their superiors, decide they're not going to stand for this.

3674
05:24:38,990 --> 05:24:40,570
They try to attempt to coup.

3675
05:24:40,570 --> 05:24:48,790
They want to get their hands on the emperor's message to the public, announcing that they're going to surrender before it can be broadcast, people will die.

The coupons will eventually realize they've failed.

They'll try to take over a radio station just so they want to be able to explain their motives.

3679
05:24:55,620 --> 05:24:57,720
It's denied they'll kill themselves.

3680
05:24:57,720 --> 05:25:15,480
Some other people commit suicide, but you see the last gasp of these people trying to make a play for things to prevent this surrender, which they've had a large hand in delaying to this point, and there are generals we should point on the mainland who've been beating the Chinese.

3681
05:25:15,480 --> 05:25:18,340
Who are going to look at this idea that they have to surrender is crazy.

3682
05:25:18,340 --> 05:25:21,540
We're going to have to go over and surrender to the people whose, but we've been kicking.

3683
05:25:21,540 --> 05:25:22,550
I don't think so.

Don't forget heru Onoda and a ton of other Japanese troops on these Pacific islands aren't going to go anywhere for decades, no matter what the emperor does here, no other army had the phenomenon of their soldiers, thousands of them fighting for years and years after the war was over.

3686
05:25:48,180 --> 05:26:07,980
Either because they were such true believers, they were never going to surrender regardless of what the truth of the situation happened to be or because they were such true believers that they refused to believe the truth of the situation was true, but you didn't see this phenomenon in any of the other major armies in the second world war.

3687
05:26:07,980 --> 05:26:10,500
And it's rare to see it in any war, ever.

3697
05:26:56,690 --> 05:27:15,480
Knew exactly when it started and everyone figured it out exactly the same time, and because of what the Japanese people went through Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the door is opened to a third world war.

3698

Which would be civilization's transformative, as Albert Einstein is supposed to have said that he didn't know with what weapons world war 3 would be fought the world war 4, he said, would be fought with sticks and stones.

3704
05:28:18,700 --> 05:28:33,100
The second world war is one of those rare wars where civilian casualties vastly outnumbered military casualties in the first world war wasn't that way at, but military casualties are significant to just in that theater, the allies lose 4 million allied dead.

3705
05:28:33,100 --> 05:28:34,470
A lot of those Chinese.

3706
05:28:34,470 --> 05:28:50,070
We forget that the Chinese play the role in the Asia Pacific theater that the soviets play in the European one ones who suck up the majority of the damage and keep the enemy occupied and of those forces.

3707
05:28:50,070 --> 05:29:17,540
2 and a half million Japanese military deaths approximately and a million civilian ones, these are the kind of death totals that will stick with you for a while, and it's hard for me not to notice that we haven't had a great war between the great powers in the 75 years since the second war war ended.

Of course, there might be another reason for that, and I can't help but notice that we haven't used nuclear weapons on human beings since either the human being.

When the Japanese are thrown out of places like Korea, Yeah.

3714
05:29:51,500 --> 05:30:24,880
What moves into that vacuum, or do the Koreans just take over the next 15 to 25 years are going to be all of these areas having independence movements, nationalist movements, communist insurgencies and all kinds of things that can be tied directly to you, them having a soft or not so soft landing from their colonial errors and a lot of historians can can draw direct connections between the Japanese throwing out the colonial overlords when they initially took.

3715
05:30:24,880 --> 05:30:39,790
Over those areas and the amplification and acceleration of trends toward independence that were already underway in most of these places, and if they were, they were by the time the allies tried to retake control of them from the Japanese at the end of the war.

3716
05:30:39,790 --> 05:30:42,110
I mean, the Indians were going to get independence pretty soon.

No matter what.

3718
05:30:42,780 --> 05:30:54,230
They were well on their way, and it's only a couple of years after the second world war that they get independence, but you're going to have things with Korea and Malaysia and Vietnam, and the rest of indochina.

3719
05:30:54,230 --> 05:30:55,720
I mean, this is all gonna be shaking out.

3720
05:30:55,720 --> 05:31:01,390
There will be contributing to the death and destruction and the human being conveyor belt of death.

3721
05:31:01,390 --> 05:31:05,590
You know, the subsidiary second world war version for decades to come.

3722
05:31:05,590 --> 05:31:06,450
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

3723
05:31:06,450 --> 05:31:07,750
Here's the the part.

3724
05:31:07,750 --> 05:31:19,950
Though, that I try to reconcile, and I never have, which is if the end result is something that people celebrate right, if if a a nation's independence from outsiders, for example.

3725
05:31:19,950 --> 05:31:41,110
Is dependent on all these terrible things happening, is it worth it, can you put a price in lives and destruction on political or national independence that may be something that the answer differs depending on who you ask.

3726
05:31:41,110 --> 05:31:42,280
[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]

3727
05:31:42,280 --> 05:31:58,050
But what it does do is raise all sorts of questions that will lead you into moral quagmire after moral quagmire, and you start with the idea that it either inadvertently or by design.

3728
05:31:58,050 --> 05:32:15,500
Does this mean that the Japanese price began to portray their armies in these pan Asian terms, these east Asia co prosperities fear driven terms, does that mean their army actually was the military tip of the spear of the non white world.

3729
05:32:15,500 --> 05:32:16,090
[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

3730
05:32:16,090 --> 05:32:27,200
You know, playing its role in doing what none of these colonial oppressed societies could do militarily, defeat the colonial overlords, and is there some truth to that, then.

3731
05:32:27,200 --> 05:32:27,890
If there is.

3732
05:32:27,890 --> 05:32:31,780
How does that change the morality of the overall situation?

3733
05:32:31,780 --> 05:32:32,440
Right.

3734
05:32:32,440 --> 05:32:48,080
If you say that you can't put a price on national political independence, what if you're the Chinese and it cost you 20 million civilians to get yours and the people that killed those people at the Japanese, are you thankful to them for that?

3735
05:32:48,080 --> 05:32:51,120
It's it'll tie you up into moral knots.

3736
05:32:51,120 --> 05:32:53,840
Wondered how about another one, because if you play that game.

3737
05:32:53,840 --> 05:32:54,270
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

3738
05:32:54,270 --> 05:33:01,240
You know by taking the first step and wondering if the Japanese at the tip of the sphere is freeing all these well.

3739
05:33:01,240 --> 05:33:12,570
Could you make the argument that the allies are the equivalent of the democratic tip of the spear doing the same thing for the Japanese people that they're doing for other Asian peoples elsewhere?

3740
05:33:12,570 --> 05:33:15,460
I mean, freeing them from an oppressive.

3741
05:33:15,460 --> 05:33:33,300
Authoritarian, totalitarian sudo fascist state in his book embracing defeat, historian John dower looks at the postwar situation in Japan and one of the elements the focuses on is how some Japanese viewed it that way.

3742
05:33:33,300 --> 05:33:34,190
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

3743
05:33:34,190 --> 05:33:40,910
Usually the people who had been most oppressed under the old regime artists, free thinkers.

3744
05:33:40,910 --> 05:33:53,390
Liberals, communists, socialists, leftists of all kinds, people who would end up in prison or tortured or censured or watched victims of the secret police in the state.

3745
05:33:53,390 --> 05:33:53,870
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

3746
05:33:53,870 --> 05:34:13,800
They often in dowers um book look like people who view themselves as having been freed by an alliance of other countries, which is the way the United States will often portray its interventionist activities after the second world war, right, we don't have a problem with the people of this place.

3747
05:34:13,800 --> 05:34:15,890
It's their government, their government's not free.

3748
05:34:15,890 --> 05:34:20,210
We're going to come in there to feed their military, give them the freedom that they didn't have before.

3749
05:34:20,210 --> 05:34:21,050
Let them run their own.

3750
05:34:21,050 --> 05:34:52,120
I would get it in Japan, and we did it in Japan a revolution as a gift was the way some of these Japanese portrayed in in his book dollar reprints a cartoon from Japanese cartoonist cato at 0, where he portrays the Japanese as an individual in the foreground of one of these pieces of art, a human being whose hands had been tied behind his back, and then he has just had the bonds severed by a giant pair of scissors that is over his head in the piece of artwork.

3751
05:34:52,120 --> 05:34:56,600
And the scissors are sort of clothed in the stars and stripes garbs.

3752
05:34:56,600 --> 05:35:14,900
You get the idea that the scissors represent the United, the Japanese person who had been in bondage represents Japan, and in the distance running away from the scene of the crime, you can see the two figures, one who is dressed as a military high level muckety muck, representing the militarists.

3753
05:35:14,900 --> 05:35:31,770
The other looks like Mr monopoly from your monopoly game, and he represents the fat cat Richie elites who are the puppet masters in the society and now the outside powers led by the United States in this case have freed the Japanese people and handed democracy back to them, and you know, I mean.

3754
05:35:31,770 --> 05:35:32,570
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

3755
05:35:32,570 --> 05:35:40,090
It's interesting to contemplate because a lot of societies evolve politically through bloodshed.

3756
05:35:40,090 --> 05:35:50,730
I mean, how many countries get independence from other countries through bloodshed, how many get independence from their own oppressive governments by political revolution, right, the American Revolution, the French revolution.

3757
05:35:50,730 --> 05:35:51,870
Bloody affairs.

3758
05:35:51,870 --> 05:35:52,370
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

3759
05:35:52,370 --> 05:36:02,080
There's just a different vibe, isn't there, when it's people from outside your country who have to kill your soldiers, your civilians, destroy your cities.

3760
05:36:02,080 --> 05:36:06,140
Occupy your territory in order to give you these good things.

3761
05:36:06,140 --> 05:36:21,040
It's fascinating to think about and like so much of the frayed ends of the rope at the end of the second world war, how many loose ends here leave us wondering about moral questions.

3762
05:36:21,040 --> 05:36:36,280
I mean, how about the number one question that often comes out of this time period, the morality of the dropping of the atomic bomb now I am on record as saying that I think this is one of the most important ethical sorts of circumstances.

3763
05:36:36,280 --> 05:36:49,990
One can ask themselves about something that the entire potential future of humanity could rest on, and its importance becomes clear any time.

3764
05:36:49,990 --> 05:37:04,810
The issue actually raises its ugly head, like in the middle of the Cuban Missile crisis, everyone instantly understood the import of this in a moral issue known as nuclear weapons.

3765
05:37:04,810 --> 05:37:13,520
And this almost Shakespearean question of to atomic bomb or to not atomic bomb, what is not helpful, useful.

3766
05:37:13,520 --> 05:37:31,870
Satisfying, or in any way instructive for the next time we might consider using such a weapon is to take it out of the context of the times because you end up creating a moral choice that never really existed for the people who had to make it, and then judging them on that.

3767
05:37:31,870 --> 05:37:32,380
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

3768
05:37:32,380 --> 05:37:33,940
It's as though you have a plan.

3769
05:37:33,940 --> 05:37:44,310
A drop atomic weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki or plan b don't drop atomic weapons on them, and they can live happily ever after, but that was never planned.

3770
05:37:44,310 --> 05:37:53,720
B plan b is the one that makes plan a something that people would consider plan b is not to drop the atomic bomb.

3771
05:37:53,720 --> 05:37:55,940
But to continue with the fire bombing.

3772
05:37:55,940 --> 05:38:14,280
Which continued after the atomic bombs were dropped as well, historically continue with the fire bombing tightened the blockade on Japan, and they're already dropping sea mines from the air on Japan's harbors, so get that to a point where millions are dying from starvation or lack of medicine.

3773
05:38:14,280 --> 05:38:15,160
[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

3774
05:38:15,160 --> 05:38:33,580
And then had the inevitable land invasion against a bunch of civilians who are training with bamboo spears in 1945, that was the ethical choice, and it becomes a lot more murky, and when those are the planning and plan b choices, what should be pointed out.

3775
05:38:33,580 --> 05:38:51,680
Those sometimes is that our views on these things have been colored by the intervening history, and when you read what historical participants on the allied side saw these weapons like sometimes you might compare them to x caliber.

3776
05:38:51,680 --> 05:39:06,060
A super weapon that has fallen into the hands of people who see themselves as king Arthur and a weapon like x calibre in the hands of an individual like king Arthur is a potential awesome force for good.

3777
05:39:06,060 --> 05:39:07,940
[ SPACE 1.9 secs ]

3778
05:39:07,940 --> 05:39:21,910
See how murky and morally I mean, this is, this is the ethical dilemma of sour Ron's ring right in the lord of the rings isn't I hope you will forgive me for once again.

3779
05:39:21,910 --> 05:39:22,270
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

3780
05:39:22,270 --> 05:39:29,620
Somehow, with my cynical nature, seeing a silver lining to the dark cloud, that is.

3781
05:39:29,620 --> 05:39:36,500
The atomic bombings of Japan and it's a similar silver lining to the 1 I see for the holocaust.

3782
05:39:36,500 --> 05:39:37,840
[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]

3783
05:39:37,840 --> 05:39:53,610
I think that after the holocaust, the fact that there was a holocaust saved a lot of lives, I think those who died in concentration camps probably created such an international historical shock.

3784
05:39:53,610 --> 05:40:03,680
I don't know how long it lasts, but it certainly lasted pretty strongly since that created an international line in the sand that has been violated many times since.

3785
05:40:03,680 --> 05:40:05,420
I mean, look at Rwanda, for example.

3786
05:40:05,420 --> 05:40:06,220
[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

3787
05:40:06,220 --> 05:40:15,220
That has created a situation where it is radioactive to commit genocide on people.

3788
05:40:15,220 --> 05:40:16,530
[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]

3789
05:40:16,530 --> 05:40:27,620
The weaker is notwithstanding, perhaps I think the genocides that would have happened had the holocaust not happened, haven't happened, and therefore, I think the holocaust saves lives.

3790
05:40:27,620 --> 05:40:28,070
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

3791
05:40:28,070 --> 05:40:30,080
I feel the same way about the atomic bombings.

3792
05:40:30,080 --> 05:40:40,510
I I don't know if humanity ever collectively learns lessons, but if we do, I often think it comes with the equivalent of us.

3793
05:40:40,510 --> 05:41:07,200
You know, touching history's hot stove, and in this case in 1945, maybe the hot stove was an atomically heated, and had we not had an example of what these weapons do to people and to our society and the things that we build, you know, the power is that one historian said to turn everything into nothing.

3794
05:41:07,200 --> 05:41:07,650
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

3795
05:41:07,650 --> 05:41:19,110
That's a theoretical power until you see it, and seeing it is shocking and the shock of it may have prevented us maybe from thinking we ever had to try to use these weapons again.

3796
05:41:19,110 --> 05:41:24,150
I mean, think about had the weapon been delayed another year.

3797
05:41:24,150 --> 05:41:50,390
And the war ended before nuclear weapons were ever used, do you think given what you know about how we are that we wouldn't have used them in the interim just to see what they do, and we were tempted many times, and it was always Hiroshima Nagasaki zi example that created, if not a feeling on the parts of the military or the political leaders may be as strongly as we wanted.

3798
05:41:50,390 --> 05:42:02,290
Certainly a feeling on the parts of of global humanitarian public opinion and the pressures you know exerted by them and the that were certainly, for example.

3799
05:42:02,290 --> 05:42:17,940
Cascading through president Kennedy's brain as he contemplated the decisions he was making in the 1962 Cuban Missile crisis when he was looking at 6 or 700 million people dying, you know, in a few days.

3800
05:42:17,940 --> 05:42:19,870
[ SPACE 1.9 secs ]

3801
05:42:19,870 --> 05:42:49,470
Is it possible the humanity and the Japanese specifically suffered a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand two hundred and fifty thousand deaths from a couple of ten kiloton atomic bombs, maybe a 15 kiloton one in nagasakiya case to teach us not to use dozens or hundreds of 30 megaton ones.

3802
05:42:49,470 --> 05:42:51,230
[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]

3803
05:42:51,230 --> 05:43:01,020
I mean, if that's the case, is this the atomic age beginning nightmarish, so that it doesn't have to end that way someday.

3804
05:43:01,020 --> 05:43:01,470
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

3805
05:43:01,470 --> 05:43:14,160
So that we don't have to have, you know, the war after the next war occur with our very best technological capabilities and those being sticks and stones.

3806
05:43:14,160 --> 05:43:22,330
[ SPACE 8.2 secs ]

3807
05:43:22,330 --> 05:43:23,330
Hi, everyone, Dan, here.

3808
05:43:23,330 --> 05:43:25,520
We're just a couple of quick words before we leave.

3809
05:43:25,520 --> 05:43:26,240
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

3810
05:43:26,240 --> 05:43:31,730
The first one is if you were interested enough in the ideas surrounding strategic bombing.

3811
05:43:31,730 --> 05:43:42,190
That's the bombing of cities or the early history development use theories, ah, trying to come to grips with its potential destructive power of atomic and nuclear weapons.

3812
05:43:42,190 --> 05:43:45,400
We do have past shows on both of those subjects.

3813
05:43:45,400 --> 05:43:46,060
[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

3814
05:43:46,060 --> 05:44:00,500
1 is still in the free feed as of this recording anyway, and that is the destroyer of worlds that's about 6 hours on that subject, so maybe wait for a long car drive, but we also have in the pay for archives off of our website.

3815
05:44:00,500 --> 05:44:03,940
They're like two or three bucks, I think, um, logical insanity.

3816
05:44:03,940 --> 05:44:13,040
The title of which we referenced in the past show you just heard twice, maybe and also logical insanity extra for the stuff that didn't fit into logical insanity.

3817
05:44:13,040 --> 05:44:16,070
And those are um available on the website that sounds interesting to you.

3818
05:44:16,070 --> 05:44:16,470
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

3819
05:44:16,470 --> 05:44:21,150
Once again, I want to thank you for being the most patient audience on the planet, and we appreciate it.

3820
05:44:21,150 --> 05:44:24,070
It allows us to do the work with the way we wanna do.

3821
05:44:24,070 --> 05:44:25,380
[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]

3822
05:44:25,380 --> 05:44:43,430
Also another announcement for those of you who didn't get to see and want to see our first world war immersive, experienced exhibit war remains just wanna let you know that it is now a part of the national world war I museum and memorial in Kansas City Missouri, and you can go see it there.

3823
05:44:43,430 --> 05:44:43,880
[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

3824
05:44:43,880 --> 05:44:44,990
This is the full set.

3825
05:44:44,990 --> 05:44:46,250
By the way we're talking, I mean.

3826
05:44:46,250 --> 05:44:49,280
There's a home version of this, but it doesn't have the actual set.

3827
05:44:49,280 --> 05:44:49,660
[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

3828
05:44:49,660 --> 05:45:03,080
It doesn't have the giant speakers under your feet to make the sound of things like shells vibrate through your spinal column is a whole bunch of things that the actual we we said it combined like virtual reality in a haunted house when you were a kid in terms of you know.

3829
05:45:03,080 --> 05:45:04,730
You can reach out and touch things.

3830
05:45:04,730 --> 05:45:08,270
And they're there, right, barbed wire rats.

3831
05:45:08,270 --> 05:45:16,880
Everything feels just the way, um the people at M W M and at flight school and at skywalker sound um.

3832
05:45:16,880 --> 05:45:19,810
They outdid themselves with this, and if you have the home edition, that's great too.

3833
05:45:19,810 --> 05:45:27,350
But there's nothing like standing on those speakers and just having it, you know, knock your socks off, so if you find yourself in Kansas City Missouri.

3834
05:45:27,350 --> 05:45:32,550
And you'd like to experience it head over to the national world war I museum and memorial, and I check it out.

3835
05:45:32,550 --> 05:45:33,400
Would you tell em?

3836
05:45:33,400 --> 05:45:33,950
I sent you.
