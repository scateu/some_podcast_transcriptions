1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,792
What you're about to hear is part

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:04,352
4 of a multi-part series on the first world

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,192
If you like your stories to have some sort of cohesive

4
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:11,008
Linear narrative flow although I'm not promising

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,080
But if that's what you like we're

6
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:16,384
Probably better off suggesting you go check out

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,688
Episode number one and work your way to here

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,016
You don't care about that kind of stuff at all you just don't trust me to

9
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,832
To deliver a cohesive linear narrative flowing

10
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,600
Blame you

11
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,136
Well then by all means start he

12
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:27,904
Kira part 4

13
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:31,488
And check out this series that we're calling blueprint

14
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,256
Armageddon

15
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:37,376
December 7th 1941

16
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:41,216
A date which will live

17
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,384
In infamy

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,968
The events

19
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:11,168
Call nist time and place I take pride in the words ich bin ein Berliner

20
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:30,368
I welcome this kind of examination

21
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:36,768
Weather now

22
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:41,632
We are not descended from fearful men

23
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,216
Hardcore history

24
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,944
How do you Market

25
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:55,968
War

26
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,296
How do you sell combat

27
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,624
To the people who are actually going to have to engage

28
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,440
Hypothetical question

29
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,256
Any military

30
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:14,912
That requires volunteers to decide they want to join the service has to think about how you actually

31
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,472
Sell the idea to the people who

32
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,008
You'll have to take part in it

33
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,592
An idea that carries with it the potential for

34
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:27,456
Some very nasty outcomes in the very worst of circumstances done that the difficult

35
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,504
Job perhaps to Market

36
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,784
Combat

37
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,368
Easier to do in peacetime though right if you have to sell

38
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,440
Suntan oil to people in Alaska

39
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,000
You might be able to pull that off in the summer

40
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,560
In December it's a really tough sell

41
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,376
The first world war breaks out

42
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,912
If you're trying to Market

43
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,216
Recruitment into the British army

44
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:53,568
You can sell the same sort of talking points the same soda angles that have worked

45
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,224
For governments and monarchies and tribes going back to the beginning of civilization the military's long hair

46
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,016
Certain selling points

47
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,040
I think we're all familiar

48
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:03,808
With them

49
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:08,672
Add regular pay thrown into that as well

50
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
Heroism

51
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,000
The adventure

52
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,560
The status and meaning of this a lot of things

53
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,120
Some people just like to fight I mean you never know

54
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,424
The problem is is that

55
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,752
That's a pre 1914

56
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,384
In a talking point when it comes to what happens when the first world war breaks out

57
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,224
And how that just totally messes with your marketing strategy

58
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,760
Unless you're marketing

59
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,040
Hell

60
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,088
As a travel destination

61
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,136
You can't

62
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:44,768
No matter how much press censorship you have in the British had plenty in the first world war just like everyone else

63
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,304
You can't mask

64
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
Those kind of casual

65
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,400
Now you can mask the reality the sort of stuff that

66
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:54,496
These newspaper reporters who were sent there during the war after the war

67
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,824
You know they would write books telling you the real story what really happened

68
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,896
Tell you to never imagined it was all censored by the Press

69
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,688
Even with the censorship

70
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,456
You can't

71
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,480
Haida

72
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:10,880
Death and destruction and dismemberment and you see the people returning to your hometown with a horrible wounds you hear some of the rumors whilst

73
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
Stories

74
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,952
You know it's not going to be fun

75
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,024
All of a sudden the marketers

76
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,303
In

77
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,607
Great Britain's recruitment

78
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,887
Operation

79
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,679
To play hardball

80
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,287
No more just throwing out carrots they're going to use some sticks to

81
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,847
In the US we have a twenty-first-century

82
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,407
Volunteer army ourselves in the US uses

83
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,199
Just carrots to

84
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,247
Encourage people to join up

85
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,807
Will pay you more will pay you for college

86
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,647
You'll make something of your life I mean there's all these different things that they used to motivate

87
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,415
People but they're not

88
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,439
Very many sticks

89
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,463
In the USSR

90
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,815
Once the first couple of weeks of the first world war happen

91
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,351
And everybody together

92
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:59,007
Find out how enormous this is going to be in in an absolutely stunning group wake up call where the light goes on over everyone's head

93
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
And they're going

94
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,311
Oh my gosh you don't have enough

95
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,335
Resources

96
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:07,199
Oh my gosh you don't have enough money for a war like this and oh my gosh we don't have enough people

97
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,623
And even some of these larger States who you think yourself off you know people shouldn't be a problem look at how many people are coming up every generation

98
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
Remember

99
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,951
Manpower in the old

100
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:24,607
You are quotes means Manpower across-the-board not just the people fighting on the front line but the people that can still be

101
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,167
Miners to extract

102
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,471
The material you need to carry on the war

103
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:35,615
Or people working in arms manufacturing plant so that they can build the bombs you need to fight the war

104
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,663
In other words if you take too much

105
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,455
Jethro on the fighting line

106
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:44,319
You won't have enough people back home making the stuff that the people on the fighting line need to win

107
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,879
Manpower becomes a very big deal

108
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,975
All these other countries in the war Germany France Russia no problem they've spent

109
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:55,071
Decades working out of conscription operation where they draft people

110
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,727
Yeah yeah come of age you do a couple years in the service and then you become Parts the reserves then you become part 2 the other Reserve

111
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,263
Heavier than older reserve and

112
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:09,663
You know after a while they got a whole revolving self-perpetuating system in place where they every generation comes up

113
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,199
They're cranking out new soldiers

114
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,991
Except for Great Britain

115
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,295
The last

116
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,087
Volunteer service

117
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,439
Involved in this conflict when it breaks out it puts unique pressures on them

118
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,511
The first thing they do is simply

119
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:30,399
Ask people to join I remember 1914 you didn't quite know what you were in for you could still sell the old

120
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,679
Selling point uniform

121
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,959
Wonderful in the women

122
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,543
You look dashing and is just War Adventure

123
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:42,687
Kill the boss you know all the good methods of King needs a new king and country all the things that have always work and still work

124
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
A lot of cases

125
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,247
Special in peacetime

126
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,295
Work and more

127
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,343
Stokes and Britain and Scotland

128
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,183
Canada Australian all these places signed up than they even could handle

129
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,511
I'm looking for a couple hundred thousand got a lot more than that

130
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,583
But that's before the casualties

131
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
Start happening

132
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,911
Unpatriotic Britain sign up

133
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,239
But you don't know how many patriotic britons unit you're going to need and not just

134
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,079
In one big lump but every month to replace the troops you lose

135
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,919
In late 1915 the British just lose

136
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,943
At Gallipoli

137
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:20,063
And they walk away after a couple of months with 250000 casualties

138
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,367
You don't just replace those

139
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,743
By playing nice and easy and saying come and Fight For King and Country using more Hardball method

140
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:34,911
And one of the ones that I've always thought was just indicative of something that you imagined it in modern times it boggles the Mind using up a strata

141
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,959
How'd you like this today but it's an absolute genius

142
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,263
Shows exactly

143
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,055
The most vulnerable point

144
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,591
In a young man's

145
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,919
Your psyche in the place where you're a marketer you're looking for

146
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,759
In what motivates people how you can touch these

147
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,551
These elements of influence in

148
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,343
The order

149
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,391
I'm the feather the white feather movement

150
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:01,279
Is absolutely brilliant in that regard I mean it's almost devious you try to imagine our government doing something like this today

151
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:04,095
Modern 21st century technology

152
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,375
Basically

153
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,191
You know when August or early September 1914 rolls around

154
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:14,079
There's an admiral in the British admiralty who's working like everyone else to think about it when I come in Courage more people

155
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,127
To sign up for this horrible War

156
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,919
And comes up with

157
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:21,247
You know in an attack on a motivational marketing strategy

158
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,343
He's going to enlist patriotic young British women

159
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:30,719
To walk the streets of all these towns in Britain their Hometown in over their people they know

160
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,999
And if they see

161
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:32,767
Men

162
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,095
Not in uniform who look like they could be or should be

163
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,631
They're going to go up

164
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,191
Surround this person and start

165
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:44,543
Saying the most horrible thing you are powered and all these terrible things to them

166
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,591
Pretty women

167
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:50,175
In public dressing you down if you're 18 years old

168
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,967
That's a pretty

169
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,759
Good marketing

170
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,063
You're changing someone's armor to exploit

171
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
Not just that

172
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,415
You're probably and usually were on the street of your hometown

173
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:04,255
Where the passers-by know you or your family

174
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,791
This is April

175
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,095
Soundly embarrassing moment

176
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,423
You know everyone around you everyone connected with you

177
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:17,567
God forbid you have a girlfriend she's going to think this looks pretty bad for her to I mean that the affected was was huge

178
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,615
And then before this little group of women

179
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,407
We're done with you

180
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,431
They would put

181
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,967
A white feather

182
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,759
Signifying power death

183
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,575
On your lapel or somewhere very visible

184
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111
Yuan you

185
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927
This was not

186
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:39,071
An unusual occurrence there are accounts for people that say they were afraid to go outside the house sometimes

187
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
Because

188
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:40,863
These

189
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:47,263
Patriotic and zealous women who were really just trying to help that's the funny part this is the society motivating paper

190
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,799
Small bee sting

191
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,335
All the right virtues

192
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,431
But I've got an account from a 16 year old boy

193
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,223
Had to go through this

194
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:02,879
And then he signed up for the service cuz he was so definitely embarrassed and Afraid in an inch and ashamed and the service

195
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:09,279
This person laughed him out of the room but then said he looks so downtrodden exaggerated this height exaggerated is 8 in

196
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
Exaggerated

197
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,095
Wait and he was in

198
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,447
At 16-under 110 lb

199
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,983
On the Western Front

200
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,031
It's absolutely

201
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,383
Deviously clever one

202
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,967
Could backfire

203
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,759
He's created marketing

204
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,039
Recruitment ideas

205
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:35,391
Free cable the government felt the need to put out symbol that people could wear

206
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:40,255
To an already done their service overseas and have been wounded and honorably discharged

207
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:46,655
Or work for some really important armaments or war-related Industries couldn't be spared because apparently enough of those

208
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,703
Those people were being mistakenly

209
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,007
Given the order of the white feather treatment

210
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,823
To make that an important thing for the government to do

211
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,639
There were other Creative Marketing plans not

212
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,687
Sticks but carrots in one of them

213
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,247
Another brilliant woman you think about it on the surface

214
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:06,367
Involved the British government explaining to recruit that if you sign up with your pals your buddies

215
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,159
You could all serve together

216
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,951
Other people joined up

217
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:16,351
On the same street where the same Pub or the same Community or the same fraternity or the same profession

218
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:22,751
And they all served together they had Wonderful Name ZJ like military unit names that they're still known by I mean they were the Liverpool

219
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
Pool pal

220
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,079
Where the Grimsby Chums

221
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:30,175
I need friends all went to the service you figure if you got a Certain Magical do it with your friends

222
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,479
Can you get to watch your friends die

223
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,575
Heart we didn't really consider when we signed up and it sounded kind of fun

224
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
Not just that

225
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:42,975
When these units would get decimated in some of these terrible encounter for example you can be walking down a road

226
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:47,583
With your pals in the open and all of a sudden get caught by artillery fire

227
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,143
Supper 80% casualties and then

228
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,959
Instead of the losses and the suffering

229
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:58,591
And the grief being spread out so diluted across the width and breadth of the entire British Isles for

230
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,639
British Empire for that matter

231
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,687
Some local community

232
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,479
Or some fraternity

233
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,039
Or some profession just gets pounded

234
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,367
And there are Villages and towns in Britain now that

235
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,951
Had these terrible days just happened to the whole community

236
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,023
I'm pretty much everybody suffers a major lost one way or the other

237
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,303
At the downside of that

238
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,583
Clever marketing plan

239
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,887
By 1916

240
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,447
There's nothing clever enough to get enough people in you

241
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,007
The losses are so high

242
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,543
At the British finally do what

243
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,335
The British really don't do

244
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,383
And they started can scripting RPG

245
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
It's hard to blame the

246
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,503
List two for starting the same soda draft

247
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,551
That the Continental great Powers use

248
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:45,439
All you have to do is we said the casualties are so high look at them by the end of 1915 the British have suffered half-a-million casual

249
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,255
200000 of those are dead by the way

250
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:54,911
For a traditionally Naval power who has traditionally a rather small army by Continental standards

251
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,703
Huge numbers

252
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,799
Now you want to see what Continental standard look like

253
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
Look at the British Ally

254
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,359
The French

255
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:09,759
Who had a huge Army in the meat grinder since the first minute of this whole Affair and by the end of 1915 there cash

256
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,039
Casualties are over 2 million

257
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,111
More than 700 thousand of those order

258
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,463
And all these great powers are looking at the

259
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,767
Principal enemies and trying to figure out

260
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,607
How close they are to the throwing in the towel moment

261
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,959
The Germans are looking at the French and all the casualties they've suffered and they looking in their thinking

262
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
They must be

263
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,775
Be close to the end of their rope

264
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,079
The Germans have suffered more cash

265
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,639
By the end of 1915 the French

266
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,431
But they're fighting on more front

267
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,223
Right there fighting the French and the British in the West

268
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,783
Gigantic Russian forces

269
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,855
In the Eastern are involved in the Balkans a lot in 1915

270
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,463
Their casualties by the end of 1915 or over two-and-a-half million

271
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,303
About 750 thousand of those are dead

272
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,631
Hard to know the Germans list 250000

273
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,655
Missing

274
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:02,751
In this war people got blown to bits they got covered up by

275
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:08,383
Giant mountains of Earth that shells have blown up in the air falling back on the ground lot of missing people

276
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,943
Probably between 750 and 8

277
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
3000

278
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
Dad

279
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
Funny German

280
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
This point in the war

281
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,343
The Russians have suffered Titanic

282
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
Losses

283
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:18,879
From minute one

284
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,463
They lost a huge battle in 1915 called

285
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,743
Gorlice tarnow

286
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
Alisa Turner

287
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
And

288
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,119
That battle all by itself

289
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,423
They lost a hundred and fifty thousand.

290
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,239
Almost seven hundred thousand wounded

291
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,287
And basically a million

292
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,615
Titanic losses

293
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,711
Maybe it's easier to understand their monthly burn

294
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:48,831
By October 1915 the Russians are losing 235000 men

295
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,463
How sustainable is that you again you got to be looking at the Russians thinking

296
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,535
They're almost done and the German High command kind of is

297
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:02,143
Now the Germans can't be too happy though because they are main Ally

298
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,935
The austro-hungarians

299
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:10,335
Are suffering casualties that are every bit as momentous as the Russians but they don't have the manpower to back them

300
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:18,015
Meaning 1 4 month. In 1951 four month. The Austrian suffer

301
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:18,783
50000 cash

302
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
Boom

303
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,111
That's in addition

304
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,695
To the already astounding casualties they took in the

305
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
Few months

306
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,999
Right after the war started

307
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:33,119
The German several times will have to prop up the austrians just to keep them able to continue in the cons

308
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,447
The austrians are a pain in the rear

309
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
Germany

310
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
A lot of the time

311
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:43,615
Meaning for Eric Von falkenhayn the German commander in charge in January 1916 he can't stand them

312
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,455
They're always getting into some sort of disaster

313
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:51,039
That they then go to falkenhayn and ask for help getting out of

314
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:56,927
And to make matters worse it's usually a disaster than from falkenhayn warn them about an advance don't do that

315
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,975
It'll be a disaster and then they do it

316
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,815
Against his wishes and then coming after we bailed out multiple times

317
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,119
They can always play their

318
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,679
Their trump card though against Von falkenhayn

319
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:11,007
Legitimately considering the huge casualties they suffered

320
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,079
They can kind of go there and say we'll listen I mean you know if you don't help us

321
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:19,455
We're not that far from dropping out of the war I don't know I can't guarantee we'll be here in a few know you have to help them or it

322
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:23,295
Strategic disaster if the austro-hungarians drop out of the war

323
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,063
Right

324
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,903
The pom falkenhayn doesn't want to pay any attention to any.

325
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,951
Don't worry about the Russians

326
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:35,071
There are German generals and what not to keep saying the Russians that's how we win the war

327
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,607
Falcon I didn't hear about that

328
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,935
Doesn't want to focus in the Balkans although in 1915

329
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,215
They destroyed

330
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:41,983
Serbia

331
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,263
Get that out of the way

332
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:50,687
Pokemon doesn't want to hear about the Middle East in the turkey doesn't want to talk about Austrian her problem didn't want to know what it'll he's doing

333
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,735
He wants to focus on this

334
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,527
Maybe

335
00:16:54,783 --> 00:17:00,927
War winning or War losing gordian knot that is the puzzle that must be solved if you are a j

336
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,975
General task with winning this war

337
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,511
It's the Western Front

338
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,607
How you deal with that and it kind of does unprecedented problem

339
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:15,519
Yeah there's a famous German saying that may or may not have happened but it's it's infused this whole.

340
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:21,663
Where one German general supposed to commented about how amazingly the British troops

341
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,223
Thought and he said they're lying

342
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,039
And the sub-commander with him

343
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:31,647
Is supposed to have said something to the effect of yes lucky for us they're led by donkeys

344
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,231
1915 Western Front battles

345
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,279
Are with a donkey's first

346
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,303
Get label

347
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
With that

348
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:40,863
Education

349
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,911
The same time

350
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:47,007
When you realize that they have no metrics for what they're doing in 90

351
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:47,775
15

352
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,591
This has never been done before nobody's ever had this

353
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:54,175
Kind of Firepower nobody's ever put these kind of defenses up I mean

354
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,991
We're playing with all sorts of new military toys

355
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,807
And I've never been tested in a situation like this

356
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,831
How much slack

357
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,623
Do you cut the generals

358
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:07,999
And give them what is some time to call by historians in this case a learning curve

359
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,047
You're playing with p

360
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
People's lives

361
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,631
How slowly are you allowed to figure things out

362
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,215
We can go into any of the 1915 battle

363
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:23,359
Winston Churchill is just one of many people who objects to the whole idea of calling those battles

364
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,895
In the 1915

365
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,735
Ear or 1916 year or 1917 year battle

366
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:34,623
He says it's a disservice to what the name means she said there were battles in 1914 at the start of the war

367
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:39,231
Inner battles in 1918 at the end of the war but that stuff in the middle was a c

368
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
Price quote

369
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,351
These sanguinary prodigious struggle

370
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,935
Extending over many months are often Loosely described

371
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,703
As bottle

372
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:53,055
Judging by the number of men who took their turn in the fighting at different times

373
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:56,383
By the immense quantities of guns and shells employed

374
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,431
Am I the Hideous casualty total

375
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,967
They certainly rank

376
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,247
Taken as a whole

377
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,807
Among the largest events in military history

378
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,879
But we must not be misled by terminology

379
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,671
You have to call them battle

380
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:13,791
Was merely a method of presenting a general view of an otherwise confusing picture

381
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,583
It might well pass unchallenged

382
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,655
What are the temperatures been made by military commander

383
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,703
Am I a whole school of writers

384
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,239
To represent the

385
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,287
Prolonged operations

386
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,871
Has it been comparable to the decisive battles of the past

387
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,663
Only larger and more important

388
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,223
To yield to the specious argument

389
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,039
Is to be drawn into a holy wrong impression

390
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,831
Both of military science

391
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,391
And of what actually took place in the Great War

392
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
And quote

393
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
These

394
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,535
Battles on the Western Front

395
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,095
For a full three years in the conf

396
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,399
Look pretty much like this

397
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,935
As described

398
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,215
The historian

399
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,239
Hold your hair back

400
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,263
Quote

401
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,615
The fighting on the Western Front had taken on a deadly regularity

402
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,943
Attackers stormed enemy trenches in waves

403
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:09,343
Only to be mowed down by hostile machine gun fire when artillery as they tried to cut the wire in tank

404
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,391
That protected the earth works

405
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,415
And quote

406
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,975
There's a repetitive

407
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,767
To the fighting on the web

408
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,583
It's a repetitiveness that actually

409
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,863
Is associated

410
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,935
With World War 1 and the Western Front specifically

411
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,471
It's part of the tragedy

412
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
It adds

413
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,519
To the pain

414
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,311
Because after all

415
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,359
If you seen the same

416
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,663
Event over and over and over again

417
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687
Doesn't it

418
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,247
Become a different kind of tragic

419
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,831
If you watch the first wave of those young soldiers

420
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,671
Leave the safety of their trench go over-the-top at the

421
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:49,279
In a whistle of their officer get mowed down by Machine Gun fire

422
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,071
Before they've even gone 10ft

423
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,095
That's tragic

424
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:56,447
Another level of tragedy when the next wave gets up right behind them

425
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,239
To follow in their footsteps

426
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,031
Having already seen what

427
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,055
And to them

428
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,895
That's what we wanted to capture

429
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,431
In

430
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,967
Are discussions of the western

431
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,015
Because it became an issue

432
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:14,623
Early on how we're going to deal with all these battles that were roughly the same

433
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,903
Equally tragic

434
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,464
And for the soldiers on the ground

435
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,488
Eerily similar

436
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,792
When trying to figure out

437
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,608
What we wanted to highlight

438
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,704
A Shakespeare quote kept popping into my head when I was working on this

439
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,520
It was just lying that all the world's a stage

440
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,312
And all the people merely

441
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,080
Players

442
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,152
I thought to myself well that's what we have here

443
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,944
We have

444
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,784
One of the most extreme stages

445
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,064
In human history

446
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,624
We've created

447
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,440
With these Western Front battles in 1915 19

448
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,464
16 - 17

449
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,512
A hell like environment

450
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,304
And then

451
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,352
We forced millions of

452
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,120
People

453
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
2

454
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
Acton

455
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,032
Some of the most extreme situations

456
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,080
People have been put into ever

457
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:06,848
In his

458
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,432
And watching how they endure

459
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,736
Is sometimes

460
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,016
Soul crushing

461
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,808
Put another X

462
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,856
It's absolutely life-enhancing

463
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,672
Yeah sometimes you can

464
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,976
Benefit quite a bit

465
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,768
From the suffering

466
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,144
As we sat down

467
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:36,032
When we started this series and tried to figure out a creative approach to dealing with all these battles

468
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,592
One thing becomes very clear

469
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,640
We did some creative experiments

470
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,432
You quickly find out

471
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,456
Set the battles

472
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,992
In an emotional sense

473
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,064
Reach a point of diminishing returns very quick

474
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,368
You just become

475
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,392
Vietnam

476
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,160
The mall

477
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:56,768
All the scale the intensity the sheer horrific repetitive pounding

478
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,352
Eventually makes you stop feeling

479
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,168
It's a rather than go from

480
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,728
Indecisive and

481
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:09,056
Horrific battle to the next indecisive in horrific battle

482
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,872
We thought we would focus on a few

483
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,224
What we would consider to be almost signature battles if you will but

484
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,576
They provide a very similar backdrop for the poor individuals who have to live

485
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,112
In that environment

486
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:28,512
And allow us to sort of examine at a human level what's going on here a little bit as best we can

487
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:34,144
And to explore some of the questions that are very intriguing about the story and not just about the human suffering what about

488
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,424
Command Decisions

489
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,472
And some of the technology and some other things

490
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,800
Hopefully interspersed with a little bit of

491
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:44,640
In a comment about what's going on in the rest of the world while this is half

492
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:49,760
And part of what makes 1916 so difficult is there a lot of overlapping stuff

493
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:55,136
So if you tell it in the he said that she said that he said fashion

494
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,928
It becomes very confusing very quickly

495
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,720
The first thing to understand

496
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,048
Is that 1916 comes about

497
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:05,632
Obviously because of plans made in late 1950

498
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,680
Weed said you earlier

499
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:10,752
But this was a real question for the general

500
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:14,848
But how you solve this gordian knot that is the Western Front

501
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,224
Will in late 1950 in the Allied commands got together in a place called Chantilly in France

502
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,272
To deal with this question

503
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,552
Their plan

504
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:26,368
Was going to be to continue to pound

505
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,160
And pound harder

506
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,976
But the new aspect was

507
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,536
They were going to make sure that everybody

508
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,328
All the different allied powers

509
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,352
How did the

510
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,656
Central Powers Germany and Friends

511
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,936
At the same time

512
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,240
They were going to coordinate the rapper

513
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,776
This was going to

514
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,312
Nullify

515
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:49,920
What the Germans have been doing so far the Germans have a great Army but they can't be everywhere at once

516
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,456
Luckily for them

517
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:55,040
Up until 1916 they weren't attacked everywhere at 1

518
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,088
They would use something called

519
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:00,672
Interior lines it's a little like taking the center

520
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,720
Square in a game of tic-tac-toe

521
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,512
The Germans were able to use their wonderful

522
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,792
Railway system

523
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:10,400
To transfer troops from less threatened sectors to more hotspots

524
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:17,056
And thereby frustrate Allied efforts of the Allied plan for knocking down German fortifications to 1960s if they're all go

525
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,104
Attack it basically the same time

526
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,920
Frustrating the Germans ability to move troops to hotspot

527
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,224
The Germans had a different plan entirely

528
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,784
You see the people that Chantilly

529
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,112
1952 get together and decide to attack the Germans from multiple

530
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,904
In allocations at the same time

531
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,976
Are still for the most part envisioning the classic

532
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,768
Military in

533
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,048
To this war

534
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:44,960
They see the chances increased by attacking multiple locations that you're going to crack the German summer

535
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:51,360
When you crack them you're going to send your forces through the breach and you're going to send the calvary through and now the Germans are going to break in there going to be

536
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:56,736
Berlin and you know that's how these things and the minds of people who have a very

537
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,552
Especially old-fashioned View

538
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,576
Of War

539
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,880
There are additional

540
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:09,024
Dance to this idea who say even on the Allied side you got it all wrong it's not going to happen that way the technology

541
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,352
The specific circumstances the fact there are no flags on the Western Front

542
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,376
You're dreaming

543
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,192
Because you're dreaming your plans are going to work

544
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:20,288
On the German side the people who have this attitude

545
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,848
That that old-fashioned Viewpoint is just that

546
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,872
Old fashioned

547
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:28,480
Happened to be in positions of higher authority than the dissident generals on the other side

548
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,392
They looked at the way the war is going and figured out that the casualties

549
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,160
AR

550
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,440
The Difference Maker

551
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:41,536
And it all these countries are suffering because of the numbers of people that are dying

552
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:44,352
You need to increase the numbers of people who are dying

553
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:46,400
Not only does it become hard to replace them

554
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:50,752
Huge stresses and strains on the society they're losing you

555
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,056
Their families their governments

556
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,640
Some of these societies are fragile enough to Simply

557
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,944
You know fall apart like a house of cards

558
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:04,064
Others could have the entire population turned on the government and say we've had enough

559
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,856
That becomes the best

560
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,160
To end the war in the minds of some of these

561
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,256
A guy like the leader in Germany Erich von falkenhayn

562
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,816
Is looking at what these 1950

563
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,352
Gamebattles taught him

564
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,192
And they taught him that Modern Warfare on the Western Front

565
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,240
Turns into a meat grinder

566
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,520
No matter what you do

567
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,104
He comes up with the brilliant idea again most of story

568
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:27,872
Still think

569
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,408
Some people say it's

570
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,224
Shooting an arrow on painting a bullseye around it afterwards

571
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,040
He comes up with a brilliant idea that these meet Brian orser

572
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:39,904
Happening no matter what you design the Battle of me like what if you designed the battle to be like a meat grinder

573
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,696
What you create

574
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,232
Amy grinder

575
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,792
And then entice the enemy to come into it

576
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,608
If that's what's so effective on the battlefield

577
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,144
What if you plan

578
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,680
To grind meat

579
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,264
Instead of having it be a by-product of other activities and play

580
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,360
Valkenhayn late 1915 determines that the French

581
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:03,456
Are already in or near their breaking point in terms of the casualties they suffer

582
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,040
And he goes to the rest of the military command he starts talking about

583
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:10,112
What do you like to do in 1916 to try to win the war

584
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,160
He wants to set

585
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:12,928
Trap

586
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,232
The French army

587
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,816
The idea is to

588
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,584
Create

589
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,864
One of these

590
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,936
In a modern 20th century

591
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,216
Patricia hampl

592
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,752
Wendy's meat grinder

593
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,824
And then lure the French army into

594
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,128
For that you need

595
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:32,896
Bait

596
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,968
And the determination on where this off

597
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:37,504
Happen

598
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:41,600
Is dependent on what site can be chosen

599
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,880
That would best

600
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,672
Play the role of bait

601
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:51,072
And I should point out that historians from different countries disagree on this Americans and British historians often point out that this site

602
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:54,144
Chosen has no real military value at all

603
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,192
It was solely chosen cousins

604
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,728
The perfect emotional bait

605
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,032
To lure the French army into the meat grinder

606
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,568
German and

607
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:05,408
French historians though often assert that this site did have military

608
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,432
Importance and that that

609
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:09,504
You did create a real military need to do

610
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,296
What's a French ended up doing

611
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,320
Nonetheless

612
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,600
The German plan

613
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,416
Is to use all this artillery first

614
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,208
Pulverized the defenses

615
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,000
Around this important site

616
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,024
Did the French

617
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,304
You have an emotional

618
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,840
Political and everything else attached

619
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,608
22

620
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,936
Blow the French off of these Hills

621
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,704
Austin overlook

622
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,472
The city

623
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,776
The city called for John

624
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:38,176
And then fortify the hills bring your guns up there start shooting at the city of Verdun

625
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:38,944
And wait for the

626
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,480
French army to show up

627
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,528
Open try to knock you off those Hills

628
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,600
And knowing the superiority of

629
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,880
Prepare defenses

630
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:51,232
The French are just going to bash themselves up against your barbed wire you

631
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,768
You're trying to use your machine guns

632
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:57,376
Your Cannon and everything else in a place that was specifically designed to be a killing field

633
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,680
Thoroughly

634
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,960
Attritional

635
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:04,800
Bloody 20th century way to conduct Warfare

636
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,104
But it's not a bad idea

637
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,176
It also should be no surprise

638
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:15,040
The battle that was designed to act like a meat grinder

639
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,112
Turns into one of the most horrible battles of

640
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:18,880
Ball time

641
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,488
Even the name when I hear it

642
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,512
Verdun

643
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,560
It's like Stalingrad

644
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:29,376
It really is at one of those names that just conjures up a

645
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:32,704
Specific Imaging in and level of Horror

646
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,008
That puts it in a special place

647
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,544
In military history

648
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:43,456
Sort of like if you said you know where is the worst place in the world ever be in military history like a tie

649
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:45,504
Between a million different spots right

650
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,552
Mankind had a long enough past

651
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:51,392
Is that there are recurring examples of horror riffic places

652
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,696
To end up on any given day we like to site

653
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,720
The famous

654
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:57,792
Battle between the Romans and carthaginians thousands of years ago

655
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,584
We're all those Romans were

656
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,168
Surrounded in trapped and killed over the whole long day and it's terrible

657
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,008
Probably about as bad as a lot of other terrible situation

658
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,288
There's a few

659
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,848
Or you just go okay that's as bad

660
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,640
As the Battle of cannae sort of

661
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,176
But at artillery

662
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,224
Madonna's like nothing

663
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,760
That has ever happened

664
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,320
Really on a large-scale and I'm sure again

665
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:24,160
Mankind's a long history everything's kind of tried nothing new Under the Sun as they say

666
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:30,048
The vagina special for John is so special in fact and so different and so outside the box for the

667
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,840
Thinking of the time.

668
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:37,216
When fogging hind comes up with the idea that he's going to bleed France

669
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:37,984
White

670
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,264
His words

671
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:46,688
It's so runs against the grain of the nineteenth-century sort of morality of warfare remember we started this

672
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,712
Warren Muir

673
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:53,088
Year-and-a-half ago wearing white gloves with people who dualed when they were in school together

674
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,160
And who thought of this in almost especially on the Western Front

675
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:01,024
Gallant kind of sense right we exchange swords when we surrender and all the stuff

676
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:06,144
And now we have generals thinking okay how can I lower millions of men into a confined space

677
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:09,984
And just pound them into marmalade

678
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,288
To quote one French soldiers

679
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,080
Way of explaining what happened

680
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:19,968
One of the things I love by the way about this. Just like I love it about the Second World War

681
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:24,576
Is that we have a lot of the actual words of the generals themselves

682
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:31,232
They all wrote Memoirs as we said after the war most of the time trying to defend their reputation against their critics

683
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,792
Cuz after this war everyone's pointing fingers at everybody

684
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,888
You know because it was so terrible and people were so angry and and so

685
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:44,800
Mad at General's amongst other people that they were looking to blame that all these General right pieces defending

686
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,568
The right here

687
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:52,224
We have Falken Hinesville ludendorff we have all these guys Memoirs now you can't take him you know what face value remember there

688
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:52,992
Trying to

689
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,808
Stakeout of historical position here in defense of Their Own

690
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:56,832
Historical

691
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:03,232
Reputation none-the-less falkenhayn you don't need your love falkenheiner hate me has his fans and he has his detractors

692
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:07,584
I'm one of his van but I like the way his mind works in the way he writes in his book where he

693
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,984
Written right after the war where he's trying to explain his thinking on this he runs down and logical fashion you where he seized

694
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,520
The war in 1915

695
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:20,128
And it's not that bad for the Central Powers you'll be a lot of people that will say after the Germans failed

696
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:24,736
With an initial knockout blow in 1914 it was all a hard slog downhill for them

697
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,760
Necessarily

698
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,464
1950 model year for the Central Powers still have some other attempts were there almost win the war later in the war so this is like

699
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,256
Set all along the heavyweight fight

700
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:39,584
And there were times when both sides have the other side in trouble

701
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,960
Quick look at Falcon Hines Memoir showed that he thinks France is in trouble that it's not that far from the breaking point

702
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,520
Is wood falkenhayn writes about his

703
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,080
Thinking leading up to his planning for this

704
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:50,848
Battle that

705
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,128
He's most known for it

706
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:52,896
Verdun

707
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,920
Falkenhayn right

708
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,200
Quote

709
00:33:56,224 --> 00:34:00,576
As I've already insisted The Strain on France is almost reached the breaking point

710
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,904
Certainly born with the most remarkable devotion

711
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,976
If we succeeded in opening the eyes of her people

712
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:10,560
To the fact that in the military since they have nothing more to hope for

713
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:15,168
That breaking point would be reached and England's best sword knocked out of her hand

714
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:21,568
To achieve that object the uncertain method of amass breakthrough in any case beyond our means

715
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,592
Is unnecessary

716
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:26,432
We can probably do enough for our purposes with limited resources

717
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,712
Within our reach

718
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:34,112
Behind the French sector of the Western Front there are objectives for the retention of which the French general staff

719
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,928
Would be compelled to throw in every man they have

720
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,464
If they do so

721
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,768
The forces of France will bleed to death

722
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:45,888
And there can be no question of a voluntary withdrawal whether we reach our goal or not

723
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,168
And quote

724
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,496
British military historian

725
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,520
John King

726
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,544
Put it this way

727
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,312
Quote

728
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,384
Duncan Hines plan was brutally simple

729
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:02,016
The French forced to fight in a crucial but narrowly constricted corner of the Western Front

730
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:08,416
Would be compelled to feed reinforcements into a battle of attrition with a material circumstances so

731
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,696
No favored the Germans

732
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,232
The defeat was inevitable

733
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:14,304
Did the French gave up the struggle they would lose Verdun

734
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:17,120
If they persisted they would lose their army

735
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,656
And quote

736
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,960
Displaying falkenhayn

737
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:25,056
Was giving the Sinister sounding name of operation Gary

738
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,640
Which I've seen translated multiple different ways usually it's

739
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,432
Called operation judge

740
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,224
Which implies

741
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,504
So the finality

742
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:37,600
Is the High Hope of fall behind going into this campaign right maybe this way

743
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,368
Decide the war

744
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,696
Another translation you sometimes run into

745
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,232
Is court of justice

746
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,280
Central idea

747
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,304
Decision point

748
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,584
The 3rd

749
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,144
Translation of the jewel sometimes run into

750
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,424
Is more indicative

751
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,448
Aldi

752
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,216
Tactics

753
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,240
An approach

754
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,288
The Fall Guy is going to take the win this bad

755
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,848
It's operation

756
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,384
Place of execution

757
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,176
And

758
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:02,944
Wow

759
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:09,344
The Kaiser and falkenhayn and all these generals are coming up with this plan in late 1915 the Allies Beyond tan forces are doing

760
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,112
Doing the same thing

761
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,160
I mean I want is a little bit

762
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:18,560
Lackadaisical about the whole thing. The Russians not the people in the Balkans they've been feeling German attacks over the

763
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,328
The last year

764
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,608
But the British and the French

765
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,472
To haven't seen the German Army on the offensive since way back in 1914

766
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:30,848
They're kind of leisurely planning what they think will probably be there war winning giant offensive

767
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,408
Slated for late spring or early summer

768
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,712
1916 / on the river Somme

769
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:41,856
An enormous joint British and French effort with months of planning and and just

770
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,160
Sweeping everything in front of them that kind of

771
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,696
In a Rosy Outlook

772
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,304
And the Germans instead in late February 1916

773
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,328
Go on the

774
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:55,680
Offensive on the Western Front of the first time in more than a year and catch everyone off guard

775
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,240
It's ridiculous that they could

776
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,288
The amount

777
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,568
Of effort that was

778
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,640
Required to put together a modern offensive or something

779
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,944
We modern people take for granted

780
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,992
But when you hear how much

781
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,016
Planning

782
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,040
And stock

783
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,064
Piling end

784
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,184
Engineering Feats are required to pull off something like the Battle of Verdun

785
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:21,280
You begin to see why was so different than anything these people have ever known

786
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:28,192
As we said a hundred years before a Napoleonic battle was considered extraordinary if it went on for 3 days

787
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,520
Throughout most of human history battles take hours

788
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,080
These battles that these

789
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,360
Allied

790
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,896
And Central Power

791
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:37,920
Planners are

792
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:38,944
Conducting

793
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,248
Require months of preparation

794
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:46,112
They don't go on for months to how do you get enough stuff there to make sure your soldiers don't

795
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,160
Starve or run out of ammunition

796
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:49,952
Well

797
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,488
For the Battle of Verdun

798
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:56,352
It was more than seven weeks of actual unloading of supply

799
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,168
Is the way writer GJ Meyer describes

800
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,448
Be planning

801
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,472
I'm stockpiling

802
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,264
For the February 19th 6

803
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,288
Battle quote

804
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:08,128
The Germans meanwhile were accomplishing prodigious feats

805
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,664
And getting everything in place

806
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:15,040
Helped by The Hillywood in Countryside and the Cloudy winter weather of the Verdun region

807
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:21,440
They were doing an astonishingly good job of keeping the French from learning what they intended to do or when or

808
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,464
Exactly where

809
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:28,608
No fewer than five new railway lines were constructed across the German held portion of the plateau

810
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,912
Immediately to the east of the Verdun Hills

811
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,704
In a seven week period

812
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,800
Between late December and early February 1300 train

813
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:40,384
Not Railway cars but entire train

814
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:43,200
Holding 2.5 million shell

815
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,992
Earth moving equipment

816
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:51,392
Construction machinery and everything required to prepare the offencive and support 300 thousand troops in win

817
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,440
Winter came rolling up to Verdun

818
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:57,024
The guns were positioned in the woods and covered with camouflage

819
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:01,120
A new development in Warfare made necessary by aerial reconnaissance

820
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:07,776
Underground Chambers capable of holding as many as 500 men each were excavated opposite the French lines

821
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,568
And lined with steel and conquer

822
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,360
In the sky above all this

823
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:14,688
What's the greatest concentration of aircraft get seen on any front

824
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,736
150 aircraft

825
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:21,856
A German umbrella so impenetrable that even on there are days when visibility was good

826
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,928
The French Pilots weren't able to get a close look at what was happening

827
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,976
By the second week of February

828
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:31,072
Everything was in place for an offensive with the potential to change the course of the war

829
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,608
And quote

830
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,936
The German plan

831
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,704
Wisconsin

832
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,008
Complicated because

833
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:42,080
This was one of the great defensive spots in French history

834
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,152
We're done watching just a fortress it was a fortress Zone

835
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,736
Multiple Fortress is all working together

836
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:52,064
Ground that have been fought over

837
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,648
Since the days of Julius Caesar and the Romans

838
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:59,744
Fortifications that have been upgraded even as recently

839
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,864
As 1914 when the lessons of what happened to those Belgian forts were Incorporated

840
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:07,168
And then when the war started

841
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:12,032
The French High command decided to fortresses were old-fashioned

842
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,056
Do do do

843
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:16,384
The limits of new technology or rather the lack of limit

844
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:23,040
They decided that those Belgian forts being pounded by that artillery signaled that these Sports were nothing but a death trap

845
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,088
It would be better to take

846
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,648
The weapons on them in the truth that man them

847
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:30,720
And put them to where the hot spots were in the fighting after all if

848
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:33,536
Frances in a life-or-death struggle what are we putting

849
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:39,936
A hundred thousand more troops in the Verdun region to man a bunch of fortresses that are just going to trap them and getting killed by artillery

850
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:44,544
Let's put them where they're needed oh yeah I make sure they bring the guns in the ammunition and every

851
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,312
Everything else

852
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,336
So they did

853
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,640
Pradhan was a relatively rare

854
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:53,248
Quiet sector in 1916 before the big German build up

855
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,064
Nonetheless You Can't Hide preparation zzyzx

856
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,112
As the German preparations

857
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:58,880
Forever

858
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:05,280
The French become aware of it a couple of weeks before the Germans launch their attack how quickly trying to make up for lost ground and get stuff

859
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:09,120
You know to these areas because they can sense a buildup in the Germans are launching

860
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:13,728
Distracting a packs elsewhere this would have been a confused a french-owned where everything's coming from

861
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:17,824
And on February 21st after a couple of postponements due to bad weather

862
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,360
The storm break

863
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:24,480
Kicked off by a giant nail gun

864
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,552
Whose nickname by the way as long Max

865
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,832
Just like naming swords

866
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,112
The guns 2

867
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:33,184
Apparently and long Max fires a shell

868
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,464
The travels

869
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,816
Somewhere between 15 and 20 mile these are in Norman

870
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,400
And that becomes the first shell to drop

871
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,192
As part of the Giant

872
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,216
Why

873
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,496
The kicks off the bottle

874
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,520
Verdun

875
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,848
And right after long Max's barrage kicks off

876
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,151
All these enormous weapons

877
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,175
Open up C

878
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:58,015
It's not just between 1200 to 1500 guns

879
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,063
It said half of them are cute

880
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:07,743
You're all those guns that pounded the fortune Belgium's of giant 420 mm Gama Motors you have that 300

881
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:11,839
80 mm skeleton pieces from Austria and you have more of each of them

882
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:12,607
Uneven

883
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:18,751
Enormous number of 210 mm in and 170 is 155 and I mean my goodness

884
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,543
And they open up

885
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:25,407
All at once and begin pounding this relatively small area of the front

886
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:28,735
What makes this so incredibly damaging is you have

887
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,015
The fuge weapons

888
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,039
Pounding this

889
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,087
Relatively tiny area on a map

890
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:38,463
And you fire an enormous number of shells by any standard the first World War

891
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,255
In a short period of time

892
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:47,167
If you're on the ground at some of those 1915 battles in their firing 1.7 million shells but they're doing it over to

893
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,447
You were three or four weeks

894
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,751
The intensity on the ground very different

895
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,567
Can you play firing 2 million shells

896
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,103
In six days

897
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:59,711
Poor tiny everyone little wood on the battlefield

898
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,271
1000 yards by 500 yards to

899
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,039
80

900
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,319
Thousand shells

901
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,343
In the first week

902
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:06,879
What is that look

903
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,439
There's no human reference for this

904
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,511
When I try to picture I close my eyes I try to picture

905
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,279
Forest

906
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,327
Disappearing in front of my eyes

907
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:18,655
This is heavily wooded and forested hilly Terrain in Verdun

908
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:22,495
And right after the bombardment need a 24-hour digital Forest laugh

909
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,031
I've watched Forrest

910
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:24,799
Elaw

911
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,895
Over weeks in months and it's still appalling to wake up in more Forest is gone

912
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:33,759
What if you got to watch the entire thing turned up in front of you in a matter of hours like a giant

913
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,551
Celestial weed wacker

914
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,599
The chewing up grass

915
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,647
There are accounts

916
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:46,047
It say that the shelling is so intense that a giant tree would get blown up in the air before it lands on the ground again another shell

917
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,583
Hitting balls right back up in the air

918
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,863
Veteran

919
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,191
Said that the battlefield quickly looked like an asparagus Farm

920
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,215
Giant shoots

921
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:56,031
Shooting up all over the soil everywhere which of the tree stump

922
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,567
And wood everywhere

923
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,847
We're needless to say

924
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,151
Tumi

925
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:04,223
This is something I would have to have some sort of video

926
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:04,991
I want to imagine

927
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,551
When I was a kid I used to wonder what a tsunami looks

928
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,087
And

929
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,159
Now quick we have video.

930
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,951
It was unimaginable

931
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:17,791
When I was young now it's something anyone who wants to see it

932
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,583
Can go look up on YouTube

933
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:25,215
Something that was a very rare sight natural phenomenon or man-made phenomenon for people to see

934
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,263
Shelling is the same way and by the way

935
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,287
There's a lot

936
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,567
You were account

937
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,103
Then you might imagine of the

938
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,383
The first day shelling

939
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,407
At

940
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,431
The battle of

941
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,967
Ferdinand

942
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,991
That's in English

943
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,271
I'm sure there must be more

944
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,063
German and French but

945
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,879
It's important to point out that there aren't a lot of people

946
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:46,463
It probably survived the war intact after those battles

947
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,023
And the ones who did were probably not all that

948
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,303
Excited

949
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,071
To relieve the itch

950
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:51,839
Experience

951
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,119
We do have something

952
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:57,215
Even though it's 40 years old Alistair Horne's the price

953
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,007
Glory has

954
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,031
Some of the best

955
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,311
Accounts in English

956
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:06,175
Of what it was like on the ground when the shelling started he tells one story of a corporal

957
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,455
Who is with his

958
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:10,015
Body isn't there just grinding some coffee

959
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,319
When the first she'll start dropping

960
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,343
He writes quote

961
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:16,671
Suddenly the whole world seemed to disintegrate around him

962
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:23,071
With the conditioned alacrity of old Soldiers the two men with the coffee grinder disappeared below-ground cursing and

963
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:23,839
Printable French

964
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:27,679
Why couldn't the bastards wait till I finish my coffee

965
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,727
The air in the body car a

966
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,007
That little for that area

967
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:34,079
They are seem solid with whirling material

968
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:38,687
The Corporal stephayne it was as if it were swept by a quote storm

969
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,711
A hurricane

970
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:44,319
Attempt is growing ever stronger where it was raining nothing but Paving Stone

971
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,855
And quote

972
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,135
On continue

973
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:47,903
Quote

974
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:53,791
Upon the terrible dean of the explosions we're superimpose the splintering crashes of rending wood

975
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:59,935
The great 210 mm shells locked off branches or uprooted the trees themselves

976
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:05,311
Barely had the tree trunks fall and then they were spewed up into the air again by fresh eruptions

977
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:08,895
From his own position still relatively immune to the shelling

978
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:12,991
Tiffany watches mechanical progress with a certain Macabre fascination

979
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,783
He was like a garden hose

980
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,551
He thought

981
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:16,575
And quote

982
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,367
And then he described

983
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,391
How

984
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:22,207
The shells would move like a wave

985
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:26,047
From one location to another pounding everything in between

986
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:32,447
And then methodically go back in the direction of just came from his though it's continually mowing the same piece of Grey

987
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,727
Round over and over again

988
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,007
It shows you

989
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:39,359
What the plan had been before the shelling started to

990
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,663
Make sure every inch of ground was covered

991
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,479
German aircraft

992
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,759
After flying over the battle

993
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:50,111
Having knocked the French Air Force out of the sky

994
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:52,415
Enter spotting for their guns

995
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:58,047
And keeping the French planes from locating the German gun so the French guns could shoot at them

996
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:01,887
This leads to a very one-sided initial encounter

997
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,679
Historian Paul Jankowski

998
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:08,031
Compares the initial bombardment here to the 1915 Battle of champagne

999
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:12,127
Which at the time seemed momentously Titanic

1000
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,407
That was a year ago

1001
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,687
Now a year later

1002
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,711
It seems like

1003
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,991
Chump change

1004
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,015
Compared to what

1005
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,575
The first day of Verdun is so appreciate

1006
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,367
Jankowski rights

1007
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,391
Quote

1008
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:26,207
It was partly because of such air cover

1009
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:29,279
Partly because it enjoyed such free rein that morning

1010
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:32,351
That the German shelling could exceed in intensity

1011
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:35,423
Anything the French or anyone else had ever endured

1012
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:39,263
This was the Battle of champagne multiplied ten times over

1013
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,567
What were the difference in kind as well

1014
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:45,919
The German artillerist were blanketing entire zones with their shells

1015
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:52,575
They directed their fire not merely on to positions they wish to take we're on two lines they wish to a blitter

1016
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,391
Put into all that nature had grown

1017
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:57,439
And that man had a record as well

1018
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:01,023
Making up in density for what they lacked in precision

1019
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:06,911
That day they saturated successive zones within a 25 mile Arc between abicor on the Left Bank

1020
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,959
Entertain on the right Bank of the muse

1021
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:13,055
With a million high explosive shells of the heaviest caliber known to man

1022
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,359
280 305

1023
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,639
380

1024
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:19,199
Even 420 mm wide

1025
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:22,271
And with lesser shells bearing toxic gases as well

1026
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,063
Method rather than red

1027
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:30,463
The system of the power hammer rather than the obstinacy of the battering ram drove the destruction

1028
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:34,559
The Morbid calculus presaged the carpet bombing of later Wars

1029
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,351
That would raise entire city

1030
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,399
And ignite the entire landscape

1031
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:41,471
But for now the thought was purely Tactical

1032
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:42,495
To devastate

1033
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,287
So that the Infantry could import

1034
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:45,823
Ndk

1035
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:52,479
Now. Jankowski says the difference in this artillery barrage is not just in the amount of stuff but the way they do it

1036
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:58,111
They are employing every little trick that they've learned in the last year year-and-a-half of warfare

1037
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,391
Including

1038
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,671
One that

1039
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:03,999
They probably think was a clever enhancement I'm sure the British in the French Mastiff

1040
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,023
Another example.

1041
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,303
Deviousness only

1042
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,583
German Park

1043
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,167
But the Germans start this artillery barrage in a little after 7 in the morning

1044
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:17,567
And they pound these French positions all morning and into the lunchtime hour and then they stopped at midday they

1045
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:19,103
Stop on queue all at once

1046
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,895
Not even

1047
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:23,967
To the punch drunk French survivors

1048
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:28,063
On the receiving end of the worst artillery barrage in human history know what this means

1049
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:31,903
It always means the same thing it means the German ground troops are coming

1050
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:37,279
In an offensive that's why you stopped shooting so that you don't blow your own men up now that they're on the way right

1051
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:39,839
So the French run up to their positions they man

1052
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,631
Defensive spots

1053
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:48,287
They uncover any guns they've got hit and they get ready to push back the German assault now that it's coming except it isn't coming

1054
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,567
It's a trick

1055
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,383
And all of a sudden all the guns open up again

1056
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:58,783
And start smashing the now exposed French survivors who showed those planes up in the air I'm another observe

1057
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,367
Oh yeah that guy survival there's a machine gun that we didn't see

1058
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,415
It was an intermission

1059
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,463
To get the French to expose themselves

1060
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:11,327
And this feeling goes for the rest of the day until the late afternoon so

1061
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:14,655
Go from 7 something in the morning to 4 something in the afternoon

1062
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,959
And then the French survivors

1063
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,007
See the first signs of Germany

1064
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:19,775
Country activity

1065
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,543
The approaching

1066
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:22,847
What they say

1067
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:25,151
Looks like something out of

1068
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,175
Time machine

1069
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,735
From the head Larry

1070
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,295
Gone

1071
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,343
Iconic

1072
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,367
Pickelhaube

1073
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:37,439
Mother pointed helmets that the German troops wear that harken back

1074
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:43,071
To the greatness of Prussia and Europe at the height of its 19th century Zona Colonial dominant it

1075
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:47,423
It's symbolic and it's been replaced with something that looks like a minor should wear

1076
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:50,495
Thoroughly working class

1077
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:54,079
Nothing romantic gentlemanly officer or aristocratic

1078
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:54,847
Hobbit

1079
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,383
These

1080
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,663
Tip of the spear

1081
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,711
Troops here are wearing

1082
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,991
The German stahlhelm

1083
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:05,087
Which with a minor modification or two is the exact same helmet

1084
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,135
The German troops will wear

1085
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,159
In the second world

1086
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:09,695
Bees

1087
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:12,255
Stormtroopers as they're called

1088
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,535
I've been known to his

1089
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,839
Look like the verme

1090
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,655
And they're carrying flamethrower

1091
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:24,799
Among other nasty surprises for anyone they might run into they got machine guns with

1092
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:25,823
They got

1093
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,871
Men who are wearing clothes

1094
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:28,639
Foods that have

1095
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:34,015
Big bags one of us part of the where they can stuff hand-grenades cuz you just can't carry enough hands

1096
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,831
They've even gotten this

1097
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,879
You know shows you what they think they're up against

1098
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:39,903
Mei-li wah

1099
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,463
Nfamus all these Stormtroopers

1100
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:47,583
If units are famous for the clubs they carry or the hatchets or the Long Knives or

1101
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:53,983
Even things like brass knuckles and stuff these are people who expect to get into physical combat a very close

1102
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:54,751
Strange

1103
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,799
They are using

1104
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:02,175
What at the time seemed like very newfangled very modern

1105
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:08,831
Techniques on the battlefield are known as infiltration tactics they pretty much are the same small unit tactics every millet

1106
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,367
Terry the world uses today

1107
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:13,695
They've been in development for a while to it's a mister

1108
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:20,095
Suggested the first time anybody sees them is with the storm troops but the storm troops are the first to integrate everything

1109
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,887
Into their system

1110
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:28,799
Not only are they going to use these infiltration tactics but look at the weapons that they burned themselves within they train with all this another where they've integrated all the

1111
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:32,639
All the various ideas and theories from all the militaries around the world the last 15 years

1112
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:35,967
And are the first to put these troops out in the field whose job it is

1113
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:38,015
To look for weak spot

1114
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,575
And they call him the field

1115
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:46,975
I'm going to run into in a significant opposition they stop or move around it and places where everyone's been killed by

1116
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,255
The artillery barrage

1117
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,535
Punch right through there

1118
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,607
Their goal

1119
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:53,631
Capture

1120
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:54,655
Bait

1121
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,679
Remember

1122
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,215
This is a trap

1123
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:01,823
The cheese in the Trap has to be captured by the Germans

1124
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,103
Before I can play the role

1125
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:03,871
All the cheese

1126
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:06,175
That's what this is all about

1127
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,455
That is if you believe

1128
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:13,855
Either the standard historical approaches quite a few historians who believe this whole idea of let's create this meat grinder

1129
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:14,623
Is BS

1130
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,671
Propaganda at the time

1131
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,695
And

1132
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:20,511
Mia culpa avoidance later on right

1133
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:24,607
If you believe that they're not trying to capture beta try to capture Verdun

1134
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:26,399
Either way the point of this

1135
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,679
Initial attack

1136
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:28,703
Is to get the height

1137
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:36,127
The problem is the Germans find out to degree exactly with the French and the British and found out the whole year before

1138
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:39,711
Which is that no matter how good the artillery barrage

1139
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,271
There are just units that survived

1140
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,831
And then when they strike back at you

1141
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,367
It's amazing

1142
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,159
And the casualties Mount up

1143
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,695
Unbelievably fast

1144
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,999
On the very first day

1145
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,559
As the German troops pour into an area

1146
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,607
And begin to

1147
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,447
Cowlicks in front of Master innocent in a specific area

1148
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:02,751
French artillery opens up on them

1149
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:05,311
And this is an account by French staff off

1150
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:06,847
With the artillery

1151
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:10,431
Who first describes what the German artillery attack on his position

1152
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,455
Is like

1153
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:14,527
And then describes responding in kind

1154
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:17,343
His was one of the few batteries that did by the way

1155
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,367
He writes quote

1156
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:25,791
Thousands of projectiles are flying in all directions some whistling others howling others moaning low

1157
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:28,095
When all uniting into one infernal Roar

1158
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:31,167
From time to time an aerial torpedo passes

1159
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:33,471
Making a noise like a giant motor car

1160
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:36,799
With a tremendous thud a giant shell bursts

1161
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,847
Quite close to our observation post

1162
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:42,943
Breaking the telephone wire and interrupting all communication with our batteries

1163
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:45,503
A man gets out at once for repairs

1164
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:50,111
Crawling along his stomach through all this place of bursting minds and shells

1165
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:52,671
It seems quite impossible he writes

1166
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,719
Addition escape the rain of shells

1167
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:56,767
Which exceeds anything imaginable

1168
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:59,071
There has never been such a bombardment in war

1169
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:01,631
Our man seems to be enveloped in explosion

1170
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:05,983
And shelters himself from time to time in the Shell craters which honeycomb the ground

1171
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:08,799
Finally he reaches a less stormy spot

1172
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,079
Men's his wires

1173
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:12,895
And then as it would be Madness to try to return

1174
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:15,967
Settles down in a big crater and wait for the storm to pass

1175
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,015
Now he looks up

1176
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,295
Nce

1177
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,087
The German assault

1178
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:21,855
Approaching

1179
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,623
Quote

1180
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:27,487
Beyond in the valley dark masses are moving over the snow-covered ground

1181
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:30,559
It is German infantry advancing impact formation

1182
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,351
Along the valley to the attack

1183
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:36,191
They look like a big gray carpet being unrolled over the country

1184
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:38,239
We telephone through to the batteries

1185
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,519
And the ball begin

1186
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:45,663
The site is hellish in the distance in the valley and upon the slopes regiment spread out

1187
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:48,991
And if they deploy fresh troops come pouring in

1188
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:52,319
There's a whistle over our heads it's our first shell

1189
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:54,879
It falls right in the middle of the enemy Infantry

1190
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:57,951
We telephone through telling our batteries are there hit

1191
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:01,279
And a deluge of heavy shells is poured on the enemy

1192
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:03,071
Deposition becomes critical

1193
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,887
True glasses we can see men Madden

1194
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:09,215
Men covered with hair or thin blood falling one upon the other

1195
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:11,775
When the first wave of the assault is decimated

1196
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:16,383
The ground is dotted with heaps of corpses but the second wave is already pressing on

1197
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:19,967
Once more are shells Carvalho for gaps in their ranks

1198
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:25,087
Nevertheless like an army of rats the bushes continue to advance in spite of our marmite

1199
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,367
I turn the French

1200
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:27,391
Are there shells

1201
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,415
He says quote

1202
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:31,231
Then our Heavy Artillery burst forth in Fury

1203
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:33,791
The whole valley is turned into a volcano

1204
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:36,607
And it said you to stop by the barrier of the slain

1205
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,143
And quote

1206
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,983
That's a foretaste of what's to come

1207
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,007
Right there

1208
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:47,103
The Germans have to be on the offensive for a little while in this battle

1209
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,919
A battle that is probably built upon the

1210
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:53,247
Presumption that the defense has a huge advantage on the office

1211
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:56,063
This artillery was meant to make up for some of that

1212
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,367
But the Germans are taking higher than expected loss

1213
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:00,415
From minute one

1214
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,487
This is a problem to cuz remember

1215
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:09,887
Regardless of which historical School you would hear to on the point of this battle it was always part of the plan.

1216
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,679
Lose as few people as possible

1217
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:17,311
So the Germans are concerned with losses and part of the reason they're suffering so many is the French or resisting

1218
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,591
Heroically

1219
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,871
On these first few days

1220
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:23,199
Their units that surrender their units that are just

1221
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:23,967
Gone

1222
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:25,503
From the artillery barrage

1223
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:28,319
But there are units including Elite ones but also

1224
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:32,671
Rather pedestrian one sitting there and dying to the last man to delay

1225
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:37,535
This German Advance these infiltration troops are looking for places to push through they find a couple

1226
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,327
But they find a bunch with these

1227
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:42,143
Decimated Defenders resisting heroically

1228
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:45,215
By the country time to get

1229
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:47,775
Fresh troops reinforcing that area

1230
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:52,383
To that area ever done is actually supplied on the French Side by one little Kenny Road

1231
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:55,455
The German to build multiple Railway

1232
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:57,247
The nearsighted Supply the battlefield

1233
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:03,647
Right so as French reinforcements are coming up these heroic Defenders are holding the Germans off as long as they can

1234
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,439
There are more big bombardments

1235
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:08,511
The Germans push more troops in with more tenacity

1236
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,535
On

1237
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,583
February 25th

1238
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:17,727
The Germans in an almost Indiana like Jones movie kind of drama

1239
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:22,079
Capture the big Ford in this region the sort of overlooks the whole battle

1240
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,895
We told you that the French High command

1241
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:25,663
Kind of

1242
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:30,271
Lost interest in fourth after the Germans to match the ones in Belgium smash the early ones in France

1243
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:36,927
But they still had people in them and they were still guns in them in slowly but surely they were starting to realize that sometimes and in some places they were

1244
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:40,255
We're worth having didn't matter these troops were in this

1245
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:45,631
Ford which is mostly below ground when a German soldier gets blown into it somehow

1246
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:47,935
Due to a shell exploding nearby

1247
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:54,335
Lansdowne on the ground has a pistol with him and eventually will let in some friends but by and large is walking

1248
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:56,383
Around this underground giant Ford

1249
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:02,783
And as he opens doors into rooms there's a couple of French soldiers playing cards or whatever any capture them and lock them in a room and you

1250
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,575
He does this over and over and over again

1251
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:07,135
Finally has everybody kind of captured

1252
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:09,439
Nobody dies on either side

1253
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:13,023
And this major feature in the early part of the battle Falls

1254
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:13,791
To the German

1255
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:18,143
It's one of those situations that sort of rocks

1256
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,679
The French morale

1257
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,215
And they start

1258
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:21,983
To follow

1259
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:22,751
Part

1260
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:25,823
They've been through a ton

1261
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,359
And now

1262
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:33,759
There's this crisis moment we're all of a sudden it looks like the Germans are going to break through in the French were just going to fall apart before any reason for

1263
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,039
Porsche Macan stiffen the line

1264
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:38,111
This is where things get really Wiggly in this battle by the way

1265
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:43,487
He gets right down to what the hell the point of it is

1266
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,047
If you're falkenhayn

1267
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:49,887
And historians who think he tried to create a meat grinder all that's true

1268
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:51,679
You don't want a breakthrough

1269
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:55,263
You don't want Verdun it's not really what you want

1270
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,311
It's the cheese in your trap

1271
00:59:57,567 --> 01:00:03,711
If you take it then you're just going to get counter-attack you're going to lose a lot of troops again and that been that's 1915 all over again

1272
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:04,991
What are we do differently right

1273
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,575
If you're from the other school of thought though

1274
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:15,231
The idea of breaking through to Verdun at this point is to nearly achieved what the whole bottle

1275
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:20,095
What design to do unexpectedly quickly the Crown Prince was commanding this Army's really excited in there

1276
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:25,727
All sorts of messages where they say hi I will take it I mean it expected this fast but we'll take it and then

1277
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:29,567
They get within 2 miles of the city at one point

1278
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:32,383
And then the French put a new commander in charge

1279
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:36,223
A guy who will be famous by the way in both world wars for different reasons

1280
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:37,759
A guy named Peyton

1281
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:42,367
And pathan becomes you know it's so hard to

1282
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:46,719
To separate the myth from the man went went with his connection to Verdun

1283
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:49,023
But at the narrative is

1284
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,071
The pathan gets in there

1285
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:53,887
And changes the French morale

1286
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,167
By himself pract

1287
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:57,215
There's all these and you know General

1288
01:00:57,471 --> 01:01:02,847
Travel with her on press Corps so there's going to be this guy is going to have a bunch of people helping to to pump up the myth

1289
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:09,247
What is famous for coming to the battlefield and you know any situations where the French just look desperate in a looking

1290
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:13,599
Troops and going now we have them right where we want them that kind of thing and you know

1291
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:16,671
Maybe it's the 19th century mentality but that seems to work

1292
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:21,023
The famously says or somebody says for him and then he stands behind it

1293
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,815
They shall not pass

1294
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:27,423
And this becomes too big Narrative of Verdun and it turns into like a French Thermopylae

1295
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:32,543
What the french aren't going to die 2 the last man they're going to win in the end right again part of this this

1296
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,079
Overriding narrative

1297
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:39,967
Now morale is kind of a hard to quantify sort of thing hard to measure heart

1298
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:41,503
Look back in history prove anything

1299
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:45,087
You don't have to prove the real world terrafirma things that

1300
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:45,855
Attended

1301
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:47,135
Tanzanite jewelry guy

1302
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,927
He's a defensive specialist

1303
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,719
And the first thing he does

1304
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:57,375
Is bringing his own artillery and consolidate it and ask for more and slowly but surely begins to build up

1305
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,679
His own meat grinder

1306
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:02,495
Two can play at that game

1307
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:06,847
And pathan start stocking up the French side with artillery to

1308
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,407
And all this artillery

1309
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:12,735
Turns this entire area

1310
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,527
Into the Moon

1311
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,087
But weirder

1312
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,927
Seashell holes in your head you think of something Symmetra

1313
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,975
Trickle like a meteorite crater

1314
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:24,767
But it doesn't happen that way because you get

1315
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:29,887
Seashell holes which can be 30 ft deep with absolutely straight up and down edges

1316
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:31,679
But then they get hit with another shell

1317
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:37,055
Some weird angle Orleans imagine then they get hit with another one and another one and another one and it turns it into

1318
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,847
Super weird formation

1319
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:43,455
It still looks weird today if you go look at modern pictures of Verdun Battlefield

1320
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:44,479
It looks

1321
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:45,759
Totally

1322
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:52,159
And it creates a battlefield is a painting by a Frenchman lularoe I think is his name called hell

1323
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:54,463
And it shows a couple of French soldiers

1324
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:56,255
In one of these craters

1325
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:59,583
And a dead body near them and they're wearing gas masks

1326
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:05,983
And the garage is going on a giant Timbers are part of this enormous crater and craters everywhere in the distance is

1327
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:06,751
Far as you look

1328
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:10,335
We said this is like making War worse

1329
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,151
These craters are the grossest thing

1330
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:15,199
You can imagine I mean really just

1331
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,223
Awful

1332
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:20,831
They fill with water very quickly everyone of them practically with a dead body or two in them

1333
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:23,647
If there was water there's tons of trash tons of stuff

1334
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:28,767
I'm all kinds of I mean they're mostly uses latrines if it's close enough we can get to them

1335
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:30,559
The water is

1336
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,327
Bedded

1337
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,095
And

1338
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:35,423
Horrible and greasy from the bloated bodies that float in it

1339
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,191
And

1340
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,727
Interesting in a poisonous

1341
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:41,055
Because the gas that used on the battlefield I know it

1342
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,359
Tempting to think of it as vapor

1343
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:45,151
But it's really almost a solid

1344
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:47,967
Where when a gas shell explodes it covers

1345
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:50,527
An entire area would like a pollen like

1346
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,343
Coding and that pollen like coating

1347
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,111
Is deadly

1348
01:03:54,623 --> 01:04:00,767
So it's like putting insecticide on a given area to keep you out of it for a while and eventually the rain will come and dissolve that

1349
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:03,839
But the dissolve runoff just goes into all these gel holes

1350
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:06,399
That are filled with water and makes them just poison

1351
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:07,679
There will be

1352
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:14,079
Riders will talk about how at first in in the spring the Verdun Battlefield will try to recover a little of its life and they will see little girl

1353
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:14,847
Green shoots

1354
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:16,383
Pop up for a minute before

1355
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:20,735
The poisonous air and Soil and Water and everything just kill them right away

1356
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,015
It's a giant

1357
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,295
Burnt out

1358
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:25,087
Insecticide Zone

1359
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:29,183
That's what Verdun is an Invicta landscape itself

1360
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:34,047
Is horrifying to a degree that's hard to describe unless you want to say

1361
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:36,607
This is Mordor

1362
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:40,447
This is JRR tolkien's conception

1363
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,727
Of the dark light

1364
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,519
He was in the first World War

1365
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:44,543
Maybe got it from

1366
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:50,943
The match is perfect. I mean once this artillery has been going for not even that long at this levels of intensity

1367
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:55,551
You have around you on this battlefield and we talked about stage

1368
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,575
And all the

1369
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:59,903
People merely players will look at the stage these people are playing on

1370
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:03,999
You know very shortly into the battle it's a lunar landscape it's the Moon

1371
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,279
Okay

1372
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:09,631
And these trenches are places where people meet there and very often.

1373
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:15,263
Lots of stories about soldiers with big heavy packs in the night losing their way falling into one of these

1374
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,543
Terrible

1375
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,335
Craters & just drowning

1376
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,895
The worst story are these people who

1377
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:27,295
But you hear stories about people drinking kneeling down and drinking out of these green colored poisonous Waters with bodies float

1378
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,063
Coding in it

1379
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,367
Because the water isn't making it up to the front

1380
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:36,767
The people whose job it is to bring food and water to the people on the front edge of the meat grinder are getting killed trying to bring it up

1381
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,071
Is a terrible.

1382
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,887
It's the battles of 1915

1383
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:46,495
Taken to the next level which is what this war is going to be about every time the world thinks

1384
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:50,591
They come to the limits of their interest surely this is the worst battle there will ever be

1385
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:52,639
The standard gets up

1386
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:53,407
Again

1387
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:55,199
And this happens continually

1388
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,015
It's a

1389
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:58,783
Pressure cooker

1390
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,575
Who's going to break first

1391
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:04,415
And you know you thought last year was bad welcome to next year

1392
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,743
I'm on next year's deadlier

1393
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:11,583
I'm on the scale is more and perhaps unsustainably Titanic

1394
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,887
The pattern is

1395
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,423
Unfortunately for the troops on the ground

1396
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,447
Horrific Lee

1397
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,215
Familiar

1398
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:20,287
About a week into the assault

1399
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,335
The German attack

1400
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,103
Jordan Staal

1401
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,407
Just like

1402
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:26,687
All these other

1403
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,967
Battles we've seen in

1404
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:29,247
A lot more we will

1405
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:31,295
The initial assault is the most

1406
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:34,367
Tense nail-biting up in the air kind of time

1407
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:38,207
Once it stopped there may be abs and flows and scary moments

1408
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,743
By and large

1409
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:42,815
We have descended into what Churchill called did you say

1410
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:45,631
Prolonged operations are extended operations

1411
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,935
We're now into combat

1412
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:50,495
And for the troops on the ground

1413
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:55,359
It's the most horrifying environment when we want to study the idea

1414
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,895
Human beings

1415
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:57,663
Can do

1416
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:01,503
It seems to me you want to see them in some of the most if you want to see if

1417
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,527
Just like a product

1418
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,551
Test did you want

1419
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:06,111
To put it under the most extreme stress and see how behave

1420
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,647
Look at what we're done but

1421
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:10,463
Over the next many months

1422
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,279
Do I have to live

1423
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,583
How do they induce

1424
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,631
And

1425
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:19,167
When you hear the stories

1426
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,447
East from this place I mean

1427
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:21,983
Start with the approach

1428
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,263
The French

1429
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:24,287
As we said

1430
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:29,663
And a lot of trouble to rotate their troops in and out of this battle cuz they get worn down like a

1431
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:31,199
Pencil in a pencil sharp

1432
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:31,967
Do you have to

1433
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:33,247
And rotate them

1434
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:38,367
When the soldiers approached Verdun they can see it a long way away

1435
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:43,743
I mean the guns of the opening barrage were said to be audible a hundred miles away

1436
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:46,559
So when they're approaching Verdun it looks like a giant

1437
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,327
Forest fire

1438
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,095
Fire in the distance

1439
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:51,167
One French soldier on the way to it said

1440
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:53,215
Reminded him quote

1441
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,007
I'm a gigantic Ford

1442
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:57,055
Neither day or night

1443
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,079
And quote

1444
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,127
The fires of Mordor

1445
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:00,895
Like I said

1446
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:04,479
The air becomes Smoky and hazy

1447
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:11,135
And you don't see the sun clearly anymore and all the vegetation disappears one artist said the only color in the landscape

1448
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:13,439
After a while cuz it's just overturned

1449
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:17,535
And bodies and debris and everything turned up concrete

1450
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:24,191
It's a hellish environment but there is a smear of red here are there with the horses have just been splattered by artillery

1451
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:27,007
I mentioned that it sounds like hell yet

1452
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:32,639
We mentioned earlier how hard it was to get food and water to

1453
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,407
The troops fighting

1454
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,175
The front line

1455
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,223
But it was hard to get anything

1456
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:37,247
To the Troops

1457
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:39,039
Fighting at the front line for example

1458
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:41,343
To get new troops to the front line

1459
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:43,391
Could kill off half your troops

1460
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:44,927
In his book

1461
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,487
The price of Glory Alistair Horne

1462
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:50,303
Takes a couple of different accounts

1463
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:52,607
And put them together and quotes a few

1464
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:53,887
People who were there

1465
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:57,727
About what it was like simply trying to get to the front of the meat drying

1466
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:02,335
Edward on imagine suffering a 40 or 50% casualties trying to get to the moon

1467
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:03,615
Reminder here's what he writes

1468
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:05,663
Quote

1469
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:08,223
A mile or two from the Frontline

1470
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,783
Troops entered the First Communication trenches

1471
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:13,599
Go to call them this was generally both an exaggeration

1472
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:14,879
And an anachronism

1473
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:17,951
Parapets gradually grew lower and lower

1474
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:21,535
Until the trench became little deeper than a roadside ditch

1475
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:26,399
Chills now began to fall with increasing regularity among closely packed men

1476
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,679
In the Darkness

1477
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:31,263
He says for obvious reasons approach marches were usually made at night

1478
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:35,103
The Columns trampled over the howling wounded lay under foot

1479
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:38,175
Suddenly the trench became nothing more than a track

1480
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:40,735
Harley traced out amid the shell holes

1481
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:41,759
In the mud

1482
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:45,343
Which the shelling had now turned to a consistency of sticky butter

1483
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:47,903
Troop stumbled and fell repeatedly

1484
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:52,255
Cursing in low undertones as if fearful of being overheard by the enemy

1485
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:55,583
Relentlessly pursued them with a shells at every step

1486
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:59,679
Sometimes there were duckboards around the lips of the huge shell crater

1487
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:01,471
But more often there were not

1488
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:06,847
And heavily Laden men falling into the water filled holes remain there until they drown

1489
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:09,151
Unable to crawl up the greasy side

1490
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:12,735
If a comrade pause to lend a hand he writes

1491
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:15,807
It often meant it to Wood round instead of one

1492
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:22,207
In the chaos of the battlefield where all reference pointed long since been obliterated relieving detachments

1493
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,231
Stopped and got lost

1494
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:25,023
And wondered hopelessly all night

1495
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:28,863
Only to be massacred by an enemy machine gunner is Dawn betrayed them

1496
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:30,655
It was not unusual for relief

1497
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:33,983
To reach the front line with only half the numbers that set out

1498
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:38,079
Nor for this nightmare approach march to last 10 hours or longer

1499
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:39,359
And quote

1500
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,663
Seems to me

1501
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:44,735
Maybe I can speak for some of my generation

1502
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:48,831
If I just spent 10 hours struggling through that

1503
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:51,903
And lost half our people while doing so

1504
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:55,487
Just so I got to take my turn on the front lines

1505
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:57,279
I'm going to be

1506
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,559
Severely

1507
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:00,095
Destabilize

1508
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:01,119
Let's put it that

1509
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,399
Why is that a good way to describe it

1510
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:05,215
And even though these

1511
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:09,055
French units will be rotated maybe only spend five or six or seven days up at

1512
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:09,823
At the front

1513
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:14,431
I mean that was designed to keep them from just being decimated and being shattered

1514
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,991
But judging from some of the witness accounts

1515
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:18,271
It didn't work

1516
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:22,111
British historian John Keegan the late John Keegan

1517
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:23,391
All right

1518
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,927
It's that time I French

1519
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:26,463
Officer named Augustine coaching

1520
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:29,279
Spend from the 9th to the 14th of April

1521
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,583
On one of these important Hill

1522
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:32,607
And Keegan writes

1523
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:33,887
Coding this

1524
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:35,423
Officer

1525
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,191
Quote

1526
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:37,727
The last two days

1527
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:41,055
Soaked in icy mud under terrible bombardment

1528
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:43,615
Without any shelter other than the narrowness of the trench

1529
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:45,663
The boss did not attack natural

1530
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:46,943
It would have been too stupid

1531
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:47,967
Result

1532
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:50,527
I arrived there with 175 men

1533
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:52,063
I returned with 34

1534
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:53,599
Several half mast

1535
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:55,647
Not replying anymore when I smoke

1536
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:57,439
And quote

1537
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:01,535
French Lieutenant describe watching a unit his own unit

1538
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:02,303
Actually

1539
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:06,655
Coming down and back from Verdun after being relieved and he says

1540
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:07,423
Quote

1541
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,727
First came the skeletons of company

1542
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:13,567
Occasionally let by wounded officer leaning on a stick

1543
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:15,871
All marched or rather advanced

1544
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,407
In small steps

1545
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:19,967
Zigzagging as if intoxicated

1546
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:23,807
It was hard to tell the color of their faces from that of their tunics

1547
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:25,599
Mudhead covered everything

1548
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,879
Dried off

1549
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:29,183
And then another layer had been reapplied

1550
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,719
They said nothing

1551
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:33,023
They even lost the strength to complain

1552
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:36,863
It seemed as if he's mute faces were crying something terrible

1553
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:39,423
The Unbelievable horror of their martyrdom

1554
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:42,751
Some territorial two were standing near me but came pensive

1555
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:47,359
They had that air of sadness that comes over one when a funeral passes by

1556
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:49,407
And I overheard one say

1557
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:51,199
It's no longer in army

1558
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:52,479
Those are Corpses

1559
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:55,551
Two of the territorials wept in silence

1560
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,575
Like women

1561
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:57,855
And quote

1562
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:00,927
So what's going on to those guys

1563
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:02,463
That they go in

1564
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,999
One way

1565
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:09,375
And they come out so shattered and sometimes it only takes a couple of days to go from one reality to the other

1566
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,399
That's where

1567
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:12,703
At least first hand accounts from these people

1568
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:13,471
Barstow

1569
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,007
Moving

1570
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:19,871
Principal from the perspective of these men on the ground everything seems so pointless

1571
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:20,895
Because

1572
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:25,247
They only know this little world of this big Battlefield they're operating on

1573
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:27,295
And a perfect example is how

1574
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:29,855
These generals were now fighting over the same

1575
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:36,255
Terrain features over and over and over month after month after month they take him and then they're retaking them they take them again in the Raw

1576
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:39,839
All fighting over the same Carnage stand ground over and over again

1577
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:41,375
And they develop names

1578
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:43,935
I want these Hills Hill 304

1579
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:49,567
The famous hill with a lot of people paying with their lives to take it and retake it again

1580
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:52,639
There's another one known as the Deadman

1581
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:55,455
Or dead man's heels another way to translate it

1582
01:13:55,711 --> 01:14:01,599
And that's another one of these Hills I mean they've had the tops blast-it-all Often by both sides artillery

1583
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:04,927
They're smoking like volcanoes pretty much at all times

1584
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:06,975
We're told some of the Dual amount

1585
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:08,767
Doom if we want to keep arm

1586
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:10,815
Mordor analogy going

1587
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:17,727
And when our unit retake supposition on for example one of those long fought over terrain features

1588
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:21,055
Then you have that around you

1589
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:23,359
I mean for example

1590
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,639
Fantastic

1591
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:27,199
Has several quotes where he talks about

1592
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:28,223
Soldiers

1593
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:30,015
Having to retake this ground

1594
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:32,063
That are nothing more than

1595
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,855
Open

1596
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:36,415
Cemeteries combined with butcher shop

1597
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,695
He writes quote

1598
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:38,975
On the ground

1599
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:43,071
Soldier and writer Jack Mayer describes the real frightfulness when he noted

1600
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:43,839
Quote

1601
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:47,679
Everywhere there were distended bodies that your feet sink into

1602
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:52,287
The stench of death hung over the jumble of decaying corpses like some hellish perfume

1603
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:53,823
And quote

1604
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:55,359
Passing him continues quotes

1605
01:14:55,615 --> 01:15:00,479
When the Germans captured Hill 304 in May one of the first demands of the assault troops

1606
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:02,527
Was there a double ration of tobacco

1607
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:05,343
Damask the overwhelming reeked of corpses

1608
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,367
Riding around them

1609
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:10,719
Like Jacques Mayer a fellow French soldier Road at this time that

1610
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,487
Quote

1611
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:13,023
According to strength Soldier now

1612
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:16,351
We all had on us the stench of dead bodies

1613
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:21,471
The bread we ate the stagnant water we drank everything we touched had a rotten smell

1614
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:25,055
Owing to the fact that the Earth around this was literally stopped with Corpses

1615
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:26,591
And quote

1616
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,407
How do you not lose your mind

1617
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:35,039
Barrel maker and Corporal louis barthas

1618
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:39,391
Arrives at the famous Hill 304 at one point in the spa

1619
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,439
And looks up

1620
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:43,231
And contemplates

1621
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:45,023
This piece of ground

1622
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:47,583
It is cost so many people on both sides

1623
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:49,119
Their Earthly exist

1624
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:50,911
Your rights quote

1625
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:53,983
I looked out upon this famous nameless Hill

1626
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,775
Are trench lay at the foot of it

1627
01:15:56,031 --> 01:16:00,383
For several months the hill has been disputed as if it had diamond mines on its slopes

1628
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,151
Alas

1629
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:04,735
All it contain now with thousands of shredded pulverized Corpses

1630
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:11,391
Nothing distinguished it from neighboring Hills it seem to even partly wooded at one time but no trace of vegetation room

1631
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:12,671
The convulsed

1632
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:15,999
Overturned Earth offered nothing but a spectacle of devastation

1633
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,023
And quote

1634
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:23,679
Now eventually in for reasons that will get into in a minute the situation changes

1635
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:25,983
At ferdon in the Germans go

1636
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:32,383
From essentially a sort of an offensive position to a defensive one as they transfer Forces 2

1637
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,919
To another part of their front

1638
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:34,687
For something else

1639
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:36,479
What's going on taking their attention

1640
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:40,319
And so the French use this as an opportunity to retake ground

1641
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:46,975
And now we get the same kind of battles we had when the Germans were moving forward in this now that the French are now the

1642
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:50,815
Germans have taken a bunch of their artillery wasting out of French have the artillery dominance

1643
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:54,655
And now the Germans get to experience what the french experience on the other side

1644
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:57,471
And you know 9 or 10 months into this battle

1645
01:16:57,727 --> 01:17:00,287
We have human beings living on the edge

1646
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:03,359
I'm watching and beans can tolerate there's an extended

1647
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:05,919
Apparel quotes from the same guy

1648
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:07,199
A German soldier

1649
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:07,967
Who is

1650
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:09,759
In one of these

1651
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:16,159
Any sports are all over this area this is a fortified Zone that several forts covering one another in a lot of the most terrible bad

1652
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,951
Battles happen over these Sports

1653
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:24,351
And their battered down to that they're just shells of what they were but they could still hold hundreds of man and protect them from Shrek

1654
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:28,191
Often times you had tons of men in these underground blown up

1655
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:31,775
Fort with blood everywhere and everything else

1656
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:34,335
And here's the way the environment is described

1657
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,103
By this German

1658
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:36,383
Quote

1659
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:42,015
His name is private William Harmon's by the way of the 67th Infantry Regiment and I get this from Peter Hart

1660
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:43,039
The Great Wall

1661
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:44,575
He said quote

1662
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:48,415
The entrance was a mere hole in the scarred Battlefield

1663
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:53,791
And the Silhouettes Of cowering men constantly crawling in around look like huge ants in the dark

1664
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:58,399
I just ended an iron ladder some 40 ft into the concrete Cavern

1665
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:00,191
It was an enormous place

1666
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,983
Crowded with many hundreds of soldiers

1667
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:04,031
Some lay on bunk sleeping

1668
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,567
Snoring and moaning

1669
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:08,127
Some quarter the passages between the bunks

1670
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:09,407
Chatting writing letters

1671
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:11,711
Are there sat or nelton corners

1672
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:13,759
Packing or unpacking their belongings

1673
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:17,855
Hero flashlight there a candle match or cigarette. In the dark

1674
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:19,391
With flickering islands of light

1675
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:21,439
Continually shifting and brightness

1676
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,999
From this Subterranean stronghold

1677
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:28,351
A small patch of Sky to be seen when one stood close to the iron ladder

1678
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:31,423
We're look through the shaft which contain the ventilator fans

1679
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:37,823
The current of warm stale air from 40 feet beneath brought to my nostril the sickening smell of first aid Med

1680
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:38,591
Medications

1681
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:44,223
Every one of the chicken-wire births were filled with mutilated muddy torn in the following uniform

1682
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:45,503
A dismal site

1683
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,295
There was a man with closed eyes

1684
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:49,855
A blood-soaked bandage around his head

1685
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:52,415
Another beside him like twisting in pain

1686
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:56,511
I saw some lice ridden Man Who Would scratch their bandages off to ease the itching

1687
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:58,815
The passages Between the Buns were crowded

1688
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:00,607
There must have been a thousand men there

1689
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:02,143
Summit been relieved

1690
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:03,935
Could not withdraw to the rear

1691
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:07,263
And something would come to relieve the others could not proceed to the front lines

1692
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:10,847
All were imprisoned deep within the concrete and rock and roll

1693
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,127
And quote

1694
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:15,967
Now that's a senior up till that point could have happened in a lot of War

1695
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:18,271
What happens

1696
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:20,063
Next in that Underground

1697
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:22,623
Environment that soldiers writing from

1698
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:23,903
Is something

1699
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,951
It on a large scale

1700
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,231
Between great powers

1701
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:29,023
Only happened in this war

1702
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:30,559
He says quote

1703
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:32,607
I heard the cry

1704
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:33,887
Poison gas

1705
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:36,191
And I saw people around me put it on their gas masks

1706
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:39,519
I adjusted mine which still hung over my shoulder

1707
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,543
There it was

1708
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:43,615
A yellowish gas glimmering near the iron ladder

1709
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:46,431
A gas bomb must have been thrown into the entrance show

1710
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:47,711
The cry

1711
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:51,039
Gas masks on electrified the whole shelter

1712
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:52,831
Soldiers ran to get their Maps

1713
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:56,671
Which they had hung on the walls and in the corners or lay down their pack

1714
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:59,743
Many who have lost theirs on the battlefield began to cough

1715
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:03,071
The wounded in the Bronx tried to climb into the upper berths

1716
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:06,143
Well beneath the gas crept forward along its way

1717
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:08,447
Extinguishing one candle after another

1718
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:10,239
Soon many were dying

1719
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:15,360
And the bunks and Floors were filled with bodies over which the living stepped and stumbled in search of air

1720
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:18,432
The alarm surge like a wave from bunk to bunk

1721
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:22,016
Before long it would reach the farthest man hundred yards away

1722
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:23,296
The Panic was so great

1723
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:28,672
Did I saw a badly wounded men throw themselves onto the floor as though they wanted to drink in the gas

1724
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:31,488
While others tore their masks from the neighbors faces

1725
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,304
Some had a reddish foam oozing from their mouth

1726
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:35,584
And quote

1727
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:38,400
I always try to remind myself

1728
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:40,192
When we're talking about these big

1729
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:40,960
Praying

1730
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:41,728
Battles

1731
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:45,568
That what this really is is a million stories like

1732
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:51,968
The pain of that incident magnified over the entire scope of the war

1733
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:56,320
And while I'm sure there's some people who are harder than I am in terms of

1734
01:20:56,576 --> 01:21:00,160
That's life that's what history is filled with all those kinds of things

1735
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:02,464
It's hard not to sit there

1736
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,512
And feel a sense of all

1737
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:07,584
For the people who

1738
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:08,864
Facebook

1739
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:09,632
This

1740
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:13,728
I'm not out of any sort of patriotic in a glorification of War anything else

1741
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,264
And I said just sort of the

1742
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:19,104
Unexpectedly strong limits of human endurance

1743
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,688
How did they sustain the Safra

1744
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:30,112
How did they win told they had to advance into this or just not run away at top speed

1745
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:31,136
How did they do it

1746
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:33,696
Let's acknowledge not all of them dead

1747
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:38,304
There were a lot of people shot in this war

1748
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,584
For running away

1749
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:45,472
But the large majority of them did not and you sit there and go how did they not Rebelle how did they not revolt

1750
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:47,008
What would we do today

1751
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,592
Is a great quote for Mom

1752
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:52,384
F Scott Fitzgerald novel

1753
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:53,664
It's fictional

1754
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,968
But he puts words into the mouth

1755
01:21:56,224 --> 01:22:00,320
Of a man who showing one of these 19:16 battlefields

1756
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:03,648
To his compatriots the touring the battlefield and he has a discussion with

1757
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:05,952
Plain to them

1758
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:07,744
The almost

1759
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:09,536
Soup

1760
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:11,072
It was required

1761
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,352
2

1762
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:14,656
Bring up a generation of people who

1763
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,424
Do this

1764
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,192
In other words

1765
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:18,496
It's not just yours truly wondering how

1766
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:20,288
People sustain this effort

1767
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:24,128
Even right after the war people were trying to figure out how

1768
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,920
People could do this

1769
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:28,224
Here's the section from the esca

1770
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:28,992
Scott Fitzgerald

1771
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:31,808
Fitzgerald's character

1772
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,088
Explains

1773
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:34,368
Whitney Point in the distance

1774
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,160
To a little body of water

1775
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,184
Does quote

1776
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,720
See that little stream

1777
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:40,512
We can walk to it in 2 minutes

1778
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:42,560
It took the British a month to walk

1779
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:45,888
A whole empire walking very slowly

1780
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:47,424
Dying in front

1781
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,216
And pushing forward behind

1782
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:52,288
And another Empire walked very slowly backward

1783
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,824
A few inches a day

1784
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,640
Leaving the dead like a million bloody rugs

1785
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:59,456
No Europeans will ever do that again in this Jenner

1786
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:01,504
Any other character

1787
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:03,808
Why they've only just quit

1788
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:05,088
Over in Turkey

1789
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:06,368
And in Morocco

1790
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,160
The response

1791
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:08,928
Quote

1792
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:09,952
That's different

1793
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:13,024
This Western Front business couldn't be done again

1794
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,304
Not for a long time

1795
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,864
The young men think they could do it but they couldn't

1796
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:19,168
They can fight the first Marne again

1797
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:19,936
But not this

1798
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:21,728
This took religion

1799
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:23,264
And years of plenty

1800
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,056
And tremendous sureties

1801
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:28,384
Any exact relation that existed between the classes

1802
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:31,200
The Russians and Italians weren't good on this front

1803
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:36,320
You had to have a whole-souled Sentimental equipment going back further than you could remember

1804
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,856
You have to remember Christmas

1805
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:41,184
Send postcards of the Crown Prince and his fiance

1806
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,232
A little cafes in balance

1807
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:44,256
And Beer Garden

1808
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:47,328
Unter Den Linden and weddings at the Murray

1809
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,864
I'm going to the derby

1810
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,400
And your grandfather's whiskers

1811
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:55,776
General Grant invented this kind of Battle of Petersburg 1865

1812
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:58,848
Came the reply meaning General Grant in the Civil War in 80

1813
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:04,480
The main character says quote no he didn't he just invented Mass Butchery

1814
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:07,808
This kind of battle was invented by Lewis Carroll

1815
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:09,088
And Jules Verne

1816
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,880
And whoever wrote ondine

1817
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,672
And Country Deacons

1818
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:13,440
Bowling

1819
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:15,488
And Marianne's in Marseille

1820
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:19,072
And girls seduced in the back Lanes of wurtemburg invest failure

1821
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:19,840
Why

1822
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,376
This was a love battle

1823
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,680
It was a century of middle-class love

1824
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:24,448
Time spent here

1825
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:30,080
A Century of middle-class love

1826
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,104
Spent here

1827
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:31,872
That is

1828
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:35,712
Found and that's how the generation that lived through this Warsaw

1829
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:38,784
So basically Fitzgerald

1830
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:40,064
That question

1831
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:42,368
And how did these people endure

1832
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,184
Is that you had to have grown up the way they did

1833
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:51,328
The same cultural influences and expectations including societal and class-based ones

1834
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,656
Either had you seen the world the way they did had

1835
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:56,448
Similar concepts of

1836
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:59,264
You know Duty and expectations and

1837
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:00,800
Even manhood

1838
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:04,640
When you have to have in some ways

1839
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:06,944
The same allusions to

1840
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:08,480
Because in

1841
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:10,272
Certain circumstances

1842
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:12,320
Having illusions

1843
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,856
Could help you carry out

1844
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,648
Military

1845
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:16,928
Operations

1846
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,488
People who are more cynical and realistic

1847
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:21,280
Would never do

1848
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:27,680
I mean when you think about the endurance to I mean it's so normal to focus on the horrific War side of this

1849
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:28,960
What's a simple

1850
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:34,592
Your life part of this is sometimes what pushes people over the edge you know you'll hear stories sometimes wear

1851
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:36,640
They will say when they were able to adapt

1852
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:39,968
To the shelling they just couldn't handle the rats or something

1853
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:41,504
Something gets them sometimes

1854
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:44,064
Above and beyond what you might think

1855
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,600
The perfect example

1856
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:48,928
He start looking at what day-to-day life was like for these people

1857
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:54,304
Any of us would think we're focused on staying alive but sometimes it got down to an even more

1858
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,096
Base level than that

1859
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:57,120
Louis Bartos

1860
01:25:58,144 --> 01:26:00,192
Fighting in the Verdun Inferno

1861
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:01,472
Writes about

1862
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:05,824
At night being in one of these trenches when the rain just comes pouring down he says quote

1863
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:10,688
We were crouching down so as not to catch a stray bullet or shell fragment passing by

1864
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:12,224
And if this weren't bad enough

1865
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,272
A heavy rain started to fall

1866
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:18,624
It didn't take long for the water to fill in the ditch and to submerge our shoes

1867
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,440
Our helmets were transformed into drain spouts

1868
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:26,048
Little waterfalls ran down our packs onto our hips off our shoulders in a long are arm

1869
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,584
We didn't know what

1870
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,376
Or hang you were waiting for

1871
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:31,168
The night was Pitch Black

1872
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:33,728
Were they just going to leave us stuck in the sewer

1873
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:35,008
And quote

1874
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,128
Sewer is such an app name to besides the body is

1875
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:45,504
And the poison and the Decay and the lice and the rat is not even dealt with them they're both

1876
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,528
Absolutely

1877
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,856
Beyond imagination living with the lights living with the rat

1878
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:51,136
You also have

1879
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:57,792
The problems of men fighting in an inferno we're getting out of your trench men too pretty good chance of.

1880
01:26:58,048 --> 01:27:00,864
When you have to go to the bathroom when we parked us rights

1881
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:01,888
Quote

1882
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:05,216
And to make it worse cuz I've already described all of us

1883
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:09,056
One after the other suffered from an epidemic of intestinal disorders

1884
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:11,616
The resulting diarrhea sure cleaned us out

1885
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:12,896
Opportunity

1886
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:18,784
As soon as one of us got over his next door neighbor was afflicted with it and had the bad luck to have to climb out of the trench

1887
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,600
And head for the shell hole which served as our latrine

1888
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:24,160
Of course we did this only in The Last Resort

1889
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:25,696
At the last moment of agony

1890
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:28,256
Stretching our guts until they were about to burst

1891
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:32,096
One of us was surprised in the lottery and buy one of these sudden fusillade

1892
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:33,888
And collapsed into his own excrement

1893
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:39,776
It was not to expose oneself to similar incidents some used sardine or monkey meat

1894
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:41,312
Kansas chamber pot

1895
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:44,128
It was not to have to leave one's hole in the ground

1896
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:46,688
One even sacrificed his cast iron dinner plate

1897
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:48,480
And quote

1898
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:51,552
How do you keep your sanity

1899
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,344
It's a risk your life

1900
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:59,744
Did I mean the whole thing again and lean-to Battlefield there might have been one horrible day where if you're under

1901
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:06,144
Lucky enough to have dysentery that day it's a horrible day in the ranks it isn't the day after day after day thing you people are putting up

1902
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:08,192
With a pounding on their cycle

1903
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:11,520
But understanding what they went through

1904
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:16,128
Is in large part what makes this story so incredibly compelling

1905
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:20,224
The extremes of Human Experience right I talk about it all the time

1906
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,504
Is wonderful

1907
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:22,784
Paragraph

1908
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,320
By historian Eric

1909
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:25,344
Thorne Bros

1910
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:27,392
Who tries to describe

1911
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:31,232
Why this isn't gratuitous to talk about this why it's

1912
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:32,000
Part of

1913
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:35,584
Being astounded by your ancestor

1914
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:37,632
Here's what

1915
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:38,400
Bro says

1916
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:39,680
Quote

1917
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:45,312
Most historians today depart from the traditional practice of omitting casualty figure

1918
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:48,384
What was once left out for respect of the Dead

1919
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:52,992
And to avoid any indecent hint of criticizing or questioning the sacrifices they made

1920
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:54,272
Is now included

1921
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:58,112
In order to illuminate the magnitude of the horror man face

1922
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:04,768
By citing numbers in other words historians begin the process of turning back toward describing what war was real

1923
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:06,304
I really like and I do this

1924
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,632
Despite the understandable loathing of the veterans themselves

1925
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:13,472
To remember we speak about traumatic experiences they have tried

1926
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:15,008
Usually unsuccessfully

1927
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,032
To suppress

1928
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:19,616
The problems historians encounter with casualty figures however

1929
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:24,224
Especially the astronomical numbers of dead and wounded in 20th century Wars

1930
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,784
Is it numbers have a numbing quality to them

1931
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:28,832
Although shocking to read initially

1932
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:34,720
I quickly lose descriptive Effectiveness as mines failed to grasp or in the abstract

1933
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:38,560
In order to do historical Justice to combat on the ground there for

1934
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:40,864
It is necessary to go beyond the numbers

1935
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:43,168
To the gruesome eyewitness account

1936
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:46,240
Shaking off criticism that to go there is gratuity

1937
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:50,592
The Great War can only be fully understood if all its aspects are exposed

1938
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:54,944
Dimensions of the front experience that not only affected soldiers morale

1939
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:55,968
And eventually

1940
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:57,248
The outcome of the war

1941
01:29:57,504 --> 01:30:02,112
But also home fronts and they're critically important willingness to continue shoulder in the war effort

1942
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:04,416
All wars are horrible

1943
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:05,184
Brothers Wright

1944
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:07,488
Tragedies for the Dead

1945
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:09,024
Their relatives and Friends

1946
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:12,352
Hobbling sometimes disfiguring injuries for others

1947
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:15,680
Turning wives children and parents into Caregivers for life

1948
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:20,288
And psychological minefields for veterans who may have escaped death and injury

1949
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:24,384
But not the terrible memories with which loved ones two are then forced to live

1950
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:27,456
The Great War was especially hellacious however

1951
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:31,040
Because it was the first to unleash the full mechanized Fury

1952
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:33,344
A sophisticated industrial technology

1953
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:34,624
And quote

1954
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:37,184
Men had never

1955
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:39,744
To endure

1956
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:41,024
Anythink why

1957
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:49,216
Some of these French soldiers had to go back to Verdun more than one time

1958
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:56,384
What is that Duty right I read somewhere where one of them said the first time you can kind of handle cuz you don't know what you're in for it's particularly hard when you're going back to

1959
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,664
Mordor after you've been

1960
01:30:58,176 --> 01:30:58,688
Mordor

1961
01:30:58,944 --> 01:31:00,224
So happy to have survived

1962
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,784
And now you get to take your chances all over again

1963
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:09,184
To the majority the French army get the chance to rotate through this area at least once and they never get over it

1964
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:10,976
Pathan himself

1965
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:11,744
Essay about

1966
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:15,072
The Verdun experience to the French army quote

1967
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:21,728
The constant visions of death that penetrated the French soldier with a resignation that bordered on fatalism

1968
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:23,520
And quote

1969
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,360
The fighting went in for 10

1970
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:34,016
About half that time the Germans were on the attack the other half the time the French were on the attack and by the time it was over

1971
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:37,856
This is disputed but about a million total casual

1972
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:39,136
Outside data.

1973
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:40,928
Give or take 2

1974
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:45,024
At the end of the war

1975
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:48,096
It will be mandated in the treaty

1976
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:52,192
That when this battlefield is cleared and it will take

1977
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:58,336
Decades just to get the bodies off of it the shells are still there and many of these areas are cordoned off

1978
01:31:58,848 --> 01:32:01,920
Until well probably good hundred two hundred years from now

1979
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:07,808
Recirculated win French bodies were dug up and buried they needed to be buried singularly

1980
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:09,344
And with white crosses

1981
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,368
Purity

1982
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:11,648
The Germans

1983
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,184
Didn't have to be

1984
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:13,952
Can a single grape

1985
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:16,256
Even their graves were to carry

1986
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:17,536
Black crosses

1987
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:18,560
Signifying

1988
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:19,584
Shame

1989
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:23,168
The depth of emotion

1990
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:25,472
That Verdun

1991
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:29,568
Created in the immediate post-war generation but even in France today

1992
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:30,848
Is unlike

1993
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:32,384
Quite any other

1994
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,408
Military

1995
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:35,200
Endeavor

1996
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:36,736
French arms

1997
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:37,504
Participated

1998
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:41,088
And the miss making about this

1999
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,368
Crazy battle

2000
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:44,416
Start before the fighting's even done

2001
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,464
And there's a hole

2002
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:50,816
Group of revisionist historians who been trying ever since the battle happen to

2003
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:52,864
Poke holes in the myths

2004
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:55,424
That obscure the reality of Verdun

2005
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:59,264
It's got such a sacred hold on both France and Germany it's hard

2006
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,544
To separate

2007
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,824
The facts from the fiction

2008
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:04,384
There's a huge amount of heroism in Sacra

2009
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,152
Device connected

2010
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:07,456
It's understandable that you would get

2011
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:08,992
You know some is making

2012
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:13,088
And the revisionist historians often portray falkenhayn the German

2013
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,648
Commander in the one behind this plan is an idiot

2014
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:23,328
Dumb plan executed incompetently and after the war when people went to Falcon Hines or what were you thinking

2015
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:25,376
I was trying to kill a lot of people

2016
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:26,400
My goal

2017
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:27,680
Mission accomplished

2018
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:30,752
One of these revisionist historians

2019
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:34,336
Paul Jankowski is a perfect example will say something like

2020
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:40,736
To make Verdun out to be any worse than any number of terrible World War 1 battles is to play into the myth and he says it

2021
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:42,784
If being in a trench

2022
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:49,184
With the rain falling on you with your feet up to your knees in mud under shellfire and sniper fire.

2023
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,208
Day after day

2024
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:54,816
Is terrible will there's plenty of First World War battles where's a soldier you would have found yourself in that say

2025
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:58,656
Situation with bodies all around me that's not that abnormal the first World War

2026
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:00,448
They're right about that too but

2027
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:01,472
You know maybe it's

2028
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:03,776
Bearer to say that there are several

2029
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:07,872
Really unbelievably horrible an unprecedented battles in the first World War

2030
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:10,944
That are equally hellacious and you would not want to be at any

2031
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,248
They each have their own

2032
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:14,528
Awful unique

2033
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:15,296
Clay virtue

2034
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:16,320
That makes them different

2035
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:18,880
And nothing smells quite like Verdun

2036
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:22,464
And if you said to me you have to be at one of these horrible Battlefield

2037
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:24,256
Verdun is the lowest on my

2038
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:26,560
Verdun is the last

2039
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:27,328
Place out of all

2040
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:31,424
If you ask what Verdun achieve

2041
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:32,448
Again

2042
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:35,520
There's a wide variety of opinions on this

2043
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:38,336
The most popular is that it achieve nothing

2044
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:40,640
On the broad symbols

2045
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:41,920
The general waste

2046
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:43,200
This war

2047
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:46,016
About a million people

2048
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:46,784
Either are

2049
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,320
Killed or wounded

2050
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:49,088
Or

2051
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:51,904
You have never returned from that Battlefield

2052
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,184
And nothing

2053
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,744
Of huge importance was gained because of that

2054
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:00,608
One thing that certainly did happen as it moved up the timetable

2055
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:01,888
For several other bat

2056
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:08,032
How's that we're going to happen the little bit later but when the French got pressed by the Germans at Verdun they said the British and they said to the Russians

2057
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:10,336
You know those battles you were planning on starting

2058
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:14,176
Could you move up the timetable and starting sooner we could use the help

2059
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:15,200
Prayer

2060
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:16,992
I'm finally

2061
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:20,576
The one thing in 1916 you're beginning to see if we've eluded

2062
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:21,344
Did this before

2063
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:24,416
Is that these people have put up already

2064
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:26,976
With a lot more pounding than we would

2065
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:28,512
Only put up with today

2066
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:31,072
But there's a breaking point for all human beings

2067
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:32,864
In my mind

2068
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:34,912
The breaking point that's coming

2069
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:36,448
Was Quicken

2070
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:37,984
But experience

2071
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:39,008
Ever done

2072
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:43,616
And we mentioned that the French had a policy of rotating troops during the battle to keep them

2073
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:44,896
Ever done

2074
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:46,688
What that meant was

2075
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,224
Virtually the entire

2076
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,504
Higher French army

2077
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:50,528
Timer another

2078
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:52,320
Was rotated through that

2079
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:53,088
Sector

2080
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:54,624
Verdun

2081
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:56,160
Took the French

2082
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:58,208
And Ratchet it up

2083
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:00,256
The discontent levels in Waze

2084
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:03,072
It will probably out of proportion to what you could have expected

2085
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:04,352
A problem or normal

2086
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:06,144
It got you closer to the break

2087
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:09,472
The idea of

2088
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:15,616
Pushing your adversary to the point where their society literally implodes

2089
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:17,664
Is a Thoroughly Modern idea

2090
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:19,712
By 1916

2091
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:22,784
Most of the military leaders in this conflict

2092
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,856
See that as the endgame in this conflict

2093
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:30,976
The reason it's a Thoroughly Modern concept isn't because people of the past didn't understand it

2094
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:32,512
It was because

2095
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:36,096
They could never take enough damage to get to that point

2096
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:38,144
I reset the route this series

2097
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:41,728
Nations in the past for the most part couldn't take a punch

2098
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:48,640
The ones who could stand out like sore thumbs the Roman Republic for example what makes it so unusual in the

2099
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:49,664
Terry history sent

2100
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:51,456
They could sustain

2101
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:52,224
Defeat

2102
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:53,504
After defeat

2103
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:54,784
After defeat

2104
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:56,832
And not capitulate

2105
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:02,464
They could lose a battle of cannae they can lose a battle of lake trasimene in the same War

2106
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,536
And keep coming back for more very unusual

2107
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:09,376
You know what generation before those defeats

2108
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:12,192
Alexander the Great defeats the massive

2109
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:17,312
And the greatest Empire the world has ever seen the achaemenid Persian Empire with a couple of big shots

2110
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:19,616
There's never enough time

2111
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:21,664
For the society to implode

2112
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:23,968
A society

2113
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:30,624
Collapsing at the foundation's requires that they be able to stand there and exchange enough punches to go

2114
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,392
Get to that point

2115
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:33,440
R19 16

2116
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:37,024
The grinding down of Nations is well underway

2117
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:40,096
As author David fromkin says the real war

2118
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:41,888
Can become an economic

2119
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:43,936
And social survival Khan

2120
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:48,032
And the generals are beginning to organize their strategies

2121
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:50,848
To Quicken and hasten this outcome

2122
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:52,384
Example win

2123
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:53,920
Falkenhayn talks about

2124
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:55,968
You know the idea of using attrition

2125
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:57,760
To bleed the French White

2126
01:37:58,016 --> 01:38:01,344
Explains that you don't have to worry about the Russians anymore

2127
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:06,464
Because they're well on their way to having their entire Society collapse Jesus quote

2128
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:08,512
According to all reports

2129
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:11,840
The domestic difficulties of the giant Empire

2130
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:13,632
Are multiplying rapidly

2131
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:15,424
Even if we cannot perhaps

2132
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:18,240
Expect a revolution in the grand Style

2133
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:21,312
We're entitled to believe that Russia's internal troubles

2134
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:24,640
Will compel her to give in within a relatively short period

2135
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:30,528
In this connection it may be taken for granted that she will not revive her military reputation meanwhile

2136
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:33,088
We need not be anxious about that

2137
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:34,880
On the contrary

2138
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:36,672
It is probable he writes

2139
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:42,304
Did any such attempt in the law says it must involve would only hasten the process of disintegration

2140
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:43,328
And quote

2141
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:46,400
I should also point out that

2142
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:49,728
In the nineteenth Century for example that kind of disintegration

2143
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:52,032
Not only wasn't the goal

2144
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:54,848
It would have been seen as a negative by Prada

2145
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:56,896
In the era where

2146
01:38:57,152 --> 01:39:03,296
A military defeat meant that one General gave his sword to the other General in exchange some provinces or something

2147
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:04,320
Colonies are what nut

2148
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:07,136
The goal wasn't for the society to collapse

2149
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:08,928
It was now

2150
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:12,512
Military leaders

2151
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:14,304
Began to employ strategies

2152
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:17,376
Designed to make that outcome a reality

2153
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:18,400
Spriggs amp

2154
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:20,192
When the war starts

2155
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:22,496
The British use their Navy

2156
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:25,568
To clamp down a blockade on Germany

2157
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:27,360
Now the French

2158
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:31,200
Don't look at that as a very useful strategy because after all

2159
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:37,600
Something like that going to take a long time and no one win this war starts you know a very small minority who turned out the

2160
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:38,368
Because sand

2161
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:43,744
Prophetic no one thinks the wars going to go long enough for something like a blockade

2162
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,280
To actually take effect

2163
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:47,840
Dubai 1916

2164
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:54,240
Everyone is starting to understand that those long-term Anaconda like strangling strategies

2165
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,520
Are very viable

2166
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:58,848
And the British are not the only ones

2167
01:39:59,104 --> 01:39:59,872
Who can do this

2168
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:02,944
German Shepherd

2169
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:08,320
This is the point in the story where it becomes worth talking about it

2170
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:11,136
Easy

2171
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:13,184
This German fleet was a

2172
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,208
Key reason

2173
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:17,280
The tensions especially with Britain increased in the pre-war

2174
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:19,328
Call the anglo-german naval

2175
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:23,168
What is considered to be worth it by a Kaiser

2176
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:28,032
And a government that thought it was important to be able to hold your own at CSO

2177
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:29,824
These ships were built and they cost

2178
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:31,872
An amazing amount of money

2179
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:37,504
A huge amount of industrial capacity of sucked up into this every said you you turn them

2180
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:40,320
Basically friendly Britain into an enemy

2181
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:41,344
And

2182
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,904
Now that you got what you wanted

2183
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:45,440
It's sitting in pork

2184
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:46,464
Continually

2185
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:50,304
I hear you got your country straining every fiber

2186
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:56,448
You know to sacrifice for the war effort kept the civilians are starting to cut back on their caloric intake and here's this Fleet

2187
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,240
So expensive to build and

2188
01:40:58,496 --> 01:41:01,056
Every month sucking up resources and sitting in Port

2189
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:04,384
This is the time in the story

2190
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:08,224
We're because the Germans get a new Admiral

2191
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:13,344
Things start to happen on the surface naval front for really the only time in this war

2192
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:15,392
And if you are

2193
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:19,232
Not for this. Like I am I like to call it the battleship era

2194
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,024
Somewhere between 8

2195
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:24,096
1898 Chevy 1940 is about 50 years

2196
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:27,168
The arrow will you get these armored Leviathan

2197
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:29,728
Just to me they're fascinating

2198
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:31,520
Write an intersection credible vehicles

2199
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:37,152
That you may have to fast forward the show when I start going off on some detail tangent

2200
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:38,944
In only I find interesting

2201
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:42,272
But I think these vehicles are incredible

2202
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:44,064
And there is so little

2203
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:47,136
Evidence of them actually being used

2204
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:52,768
Did on the few occasions know where it happens I tend to look at them rather deeply there's only one occasion and

2205
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:54,304
I don't think I count the

2206
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:58,144
Russo-japanese War pre-dreadnought think only one occasion in history where

2207
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:01,216
These armored ships from this era

2208
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:02,240
50 years

2209
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:07,104
Actually fought the way these Admirals had envisioned they would

2210
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:10,176
In long lines miles long lines

2211
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:12,480
Stretching off to the Horizon you know

2212
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:15,552
Lord Nelson style Pirates of the Caribbean style

2213
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:21,184
And facing a fleet similarly arrayed in shooting you know when the distance between them that only happened once

2214
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:24,256
In this whole 50-year Battleship era

2215
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:26,304
And only happened once in this war obviously

2216
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:28,096
It's a battle in 19

2217
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:29,632
Call the Battle of Jutland

2218
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:34,496
Coop's Like Yours Truly this is a fantastically interesting encounter

2219
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,312
When we were thinking about organizing the story

2220
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:39,104
I know you try to carve out

2221
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,640
Places to take a little

2222
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:46,528
Direction change the momentum you go from the Carnage of Verdun and those of you who know the story Noah

2223
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:48,064
What's coming up in the future of it

2224
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:51,136
And you take a little interlude to talk about other elements not just

2225
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:52,160
The navel

2226
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:55,488
Inside of this but also the fact that the Navy really is a wonderful

2227
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:58,560
Canvas on which to represent the technology of this era

2228
01:42:59,072 --> 01:43:01,632
How big of a deal that is to the people here

2229
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,448
Perpetual problem isn't it

2230
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:06,240
I'm going back in time and seeing

2231
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:10,080
What looks to be ancient technology to us looking at it the way

2232
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:13,920
The people back there looking at it to whom it's cutting-edge stuff

2233
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:15,200
Give me first of all

2234
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:18,016
I was trying to think about the best way to sort of explain

2235
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:20,576
Create an analogy for how these people see the fleet

2236
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:22,624
They having the fleets in the Navy

2237
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:25,184
Along with this new thing these are crap

2238
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:28,512
Are the real cutting-edge technology out there

2239
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:29,280
And

2240
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:32,352
The reason why is because it's just death to be

2241
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:33,376
Too far behind

2242
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:39,776
As I said the best Navy from 1900 would lose to several navies from 1914

2243
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:43,616
That's me you're 14 years I don't think those 1914 Navy lose a ship

2244
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:44,896
That's how quickly

2245
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:45,664
Things are changing

2246
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:49,248
Robert Massey in his book Dreadnought have a great life

2247
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,040
He says in 1900

2248
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:54,112
Nothing you're 14 years before the first world war breaks out

2249
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:58,208
Every single British Admiral commanding a British battleship

2250
01:43:58,720 --> 01:43:59,232
Have been

2251
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:00,000
Train

2252
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:02,560
When they came up in the Navy in the age of sail

2253
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:06,656
So that's an example of how cutting-edge this is

2254
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:13,056
If you want a mental image think of the Titanic the ship that struck the iceberg and went down and everything that's from this

2255
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:16,128
It's sort of a steampunk e

2256
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:18,944
Sherlock Holmes a kind of feel

2257
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:23,296
I always think about it as I mean if you eat if you are up in the command center Wendy's battleships

2258
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:25,344
It's like Star Trek meets

2259
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:32,256
In a Sherlock Holmes are steampunk and instead of having a digital display you'd have one of those in a round dial

2260
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:33,280
Nails with one of those

2261
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:39,680
Arrows that looks like the elevator arrow in a nice New York hotel that goes around on a gold background of me

2262
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:40,704
You know very

2263
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:43,264
Very beautiful accident ships were beautiful

2264
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:46,080
Polish would the whole thing they were just gorgeous

2265
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:49,408
And they were The Cutting Edge technology of their day

2266
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:51,456
And I had to

2267
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:52,480
Resist

2268
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:54,272
Comparing them to spaceship

2269
01:44:55,040 --> 01:45:00,160
As a way to try to have us feel like the people back then felt cushion of me that would be just be so amazing

2270
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:01,440
Like a Starship

2271
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:04,256
But it's a little like one but not enough for the compare

2272
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:06,304
Right as I thought to myself I thought you know

2273
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:12,960
Those people saw battleships has really cutting it but not as much as we would spaceships with an equal number of men

2274
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:13,984
Crew members on board

2275
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:16,544
That would be bigger deal but then I remembered

2276
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:18,080
The submarine

2277
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:25,760
For the people again hard for us to get all wild about them but to the people back then that is science fiction

2278
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:30,112
The very definition of the word right out of Jules Verne's 20000 Leagues Under the Sea

2279
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:32,928
And all of a sudden we have ships that go underwater

2280
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:36,000
Like they have cloaking devices they become

2281
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:37,024
Invisible

2282
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:38,560
And worse

2283
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:41,376
If you're you know an able official back then

2284
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:43,168
Is it they now carry

2285
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:44,704
New weapons

2286
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:47,008
The threatened everything you have

2287
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:49,568
This is what really

2288
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:51,616
Accounts for the cautious nature

2289
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:56,224
Of Naval Warfare in this. Why didn't the ship just all come out blazing and everything

2290
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,528
Well there's all these uncertainties

2291
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:03,136
Part of this. Attraction is that you begin to see a showdown

2292
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:09,792
In Naval Warfare when you haven't had any test of any of the technology long time no one knows what's going to happen

2293
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:15,424
When you get whole fleets out here blazing away with this modern technology it hasn't happened before

2294
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:19,264
One of the things everyone kind of scared about is

2295
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:21,312
The Torpedoes for exam

2296
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:23,616
He's mines you know these floating mines that

2297
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:26,944
It lay in the water and then the ship runs into the man bun they explode

2298
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:29,760
Because these weapons are very very cheap

2299
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:31,296
Right you can make a lot of them

2300
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:33,088
And they can sink

2301
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,112
These

2302
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:35,904
Massively expensive

2303
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:38,464
You know ships that take years to build

2304
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:41,024
And whose loss is catastrophic

2305
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:42,304
I can sync those

2306
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:45,888
That's a huge change because it most and Naval Warfare

2307
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:46,656
General

2308
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:50,240
There are exceptions but when you want to sink a massive expensive

2309
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:51,264
First class

2310
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:54,592
Ship you generally need either another massive

2311
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:56,640
First class ship or a lot of other one

2312
01:46:57,664 --> 01:46:59,200
They have huge survivals

2313
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:02,528
Write a stick and justify their cost in the investment

2314
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:03,808
Now all of a sudden

2315
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:06,880
Free simple Churchill talked about the British admiralty just being

2316
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:07,904
Petrified

2317
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:14,560
That you would turn around one day and these great huge expensive ships that took forever to build and that you only have a limited number of we're just

2318
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:17,376
Disappearing in the blink of an eye boom quick explosion

2319
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:18,144
Mothership gone

2320
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:20,448
When the war starts

2321
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:22,240
Am I the first couple of months that happen

2322
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:24,800
They lose a super dreadnought

2323
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:27,104
Creme Dela Creme of the British

2324
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:28,128
Battleship forces

2325
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:31,712
All the HMS audacious trikes of mine

2326
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:34,272
Like in a month or two after the war starts in that

2327
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:36,064
Pretty brand-new ship almost

2328
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:38,880
And boom goes down 191 battleship

2329
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:39,648
Wow

2330
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:42,976
Again if you're in the admiralty you're going okay what is this mean

2331
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:44,768
And then

2332
01:47:45,024 --> 01:47:49,888
A submarine like since a couple of old British cruises boom boom boom Lemme one right after another

2333
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:51,424
And all of a sudden

2334
01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:56,288
Yeah these people who got these big expensive ships are kind of petrified about using them

2335
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:00,640
Military strike Martin Van creveld have spoken about this we just have this

2336
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:02,688
Strange dichotomy with you

2337
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:09,088
Spend so much money on these vessels cuz they're very important but that because you spend so much money on them you don't want to risk them and so

2338
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:11,392
So you have the German Navy in the British Navy

2339
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:16,512
Dealing with each other as maybe two snipers hunting each other would deal with

2340
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:17,280
Each other

2341
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:18,304
Waiting for

2342
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:21,376
The other side to make a mistake and then when they do pouncing

2343
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:23,680
The problem is is that

2344
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:25,472
When the war starts the British

2345
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:27,520
Clampdown that blockade

2346
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:29,312
And that's all they need to do

2347
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:32,384
The pressures on the Germans to do something about

2348
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:36,224
And every said Winston Churchill who was the civilian

2349
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:39,040
Head of the Navy for a while in the conflict wrote down that

2350
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:45,440
Really well they would have been a lot of advantages that sending the you know numerically Superior British Fleet to go in there and

2351
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:46,464
Is Kik German

2352
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:47,232
Tail

2353
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,072
The downside if you failed to do that

2354
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:55,168
Was so bad it wasn't worth it he said yeah you know we can get all these good things if we

2355
01:48:55,424 --> 01:48:58,240
Decisively defeated the Germans because but if we lost

2356
01:48:58,496 --> 01:48:59,264
Remember

2357
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:05,920
This is all untried technology and Naval Combat weird and unpredictable anyway you could bring the superior

2358
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:07,712
If lead in there and somehow

2359
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:10,016
Lose or just lose enough

2360
01:49:10,272 --> 01:49:15,136
So that you don't have the numerical Advantage anymore you got parody with the Enemy and that was unthinkable

2361
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:17,696
And Churchill said the chances of that happening

2362
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:21,280
Might not be great but if it happens it could cost us the whole War

2363
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:25,632
I remember reading that and thinking to myself I don't know if I buy it

2364
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:28,704
But a whole lot of interesting thoughts come to mind

2365
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:30,752
If you believe what Churchill says

2366
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:32,288
About it

2367
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:34,080
Basically having the potential

2368
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:34,848
To end the war

2369
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:40,224
Now here's how we explained it in this book he said if the German Navy were even to have a nice victory

2370
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:44,576
Against the British cut down the numerical superiority so that they both have the same number of big ships

2371
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:48,160
Then the German Navy would be able to interdict

2372
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:51,232
Just off heading for Britain and Churchill says that that would result

2373
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:52,512
Quote

2374
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:55,584
The trade and food supply of the British Isles

2375
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:56,864
Would have been paralyzed

2376
01:49:57,376 --> 01:50:01,728
Our armies on the continent would have been cut off from their Base by Superior Naval Force

2377
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:06,080
All the transportation of the Allies would have been jeopardized in Hanford

2378
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:08,896
The United States could not have intervened in the war

2379
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:12,480
Starvation an invasion would have descended upon the British people

2380
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:13,504
Ruin

2381
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:16,576
Otterbein final would have overwhelmed the Allied cause

2382
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:19,904
He says the great disparity of the results

2383
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:22,464
Stake in the battle between the British and German navies

2384
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,768
Can never be excluded from our thoughts

2385
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:26,816
And quote

2386
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:30,912
So if you buy Churchill's theory that means instead of being

2387
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:32,960
The most secure of the Great

2388
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:37,312
Powers that I think most of us assume Britney is after all your talking about an island nation

2389
01:50:37,824 --> 01:50:38,848
Country with a motor

2390
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:42,176
Right and then you add the greatest Navy in the world looks pretty secure to me

2391
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:43,968
Churchill's idea here is that

2392
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:46,784
Yeah but we are one lucky punch

2393
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:48,576
Away from that situation changing

2394
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:50,624
To stay with our boxing and

2395
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:51,392
Analogy

2396
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:52,672
And if that's true

2397
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:54,208
The Germans

2398
01:50:54,464 --> 01:51:00,608
Maybe are justified in keeping that Fleet safe in Port in case you need a lucky punch maybe you're losing the war

2399
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:01,632
Or else wrong you decide

2400
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:08,288
You'll send your in a ship's on a death run and take your chances maybe you get lucky right maybe you get a knockout blow

2401
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:12,896
If again you buy into what Churchill saying means that the Germans will

2402
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:15,200
As long as they still have a fleet somewhere

2403
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:19,040
Maintain the ability to win the war with a lucky punch at any time

2404
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:19,808
Find it fast

2405
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:21,344
Don't know if I believe it that's fine too fast

2406
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:25,440
Now the only time in this war

2407
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:30,816
That the attempt at a lucky punch happened it wasn't thrown that way

2408
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:37,216
But the only time that this decisive encounter that could be potentially horrifying if it totally went the wrong way

2409
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:39,776
For Britain the only time this happens

2410
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:41,824
Is in this part of the story where are they now

2411
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:43,872
1916

2412
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:47,456
And happens because of that Admiral we mentioned earlier his name is Reinhard Scheer

2413
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:49,760
He takes over in early 1916

2414
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:51,808
And he feels about the German Fleet

2415
01:51:52,064 --> 01:51:53,344
Pretty much the same way everyone else

2416
01:51:54,368 --> 01:51:57,440
It's time to earn your keep and let's start acting more aggressively with it

2417
01:51:57,952 --> 01:51:58,720
Apple Hill start

2418
01:51:58,976 --> 01:52:00,000
Trying to

2419
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:02,048
The best way to put in a trap the British

2420
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:08,448
The British have more big ships in the German so sheers ideas will let's see if we can ambush

2421
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:10,496
Small numbers of those big ships

2422
01:52:11,008 --> 01:52:15,872
Overwhelm them and slowly but surely Whittle down the advantage in numbers that the British have

2423
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:17,408
And it's one of these

2424
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:19,200
Attempted traps

2425
01:52:19,712 --> 01:52:20,992
That result in this

2426
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:24,320
Really only time for enthusiast like yours truly

2427
01:52:24,832 --> 01:52:25,856
To see what these

2428
01:52:26,112 --> 01:52:28,672
Fleets could do in an all-out encounter

2429
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:30,976
Play Both Sides

2430
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:33,536
Curling steal the horizon

2431
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:37,632
And with all these weapons that you know from a spectator standpoint

2432
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:40,704
You're just dying to see what the heck they can do

2433
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:43,008
I mean let's start with the guns

2434
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:48,896
The guns on these ships are the same kind of guns you saw leveling the Belgian forts in that the Germans were using it

2435
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:52,480
We're done those are the big Naval guns being used on land

2436
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:55,296
Well why didn't they call him Naval guns right

2437
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:58,112
These new battleships I mean for example the britisher

2438
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,416
Bring it in for 5

2439
01:53:00,928 --> 01:53:05,280
Brand new ones that will fight in the Second World War II that have 15 inch guns

2440
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:09,632
And multiple that me like 8 to 12 15 inch guns

2441
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:13,984
That's incredible 13in of armor they wear like 30 thousand tons

2442
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:19,104
The new Queen Elizabeth plaster called they can do like 25 knots if they're really smoking

2443
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:22,688
These are incredible incredible modern worship

2444
01:53:22,944 --> 01:53:25,504
And when you realize that they can hurl a shell

2445
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:28,320
The size of a small Volkswagen

2446
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:35,232
18 miles across the Horizon at a Target that's a hundred ft wide

2447
01:53:35,488 --> 01:53:38,816
While both shooter and Target are moving

2448
01:53:39,072 --> 01:53:41,888
And hope to hit it reasonably well

2449
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:45,472
That's shocking I mean the Spanish American War

2450
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:49,568
I'll less than 20 years before this time. They would fire hundreds of shots

2451
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:51,104
Add about

2452
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:53,664
Just Less Than 3 miles distance

2453
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:57,248
And every now and then they'd score hit you know hundreds to get a few

2454
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:58,528
In the

2455
01:53:58,784 --> 01:54:04,672
Russo-japanese War they broke all records when they open fire at each other at 8 Miles distance

2456
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:06,976
That's 11 years

2457
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:08,512
Before the Battle of java

2458
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:10,304
8 Miles breaking all record

2459
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:13,120
Battle of Jutland has ship that can fire 18 mile

2460
01:54:14,912 --> 01:54:21,056
How do you even hit anything on the horizon will both sides British and German are incorporating against like steampunk techno

2461
01:54:21,312 --> 01:54:22,592
Media rudimentary

2462
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:25,152
Fire Control computer you might call it

2463
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:30,016
And both sides have different versions of the Germans have Superior Optics and so they'll score

2464
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:33,600
The early hits in it when in this encounter that happens

2465
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:34,880
In large part

2466
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:36,928
Because the British are reading

2467
01:54:37,184 --> 01:54:39,488
The naval Communications of the German

2468
01:54:40,768 --> 01:54:42,048
Tell of the battle of Jutland

2469
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:45,376
For a couple of reasons not just because it's the battleship encounter

2470
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:48,704
Of the war but also because it's a rubber meets the road MoMA

2471
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:51,008
Put up or shut up historical

2472
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:52,544
Test

2473
01:54:53,056 --> 01:54:53,568
Where

2474
01:54:53,824 --> 01:54:57,408
All of the military theories in the debates in the

2475
01:54:57,664 --> 01:55:03,808
The philosophical differences amongst experts over the proper way to build the ships and what Naval battles going to be like

2476
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:05,344
Like in the next war and all that stuff

2477
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:08,928
Leaves the realm of the theoretical and gets

2478
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:12,000
A laboratory tested on the naval Battlefield

2479
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:15,840
The land Powers already saw this happen to them right at the start of the war

2480
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:20,960
Their military lands their reason all that the people have speculated about for decades

2481
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:23,264
Got their acid test in the first month

2482
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:26,080
Places like the battles of the Frontiers where

2483
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:29,408
Those sort of high-minded academic debates

2484
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:31,968
Military war colleges about whether or not

2485
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:38,624
Charging Cavalry will have any sort of a role on a modern Battlefield with machine guns and everything I mean that kind of stuff gets test

2486
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:41,440
In the first month of the war and the results are of course

2487
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:45,024
Bloody and decisive even if they won't be absorbed writer

2488
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:48,864
The naval side of this war hasn't had this kind of nasty

2489
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:52,960
Little encounter one of the Falkland Islands another one

2490
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:56,288
Dogger Bank between a few Cruisers here in a battle cruiser

2491
01:55:56,544 --> 01:55:57,056
To there

2492
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:59,360
But nothing like what's going to happen

2493
01:55:59,872 --> 01:56:01,152
And when you realize how

2494
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:02,688
Careful these animals are being

2495
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:05,760
Because of the nature Naval Combat I mean

2496
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:11,648
You could provide an opportunity for someone to get a lucky punch if you're not careful so none of these Admirals wants to go out

2497
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:12,928
Unless they have in it

2498
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:16,000
Unless they have an advantage on their side favorable conditions

2499
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:18,816
The British don't have to do anything

2500
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:25,472
Cuz they got this blockade going so worst case scenario if things just stay as they are there wearing the Germans down

2501
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:27,264
They're going to create

2502
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:29,056
Disintegration

2503
01:56:29,568 --> 01:56:31,616
August 8th just like we told you

2504
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:33,920
Nina was the goal now of these leader

2505
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:38,016
You know if the Germans begin to starve at home

2506
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:44,416
And the caloric intake is already being reduced for their civilians you will see revolution in the street so this Brie

2507
01:56:44,672 --> 01:56:47,488
Free strategy blockade will eventually bring Germany

2508
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:50,560
So it's incumbent upon the Germans to do something

2509
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:55,936
That situation when they get their new album reinhart's year in 1916 who wants to be more aggressive

2510
01:56:56,192 --> 01:56:57,728
He decides to create his own at

2511
01:56:59,008 --> 01:57:00,032
Weather conditions

2512
01:57:00,288 --> 01:57:02,080
For his own advantage

2513
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:03,104
John the naval battle

2514
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:04,896
Reset the traps

2515
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:06,176
In late May

2516
01:57:06,432 --> 01:57:12,576
1960 Nissan S14 what he hopes will be a Detachment of big British warships

2517
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:13,344
Five or six

2518
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:14,624
Battle Cruisers

2519
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:18,976
And entice them past your submarines are into your mind field

2520
01:57:19,232 --> 01:57:24,608
Or into an area where they think they can Feast on some of your light forces and then pounce on them with your big fat

2521
01:57:25,888 --> 01:57:26,912
But that's what sheer plan

2522
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:27,680
Things to do

2523
01:57:27,936 --> 01:57:29,984
Three sets out all these forces

2524
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:31,264
Appears this little ambush

2525
01:57:32,032 --> 01:57:33,568
And what he doesn't know

2526
01:57:33,824 --> 01:57:35,616
Is it the British as we said

2527
01:57:36,128 --> 01:57:38,432
Are reading all these Naval communication

2528
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:41,248
Are the British the greatest cryptographers on the planet

2529
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:43,808
Or is that just the 20th century sort of

2530
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:45,344
Coloring my view

2531
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:52,000
Because boy with a great the 20 Century in the second world war they will famously be reading all the German Enigma traffic among other things

2532
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:56,608
In this war in the first couple of months of German Naval codes fall into their hands

2533
01:57:57,376 --> 01:57:59,168
And while they may not be

2534
01:57:59,424 --> 01:58:01,216
Deciphering every single message

2535
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:02,496
Winning Tire

2536
01:58:02,752 --> 01:58:06,336
German high seas Fleet as it's called hundred ships about

2537
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:10,688
Decides to weigh anchor and go out in a looking to play in the North Sea

2538
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:14,016
The British know about that Dobby big Communications bikes and everything

2539
01:58:14,272 --> 01:58:16,576
So when she decides to sit this ambush

2540
01:58:16,832 --> 01:58:21,184
The British reading the naval codes tell the fleet guess what the Germans are out there

2541
01:58:21,696 --> 01:58:27,840
And they don't know that we know they're out there and so the British Grand Fleet things okay now we have the advantage we will

2542
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:28,864
Crap

2543
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:29,888
The Trappers

2544
01:58:30,656 --> 01:58:33,728
And so the British Grand Fleet which is like 28

2545
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:40,384
You know super dreadnoughts and dreadknots I mean it's the biggest Fleet in the world it's the most powerful Fleet in world history up to this

2546
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:41,152
West Point

2547
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:44,736
And in terms of size and tonnage it may be the biggest feet ever

2548
01:58:45,248 --> 01:58:50,112
It weighs anchor it starts making its way to where this Ambush point is

2549
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:54,976
And it leaves so early by the way because it's got all this Advanced information

2550
01:58:55,232 --> 01:59:00,608
But it totally screws up a lot of Admiral shares Ambush cuz his forces and who had these submarines that were going to be

2551
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:03,680
Outside the British ports and they could shoot at the

2552
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:06,496
British ships as they left the harbor none of that stuff ready

2553
01:59:07,264 --> 01:59:11,616
And so the the British ships make their way to the Rendezvous point where the with the Germans

2554
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:15,968
And you're setting up another Trafalgar he I mean if the British

2555
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:18,016
Emerges

2556
01:59:18,272 --> 01:59:23,648
Interview and catches the German Fleet there you could sink half of it before they get away

2557
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:24,928
And then

2558
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:26,720
Murphy's Law

2559
01:59:27,232 --> 01:59:29,792
Joins the battle movies not take Center Stage

2560
01:59:30,048 --> 01:59:33,888
In this encounter by the way which would have made a great dress rehearsal

2561
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:36,704
Early 20th century Naval Warfare

2562
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:39,008
Unfortunately it's opening night

2563
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:40,544
And you know

2564
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:46,944
You have troubles on opening night with all of the Loose Ends that haven't been fixed yet imagine instead of opening night you're doing the dress rehearsal

2565
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:52,320
And yet you have 250 ships in about 15 square miles when these things come together mean

2566
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:58,976
Things that can go wrong and do go wrong effect this battle mightily and it's a good argument for why these apples

2567
01:59:59,232 --> 02:00:00,768
Those are so cautious they know this

2568
02:00:02,048 --> 02:00:04,096
Murphy's Law intervenes while the British

2569
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:10,496
Are about to pounce on the German because of British send a message back to their intelligence service one of the confirmation of this or that

2570
02:00:10,752 --> 02:00:16,128
Any intelligent people reading the German Naval codes tell them that they made a mistake earlier

2571
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:21,760
They said oh yeah the German fleets not at Sea like we thought they're still safely in Port don't worry about it

2572
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:28,160
So now these Admirals who 5 minutes ago knew where the German fleet was and we're ready to pounce on it

2573
02:00:28,416 --> 02:00:29,952
Don't know they're there anymore

2574
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:31,488
But of course

2575
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:32,768
They are

2576
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:36,352
And so now we have both main fleets

2577
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:39,680
Close to each other in the North Sea

2578
02:00:39,936 --> 02:00:42,496
None of them aware of the other's existence

2579
02:00:45,568 --> 02:00:47,872
So the rhythm of this battle of Jutland

2580
02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:49,920
Is wonderful starts off as a trap

2581
02:00:50,176 --> 02:00:55,040
Flips into a counter trap and now it is serendipitously morphed into

2582
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:56,576
An encounter battle

2583
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:58,368
And that's how it get started

2584
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:02,464
German light forces on one side of the horizon

2585
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:04,768
British light forces on the other side of the horizon

2586
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:07,072
Spot a civilian

2587
02:01:07,328 --> 02:01:08,096
Trawler

2588
02:01:08,352 --> 02:01:14,240
Between the two of them they can't see each other cuz they're so far away the curvature of the earth limit their site but they can both see the trawler

2589
02:01:14,496 --> 02:01:15,264
Bud light units

2590
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:21,664
Unit conversion the trolley to investigate it discover each other start shooting and send messages back to the main Fleet saying guess what

2591
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:23,968
I found over here on the other side of the horizon

2592
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:26,016
The enemy Fleet right

2593
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:30,624
This creates like a war Vortex were all these

2594
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:33,184
Naval forces start converging on this area

2595
02:01:33,696 --> 02:01:35,744
Ships that arrived first

2596
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:36,768
Are the battle

2597
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:41,376
This is an interesting side of the story because the battlecruisers

2598
02:01:41,632 --> 02:01:43,680
Are experiencing a test right now

2599
02:01:44,448 --> 02:01:48,544
And it's the test of whether or not the Admiral that backed this entire

2600
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:49,824
Design

2601
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:51,872
In the decades before this.

2602
02:01:52,384 --> 02:01:53,408
What correct about it

2603
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:58,272
This is a theoretical argument until there's data

2604
02:01:58,528 --> 02:02:01,600
There hasn't been a chance to have any data now we're going to have data

2605
02:02:02,112 --> 02:02:03,648
Are these ships viable

2606
02:02:04,672 --> 02:02:08,256
But first of all you need to know what they are and battlecruiser is a hybrid design

2607
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:10,304
It's supposed to combine

2608
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:12,864
The punching power of a battleship

2609
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:14,912
With the speed of a cruiser

2610
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:17,728
So if a battleship is like some

2611
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:18,752
Giant

2612
02:02:19,008 --> 02:02:19,520
Lion

2613
02:02:19,776 --> 02:02:20,288
For exam

2614
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:21,568
Or tiger

2615
02:02:22,336 --> 02:02:24,896
These battle Cruisers are more like panthers

2616
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:30,272
Now this is going to be confusing because they are all named after like giant cats and so

2617
02:02:30,528 --> 02:02:35,904
The flagship of this battle cruiser Squadron on the British side of the lion so don't get confused if I start talking about

2618
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:36,672
About the lion

2619
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:39,488
But that describes him pretty well

2620
02:02:39,744 --> 02:02:42,304
The hypothetical problem here though

2621
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:44,096
Is that you had to give up

2622
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:45,888
To get the speed of a cruiser

2623
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:48,960
You had to give up the armor of the battleship

2624
02:02:49,472 --> 02:02:51,008
So what we have here is a

2625
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:54,080
Ship with all the Striking power of a battleship

2626
02:02:54,592 --> 02:02:56,384
But one that can't take

2627
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:57,664
A punch by a battle

2628
02:02:58,688 --> 02:02:59,200
Or

2629
02:02:59,456 --> 02:03:00,736
Its counterparts

2630
02:03:01,248 --> 02:03:02,272
Another battle cruiser

2631
02:03:03,808 --> 02:03:07,904
When this was pointed out before the war the Admirals who liked the battlecruiser concept

2632
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:10,720
Waived off this worry by saying don't worry

2633
02:03:10,976 --> 02:03:12,768
Speed will be their armor

2634
02:03:13,536 --> 02:03:17,632
And that's where the argument is because nobody knows if speed will be there armor

2635
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:22,752
Bees battlecruisers approach this battle at 26 or 27 not

2636
02:03:23,008 --> 02:03:23,520
Which is

2637
02:03:24,032 --> 02:03:28,128
Amazingly fast worship their size there are six of them on the British side

2638
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:31,968
Five of them on the German side and when they meet

2639
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:34,528
They begin to open fire

2640
02:03:34,784 --> 02:03:37,600
And only about like eight miles which is short

2641
02:03:38,368 --> 02:03:40,672
The British have the longer-range guns by the way

2642
02:03:41,184 --> 02:03:44,512
But don't open fire first this becomes the first of many things

2643
02:03:44,768 --> 02:03:49,632
That the British Admiral of these battle cruiser the guy named 80 will be critiqued about

2644
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:51,168
You know after this battle

2645
02:03:52,704 --> 02:03:53,984
The battle opens up in about

2646
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:55,776
3:45 in the afternoon

2647
02:03:56,288 --> 02:03:57,312
Visually

2648
02:03:57,568 --> 02:03:58,848
It is hard to see

2649
02:03:59,872 --> 02:04:00,640
The ships

2650
02:04:00,896 --> 02:04:07,040
If you actually see a picture of them at Full Tilt are smoking like they're on fire and when you have a bunch of them there

2651
02:04:07,296 --> 02:04:09,856
Putting tons of this dark suit into the air

2652
02:04:10,368 --> 02:04:12,928
Add to that the fact that were over by Denmark

2653
02:04:13,184 --> 02:04:14,208
In the North Sea

2654
02:04:14,464 --> 02:04:15,232
There's fog

2655
02:04:15,488 --> 02:04:18,048
They're squalls there's mist

2656
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:20,864
There's rain is all kinds of things that inhibit

2657
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:22,400
The ability to see very well

2658
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:24,704
And sometimes one Fleet

2659
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:30,336
Will be in a position where they see the other Fleet really well but the other Fleet doesn't see them and vice versa so the

2660
02:04:30,592 --> 02:04:32,896
Part of being a good animal is trying to arrange your Fleet

2661
02:04:33,152 --> 02:04:39,296
So that the other Fleet is highlighted against the horizon or in some way that makes them an easier Target and your Fleet is kind of a

2662
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:40,576
Sheraton hard to hit

2663
02:04:41,344 --> 02:04:46,720
But ships had not tried to shoot at each other and some of the ranges they're going to try to shoot at each other here

2664
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:51,072
Boonies battlecruiser start shooting at about 3:45

2665
02:04:51,584 --> 02:04:52,352
The British

2666
02:04:52,608 --> 02:04:53,632
Cute long

2667
02:04:53,888 --> 02:04:59,008
Initially over the heads of the German ships the German ships are disconcertingly accurate

2668
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:02,336
They strike the battlecruiser Tiger

2669
02:05:02,592 --> 02:05:05,920
Like 6 times in quick succession with 11 inch shells

2670
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:09,504
Anaphora

2671
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:11,552
They strike the flagship

2672
02:05:12,064 --> 02:05:14,112
The lion with Admiral baby on board

2673
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:16,672
The shells penetrate

2674
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:17,440
The terror

2675
02:05:17,696 --> 02:05:18,464
Which is the

2676
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:20,000
Sort of armored bubbled

2677
02:05:20,256 --> 02:05:21,536
That contains the big guns

2678
02:05:22,048 --> 02:05:26,656
The turret either explodes or catches on fire and there are photographs by the way

2679
02:05:26,912 --> 02:05:30,496
Moments in the Battle of Jutland are not great and I always imagined them

2680
02:05:30,752 --> 02:05:32,288
Zoomed in and colorized

2681
02:05:32,544 --> 02:05:34,592
But you can see the lion burning

2682
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,384
And it looks bad

2683
02:05:36,896 --> 02:05:40,992
And Admiral Beatty didn't realize at the time how closely he came

2684
02:05:41,504 --> 02:05:43,296
To being blown to Kingdom Come

2685
02:05:43,808 --> 02:05:44,832
To find out later

2686
02:05:45,088 --> 02:05:45,600
That

2687
02:05:45,856 --> 02:05:49,952
A guy who was dying and who lost both his legs

2688
02:05:50,208 --> 02:05:52,000
On the line

2689
02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:56,096
Save the ship by flooding the magazine the last order he gave was to

2690
02:05:56,352 --> 02:05:57,632
Flood the whole area

2691
02:05:57,888 --> 02:05:58,656
Where the

2692
02:05:58,912 --> 02:05:59,424
Explosives

2693
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:00,448
To keep them from

2694
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:01,472
Blowing the ship

2695
02:06:01,984 --> 02:06:05,568
Now if Beatty was wondering what it would be like to see one of these

2696
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:06,592
Modern

2697
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:08,128
Amazing ships

2698
02:06:08,384 --> 02:06:09,408
Explode

2699
02:06:09,664 --> 02:06:11,712
He only had to wait about two minutes

2700
02:06:11,968 --> 02:06:12,992
You actually look at the

2701
02:06:13,248 --> 02:06:16,576
Moment-by-moment rundown of this battle and that's part of the fun of naval battle

2702
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:18,112
All these ships kept

2703
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:19,392
Very

2704
02:06:19,648 --> 02:06:25,792
Descriptive and detailed logs about their movement Moment by Moment by moment they've reconstructed this entire battle

2705
02:06:26,048 --> 02:06:28,352
From almost each individual ships viewpoint

2706
02:06:28,864 --> 02:06:33,216
And the part that strikes you when you read a rundown as how quickly everything is happening to

2707
02:06:33,472 --> 02:06:37,312
Baby suffers this hit on his own turret like for 2 minutes later

2708
02:06:37,568 --> 02:06:38,848
Thms in the figurative

2709
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:42,432
A somewhere in the 20000 tonnes

2710
02:06:42,688 --> 02:06:44,224
A battle cruiser

2711
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:45,248
Explode

2712
02:06:47,296 --> 02:06:48,576
Just explode in the moment

2713
02:06:49,088 --> 02:06:51,904
It's Churchill in the admiralty is nightmare come true

2714
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:53,696
In a blink of an eye

2715
02:06:53,952 --> 02:06:59,840
You have a towering Cloud reaching up like 1500 ft Witnesses say you could see

2716
02:07:00,096 --> 02:07:00,608
Pinotage

2717
02:07:00,864 --> 02:07:03,424
Tunnels in guns and everything shooting up

2718
02:07:03,936 --> 02:07:05,472
Into the horizon

2719
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:09,568
And both sides German and British watch this happen together

2720
02:07:11,872 --> 02:07:15,456
Out of the more than 1000 Sailors aboard the independable to

2721
02:07:15,968 --> 02:07:16,480
Survive

2722
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:20,064
It's hard not to include an account by one of them

2723
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:22,880
I did not include an account of the Survivor

2724
02:07:23,648 --> 02:07:26,208
I'm a ship whose magazine gets penetrated

2725
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:32,864
And explode with him on it I guess he was way up high in the top observational are these still call that a crow's nest he said

2726
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:34,400
180 ft High

2727
02:07:35,424 --> 02:07:36,192
His name is

2728
02:07:37,216 --> 02:07:37,984
Foamer

2729
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:42,080
And here's how he described the explosion of the HMS indefatigable

2730
02:07:42,336 --> 02:07:43,616
While he was on board

2731
02:07:43,872 --> 02:07:44,384
Quote

2732
02:07:44,896 --> 02:07:46,944
There was a terrific explosion aboard the ship

2733
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:48,480
The Magazine's went

2734
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:51,296
I saw the guns go up in the air just like matchsticks

2735
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:52,576
12-inch guns

2736
02:07:53,088 --> 02:07:53,856
Bodies and everything

2737
02:07:54,624 --> 02:07:56,160
She was beginning to settle down

2738
02:07:56,416 --> 02:07:58,976
Within half a minute the ship turned right over and she was gone

2739
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:04,608
I was 180 feet up and I was thrown well clear of the ship otherwise I would have been sucked under

2740
02:08:04,864 --> 02:08:06,400
I was practically unconscious

2741
02:08:06,656 --> 02:08:07,680
Turning over really

2742
02:08:07,936 --> 02:08:09,984
At Last I came on top of the water

2743
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:12,800
When I came up there was another fellow named Jimmy Green

2744
02:08:13,056 --> 02:08:14,080
And we got a piece of wood

2745
02:08:14,336 --> 02:08:16,640
He was on one end and I was on the other end

2746
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:19,456
A couple of minutes afterwards some shells came over

2747
02:08:19,712 --> 02:08:21,504
And Jim was minus his head

2748
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:23,296
So I was left on my lonesome

2749
02:08:24,064 --> 02:08:24,576
And quote

2750
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:26,624
Now

2751
02:08:27,648 --> 02:08:29,440
About 20 minutes after that

2752
02:08:30,464 --> 02:08:33,536
The HMS Queen Mary another one of these battlecruiser

2753
02:08:34,048 --> 02:08:34,816
Explode

2754
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:39,168
Same way I mean a little bit different minute she gets hit and then there's this pause and

2755
02:08:39,424 --> 02:08:41,984
Sailors are jumping into the water and then she explodes

2756
02:08:42,752 --> 02:08:48,896
We're accounts from Sailors who were in the water who said the sky was all of a sudden just filled with all this massively heavy debris

2757
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:51,968
It was now falling down on them in the water

2758
02:08:52,224 --> 02:08:54,272
They're all diving into the water trying to

2759
02:08:54,528 --> 02:08:57,600
Escape giant funnels and big metal objects falling on them

2760
02:08:57,856 --> 02:08:59,392
And probably a lot of them didn't this guy

2761
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:01,440
Again more than a thousand

2762
02:09:01,952 --> 02:09:04,512
I'll be Sailors on board a small handful

2763
02:09:04,768 --> 02:09:05,536
Rescued after

2764
02:09:05,792 --> 02:09:07,328
Less than less than 25

2765
02:09:08,608 --> 02:09:09,632
And at one point

2766
02:09:10,144 --> 02:09:14,496
Admiral Beatty turns to a subordinate said there seemed to be something wrong with our bloody ships today

2767
02:09:15,776 --> 02:09:16,288
Detroit

2768
02:09:17,312 --> 02:09:18,336
They're not passing

2769
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:20,896
The acid test the hypothesis

2770
02:09:21,664 --> 02:09:27,808
That you know was the philosophical underpinnings of this entire class of Warships at least on the British side it

2771
02:09:28,064 --> 02:09:28,832
Proven to be

2772
02:09:29,088 --> 02:09:29,600
Floss

2773
02:09:31,392 --> 02:09:32,416
They don't have enough

2774
02:09:32,672 --> 02:09:33,184
Armor

2775
02:09:33,952 --> 02:09:36,768
Speed is not turning out to be there armor

2776
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:39,328
And when their Armor gets pierced

2777
02:09:40,352 --> 02:09:45,472
Yeah the way they're handling this ammunition and the lack of flash protectors and some other things means

2778
02:09:45,728 --> 02:09:49,056
The magazine is catching on fire exploding way too easily

2779
02:09:49,568 --> 02:09:53,152
And you can tell that it's happened too easily become a German side it's not happen

2780
02:09:54,432 --> 02:09:55,200
They sacrificed

2781
02:09:55,456 --> 02:09:56,480
In some other areas

2782
02:09:56,736 --> 02:09:57,504
If their guns are smaller

2783
02:09:58,272 --> 02:09:59,040
They're a little slower

2784
02:09:59,296 --> 02:10:00,064
In order to

2785
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:04,416
Slap some more armor over some of these vulnerable point and are not blowing up

2786
02:10:07,488 --> 02:10:09,280
Again these Germans build ships like

2787
02:10:09,792 --> 02:10:11,840
Mercedes and they're taking a pounding

2788
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:14,400
While they are run

2789
02:10:14,656 --> 02:10:15,424
Away

2790
02:10:17,728 --> 02:10:23,872
That's what you have to notice and what's happening at these battling of these ships are not stationary they're not anchored and staying in the same spot there

2791
02:10:24,128 --> 02:10:24,640
All movie

2792
02:10:25,152 --> 02:10:27,200
And they're all moving in a specific Direction the

2793
02:10:27,456 --> 02:10:30,528
British are chasing the Germans and the Germans are moving away

2794
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:37,184
Now if you were the British Admiral this makes perfect sense to you you've got the bigger ships right and then till they start explode

2795
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:38,720
Going around you you have more of them

2796
02:10:38,976 --> 02:10:42,304
Besides that you have a bunch of big brand new the newest

2797
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:45,632
Most awesome battleships in the world are Queen Elizabeth class

2798
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:47,168
I've already mentioned

2799
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:52,288
Warspite Malaya Valiant all these famous ships that will all fight in the Second World War

2800
02:10:52,544 --> 02:10:58,176
They're Fresh Off The Docks 15 inch guns 30,000 tons 13 inch of armor end

2801
02:10:58,432 --> 02:11:00,224
Baby's got them with him

2802
02:11:01,248 --> 02:11:04,832
So you darn right these Germans are going to run away never mind that

2803
02:11:05,088 --> 02:11:08,160
You know I tried to communicate with those battleships using

2804
02:11:08,672 --> 02:11:09,696
Flags

2805
02:11:10,464 --> 02:11:12,256
Let me talk about Murphy's Law

2806
02:11:12,512 --> 02:11:14,560
Interposing its will on this battle

2807
02:11:15,072 --> 02:11:17,376
Part of it has to do with things that just looks so silly

2808
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:19,168
Ships have radio

2809
02:11:19,936 --> 02:11:22,240
Sometimes these animals are not that cool about using

2810
02:11:22,496 --> 02:11:25,056
Sometimes it have problems by the way so sometimes they're blameless

2811
02:11:25,312 --> 02:11:28,128
But a lot of times these animals are like the old

2812
02:11:28,384 --> 02:11:30,432
Guy trying to use the computer

2813
02:11:30,944 --> 02:11:37,088
And there's so much more comfortable with the way they were brought up in and the things that they did in the Maneuvers in peace

2814
02:11:37,344 --> 02:11:39,904
One of the ways these the ships communicate

2815
02:11:40,416 --> 02:11:46,560
Is by running the orders of the Admiral up on a flagpole they have all these different flags and each one means something different so many ads

2816
02:11:46,816 --> 02:11:47,840
I don't want to communicate

2817
02:11:48,096 --> 02:11:52,448
You know to the fleet his order they run a flag up the flagpole on his ship the flagship

2818
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:57,056
And then every other ship is supposed to as they see it run up the same one and you get the message across

2819
02:11:57,312 --> 02:12:00,896
But this is a method that was used a hundred years before

2820
02:12:01,152 --> 02:12:03,968
And Lord Nelson's time when they're fighting Napoleon

2821
02:12:05,248 --> 02:12:06,272
It ranges

2822
02:12:06,784 --> 02:12:11,648
That are exponentially shorter does that make sense exponentially shorter than the distances in this battle

2823
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:14,208
Went out to smoke and all these other things

2824
02:12:14,464 --> 02:12:17,280
In the peacetime training it seemed to work fine

2825
02:12:17,536 --> 02:12:19,328
In the rigors of combat

2826
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:20,864
It's not working fine

2827
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:24,960
And the big battleships don't see the flag change

2828
02:12:25,472 --> 02:12:29,056
When Beatty tells him to do things and they're not here

2829
02:12:29,312 --> 02:12:29,824
When this

2830
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:36,224
Battle first half as they've been playing catch-up the whole bottle but now you know they're arriving on the scene and their shells are falling soda by the germ

2831
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:36,992
Herman's now

2832
02:12:37,248 --> 02:12:43,392
The British think they've got these German battlecruisers pin down even if you know you're losing a few of your battle Cruisers while you

2833
02:12:43,648 --> 02:12:44,160
Chase them

2834
02:12:44,672 --> 02:12:47,232
But what they don't know is the throwing battlecruisers

2835
02:12:47,488 --> 02:12:49,792
Are leading them into the mall

2836
02:12:50,048 --> 02:12:54,912
The entire German Navy which is coming up from about 40 miles away moving towards them

2837
02:12:55,936 --> 02:12:56,704
What started off

2838
02:12:57,216 --> 02:12:58,496
As the German trap

2839
02:12:58,752 --> 02:13:00,544
Slipped into the British counter trap

2840
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:03,616
Evolved and morphed into the encounter battle

2841
02:13:03,872 --> 02:13:04,896
As now

2842
02:13:05,152 --> 02:13:06,432
By almost

2843
02:13:06,944 --> 02:13:08,736
Improvisational lock

2844
02:13:09,504 --> 02:13:10,528
Become a German

2845
02:13:11,296 --> 02:13:11,808
Ambush

2846
02:13:13,344 --> 02:13:14,624
If successful

2847
02:13:15,136 --> 02:13:17,184
The German Fleet could wipe out

2848
02:13:17,696 --> 02:13:20,000
Four or five battlecruisers

2849
02:13:20,512 --> 02:13:22,560
And four of the newest ships

2850
02:13:22,816 --> 02:13:24,096
In the British Navy

2851
02:13:24,352 --> 02:13:28,192
It would be I'm sure Winston Churchill would say after I could speak for him here

2852
02:13:28,448 --> 02:13:29,472
Catastrophe

2853
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:32,544
And the Germans are on the verge of making it happen

2854
02:13:34,336 --> 02:13:35,104
And then

2855
02:13:35,616 --> 02:13:37,152
A light Cruiser

2856
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:39,200
Scouting For the British

2857
02:13:39,968 --> 02:13:42,016
See the entire German Fleet

2858
02:13:42,784 --> 02:13:43,552
On the horizon

2859
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:49,440
And radios the message back to Admiral Beatty in the grand Fleet under Admiral jellicoe farther away

2860
02:13:49,952 --> 02:13:53,536
And baby sees those Germans very quickly to with the naked eye

2861
02:13:54,560 --> 02:14:00,704
The first thing he does when he realizes he's been baited into this trap is turn his battlecruisers 108

2862
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:02,752
80 degrees in the other direction and start

2863
02:14:03,008 --> 02:14:04,032
Booking out of there

2864
02:14:05,312 --> 02:14:06,080
Once again

2865
02:14:06,848 --> 02:14:07,360
Annie's law

2866
02:14:07,616 --> 02:14:09,152
Say that many times in this battle if I

2867
02:14:09,664 --> 02:14:15,808
Go to deeply into it once again he runs up the flag sang turn around and the big battleships the brand new ones.

2868
02:14:16,064 --> 02:14:22,208
I don't see it and they will end up exposed out there to the entire German Fleet for a while taking a pounding and dishing

2869
02:14:22,464 --> 02:14:24,512
One out to it should be pointed out

2870
02:14:25,024 --> 02:14:25,536
Nonetheless

2871
02:14:25,792 --> 02:14:29,632
What Admiral Beatty has done by turning 180 degrees away

2872
02:14:29,888 --> 02:14:30,400
Is

2873
02:14:30,656 --> 02:14:32,704
Turn himself into bait

2874
02:14:33,216 --> 02:14:34,496
And the Germans are following

2875
02:14:35,264 --> 02:14:38,080
And baby is running back towards his big

2876
02:14:38,336 --> 02:14:43,712
Fleetwood just coming up from also about 40 miles away so now he's flipped the Ambush once again

2877
02:14:43,968 --> 02:14:50,112
And now the Germans are heading toward the only Fleet that is still invisible on this Naval Base

2878
02:14:50,368 --> 02:14:51,392
Battlefield to anyone

2879
02:14:52,416 --> 02:14:53,440
The Germans don't know that

2880
02:14:53,696 --> 02:14:54,464
Does the British Grand Fleet

2881
02:14:58,048 --> 02:14:59,840
But now the British Grand Fleet nose

2882
02:15:00,096 --> 02:15:00,864
But the Germans are

2883
02:15:02,144 --> 02:15:03,424
An admiral Jellico

2884
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:09,056
In-N-Out in a very brave move them he's operating without enough information once again I'm real baby gets blamed for not

2885
02:15:09,312 --> 02:15:11,616
Giving him your good positional information or what not

2886
02:15:11,872 --> 02:15:14,176
A lot of This falls into the category of

2887
02:15:14,432 --> 02:15:18,784
It's a dress rehearsal of these guys a lot of their errors are the kind of things they would have corrected

2888
02:15:19,296 --> 02:15:21,600
If they had a chance to practice it in

2889
02:15:21,856 --> 02:15:23,136
Combat situations

2890
02:15:23,904 --> 02:15:30,048
Unfortunately these are a lot of you know you wouldn't call them rookie mistake but but you would correct these before the next battle nonetheless

2891
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:31,840
Jellico takes a chance

2892
02:15:32,096 --> 02:15:32,864
Deploys

2893
02:15:33,376 --> 02:15:36,192
The entire British Grand Fleet with chinos

2894
02:15:36,704 --> 02:15:37,984
More than a hundred ships over

2895
02:15:38,496 --> 02:15:40,544
1520 square miles of ocean

2896
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:42,080
It takes 15 to 20 min

2897
02:15:42,336 --> 02:15:43,872
That's how well-trained this weed is

2898
02:15:44,384 --> 02:15:45,664
He deploys the whole thing

2899
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:50,016
And he's waiting for the Germans to arrive in the Germans are now in the Mist

2900
02:15:50,528 --> 02:15:55,136
Write this battlefields marry Misty and you will you run through fog Banks you won't see things for a while

2901
02:15:55,392 --> 02:15:57,184
And the Germans can't see what's going on

2902
02:15:58,208 --> 02:16:01,792
And famously Admiral hipper who's the German Admiral in charge of the battlecruiser

2903
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:03,328
Radios

2904
02:16:03,584 --> 02:16:08,704
Admiral Scheer the head of the entire German Navy who's with the German Fleet here

2905
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:11,776
And he famously looks off in the Mist until sheer

2906
02:16:13,056 --> 02:16:14,080
Something lurks in that soup

2907
02:16:14,592 --> 02:16:17,152
We would do well not to thrust into it too deeply

2908
02:16:18,432 --> 02:16:18,944
Too late

2909
02:16:20,736 --> 02:16:22,272
The first thing that happens is

2910
02:16:22,528 --> 02:16:26,624
Is the German start taking some fire and they don't know from where big guns

2911
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:29,440
And then all of a sudden the Mist parts for a second

2912
02:16:29,696 --> 02:16:32,768
And it's a another British battlecruiser

2913
02:16:33,792 --> 02:16:34,560
The invincibles

2914
02:16:35,584 --> 02:16:39,168
And as soon as the Mist Parts in the Invincible becomes clear

2915
02:16:39,424 --> 02:16:42,496
It doesn't take 90 seconds before big German guns

2916
02:16:42,752 --> 02:16:48,896
Are opening fire the shells pouring down on the Invincible and like the other two battlecruisers the

2917
02:16:49,152 --> 02:16:49,920
Vincible explode

2918
02:16:51,712 --> 02:16:54,272
So if anybody has forgotten in the intervening

2919
02:16:54,784 --> 02:17:00,928
You know an hour or two since the earlier battlecruisers exploded that this design is proving to be someone

2920
02:17:01,184 --> 02:17:01,696
What flawed

2921
02:17:01,952 --> 02:17:06,048
The explosion of the Invincible before the two main fleets Collide is a

2922
02:17:06,304 --> 02:17:07,840
Historical reminder

2923
02:17:08,864 --> 02:17:09,888
Nonetheless it's only

2924
02:17:10,144 --> 02:17:12,960
Soon after that the Germans emerge from the Mist

2925
02:17:13,472 --> 02:17:14,496
Defined

2926
02:17:14,752 --> 02:17:17,568
The entire deployed British Fleet

2927
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:18,592
Waiting

2928
02:17:18,848 --> 02:17:22,432
For the men like a crescent around the Horizon and Shear says

2929
02:17:22,944 --> 02:17:28,064
The minute that they can see what's happening the entire Horizon erupts in a sheet of flame

2930
02:17:28,576 --> 02:17:34,208
The Bishops are long way from each other almost invisible to the naked eye smudges up against the horizon

2931
02:17:34,464 --> 02:17:37,024
You see like the smoke of all the ships

2932
02:17:37,536 --> 02:17:43,680
And then you see like the flash of the guns and just like lightning and thunder where you see the lightning and then there's this.

2933
02:17:43,936 --> 02:17:44,960
Play in the Thunder ride

2934
02:17:45,216 --> 02:17:47,264
Same thing you see this Flash and it's

2935
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:48,032
Silent

2936
02:17:48,288 --> 02:17:51,616
And then boom the boom hit you after the shells of already passed over

2937
02:17:53,408 --> 02:17:59,552
You know there are destroyers in these battle giving the talk about all the light ships running around you know sooner parrying and like

2938
02:17:59,808 --> 02:18:00,576
A bunch of little gnats

2939
02:18:00,832 --> 02:18:01,856
Between the battle Fleet

2940
02:18:02,112 --> 02:18:05,952
And these destroyers sometimes describe what it's like when he's giant shells

2941
02:18:06,464 --> 02:18:09,280
Pass over their heads and they say they sound like a locomotive

2942
02:18:09,792 --> 02:18:12,352
When they Screech over your little ships head

2943
02:18:12,864 --> 02:18:16,704
But when they fall in front of your little ship you're like your little Destroyer

2944
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:19,264
They raised geysers of water

2945
02:18:19,776 --> 02:18:23,872
Sometimes 500 sometimes 200 feet up into the air and it's composed of

2946
02:18:24,128 --> 02:18:25,664
Tons of liquid

2947
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:29,248
Which then falls back down to earth in these destroyers these little ships

2948
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:32,576
Are sometimes beaten up pretty severely by all this water

2949
02:18:32,832 --> 02:18:34,880
Smashing back down into them some people are

2950
02:18:35,136 --> 02:18:37,184
Splashed overboard and all these kinds of

2951
02:18:39,232 --> 02:18:40,000
Nonetheless

2952
02:18:40,512 --> 02:18:46,656
Admiral jellicoe has performed a famous Naval maneuver that you never want to be on the receiving end of Paul Crossing

2953
02:18:46,912 --> 02:18:48,448
The tea where he's formed

2954
02:18:48,704 --> 02:18:52,544
The top crossbar the tea and poor Sheeran the Germans form

2955
02:18:54,336 --> 02:18:57,920
In a vertical line of the T in every one of the British ships

2956
02:18:58,176 --> 02:19:01,248
Can fire on the German ships individually is they

2957
02:19:01,504 --> 02:19:03,552
Come to the front of the line it's a disaster

2958
02:19:03,808 --> 02:19:09,440
Very quickly she ever gets hit with more than 22 heavy shells fast and within 10 minutes she or has

2959
02:19:09,952 --> 02:19:10,464
Quite

2960
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:11,488
Tactically

2961
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:16,608
Adroitly by the way turned his Fleet around and disappeared back into the Mist

2962
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:19,424
And once again without radar and all that kind of stuff

2963
02:19:19,680 --> 02:19:25,824
A hard to you know where he is at that point he sends out a bunch of light units in destroyers and what not to cover his Escape so the

2964
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:29,920
The British can't just run after the midnight run into a bunch of torpedoes in mines and stuff

2965
02:19:30,944 --> 02:19:32,736
An inexplicably not to

2966
02:19:33,248 --> 02:19:37,856
How long after the she arrives back into visual range and Little People fire again

2967
02:19:39,136 --> 02:19:45,280
Ashera escapes again cuz he got his T crossed for a second time in one battle which is almost unheard of it shows your jellicoe

2968
02:19:45,536 --> 02:19:46,560
Cuz pretty darn good Abril

2969
02:19:47,072 --> 02:19:49,376
And then there's a little night action between the light units

2970
02:19:49,888 --> 02:19:52,448
What about this time Admiral shares had enough

2971
02:19:52,704 --> 02:19:55,264
You get your T crossed twice in one day

2972
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:57,056
It's time to call it a battle

2973
02:19:57,312 --> 02:19:58,848
Ed Sheeran the Germans manage

2974
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:00,128
To limp home

2975
02:20:02,176 --> 02:20:04,992
When all is said and done the British lose three battle Cruisers

2976
02:20:05,248 --> 02:20:06,528
Three armored Cruisers

2977
02:20:06,784 --> 02:20:08,064
N8 Destroyers

2978
02:20:08,576 --> 02:20:10,368
While one German battle cruiser

2979
02:20:10,624 --> 02:20:15,232
1 pre Dreadnought Battleship for light Cruisers in 5 destroyers are sent to the body

2980
02:20:16,768 --> 02:20:18,304
The casualties at Jutland

2981
02:20:18,816 --> 02:20:22,400
Are not significant they don't hurt either Navy badly

2982
02:20:23,168 --> 02:20:25,728
The British learn their lesson about the battlecruiser design

2983
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:27,776
But the Germans are humbled

2984
02:20:28,544 --> 02:20:34,176
You know they don't come out again in strength mean if it'll be a little encounter here in a little try there but but this is it

2985
02:20:34,944 --> 02:20:36,736
They gave it an attempt

2986
02:20:36,992 --> 02:20:37,504
And

2987
02:20:38,016 --> 02:20:40,064
They seemed permanently shaking

2988
02:20:41,856 --> 02:20:42,624
The German service

2989
02:20:43,392 --> 02:20:46,720
Will not perform another militarily significant

2990
02:20:46,976 --> 02:20:47,488
Move

2991
02:20:48,256 --> 02:20:48,768
In the war

2992
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:53,632
The only part of the German Navy that's going to be relevant

2993
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:55,680
For the rest of the war

2994
02:20:56,448 --> 02:20:56,960
Is the party

2995
02:20:57,216 --> 02:20:57,984
That uses TWRP

2996
02:20:58,240 --> 02:20:58,752
Peatos

2997
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:00,032
To go out

2998
02:21:00,288 --> 02:21:01,312
You're not military Target

2999
02:21:02,336 --> 02:21:02,848
But economic

3000
02:21:05,408 --> 02:21:06,432
By 1960

3001
02:21:06,688 --> 02:21:07,200
16

3002
02:21:07,456 --> 02:21:09,504
The economic side of this war

3003
02:21:10,272 --> 02:21:10,784
Is coming to

3004
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:11,552
The four

3005
02:21:13,856 --> 02:21:15,136
We begin to see

3006
02:21:16,160 --> 02:21:16,672
What

3007
02:21:16,928 --> 02:21:20,256
War on this scale is like when it becomes

3008
02:21:20,512 --> 02:21:24,096
Heart of the normal life of all of these countries you know

3009
02:21:24,608 --> 02:21:27,936
This isn't a new phenomenon anymore by 1916

3010
02:21:28,448 --> 02:21:32,032
By the middle of 1916 we've been doing this for 2 years

3011
02:21:32,544 --> 02:21:35,872
And it's been sucking up more and more of the energy of these

3012
02:21:36,128 --> 02:21:38,432
Nation states are involved in the conflict

3013
02:21:38,944 --> 02:21:40,992
It's very unlike the way most wars

3014
02:21:41,504 --> 02:21:47,392
By these Powers have been fought where the civilian population might not even know what war is happening

3015
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:51,232
If it was happening they certainly weren't directly

3016
02:21:51,488 --> 02:21:53,536
Or importantly impacted

3017
02:21:53,792 --> 02:21:55,072
This war is different

3018
02:21:56,352 --> 02:21:57,632
First of all it's life or death

3019
02:21:58,912 --> 02:22:02,496
The stakes are so high that everybody's involved in the armies

3020
02:22:02,752 --> 02:22:05,056
Are requiring such an immense amount

3021
02:22:05,568 --> 02:22:06,080
Stop

3022
02:22:06,592 --> 02:22:08,384
Have the Germans call this material slot

3023
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:09,152
The Wharf

3024
02:22:09,408 --> 02:22:10,176
Material

3025
02:22:10,688 --> 02:22:15,296
Set the entire civilian population in the production capacity of all these countries

3026
02:22:15,552 --> 02:22:17,856
Gets warped trying to provide it

3027
02:22:19,392 --> 02:22:20,416
As historian

3028
02:22:20,672 --> 02:22:21,696
Gwynne Dyer says

3029
02:22:22,464 --> 02:22:22,976
Quote

3030
02:22:23,232 --> 02:22:25,024
It is significant that the phrase

3031
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:26,048
Homefront

3032
02:22:26,304 --> 02:22:28,352
Came into use during World War 1

3033
02:22:28,608 --> 02:22:32,704
When the role of Munitions workers in the civilian production more generally

3034
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:36,288
Was becoming as important to Victory of the soldiers in the trenches

3035
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:38,848
Without a constant flow of supplies

3036
02:22:39,104 --> 02:22:41,408
Equal to the vast consumption at the front

3037
02:22:41,664 --> 02:22:43,200
The soldiers would soon be helpless

3038
02:22:43,712 --> 02:22:49,856
And since the mobilization of so huge and number of men left vast gaps in the normal Workforce

3039
02:22:50,112 --> 02:22:56,256
Lansing put 20% of its entire population in the uniform Germany 18% and the other major power

3040
02:22:56,512 --> 02:22:57,280
There's not much less

3041
02:22:57,536 --> 02:22:59,328
The remaining adults civilians

3042
02:22:59,584 --> 02:23:03,936
Had to be directed by government into whatever jobs were needed to keep production going

3043
02:23:04,448 --> 02:23:04,960
In effect

3044
02:23:05,216 --> 02:23:07,008
Disability in economy he writes

3045
02:23:07,264 --> 02:23:08,800
Was conscripted to

3046
02:23:09,056 --> 02:23:13,152
The governments of Europe quickly took control over labor and raw material

3047
02:23:13,408 --> 02:23:18,272
Imposed rationing on all scarce goods and created true War economy

3048
02:23:18,784 --> 02:23:24,928
Women flooded into factories to replace the men at the front and most production beyond the basic needs of subsystem

3049
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:26,976
Was diverted into the war effort

3050
02:23:27,744 --> 02:23:28,256
And quote

3051
02:23:29,536 --> 02:23:30,304
Dyer is also the

3052
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:31,072
The one

3053
02:23:31,328 --> 02:23:33,632
It said by this time quote

3054
02:23:33,888 --> 02:23:37,984
Battles had become an industrial operation in reverse

3055
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:40,544
In which the rates of Destruction at the front

3056
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:43,360
Match the rates of production in the industries at home

3057
02:23:43,872 --> 02:23:44,384
And quote

3058
02:23:45,152 --> 02:23:46,432
I think if guys like

3059
02:23:47,456 --> 02:23:49,248
The British military leader

3060
02:23:49,504 --> 02:23:50,016
Hey

3061
02:23:50,272 --> 02:23:52,320
Or even the German military leader

3062
02:23:52,576 --> 02:23:54,112
General Erich von falkenhayn

3063
02:23:54,624 --> 02:23:56,672
And I think about all these skills

3064
02:23:56,928 --> 02:23:58,976
That they required to have now

3065
02:23:59,232 --> 02:24:02,816
Above and beyond what you would think of is a normal generals

3066
02:24:03,072 --> 02:24:03,584
Skills

3067
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:07,168
And you saw this in earlier Wars as famous stories of General Sherman

3068
02:24:07,424 --> 02:24:09,984
In the Civil War in the United States being

3069
02:24:10,240 --> 02:24:14,080
Extra qualified for Modern Warfare because of all these failed

3070
02:24:14,336 --> 02:24:19,968
Jobs in Private Industry he'd had the taught him all these lessons that no one knew a general would need in modern

3071
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:21,760
Things about logistics

3072
02:24:22,016 --> 02:24:22,784
Stuff like that

3073
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:24,832
But by 1916

3074
02:24:25,088 --> 02:24:26,880
A guy like Hague

3075
02:24:27,136 --> 02:24:29,440
A Cavalry commander looks like he would be

3076
02:24:29,696 --> 02:24:30,976
Totally out of his element

3077
02:24:31,488 --> 02:24:33,024
Dealing with the modern

3078
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:35,840
Production needs of warfare as indeed he was

3079
02:24:36,096 --> 02:24:38,656
Duncan Hines a bit more scientific of a guy

3080
02:24:38,912 --> 02:24:41,984
And he's trying to think if I were General fault

3081
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:43,264
World war game

3082
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:45,568
You know what played a lot of those in my time

3083
02:24:46,592 --> 02:24:48,128
And I got assigned

3084
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:51,712
Because I don't think I would take Germany if I had a choice of

3085
02:24:51,968 --> 02:24:58,112
On which side of the war game Germany I command play Germany in this war game and I'm fall

3086
02:24:58,368 --> 02:24:58,880
Valkenhayn

3087
02:24:59,904 --> 02:25:06,048
You know the estimates are especially during this time. If you include the colonial subjects of the of the power

3088
02:25:06,304 --> 02:25:07,840
Hours in Europe during this time.

3089
02:25:08,096 --> 02:25:13,984
My enemies in this war if I'm falkenhayn have 750 million people

3090
02:25:14,496 --> 02:25:15,520
They can call on

3091
02:25:16,288 --> 02:25:18,592
You know for their value in their effort and

3092
02:25:19,104 --> 02:25:20,384
In some cases their lives

3093
02:25:20,640 --> 02:25:23,456
My side of the alliance has about a hundred and fifty

3094
02:25:23,712 --> 02:25:24,224
50 million

3095
02:25:25,248 --> 02:25:31,392
My enemies have the greatest Fleet in the world and I just learned at the Battle of Jutland that my Navy can't come anywhere near touching them

3096
02:25:33,952 --> 02:25:36,768
And they shut down all of my overseas trade

3097
02:25:37,536 --> 02:25:40,608
So fine General falkenhayn already I'm sitting here going

3098
02:25:40,864 --> 02:25:41,632
Wow

3099
02:25:42,144 --> 02:25:48,288
Now you look at the lineup in terms of the kind of countries in each Alliance which of the British and the French in the Russian

3100
02:25:48,544 --> 02:25:49,824
Can just a three big guys

3101
02:25:50,336 --> 02:25:50,848
In the

3102
02:25:51,104 --> 02:25:52,384
Allied entendre

3103
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:56,992
Alliance theatre all first-rate powers Bessie power best land power

3104
02:25:57,248 --> 02:25:59,296
Biggest power all three together

3105
02:25:59,552 --> 02:26:03,648
Wow and then a bunch of other countries like Italy and and smaller powers

3106
02:26:03,904 --> 02:26:07,232
That's a very powerful force who do I have on my side

3107
02:26:07,744 --> 02:26:10,304
Austria Hungary Bulgaria and turkey

3108
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:11,072
Steve bacic

3109
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:13,632
None of those powers are first

3110
02:26:14,144 --> 02:26:15,424
At least the turkey

3111
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:17,216
Start asking me for help all the time

3112
02:26:17,472 --> 02:26:18,240
Vulcan 900

3113
02:26:18,496 --> 02:26:20,800
They're putting on a pretty brave fight they've managed to

3114
02:26:21,056 --> 02:26:22,336
Kick the British French

3115
02:26:22,592 --> 02:26:23,872
South African Indians

3116
02:26:24,128 --> 02:26:26,432
New zealanders and Australian out of Gallipoli

3117
02:26:26,688 --> 02:26:28,480
In January 1916

3118
02:26:29,504 --> 02:26:30,784
Not unexpected

3119
02:26:31,296 --> 02:26:36,928
They managed to beat the British forces mostly Indian troops in a place called coot in modern-day Iraq

3120
02:26:37,184 --> 02:26:40,000
Trap them in a fortress they are forced into surrender

3121
02:26:40,256 --> 02:26:40,768
And

3122
02:26:41,024 --> 02:26:42,816
Took them on a Death March but it really

3123
02:26:43,072 --> 02:26:45,376
Doesn't impact falkenhayn very much one way or the other

3124
02:26:45,632 --> 02:26:51,776
It's just nice for him to know that the Turks are winning as opposed to losing because they are losing against the Russians but it's a mixed bag

3125
02:26:52,032 --> 02:26:53,312
Remember the Turks are tough

3126
02:26:53,824 --> 02:26:54,848
But they are

3127
02:26:55,104 --> 02:26:58,944
Not quite a twentieth-century army so those are all gravy

3128
02:26:59,200 --> 02:26:59,712
Valkenhayn

3129
02:26:59,968 --> 02:27:03,040
The bigger problem if your falkenhayn is your

3130
02:27:03,296 --> 02:27:05,088
Close allies the austro-hungarian

3131
02:27:05,856 --> 02:27:07,136
Pain in the rear

3132
02:27:07,392 --> 02:27:10,976
They don't listen to you to begin with your having fights with their main military leader

3133
02:27:11,232 --> 02:27:17,376
And then they go do what they want anyway and then they screw up cuz they didn't follow your advice and then they come to you and so will you be able to

3134
02:27:17,632 --> 02:27:19,936
Without your falkenhayn there pain in the rear

3135
02:27:20,192 --> 02:27:21,728
He's continually having to take

3136
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:24,544
Scarce troop from places like Verdun

3137
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:26,080
And instead

3138
02:27:26,336 --> 02:27:28,896
Taking the train sending them over Easton

3139
02:27:29,408 --> 02:27:31,456
Saving the austro-hungarians bacon

3140
02:27:32,736 --> 02:27:34,528
Can't really blame them though they're in big trouble

3141
02:27:34,784 --> 02:27:39,392
Anyway they may not have been a country in 1920 even if there hadn't been a first World War

3142
02:27:39,648 --> 02:27:42,976
Are made up of 11 major ethnic groups in that state

3143
02:27:43,232 --> 02:27:45,024
Some of them don't want to be there

3144
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:48,096
And their army is a microcosm of their state

3145
02:27:48,608 --> 02:27:53,472
And you got troops who don't even want to be in your Empire at times

3146
02:27:53,728 --> 02:27:56,032
On the front line that you're asking to die

3147
02:27:56,288 --> 02:27:57,056
For your Empire

3148
02:27:57,312 --> 02:28:01,152
It's not a good situation they're constantly getting into trouble in his

3149
02:28:01,408 --> 02:28:04,992
1 German Diplomat famously says about Germany's situation

3150
02:28:05,248 --> 02:28:06,272
With Austria-Hungary

3151
02:28:06,528 --> 02:28:08,320
We are fettered to occur

3152
02:28:09,344 --> 02:28:10,624
What tie do a dead guy

3153
02:28:11,392 --> 02:28:16,000
And that's the austro-hungarian force now in your favor if you're falkenhayn

3154
02:28:16,256 --> 02:28:19,328
You probably have the best army in the world

3155
02:28:20,096 --> 02:28:21,888
The 1916

3156
02:28:22,144 --> 02:28:23,424
German Army is

3157
02:28:24,448 --> 02:28:25,728
It's a combination

3158
02:28:25,984 --> 02:28:30,080
Of the best aspects of the 1914 force that Germany went to war with

3159

3161
02:28:34,944 --> 02:28:36,224
You're the way writer in passing

3162
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:37,248
Describes it quote

3163
02:28:38,016 --> 02:28:44,160
It is true that the German Army on the Western Front by early 1916 was more skilled and better equipped

3164
02:28:44,416 --> 02:28:46,976
For trench warfare the neither the British or the French

3165
02:28:47,232 --> 02:28:49,024
This is not too surprising he says

3166
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:54,656
And the British expeditionary force it only just expanded its Army from around 250,000

3167
02:28:54,912 --> 02:28:59,264
In 1914 to just over a million largely inexperienced men

3168
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:05,664
And the Frenchie right had always been uncomfortable with the notion of defensive operations rather than the offense

3169

Two spirit

3170
02:29:06,944 --> 02:29:07,712
Ethan says

3171
02:29:07,968 --> 02:29:12,320
Quote many of the German Veterans of the inconclusive though bitter fighting at Ypres

3172
02:29:12,576 --> 02:29:16,672
New Hampshire Powell Artois champagne and Lewis in 1915 have survived

3173
02:29:16,928 --> 02:29:20,000
And stiffened in army that have been well let at the sharp end

3174
02:29:20,256 --> 02:29:23,072
And remain Resolute against Allied efforts in the West

3175
02:29:23,328 --> 02:29:27,424
He didn't come close to beating the Russian armies on the Eastern front in that year also

3176
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:33,824
He's short as John terrain has noted it must never be forgotten that the German army of that. Was very

3177
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:35,872
And quote

3178
02:29:37,152 --> 02:29:38,176
So that's what you were

3179
02:29:38,688 --> 02:29:39,200
To the table

3180
02:29:40,224 --> 02:29:40,736
Is that enough

3181
02:29:42,016 --> 02:29:44,832
Is having the best army in the world enough

3182
02:29:45,344 --> 02:29:47,136
By the way that's something you traditionally

3183
02:29:47,648 --> 02:29:49,184
Think of when you think of the French

3184
02:29:49,696 --> 02:29:53,024
But it's safe to say I think that since about 1870

3185
02:29:53,280 --> 02:29:55,072
The Germans have the best army in the world

3186
02:29:55,328 --> 02:29:59,680
Will that compensate for all the downsides of the Central Powers have

3187
02:30:00,448 --> 02:30:01,216
Hard to know

3188
02:30:01,984 --> 02:30:06,848
One of the worst is the fact that the left hand and the right hand don't know what each other were doing in the Central Powers

3189
02:30:07,104 --> 02:30:12,992
The austrians go off the reservation all the time don't tell anybody but they're doing don't get any approval don't work together with anyone

3190
02:30:13,504 --> 02:30:15,296
And it's a handicap

3191
02:30:15,552 --> 02:30:16,576
Especially when

3192
02:30:16,832 --> 02:30:20,672
The Allies / aunt and forces are pretty darn good at this

3193
02:30:21,184 --> 02:30:25,536
They have an agreement that they made in 1915 to come to the aid of each other when hard-pressed

3194
02:30:25,792 --> 02:30:27,328
When the Germans launch Verdun

3195
02:30:27,584 --> 02:30:28,352
Within a month

3196
02:30:28,608 --> 02:30:32,192
The Russians come riding to the rescue in Lithuania trying to help

3197
02:30:33,216 --> 02:30:37,824
They launched an offensive that they are clearly not ready for and how could you be that would be very

3198
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:40,384
Short time in this period to a planned

3199
02:30:40,896 --> 02:30:43,712
Stocked up for carried out an offensive

3200
02:30:44,224 --> 02:30:49,600
March 1916 the Russians throw human wave attacks at the Germans

3201
02:30:50,112 --> 02:30:51,904
And predictably get mowed down

3202
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:52,672
The Germans

3203
02:30:53,184 --> 02:30:56,512
You're looking at the corpses thought these people totally untrained can infer

3204
02:30:57,280 --> 02:30:59,584
As though the Russians were willing to throw tons

3205
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:00,864
Human meat

3206
02:31:01,632 --> 02:31:07,520
At the Germans simply to scare them enough so that they would pull some units out of her down and take some pressure off the French

3207
02:31:08,032 --> 02:31:09,312
It was so inept

3208
02:31:09,824 --> 02:31:13,664
That some of the casualties of Russian soldiers suffered were because of

3209
02:31:13,920 --> 02:31:16,736
Being shelled by their own sides artillery which is always a tree

3210
02:31:18,272 --> 02:31:18,784
And

3211
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:22,112
12000 Russian soldiers froze

3212
02:31:22,368 --> 02:31:23,136
In one night

3213
02:31:23,904 --> 02:31:25,184
Lolis were wounded

3214
02:31:25,696 --> 02:31:31,584
Bought a bunch of people that just you know where out there in the cold without the proper stuff I mean the Russian Logistics are

3215
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:34,400
Traditionally pretty horrible especially in this.

3216
02:31:35,168 --> 02:31:36,448
It shows you the nature

3217
02:31:36,960 --> 02:31:37,472
Of

3218
02:31:37,728 --> 02:31:38,752
An operation

3219
02:31:39,264 --> 02:31:40,032
The Russians are not

3220
02:31:40,544 --> 02:31:43,360
Generally thought of his handling these sorts of things well

3221
02:31:44,128 --> 02:31:44,640
And

3222
02:31:44,896 --> 02:31:45,408
In

3223
02:31:45,664 --> 02:31:47,456
March 1916

3224
02:31:47,968 --> 02:31:50,016
They don't handle it well again

3225
02:31:51,296 --> 02:31:53,344
The worst part probably from the Russian respect

3226
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:56,416
That way they went to all that trouble and it didn't take any pressure off the

3227
02:31:57,696 --> 02:31:58,208
Ever done

3228
02:31:59,744 --> 02:32:00,256
The

3229
02:32:00,768 --> 02:32:03,072
Follow-up effort though by the Russians

3230
02:32:03,584 --> 02:32:06,144
On June 4th 1916

3231
02:32:06,400 --> 02:32:07,424
Will be handled

3232
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:11,264
Much better surprisingly well if you're a guy like falkenhayn

3233
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:14,592
And you've written off with a lot of your other generals any

3234
02:32:14,848 --> 02:32:18,176
Chance the Russians have doing anything significant 219

3235
02:32:18,688 --> 02:32:19,200
16

3236
02:32:19,712 --> 02:32:23,296
On June 4th 1916 the Russians do something very significant

3237
02:32:23,552 --> 02:32:27,648
Led by their unquestionably best General in the first World War

3238
02:32:28,416 --> 02:32:28,928
A guy named

3239
02:32:29,184 --> 02:32:29,696
Brusilov

3240
02:32:31,488 --> 02:32:34,560
Weed mentioned in an earlier episode that the Russians

3241
02:32:35,072 --> 02:32:36,352
Simply couldn't.

3242
02:32:36,608 --> 02:32:39,680
I mean they weren't they were okay sometimes on the defense but they couldn't attack

3243
02:32:39,936 --> 02:32:40,448
The problem

3244
02:32:40,704 --> 02:32:42,496
Is always the same they just have

3245
02:32:42,752 --> 02:32:45,056
Such an old-fashioned not up to date

3246
02:32:45,312 --> 02:32:47,360
Logistics system that the farther

3247
02:32:47,872 --> 02:32:53,504
You moved away from where you started the harder it was to get the supplies necessary for a modern Army to run

3248
02:32:54,272 --> 02:32:55,296
But where she loved

3249
02:32:55,552 --> 02:32:58,624
Is the most modern Commander the Russians have

3250
02:32:59,136 --> 02:33:04,512
He's been learning from fighting the best army in the world the Germans all this time

3251
02:33:04,768 --> 02:33:06,048
And even that was a Cavalry

3252
02:33:06,304 --> 02:33:09,120
Commander and they have a reputation for always being sort of old-fashioned

3253
02:33:09,376 --> 02:33:10,912
We're still out and braces

3254
02:33:11,424 --> 02:33:14,496
The new systems out there in the new technology for example

3255
02:33:14,752 --> 02:33:19,104
He does something almost no Russian army ever does in the first world war he uses aircraft

3256
02:33:19,616 --> 02:33:24,736
To help as spotters in to locate positions behind the lines in for reconnaissance

3257
02:33:25,248 --> 02:33:26,016
Right there

3258
02:33:26,272 --> 02:33:30,624
He's acting in a much more Modern Way than Russian armies do remember we talkin about an army

3259
02:33:31,136 --> 02:33:34,208
That for the entire length of the first World War

3260
02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:37,792
Will still be wearing cloth cap they never get

3261
02:33:38,048 --> 02:33:38,560
Metal helmet

3262
02:33:39,328 --> 02:33:42,912
During the duration the first world war is a very old-fashioned fashioned Army

3263
02:33:43,168 --> 02:33:47,008
Takes what he can do that's modern and uses it

3264
02:33:49,056 --> 02:33:52,128
The launch is his famous offensive named after him

3265
02:33:52,384 --> 02:33:56,736
On June 4th and he does so with a very modern artillery barrage intense but short

3266
02:33:58,016 --> 02:34:00,576
He's used also to camouflage to

3267
02:34:00,832 --> 02:34:02,624
Hide his intentions even as far as

3268
02:34:03,136 --> 02:34:03,904
Painting

3269
02:34:04,416 --> 02:34:05,952
Fake trenches on the ground

3270
02:34:06,208 --> 02:34:08,000
Behind his lines to confuse

3271
02:34:08,512 --> 02:34:10,816
The Germans in the austro-hungarians on the other side

3272
02:34:13,632 --> 02:34:14,912
And when he launches his attack

3273
02:34:16,192 --> 02:34:17,984
He does so along

3274
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:19,264
An enormous front

3275
02:34:19,776 --> 02:34:21,568
The Eastern Front different than the Western Front

3276
02:34:21,824 --> 02:34:23,360
Disturbing this really constrained

3277
02:34:23,616 --> 02:34:28,992
Small area which they can build a wall from side-to-side really easily it's a huge error

3278
02:34:29,248 --> 02:34:32,576
So it's much more thinly defended in leprosy love does

3279
02:34:32,832 --> 02:34:36,672
Is he attacks across this giant front with a half million men

3280
02:34:36,928 --> 02:34:42,816
Intending to break upon the defenses of the central powers like a wave breaks on a Breakwater

3281
02:34:43,584 --> 02:34:47,168
And knowing that in many places his forces will get pushed backwards

3282
02:34:47,424 --> 02:34:52,032
But where he meets weakness they should burst through here's the way

3283
02:34:52,288 --> 02:34:54,080
Writer GJ Meyer explains

3284
02:34:54,336 --> 02:34:55,360
What happens

3285
02:34:56,896 --> 02:34:57,664
On June 5th

3286
02:34:57,920 --> 02:34:58,432
When

3287
02:34:58,688 --> 02:35:00,992
Hours after the artillery bombardment starts

3288
02:35:01,504 --> 02:35:05,600
The half-million Russian forces step out of their trenches and move toward the

3289
02:35:05,856 --> 02:35:09,440
Mostly austro-hungarian line but they were German troops to

3290
02:35:09,696 --> 02:35:10,208
Quote

3291
02:35:10,976 --> 02:35:15,328
Is infantry when it attacked on June 5th found the austrians in confusion

3292
02:35:15,584 --> 02:35:16,352
Hit advanced

3293
02:35:16,608 --> 02:35:21,984
Stunned them with its scope extending as a did along a line of more than 250 miles

3294
02:35:22,496 --> 02:35:25,056
She loves the idea was that by attacking everywhere

3295
02:35:25,312 --> 02:35:27,104
He was sure to find holes somewhere

3296
02:35:27,616 --> 02:35:30,432
And he had moved his reserves scant though they were

3297
02:35:30,688 --> 02:35:34,784
Close enough to the front so that they can exploit opportunities as soon as any appeared

3298
02:35:35,296 --> 02:35:35,808
And quote

3299
02:35:36,832 --> 02:35:37,600
He continues

3300
02:35:37,856 --> 02:35:38,368
Quote

3301
02:35:38,880 --> 02:35:41,184
And the result was from the first hour

3302
02:35:41,440 --> 02:35:44,000
That's accessible most incredible magnitude

3303
02:35:44,512 --> 02:35:47,840
The austro-hungarian 4th Army disintegrated when hit

3304
02:35:48,096 --> 02:35:53,216
71000 of its men more than half the Army were killed wounded or captured

3305
02:35:53,472 --> 02:35:55,776
The seventh was wrecked even more completely

3306
02:35:56,032 --> 02:35:58,336
Losing 133000 men

3307
02:35:58,592 --> 02:36:00,128
He was the same almost everywhere

3308
02:36:00,384 --> 02:36:01,408
After three days

3309
02:36:01,664 --> 02:36:05,504
Priscilla found himself in possession of three hundred thousand prisoners

3310
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:06,784
Before the end of the week

3311
02:36:07,040 --> 02:36:09,600
More than half of the Austrian Defenders have become casual

3312
02:36:10,624 --> 02:36:11,136
And quote

3313
02:36:12,672 --> 02:36:13,440
Priscilla

3314
02:36:13,696 --> 02:36:14,208
Chatter

3315
02:36:14,976 --> 02:36:15,488
The Austrian

3316
02:36:16,768 --> 02:36:19,072
And then he ran into the typical problem

3317
02:36:19,584 --> 02:36:21,632
Any Russian Commander runs into

3318
02:36:21,888 --> 02:36:24,704
The inability of the Russian army and government

3319
02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:30,592
To get him enough stuff fast enough for him to not slow down and have his offensive Peter out

3320
02:36:31,360 --> 02:36:32,896
But this maneuver

3321
02:36:33,152 --> 02:36:35,456
Add a domino like effect

3322
02:36:35,968 --> 02:36:36,736
On the war

3323
02:36:36,992 --> 02:36:38,528
Because at Verdun

3324
02:36:38,784 --> 02:36:41,856
Falkenhayn now had a crisis on his hands in the east

3325
02:36:42,368 --> 02:36:45,184
Where he was going to have to pull troops out of Verdun

3326
02:36:45,440 --> 02:36:48,768
To go save the austro-hungarian Army which was to centigrade

3327
02:36:49,536 --> 02:36:50,560
And let's understand

3328
02:36:51,328 --> 02:36:53,632
The austro-hungarian forces we told you about those

3329
02:36:54,144 --> 02:36:54,656
Those troops

3330
02:36:54,912 --> 02:36:56,704
Who were a microcosm of the

3331
02:36:57,216 --> 02:37:03,360
Empire is a whole who didn't want to be there you had whole units and I mean battalions regimen

3332
02:37:03,872 --> 02:37:04,640
I'm slob

3333
02:37:05,408 --> 02:37:08,992
Throw down their weapons and surrender to the Russians who by the way are slobs

3334
02:37:09,248 --> 02:37:10,272
To let us not forget

3335
02:37:10,528 --> 02:37:16,672
That this War began when a Slavic National assassinated the austro-hungarian air.

3336
02:37:16,928 --> 02:37:20,512
The throne right and now we're asking slobs to fight for that

3337
02:37:20,768 --> 02:37:21,536
Empire

3338
02:37:21,792 --> 02:37:27,936
Many of them threw down their weapons they didn't want to die and they certainly do more die fighting with an Empire and they certainly didn't want to die

3339
02:37:28,192 --> 02:37:29,216
Fighting for the empire

3340
02:37:29,472 --> 02:37:31,776
Against their Slavic brethren

3341
02:37:32,032 --> 02:37:33,568
In fact some of these units

3342
02:37:34,080 --> 02:37:40,224
Are said to have jumped into the trenches with the Russians turned around and trained their guns back on the side they had J

3343
02:37:40,480 --> 02:37:40,992
Defected

3344
02:37:42,272 --> 02:37:46,624
The Germans will manage to contain with their wonderful Army the Russian threat

3345
02:37:47,392 --> 02:37:48,416
And they will

3346
02:37:49,184 --> 02:37:52,256
Halt murcielagos advance and even deal with defeat

3347
02:37:52,512 --> 02:37:53,536
To the Russians

3348
02:37:54,304 --> 02:37:56,608
But already the single-minded focus

3349
02:37:57,120 --> 02:37:59,424
Falkenhayn on Verdun has been shattered

3350
02:37:59,936 --> 02:38:05,824
The Russians who put in such a wonderful effort in the brusilov offensive in did such terrible damage to the austrians

3351
02:38:06,080 --> 02:38:08,896
Suffered immensely though while doing so

3352
02:38:09,408 --> 02:38:11,200
Well over a million cash

3353
02:38:11,712 --> 02:38:13,248
You suffered in the brusilov offensive

3354
02:38:13,760 --> 02:38:15,808
Which once again takes the Russians

3355
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:22,464
And begins to ratchet up the level of dissatisfaction getting them closer and closer

3356
02:38:22,720 --> 02:38:28,864
To the breaking point you can almost feel it in the air in 1916 a couple of these major powers are

3357
02:38:29,120 --> 02:38:31,168
Are within one good punch of going down

3358
02:38:32,960 --> 02:38:33,728
In the spring of nineteen

3359
02:38:33,984 --> 02:38:34,496
16

3360
02:38:35,264 --> 02:38:35,776
French

3361
02:38:36,288 --> 02:38:38,848
Military leader Joseph Shaffer tells his British counterpart

3362
02:38:39,872 --> 02:38:40,384
The prince

3363
02:38:41,152 --> 02:38:41,664
Is one of those

3364
02:38:43,968 --> 02:38:44,992
Within a good shot

3365
02:38:45,760 --> 02:38:46,272
Remember

3366
02:38:46,784 --> 02:38:51,392
Yeah by this time they've had a month or two at Verdun the French of suffered like 200,000 casualty

3367
02:38:52,928 --> 02:38:54,720
And at least this early.

3368
02:38:54,976 --> 02:38:55,488
2 months

3369
02:38:55,744 --> 02:38:56,768
Into 10 but no

3370
02:38:57,024 --> 02:38:57,536
Nobody knows it yet

3371
02:38:57,792 --> 02:39:00,608
At the Battle of Verdun it looks like the German leader Falcon Heinz plant

3372
02:39:00,864 --> 02:39:02,912
Lead the French army white is working

3373
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:04,960
Why you can't take your eyes off

3374
02:39:05,216 --> 02:39:07,008
The first world war there like to Prizefighter

3375
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:11,616
I just when you think one guys taking over the fight the other guy went a good shot in somebody's knees buckle

3376
02:39:11,872 --> 02:39:13,920
And spring of 1916 dropper tails

3377
02:39:14,176 --> 02:39:15,200
Sir Douglas Haig

3378
02:39:15,456 --> 02:39:15,968
The current command

3379
02:39:16,480 --> 02:39:16,992
British forces

3380
02:39:18,016 --> 02:39:19,040
It's ran Sweeney's

3381
02:39:21,344 --> 02:39:22,368
The urges Hague

3382
02:39:22,624 --> 02:39:26,208
Just start that summer offensive that he's been planning for a long time on the River Song

3383
02:39:26,464 --> 02:39:26,976
Early

3384
02:39:27,744 --> 02:39:29,024
And if you don't start early

3385
02:39:29,536 --> 02:39:30,816
The French army will cease to exist

3386
02:39:31,072 --> 02:39:31,584
Exist

3387
02:39:33,632 --> 02:39:34,144
Get so worked up

3388
02:39:34,400 --> 02:39:34,912
We're told

3389
02:39:35,168 --> 02:39:35,680
He can only be

3390
02:39:35,936 --> 02:39:37,216
Consoled and calm down with

3391
02:39:38,240 --> 02:39:38,752
Lots

3392
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:40,544
1840 Bland

3393
02:39:41,568 --> 02:39:42,080
The year 18

3394
02:39:42,592 --> 02:39:43,104
Jafra

3395
02:39:46,944 --> 02:39:47,712
Nonetheless

3396
02:39:48,736 --> 02:39:50,272
Taig speeds up the

3397
02:39:50,784 --> 02:39:52,320
Big offensive

3398
02:39:52,576 --> 02:39:53,344
Plan for the sunroof

3399
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:57,696
1916 discussed with all the other allies in late 1915 this is a

3400
02:39:58,208 --> 02:40:00,512
Long-term plan and he's going to launch it early

3401
02:40:01,024 --> 02:40:02,560
This long-term plan

3402
02:40:03,072 --> 02:40:05,888
Results in the most controversial piece

3403
02:40:06,656 --> 02:40:07,936
From the British standpoint

3404
02:40:08,448 --> 02:40:10,240
Of this whole War maybe of

3405
02:40:10,496 --> 02:40:12,544
British military history innocent

3406
02:40:12,800 --> 02:40:13,312
Priority

3407
02:40:14,080 --> 02:40:14,592
First of all

3408
02:40:14,848 --> 02:40:16,384
Douglas Haig you have to

3409
02:40:17,408 --> 02:40:17,920
Field Marshal

3410
02:40:18,176 --> 02:40:19,712
Choppers talking to is the new guy

3411
02:40:21,248 --> 02:40:23,040
Just like most of the great powers

3412
02:40:23,296 --> 02:40:26,624
In the first world war by 1916 they've fired

3413
02:40:26,880 --> 02:40:27,904
The person that got them into

3414
02:40:28,416 --> 02:40:28,928
That's right

3415
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:30,464
Dewar's terrible

3416
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:31,232
Everybody's

3417
02:40:31,488 --> 02:40:36,352
Your predictions were wrong nobody's fighting it well so one by one all these countries are sacking the people

3418
02:40:36,608 --> 02:40:37,120
They got them into this

3419
02:40:37,376 --> 02:40:43,520
The Russians dropped there at the Germans have falkenhayn cuz they got rid of on mold count while the war was in its early phases

3420
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:46,080
The French still have Joffrey

3421
02:40:46,336 --> 02:40:47,104
Crazily enough

3422
02:40:47,616 --> 02:40:48,384
But

3423
02:40:48,640 --> 02:40:52,224
You know about reputation of the miracle of the Marne in 1914 only

3424
02:40:52,480 --> 02:40:54,528
Carry you so far I didn't have long

3425
02:40:54,784 --> 02:40:55,552
To go either

3426
02:40:56,064 --> 02:40:59,904
And the British in late 1950s actor John friends like we told you the last episode

3427
02:41:00,160 --> 02:41:02,720
The guy who gets his gig is a guy named Douglas Haig

3428
02:41:03,232 --> 02:41:07,072
If you feel Marshall he's another one of these Cavalry Commanders

3429
02:41:07,584 --> 02:41:13,216
It's always weird we have a war Cavalry become something you keep off to the side and don't use cuz it just gets killed

3430
02:41:13,472 --> 02:41:15,520
And the horses are more important to move

3431
02:41:15,776 --> 02:41:16,288
Stop

3432
02:41:16,800 --> 02:41:18,080
Is crazily enough

3433
02:41:18,336 --> 02:41:20,640
And we haven't talked enough about this and will get to it

3434
02:41:20,896 --> 02:41:22,432
Horses are everywhere there's

3435
02:41:22,688 --> 02:41:24,480
Millions of them in this war

3436
02:41:24,992 --> 02:41:26,528
And your casualties too by the way

3437
02:41:27,552 --> 02:41:31,904
But all these Cavalry commanders French Hague all these guys have these visions that we're going to

3438
02:41:32,160 --> 02:41:36,768
Break the German line somewhere in the Cavalry going to go rushing in the hole we create

3439
02:41:37,024 --> 02:41:38,048
I'm going to the back and it's

3440
02:41:38,304 --> 02:41:39,072
It's D

3441
02:41:39,584 --> 02:41:40,096
Free

3442
02:41:40,864 --> 02:41:41,632
Univera macht

3443
02:41:41,888 --> 02:41:42,656
Armor Blitz

3444
02:41:42,912 --> 02:41:43,424
Krieg

3445
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:44,448
Version of that

3446
02:41:44,960 --> 02:41:46,752
That's a strategy that's been used throughout his

3447
02:41:48,800 --> 02:41:49,568
Go back to

3448
02:41:49,824 --> 02:41:53,664
Dupree Alexander trying to smash the Cavalry into the hole in roll up the line

3449
02:41:53,920 --> 02:41:58,272
It was great before you have motor vehicles and that's what these Cavalry commanders are still dreaming of

3450
02:41:58,528 --> 02:42:04,160
2 years into the war that puts the final nail into the coffin to the idea that this Cavalry has any

3451
02:42:04,672 --> 02:42:05,952
Offencive rolled

3452
02:42:07,488 --> 02:42:08,512
All you have to remember

3453
02:42:08,768 --> 02:42:14,144
It still is the fastest moving thing on the battlefield in large numbers you're starting to get motor vehicles but

3454
02:42:14,400 --> 02:42:20,544
The top of the motor vehicles to handle to rain in the very unreliable horses are still the fastest Mobility you have so their value

3455
02:42:20,800 --> 02:42:21,568
Table just for that

3456
02:42:22,080 --> 02:42:23,616
Tortelloni very vulnerable

3457
02:42:25,152 --> 02:42:25,664
Stories of

3458
02:42:26,688 --> 02:42:27,456
Dead horses

3459
02:42:27,712 --> 02:42:28,224
Is in the suffering

3460
02:42:28,736 --> 02:42:29,248
Five animals

3461
02:42:29,504 --> 02:42:30,272
In the story

3462
02:42:30,784 --> 02:42:31,552
Is under

3463
02:42:32,064 --> 02:42:32,576
Disgust

3464
02:42:33,856 --> 02:42:35,648
Douglas Haig the new British

3465
02:42:35,904 --> 02:42:36,672
Cavalry commander

3466
02:42:37,952 --> 02:42:41,792
Has at his disposal some of the largest really the largest armies

3467
02:42:42,048 --> 02:42:44,352
Did Britain has ever had ready to go to war

3468
02:42:44,864 --> 02:42:46,400
Because those volunteers

3469
02:42:46,912 --> 02:42:48,192
It started joining when

3470
02:42:48,704 --> 02:42:54,080
Lord Horatio Kitchener you remember the British military leader from the beginning of war the guy who when you see his picture

3471
02:42:54,336 --> 02:42:55,104
Scream

3472
02:42:55,360 --> 02:42:56,384
19th century

3473
02:42:56,640 --> 02:42:57,152
Man

3474
02:42:57,664 --> 02:43:02,016
I mean it was a giant mustache from another are you can almost see him in a British Redcoat

3475
02:43:02,272 --> 02:43:08,416
And he's the big face in the recruiting poster telling Britain's patriotic Britain's to sign up for king and country and a shilling

3476
02:43:09,440 --> 02:43:11,744
Kitchener's another one of these prewar

3477
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:15,840
Early war generals military leader who's been tarred by

3478
02:43:16,352 --> 02:43:21,472
You know their conduct in the war they don't they don't end up looking so genius like when the first world war gets done

3479
02:43:21,728 --> 02:43:22,240
Body right

3480
02:43:22,496 --> 02:43:25,824
So is kitchener's reputation to starting to wane he still

3481
02:43:26,336 --> 02:43:26,848
Got

3482
02:43:27,104 --> 02:43:28,896
And one real feather in his cap and that's

3483
02:43:29,152 --> 02:43:32,992
Those armies that he helped recruit in 1914 and 1915 and that he is

3484
02:43:33,504 --> 02:43:34,528
Protected like a

3485
02:43:34,784 --> 02:43:35,552
Proud parent

3486
02:43:35,808 --> 02:43:41,952
Don't send it to Gallipoli don't send her the Western Front early don't throw them in the meat grinder like everything else save them and real

3487
02:43:42,208 --> 02:43:47,328
Really make use of their patriotic contribution did people want to win the war let's put them in a position where they can do that

3488
02:43:47,840 --> 02:43:50,656
He done an admirable job of that in about three weeks before

3489
02:43:51,168 --> 02:43:51,680
Those

3490
02:43:52,192 --> 02:43:56,288
Soldiers known sometimes as the Kitchener armies are the Kitchener divisions after him

3491
02:43:56,800 --> 02:43:58,080
Are going to lose the guy

3492
02:43:58,592 --> 02:44:03,712
That was probably most responsible for seeing that they weren't used up already in the first place

3493
02:44:03,968 --> 02:44:06,272
Kitchener dies about 3 weeks before his Legions

3494
02:44:06,528 --> 02:44:07,040
Arthro Ninja

3495
02:44:07,296 --> 02:44:07,808
Frye

3496
02:44:09,088 --> 02:44:10,112
It's a crazy story

3497
02:44:10,624 --> 02:44:13,440
I'm told that it is the same

3498
02:44:13,696 --> 02:44:15,744
Has any one of those big modern deaths

3499
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:17,280
So the same as a

3500
02:44:17,536 --> 02:44:19,328
Princess Lady Diana dying

3501
02:44:19,584 --> 02:44:25,728
Or Winston Churchill dying or JFK died in the United States you said yourself you remember when that happened in Britain's of the.

3502
02:44:25,984 --> 02:44:27,264
Remember where they were when they heard

3503
02:44:27,776 --> 02:44:31,104
Lord Horatio Kitchener British military leader in almost

3504
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:32,640
Demigod

3505
02:44:33,152 --> 02:44:33,920
At the beginning of the war

3506
02:44:34,176 --> 02:44:35,968
Has gone down at sea

3507
02:44:36,992 --> 02:44:39,040
Warship on the way to Russia

3508
02:44:39,552 --> 02:44:40,576
On some military mission

3509
02:44:41,600 --> 02:44:43,904
And the boat goes down at night

3510
02:44:44,672 --> 02:44:46,720
In a force nine Gale

3511
02:44:47,488 --> 02:44:48,512
After hitting a mine

3512
02:44:50,048 --> 02:44:50,560
And there are

3513
02:44:50,816 --> 02:44:52,096
Survivors who say take this with

3514
02:44:53,120 --> 02:44:53,888
Did they saw

3515
02:44:54,144 --> 02:44:58,240
Kitchener on the deck as the ship went down impassively sort of accepting his fate

3516
02:44:58,496 --> 02:45:00,288
And you're standing on the deck of the ship goes

3517
02:45:00,544 --> 02:45:01,568
In a beneath the waves

3518
02:45:02,336 --> 02:45:03,104
That really work

3519
02:45:04,128 --> 02:45:04,896
19th century military

3520
02:45:05,664 --> 02:45:06,432
Mutation doesn't it

3521
02:45:06,944 --> 02:45:09,760
Nonetheless there have been conspiracy theories ever since about

3522
02:45:10,784 --> 02:45:11,296
Believe it or not

3523
02:45:11,808 --> 02:45:13,600
It's one of the great conspiracy

3524
02:45:13,856 --> 02:45:19,488
The fountainheads to come out of the first world war nonetheless it meant the three weeks later when kitchener's you know

3525
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,304
Parentally preserved armies are finally

3526
02:45:22,560 --> 02:45:23,584
Thrown into The Fray

3527
02:45:23,840 --> 02:45:25,120
He's not there to have any saying

3528
02:45:26,656 --> 02:45:27,680
The guy who is

3529
02:45:27,936 --> 02:45:29,216
Is Douglas Haig the new guy

3530
02:45:30,240 --> 02:45:33,056
Now known to some in history as

3531
02:45:33,568 --> 02:45:34,080
The butcher

3532
02:45:34,848 --> 02:45:39,200
So that should give you an idea of what we're about to get into here on a wide variety

3533
02:45:39,456 --> 02:45:39,968
The fronts

3534
02:45:40,992 --> 02:45:47,136
This battle is won the Sir Douglas Haig has been preparing for since the year before

3535
02:45:48,160 --> 02:45:49,440
When the French told him

3536
02:45:49,696 --> 02:45:55,840
They were in danger of disintegrating he's moving up something he's been working on for a while now at everyone

3537
02:45:56,096 --> 02:45:56,608
Nose it

3538
02:45:58,144 --> 02:45:59,936
The big 1916 offensive

3539
02:46:00,192 --> 02:46:03,008
Is no secret haakenson newspapers basic

3540
02:46:03,519 --> 02:46:07,103
Remix that we find out all the ways that everybody knew this was coming

3541
02:46:07,615 --> 02:46:12,991
It makes you wonder right again how intelligent it is to be launching something that everybody knows it's coming but

3542
02:46:13,247 --> 02:46:15,551
It couldn't really be helped if you're going to fight

3543
02:46:16,063 --> 02:46:18,623
At this spot on the Somme River with a British

3544
02:46:18,879 --> 02:46:19,647
And the French

3545
02:46:19,903 --> 02:46:20,671
Horses meat

3546
02:46:21,183 --> 02:46:24,767
On the Western Front with with a British line ends in the French line begins

3547
02:46:25,279 --> 02:46:30,655
That's where they're going to hold this joint defensive maybe for the sole reason that that's where both armies

3548
02:46:31,679 --> 02:46:33,215
That would be a really silly reason

3549
02:46:33,727 --> 02:46:34,239
2 attack

3550
02:46:35,007 --> 02:46:40,383
The greatest defenses on the Western Front which of the greatest defenses ever in the world

3551
02:46:40,639 --> 02:46:42,943
Right now these are defenses that make the old Roman

3552
02:46:43,199 --> 02:46:44,479
Uline

3553
02:46:44,735 --> 02:46:47,807
And that you would cross Europe with these giant wall I mean

3554
02:46:48,063 --> 02:46:48,575
Minor

3555
02:46:49,599 --> 02:46:50,367
There's never been defense

3556
02:46:50,623 --> 02:46:52,159
That the Germans are at the point now

3557
02:46:52,415 --> 02:46:55,231
Where they're building Creature Comforts into their

3558
02:46:55,743 --> 02:47:01,887
Fortified line I mean they're putting wallpaper on and they've got electric lights and ventilation and then running water

3559
02:47:02,143 --> 02:47:06,239
I mean it's crazy that the trenches are in some cases all line with wood boards

3560
02:47:06,751 --> 02:47:10,079
Done with about as much Theron this is the Germans are known for

3561
02:47:10,335 --> 02:47:16,479
These are huge modern fortifications in some sense in these Germans on the other side of this line with the French and the British were thinking

3562
02:47:16,735 --> 02:47:18,783
King about launching this big 1916 offensive

3563
02:47:19,039 --> 02:47:21,855
Have bunkers that are 30 and 40 feet underground

3564
02:47:23,135 --> 02:47:25,695
Cut into the chalk of these Hills

3565
02:47:26,207 --> 02:47:27,487
Did the Germans occupy

3566
02:47:27,999 --> 02:47:29,279
They're looking down

3567
02:47:29,535 --> 02:47:30,559
4 months

3568
02:47:31,071 --> 02:47:37,215
As the British load up all the stuff you now need for a modern offense of all that stuff we said that the Germans needed at Verdun

3569
02:47:37,727 --> 02:47:40,031
The British needed the song right the French to buy the

3570
02:47:41,311 --> 02:47:43,871
David laid five railroad line

3571
02:47:44,127 --> 02:47:45,919
The new tracks to the battlefield

3572
02:47:46,431 --> 02:47:48,991
Cuz that's how often and how many trains are going to be running

3573
02:47:49,247 --> 02:47:50,783
Just unloading stuff

3574
02:47:51,039 --> 02:47:51,807
4 months

3575
02:47:53,087 --> 02:47:54,623
3 million shells

3576
02:47:54,879 --> 02:47:56,671
Millions of tons of food

3577
02:47:56,927 --> 02:48:00,255
I mean crazy my engineering course that are building thing

3578
02:48:00,511 --> 02:48:02,303
Gino full on permanent structures

3579
02:48:02,815 --> 02:48:03,327
While the germ

3580
02:48:03,839 --> 02:48:06,143
Watch the whole thing and plant board and train for

3581
02:48:06,655 --> 02:48:07,935
They're having drills everyday

3582
02:48:08,703 --> 02:48:14,335
How quickly can we get up from our underground bunker and get up to the transit man the machine guns before the British soldiers were on top of us

3583
02:48:14,591 --> 02:48:16,383
Everybody knows this is coming

3584
02:48:16,639 --> 02:48:17,663
And everybody knows how it's

3585
02:48:19,967 --> 02:48:21,247
The British take these armies with

3586
02:48:21,503 --> 02:48:24,319
Many many many green troops that have never been in a battle

3587
02:48:24,831 --> 02:48:27,903
What time in the trenches opposite these German lines

3588
02:48:28,927 --> 02:48:29,439
Again

3589
02:48:29,951 --> 02:48:30,975
A position so strong

3590
02:48:31,743 --> 02:48:33,279
Winston Churchill says

3591
02:48:33,791 --> 02:48:39,679
It was quote undoubtedly the strongest and most perfectly defended position in the world

3592
02:48:42,495 --> 02:48:43,263
And start

3593
02:48:43,519 --> 02:48:44,543
Bombarding it with art

3594
02:48:46,079 --> 02:48:47,103
Start June 20

3595
02:48:47,615 --> 02:48:48,639
1916

3596
02:48:50,431 --> 02:48:51,199
A lot of Art

3597
02:48:52,735 --> 02:48:57,087
As a matter of fact the song becomes one of about four or five First World War battle

3598
02:48:57,855 --> 02:49:00,927
They compete for like the Guinness Book of World Records

3599
02:49:01,439 --> 02:49:05,279
For the biggest largest worst more intense most numerous you know

3600
02:49:05,535 --> 02:49:07,839
Picture category artillery bombardment of the war

3601
02:49:09,631 --> 02:49:12,959
Serafino's a history geek I would be arguing it with other history

3602
02:49:13,215 --> 02:49:16,031
It's always about criteria right are we talkin about the

3603
02:49:16,287 --> 02:49:16,799
The largest number

3604
02:49:17,055 --> 02:49:17,823
Rochelle's Foxboro

3605
02:49:18,335 --> 02:49:18,847
Battle

3606
02:49:19,103 --> 02:49:20,639
4060 million at Verdun Maybe

3607
02:49:21,151 --> 02:49:24,735
Who are we talking about the most number of shells used in the initial part of the bat

3608
02:49:25,247 --> 02:49:29,855
Or the most number of she'll drop in the shortest. Of time or the smallest space I mean

3609
02:49:30,111 --> 02:49:35,999
There's literally a measurement of how many tons of shells fell on each square meter of these battle

3610
02:49:36,255 --> 02:49:37,535
By the way if you use that

3611
02:49:37,791 --> 02:49:38,559
As You Are

3612
02:49:40,863 --> 02:49:41,375
Perdon

3613
02:49:45,215 --> 02:49:46,239
Nonetheless the fact that

3614
02:49:46,495 --> 02:49:48,031
The song is in this argument

3615
02:49:48,543 --> 02:49:50,591
Show you the level of artillery were talking about here

3616
02:49:51,103 --> 02:49:52,895
And when it opens up on the 24th

3617
02:49:53,919 --> 02:49:55,199
It's it's incredible

3618
02:49:55,455 --> 02:49:57,247
When it's volume but the Germans laugh a lot

3619
02:49:58,783 --> 02:50:00,319
Compartment

3620
02:50:01,087 --> 02:50:03,647
But the Germans are mostly underground Undercover

3621
02:50:03,903 --> 02:50:06,463
And most of them are bent is once again

3622
02:50:06,719 --> 02:50:07,487
Shrapnel shell

3623
02:50:07,999 --> 02:50:11,583
Sounds like a little teeny point doesn't it for about a battle to turn on

3624
02:50:12,095 --> 02:50:15,935
But had those shells been high explosive instead or maybe even gas

3625
02:50:16,447 --> 02:50:20,031
This battle may go another Direction and every story and brings up

3626
02:50:20,287 --> 02:50:21,055
Shrapnel

3627
02:50:21,311 --> 02:50:22,079
Pretty much pointless

3628
02:50:23,871 --> 02:50:27,967
It's remember it's like a giant hand grenade or shotgun shell exploding in the air and all these little pellets

3629
02:50:28,223 --> 02:50:31,807
It's a ground devastating to infantry out in the open but the Germans are in the open

3630
02:50:33,343 --> 02:50:34,111
In addition

3631
02:50:34,367 --> 02:50:36,927
The artillery is meant to do more than just kill German

3632
02:50:37,695 --> 02:50:39,231
The artillery has to clear

3633
02:50:39,743 --> 02:50:40,511
The battlefield

3634
02:50:40,767 --> 02:50:41,791
All the stuff that

3635
02:50:42,047 --> 02:50:43,071
There is defenses

3636
02:50:43,327 --> 02:50:46,655
So let the troops on the British I can actually get to the German Trench

3637
02:50:47,423 --> 02:50:48,703
It's full of barbed wire

3638
02:50:49,215 --> 02:50:50,495
No man's land

3639
02:50:50,751 --> 02:50:51,519
Another train

3640
02:50:52,031 --> 02:50:54,079
Another no man's land in another Trench

3641
02:50:54,335 --> 02:51:00,479
The Trenches are all going uphill and these no man's land areas besides being filled with concrete bunkers and

3642
02:51:00,735 --> 02:51:01,247
Everything you told me about

3643
02:51:01,503 --> 02:51:02,783
Before The Killing Zone

3644
02:51:03,039 --> 02:51:05,343
They have yards barbed wire

3645
02:51:05,599 --> 02:51:06,367
Sticking your finger

3646
02:51:07,903 --> 02:51:09,183
Metaphysical empath

3647
02:51:09,951 --> 02:51:11,487
It has to be overcome by The General

3648
02:51:11,743 --> 02:51:15,327
The generals have figured out in their minds that an artillery barrage of this

3649
02:51:15,839 --> 02:51:20,447
You know caliber the amounts were talking about here in barbed wire will just explode into

3650
02:51:20,959 --> 02:51:23,775
It will not be an impediment when the artillery barrage is over

3651
02:51:24,287 --> 02:51:25,823
Except the shrapnel shell dontrel

3652
02:51:29,151 --> 02:51:30,431
There was a benefit

3653
02:51:30,687 --> 02:51:31,199
Artillery

3654
02:51:32,735 --> 02:51:34,015
Recorded before Napoleon has the

3655
02:51:34,271 --> 02:51:34,783
The great lion

3656
02:51:35,039 --> 02:51:35,807
Comes in handy all the time

3657
02:51:36,575 --> 02:51:38,623
Quantity has a quality all its own

3658
02:51:38,879 --> 02:51:41,439
And the sheer intensity this barrage

3659
02:51:41,695 --> 02:51:45,279
Life began to have an effect on the Germans even though they were physically protected from being

3660
02:51:45,535 --> 02:51:46,303
Do injured

3661
02:51:47,327 --> 02:51:48,607
I began to play on them

3662
02:51:48,863 --> 02:51:49,375
First of all

3663
02:51:49,887 --> 02:51:52,703
They know they got something really nasty awaiting them

3664
02:51:52,959 --> 02:51:53,471
In their future

3665
02:51:53,727 --> 02:51:55,263
You try to put yourself in their shoes

3666
02:51:55,775 --> 02:51:56,287
Okay

3667
02:51:56,543 --> 02:51:59,103
They know that when this artillery barrage is over

3668
02:51:59,359 --> 02:52:05,503
The British are going to be on them they've been training for this moment for months right run up the stairs how quickly can you get

3669
02:52:05,759 --> 02:52:06,527
Find the machine gun

3670
02:52:06,783 --> 02:52:08,831
In time to stop the British from taking over your Trench

3671
02:52:09,343 --> 02:52:10,367
So they're going to either

3672
02:52:10,623 --> 02:52:11,391
Be killed

3673
02:52:11,647 --> 02:52:12,927
Be grievously wounded

3674
02:52:13,183 --> 02:52:15,231
See your friend killed or wounded or happy

3675
02:52:15,487 --> 02:52:19,071
The kill someone and they're going to have a really nasty day and they're very near future

3676
02:52:19,583 --> 02:52:20,607
In the meantime

3677
02:52:20,863 --> 02:52:24,191
You going to have one of the greatest artillery barrage in history going on

3678
02:52:24,447 --> 02:52:25,215
Around you

3679
02:52:25,471 --> 02:52:26,495
Ernst Junger

3680
02:52:26,751 --> 02:52:32,127
Who will be at this battlefield in about a month and can artillery barrage that is not as bad as this one

3681
02:52:32,639 --> 02:52:34,943
He will compare it to the Roar of the ocean

3682
02:52:36,223 --> 02:52:38,783
He will say that there are no individual sound

3683
02:52:39,295 --> 02:52:43,903
He says he will it will achieve at times and last 4 hours A demented intense

3684
02:52:44,927 --> 02:52:47,231
And he says when it eventually calmed down

3685
02:52:47,743 --> 02:52:50,047
Calm down to Mere drumfire

3686
02:52:51,071 --> 02:52:52,351
Which is you know the sound of

3687
02:52:52,607 --> 02:52:53,375
Of a drum roll

3688
02:52:53,631 --> 02:52:57,215
What's how fast your children shelter dropping he says even when it's the drumroll you can't

3689
02:52:57,471 --> 02:52:59,263
Pick out any individual explosion

3690
02:52:59,519 --> 02:53:00,799
It's just one big loud sound

3691
02:53:01,055 --> 02:53:03,615
But the demented Fury did it reaches sometimes

3692
02:53:03,871 --> 02:53:05,151
Blows that away litter

3693
02:53:05,407 --> 02:53:06,175
Early and that's

3694
02:53:06,431 --> 02:53:11,807
The kind of intensity these soldiers are living with knowing that they've got this horrible moment in their future

3695
02:53:12,319 --> 02:53:13,343
And it goes on for days

3696
02:53:13,855 --> 02:53:14,623
We're told that

3697
02:53:15,135 --> 02:53:16,671
The German soldiers who were kind of laugh

3698
02:53:17,439 --> 02:53:20,767
At the fact that the British were using like 70% shrapnel shells on them

3699
02:53:21,279 --> 02:53:22,047
Aren't laughing at

3700
02:53:23,839 --> 02:53:24,607
They're getting tired

3701
02:53:24,863 --> 02:53:25,631
Prince trasimeno

3702
02:53:25,887 --> 02:53:26,399
Put yourself in

3703
02:53:26,911 --> 02:53:28,447
The position just not sleeping for 5 days

3704
02:53:29,215 --> 02:53:29,727
And now

3705
02:53:30,239 --> 02:53:30,751
You know ad

3706
02:53:31,007 --> 02:53:31,519
All the other thing

3707
02:53:32,031 --> 02:53:32,543
On top of that

3708
02:53:33,311 --> 02:53:36,383
So there is an effect that distorts Hillary's having in the Germans all right about

3709
02:53:37,151 --> 02:53:38,431
The British

3710
02:53:38,687 --> 02:53:40,479
Commander this part of the controversy

3711
02:53:40,735 --> 02:53:45,855
We're told that there were lots of people saying that this artillery barrage was going to make this a cake

3712
02:53:46,367 --> 02:53:47,903
And you've heard that before right

3713
02:53:48,671 --> 02:53:52,511
Don't all these battles begin to sound like isn't there repetitiveness to the story

3714
02:53:53,279 --> 02:53:54,047
If there is

3715
02:53:54,559 --> 02:53:55,839
You're getting the right feeling on

3716
02:53:56,351 --> 02:53:57,375
Because that's how

3717
02:53:57,887 --> 02:54:04,031
It's always been played and it seems like the people at the time fell to oh no not again haven't we seen this movie

3718
02:54:04,287 --> 02:54:06,079
Before the general seem to always

3719
02:54:06,335 --> 02:54:06,847
Just want more

3720
02:54:07,103 --> 02:54:09,919
Give us more artillery give us more men give us deeper defense

3721
02:54:10,175 --> 02:54:11,455
It will fix the situation

3722
02:54:11,967 --> 02:54:14,527
So here's the biggest artillery barrage the British have ever launched

3723
02:54:15,295 --> 02:54:16,831
They shoot off 2 million shells in node

3724
02:54:18,111 --> 02:54:19,391
Different comparison purposes

3725
02:54:19,647 --> 02:54:20,159
A hundred years

3726
02:54:20,927 --> 02:54:21,951
Battle of Waterloo

3727
02:54:22,207 --> 02:54:24,511
Napoleon is estimated to had about 20000

3728
02:54:24,767 --> 02:54:25,279
Cannonballs

3729
02:54:25,535 --> 02:54:26,303
With the French army

3730
02:54:26,815 --> 02:54:30,399
So you're two million shells in a week or two thousand

3731
02:54:31,423 --> 02:54:33,471
Crazy the level of artillery we're going to see here

3732
02:54:33,983 --> 02:54:39,615
A little bit Lowe's good commanders into this sense that it's going to accomplish so much more than it does

3733
02:54:40,895 --> 02:54:42,431
It's the soldiers on the ground though

3734
02:54:42,943 --> 02:54:43,455
That produce

3735
02:54:43,711 --> 02:54:45,759
The historical reminders

3736
02:54:46,271 --> 02:54:51,135
The most of them were too realistic and to Savion too cynical to buy into any of that Rosie

3737
02:54:51,647 --> 02:54:52,927
The generals could afford to be Rosie

3738
02:54:53,439 --> 02:54:57,023
The guys on the ground going in for example the first wave

3739
02:54:57,535 --> 02:55:01,631
Of this assault that the Germans have been waiting for you for months they know better

3740
02:55:02,399 --> 02:55:04,959
And you can tell because there are absolutely

3741
02:55:05,471 --> 02:55:06,239
Heartbreaking

3742
02:55:06,751 --> 02:55:08,031
Last letters home

3743
02:55:08,543 --> 02:55:09,823
Animated into the history

3744
02:55:10,079 --> 02:55:11,103
Peter Hart wonderful

3745
02:55:13,151 --> 02:55:14,175
Has one of these letters

3746
02:55:14,687 --> 02:55:16,479
From a captain Charles May

3747
02:55:16,735 --> 02:55:18,271
Who fights in the 22nd Manchester

3748
02:55:19,295 --> 02:55:20,575
He's writing to his wife

3749
02:55:21,087 --> 02:55:23,903
Right before he goes over the top in this battle

3750
02:55:24,671 --> 02:55:25,695
Nnn

3751
02:55:25,951 --> 02:55:27,487
Again imagine

3752
02:55:27,743 --> 02:55:28,255
Imagine

3753
02:55:28,511 --> 02:55:29,023
How would it be

3754
02:55:29,279 --> 02:55:29,791
That's you

3755
02:55:30,303 --> 02:55:32,607
To be in the position of writing a letter

3756
02:55:34,143 --> 02:55:36,703
That's a permanent scar on your soul even if you get

3757
02:55:36,959 --> 02:55:39,263
The proverbial reprieve from the governor

3758
02:55:39,519 --> 02:55:40,031
Right

3759
02:55:40,287 --> 02:55:41,567
Captain Charles May

3760
02:55:41,823 --> 02:55:43,615
22nd Manchester regiment

3761
02:55:44,127 --> 02:55:46,943
Who's about to go over the top on the first day of the song

3762
02:55:47,455 --> 02:55:48,223
And writes his wife

3763
02:55:48,479 --> 02:55:48,991
Quote

3764
02:55:50,015 --> 02:55:52,575
I must not allow myself to dwell on the personal

3765
02:55:53,087 --> 02:55:53,855
There's no room for it

3766
02:55:54,623 --> 02:55:56,415
Also it is demoralizing

3767
02:55:57,183 --> 02:55:57,951
But I do not want

3768
02:55:58,975 --> 02:56:00,511
Not that I mind for myself

3769
02:56:00,767 --> 02:56:02,559
If it be that I am to go I'm ready

3770
02:56:03,071 --> 02:56:04,863
But the thought that I may never see you

3771
02:56:05,119 --> 02:56:06,655
Or our darling baby again

3772
02:56:07,167 --> 02:56:08,703
Turns my bowels to water

3773
02:56:08,959 --> 02:56:11,775
I cannot think of it would even the semblance of equanimity

3774
02:56:12,287 --> 02:56:14,847
My one consolation is a happiness it's been hours

3775
02:56:15,359 --> 02:56:15,871
Also

3776
02:56:16,127 --> 02:56:19,455
My conscience is clear that I've always tried to make life a joy to you

3777
02:56:19,967 --> 02:56:20,735
I know at least

3778
02:56:21,247 --> 02:56:23,295
But if I go you will not want

3779
02:56:23,551 --> 02:56:24,063
That is something

3780
02:56:24,831 --> 02:56:28,415
What it is the thought that we may be cut off from one another which is so terrible

3781
02:56:28,671 --> 02:56:32,255
And there are babe May grow up without my knowing her

3782
02:56:32,511 --> 02:56:33,791
And without her knowing me

3783
02:56:34,303 --> 02:56:35,327
It's difficult to face

3784
02:56:35,839 --> 02:56:38,399
And I know your life without me would be a dull black

3785
02:56:38,911 --> 02:56:40,959
Get you must never let it become holy so

3786
02:56:41,471 --> 02:56:44,287
Pretty you will be left the greatest charge in all the world

3787
02:56:44,543 --> 02:56:45,823
The upbringing of our baby

3788
02:56:46,335 --> 02:56:48,639
God bless that child she's the hope of life to me

3789
02:56:49,151 --> 02:56:50,687
My darling au revoir

3790
02:56:50,943 --> 02:56:53,503
It may be that you will only have to read these lines

3791
02:56:53,759 --> 02:56:55,295
As ones of passing interest

3792
02:56:55,807 --> 02:56:56,575
On the other hand

3793
02:56:56,831 --> 02:56:58,623
They may well be my last message

3794
02:56:58,879 --> 02:56:59,391
To you

3795
02:56:59,647 --> 02:57:00,415
If they are

3796
02:57:00,671 --> 02:57:04,511
Notes for all your life that I loved you and baby with all my heart and soul

3797
02:57:04,767 --> 02:57:06,559
At U2 sweet things

3798
02:57:06,815 --> 02:57:08,095
We're just all the world to me

3799
02:57:08,607 --> 02:57:10,399
I pray God I made you my duty

3800
02:57:10,655 --> 02:57:12,959
For I know that whatever that may entail

3801
02:57:13,215 --> 02:57:14,239
You would not have it otherwise

3802
02:57:18,335 --> 02:57:18,847
Peter Hart

3803
02:57:19,103 --> 02:57:19,615
Remarkable

3804
02:57:20,127 --> 02:57:20,639
Sensitivity

3805
02:57:21,151 --> 02:57:21,919
Add the post

02:57:30,879 --> 02:57:33,439
He's buried in the dantzig alley british cemetery

3810
02:57:34,207 --> 02:57:37,023
Small-scale tragedies litter the history of War

3811
02:57:37,279 --> 02:57:41,119
Sad reminders that the necessities of War ruin the lives of Millions

3812
02:57:42,143 --> 02:57:42,655
And quote

3813
02:57:44,959 --> 02:57:45,471
She said

3814
02:57:45,983 --> 02:57:47,775
All this pain from this war

3815
02:57:48,031 --> 02:57:51,103
Are like pebbles dropped in water and the ripples outward

3816
02:57:51,359 --> 02:57:53,663
Affect the rest of these societies me Millions

3817
02:57:53,919 --> 02:57:54,943
The people impacted like this

3818
02:57:55,455 --> 02:57:56,735
The ripple effect affect

3819
02:57:56,991 --> 02:58:00,063
Ends or maybe even hundreds of millions of

3820
02:58:02,367 --> 02:58:03,135
For a while

3821
02:58:03,647 --> 02:58:04,927
The song becomes one of these

3822
02:58:05,183 --> 02:58:05,695
Pebbles

3823
02:58:05,951 --> 02:58:07,999
It's like Ground Zero for a huge

3824
02:58:08,255 --> 02:58:08,767
Ripple of

3825
02:58:09,535 --> 02:58:10,047
The Willows

3826
02:58:10,559 --> 02:58:11,071
Britain

3827
02:58:11,583 --> 02:58:12,607
To this day

3828
02:58:14,143 --> 02:58:16,959
I try to think about what mental state I would be in

3829
02:58:17,727 --> 02:58:18,495
After writing a

3830
02:58:20,799 --> 02:58:23,103
And when you think about millions of people

3831
02:58:23,615 --> 02:58:24,127
Young p

3832
02:58:24,383 --> 02:58:24,895
People mostly

3833
02:58:25,407 --> 02:58:26,431
Being in situation

3834
02:58:26,943 --> 02:58:27,711
Weather writing Al

3835
02:58:29,503 --> 02:58:30,527
How does that change you

3836
02:58:32,063 --> 02:58:34,367
When they are going to be noticeable

3837
02:58:34,879 --> 02:58:35,391
Changes

3838
02:58:35,647 --> 02:58:36,927
In this generation

3839
02:58:37,695 --> 02:58:42,303
In the four years during the special where I've been comparing this. To historical sgo

3840
02:58:42,815 --> 02:58:43,327
Right where

3841
02:58:43,583 --> 02:58:46,399
One generation and another Generations would have mingled

3842
02:58:46,655 --> 02:58:48,191
The old world and the new world

3843
02:58:49,727 --> 02:58:51,007
But maybe it's more of a wormhole

3844
02:58:51,263 --> 02:58:52,031
All Through Time

3845
02:58:52,543 --> 02:58:54,847
And when this nineteenth-century group of people

3846
02:58:55,359 --> 02:58:57,663
No transitions through the 20th century

3847
02:58:57,919 --> 02:59:00,479
It's not going to make it intact it's going to suffer

3848
02:59:00,735 --> 02:59:04,319
Damage on the way through it's like a birthing process to the modern era

3849
02:59:04,575 --> 02:59:07,391
And that can be bloody and painful and potentially fatal to

3850
02:59:09,951 --> 02:59:10,463
The British

3851
02:59:10,719 --> 02:59:11,231
Thought

3852
02:59:11,743 --> 02:59:12,255
Throughout this war

3853
02:59:13,023 --> 02:59:14,303
That they taken large casual

3854
02:59:15,071 --> 02:59:17,375
The Battle of 1915 places like Gallipoli

3855
02:59:17,631 --> 02:59:18,655
Those are large casual

3856
02:59:19,167 --> 02:59:21,727
The British which are a traditionally Naval power

3857
02:59:21,983 --> 02:59:24,287
An employee relatively by Continental standard

3858
02:59:24,543 --> 02:59:25,311
Small armies

3859
02:59:26,335 --> 02:59:27,359
This is the first time that

3860
02:59:27,615 --> 02:59:28,127
Had a large

3861
02:59:29,407 --> 02:59:31,711
To suffer the kind of casualties that some

3862
02:59:31,967 --> 02:59:32,735
Nations like the

3863
02:59:32,991 --> 02:59:35,295
The French or the Germans or the Russians have been suffering this whole time

3864
02:59:36,319 --> 02:59:37,599
On July 1st

3865
02:59:38,111 --> 02:59:39,135
1916

3866
02:59:39,903 --> 02:59:41,183
The shelling subsides

3867
02:59:41,695 --> 02:59:42,719
The whistles blow

3868
02:59:43,231 --> 02:59:46,559
And these troops in the morning or told to get out of their trenches

3869
02:59:46,815 --> 02:59:48,863
I had a cross into no man's land

3870
02:59:49,631 --> 02:59:50,399
And continued

3871
02:59:50,655 --> 02:59:51,935
To take the German defense

3872
02:59:53,983 --> 02:59:55,007
This is where they find out

3873
02:59:56,031 --> 02:59:59,871
That the assumptions made in the planning stages of this conflict

3874
03:00:00,383 --> 03:00:02,687
Haven't come to pass the way the military

3875
03:00:02,943 --> 03:00:03,967
Sports assumed they would

3876
03:00:05,503 --> 03:00:06,527
And because of that

3877
03:00:07,295 --> 03:00:08,575
British forces

3878
03:00:08,831 --> 03:00:10,111
On the very first day

3879
03:00:10,623 --> 03:00:11,903
Of the battle of the Somme

3880
03:00:13,183 --> 03:00:13,695
Supper six

3881
03:00:13,951 --> 03:00:14,463
3000 cash

3882
03:00:16,255 --> 03:00:16,767
20000

3883
03:00:18,303 --> 03:00:19,327
There's never been a day like

3884
03:00:19,839 --> 03:00:20,607
In British history

3885
03:00:20,863 --> 03:00:21,887
And now all of a sudden

3886
03:00:22,143 --> 03:00:23,935
They can understand how the French belt

3887
03:00:24,447 --> 03:00:29,823
On that August day in 1914 when they suffered 22,000 dead in an afternoon

3888
03:00:30,847 --> 03:00:32,895
These are Thoroughly Modern casualties in

3889
03:00:33,151 --> 03:00:35,199
Two people not accustomed to them they are stunning

3890
03:00:36,479 --> 03:00:38,015
On the finger start pointing media

3891
03:00:39,039 --> 03:00:39,807
What the heck happened

3892
03:00:41,599 --> 03:00:42,623
Generation of people who

3893
03:00:42,879 --> 03:00:43,903
Felt this viscerally

3894
03:00:44,159 --> 03:00:48,511
Have kept this debate going and it continues between historians even today

3895
03:00:49,791 --> 03:00:50,303
What the hell

3896
03:00:51,583 --> 03:00:52,351
Who's responsible

3897
03:00:53,887 --> 03:00:58,239
What happened to the Troops will they got out of the trenches only to find that in most areas

3898
03:00:58,751 --> 03:01:02,079
The assumption that this artillery would Smash Up The Wire

3899
03:01:02,591 --> 03:01:04,383
Wasn't true when the wire was there

3900
03:01:05,407 --> 03:01:06,687
It was a physical in Panama

3901
03:01:07,199 --> 03:01:11,551
In no-man's-land trapping troops in the open so they could be raped

3902
03:01:11,807 --> 03:01:15,391
By Machine Gun fire archery fire too but mainly machine-gun fire

3903
03:01:15,647 --> 03:01:19,743
From those Germans who were not as badly affected by the artillery either

3904
03:01:19,999 --> 03:01:21,791
As the planners had assumed they would be

3905
03:01:23,839 --> 03:01:26,399
Tens of thousands of British soldiers are being mowed down

3906
03:01:26,655 --> 03:01:27,935
All the time one German

3907
03:01:28,191 --> 03:01:29,471
On the other side

3908
03:01:29,727 --> 03:01:30,751
Of this human trash

3909
03:01:31,519 --> 03:01:32,543
I love the song on the first date

3910
03:01:32,799 --> 03:01:35,615
Is quoted Indian passing his book all the Kaiser's men

3911
03:01:36,127 --> 03:01:37,151
And he said quote

3912
03:01:37,663 --> 03:01:38,943
Deleting wave

3913
03:01:39,199 --> 03:01:39,711
A British troops

3914
03:01:39,967 --> 03:01:42,271
Was now halfway across no-man's-land

3915
03:01:42,783 --> 03:01:45,087
Get ready was passed along our front

3916
03:01:45,343 --> 03:01:50,207
And heads appeared over each shell crater edge of final positions were taken up with the best view

3917
03:01:50,463 --> 03:01:52,511
And machine guns mounted firmly in place

3918
03:01:53,023 --> 03:01:56,095
A moment later when the first British line was within a hundred yards

3919
03:01:56,351 --> 03:02:00,703
The rattle of Machine Gun and Rifle fire broke out along our whole line of shell hole

3920
03:02:01,215 --> 03:02:03,775
Followed soon after by deadly accurate shellfire

3921
03:02:04,543 --> 03:02:07,871
The advanced rapidly crumpled under this Halo shells and bullets

3922
03:02:08,383 --> 03:02:13,503
All along the line meant to be singing throwing up their arms and collapsing never to move again

3923
03:02:14,015 --> 03:02:16,831
The extended line the badly shaken with many gaps

3924
03:02:17,087 --> 03:02:18,879
Now came on all the faster

3925
03:02:19,391 --> 03:02:25,535
Instead of a leisurely walk they covered the ground in short rushes at the Double and within a few minutes the leading troops at Advance

3926
03:02:26,047 --> 03:02:28,607
Two within a stone's throw of our front Trench

3927
03:02:28,863 --> 03:02:34,751
Again and again the extended lines of British infantry broke against the German defense like waves against the cliff

3928
03:02:35,007 --> 03:02:36,287
Only to be beaten back

3929
03:02:36,799 --> 03:02:42,431
It was an amazing spectacle of unexampled gallantry courage and Bulldog determination on both sides

3930
03:02:43,967 --> 03:02:44,479
And quote

3931
03:02:45,503 --> 03:02:47,551
Now those are the troops who made it through the wire

3932
03:02:48,319 --> 03:02:51,647
There were places where gaps have been blown in The Wire

3933
03:02:51,903 --> 03:02:56,511
The problem was that the troops would congregate at those gaps cuz they're the only way to the other side

3934
03:02:56,767 --> 03:03:02,143
And then get stuck in giant backup this as a small stream of troops made it through the corridor

3935
03:03:02,399 --> 03:03:08,543
And those those backups in those Globs of soldiers just waiting for their chance to get through the corridor the wire would be mowed down

3936
03:03:08,799 --> 03:03:10,079
I shall fire and machine gun

3937
03:03:11,359 --> 03:03:12,383
This day

3938
03:03:12,895 --> 03:03:17,759
Has so affected the British in fact it's their version of Verdun what would Verdun is to the French sole

3939
03:03:18,015 --> 03:03:19,551
The song is to the British one

3940
03:03:19,807 --> 03:03:22,111
And it has divided historians ever since

3941
03:03:22,367 --> 03:03:24,927
And you can see normally calm and sedate

3942
03:03:25,183 --> 03:03:29,791
Rather cold sometimes British historians lose their head over this subject

3943
03:03:30,303 --> 03:03:33,631
John Keegan who I've said is not my favorite

3944
03:03:33,887 --> 03:03:37,215
But the two World Wars I think are his strong point

3945
03:03:37,471 --> 03:03:40,031
And you can tell he's a guy who's hung out

3946
03:03:40,287 --> 03:03:41,823
With some of the enlisted troops

3947
03:03:42,079 --> 03:03:44,127
That were trapped that day at the song because

3948
03:03:44,383 --> 03:03:45,151
There

3949
03:03:45,663 --> 03:03:47,455
Continued anger and

3950
03:03:47,967 --> 03:03:51,551
Incredulously about this whole thing has rubbed off on him and by the way

3951
03:03:51,807 --> 03:03:54,111
If you were trapped there like a Sitting Duck

3952
03:03:54,367 --> 03:03:54,879
On

3953
03:03:55,135 --> 03:03:58,719
You don't open playing in No Man's Land watching your body's get blown to bits

3954
03:03:58,975 --> 03:04:01,791
And you're freaking out you would be thinking to who the hell put me here

3955
03:04:02,047 --> 03:04:05,119
Who's responsible for this if I ever get out of this Heads Will Roll

3956
03:04:05,631 --> 03:04:06,655
Of course most of these

3957
03:04:07,167 --> 03:04:09,215
British troops at this battle or not of a

3958
03:04:09,471 --> 03:04:10,751
The class in British Society

3959
03:04:11,263 --> 03:04:12,031
Made much of a

3960
03:04:12,287 --> 03:04:13,055
Fast but they've got

3961
03:04:13,311 --> 03:04:14,335
Loyal Defenders

3962
03:04:14,847 --> 03:04:16,127
The will when this is over

3963
03:04:16,383 --> 03:04:17,919
Keegan's one of them by the way

3964
03:04:18,687 --> 03:04:19,711
You can you can just

3965
03:04:19,967 --> 03:04:20,991
Feel the anger

3966
03:04:21,503 --> 03:04:22,527
When he writes quote

3967
03:04:24,063 --> 03:04:26,623
In all the British had lost about 60000

3968
03:04:26,879 --> 03:04:28,927
IHome 21000 have been killed

3969
03:04:29,183 --> 03:04:32,511
Most in the first hour of the attack perhaps the first minutes

3970
03:04:33,023 --> 03:04:37,887
The Trenches wrote Robert key 50 years later now he's quoting Robert key quote

3971
03:04:38,143 --> 03:04:41,215
Where the concentration camps of the first World War

3972
03:04:41,983 --> 03:04:42,751
Kyle Keegan talks again

3973
03:04:43,263 --> 03:04:47,615
And though the analogy is what an academic reviewer would call unhistorical

3974
03:04:47,871 --> 03:04:49,919
There is something Treblinka like

3975
03:04:50,431 --> 03:04:52,735
About almost all accounts of the 1st of July

3976
03:04:52,991 --> 03:04:56,063
How about these long docile lines of young men

3977
03:04:56,319 --> 03:04:57,599
Shoddily uniformed

3978
03:04:57,855 --> 03:04:58,879
Heavily burdened

3979
03:04:59,135 --> 03:05:00,415
Numbered about their necks

3980
03:05:00,671 --> 03:05:01,439
To identify

3981
03:05:01,695 --> 03:05:02,463
After they were killed

3982
03:05:02,719 --> 03:05:08,607
Plotting forward across a featureless landscape to their own extermination inside the barbed wire

3983
03:05:09,119 --> 03:05:10,911
Accounts of the song he writes

3984
03:05:11,167 --> 03:05:14,495
Producing readers and audiences much the same range of emotions

3985
03:05:14,751 --> 03:05:17,055
As do descriptions of the running of Auschwitz

3986
03:05:17,567 --> 03:05:21,663
Guilty Fascination incredulity horror disgust

3987
03:05:21,919 --> 03:05:22,943
Pity and anger

3988
03:05:23,711 --> 03:05:24,223
And quote

3989
03:05:24,735 --> 03:05:25,247
Amigos

3990
03:05:25,503 --> 03:05:27,551
I want to say that this is not just from

3991
03:05:27,807 --> 03:05:28,319
The

3992
03:05:28,575 --> 03:05:29,087
Peaceniks

3993
03:05:30,111 --> 03:05:31,391
Tenderhearted out there

3994
03:05:32,159 --> 03:05:37,279
Not just from the military historians will you get it from either but he was but from the professional troops to

3995
03:05:39,071 --> 03:05:39,839
He says quote

3996
03:05:40,095 --> 03:05:45,727
Anger is the response which the story of the song most commonly evokes among professionals meeting soldiers

3997
03:05:46,239 --> 03:05:48,287
Why did the commanders not do something about it

3998
03:05:48,543 --> 03:05:50,335
Why do they let the attack go on

3999
03:05:50,591 --> 03:05:55,199
Why do they not stop one battalion following the wake of another to join it in Death

4000
03:05:55,711 --> 03:05:56,223
And quote

4001
03:05:57,759 --> 03:05:59,807
Getting goes on to say that some Italians were stop

4002
03:06:00,319 --> 03:06:02,879
But that's one of the things that so many people got angry about is that

4003
03:06:03,135 --> 03:06:04,671
Once you saw for example

4004
03:06:04,927 --> 03:06:06,975
That the wire was still there

4005
03:06:07,231 --> 03:06:13,375
Why did you let more lines of troops get up out of the trenches and follow the people who just got destroyed in from

4006
03:06:15,935 --> 03:06:17,727
This is how someone like Hague

4007
03:06:18,495 --> 03:06:20,031
Gets a reputation

4008
03:06:20,543 --> 03:06:21,055
Butcher

4009
03:06:23,103 --> 03:06:24,383
Not going out of my way in this

4010
03:06:26,431 --> 03:06:29,759
21915 copies General Slack

4011
03:06:30,527 --> 03:06:33,087
Because they're learning right this is all new stuffing

4012
03:06:33,343 --> 03:06:35,135
Until you experiment Louis don't know how to use

4013
03:06:35,647 --> 03:06:36,159
You don't know

4014
03:06:36,671 --> 03:06:37,695
And what it can do

4015
03:06:39,231 --> 03:06:42,047
When can you start holding these people accountable

4016
03:06:42,303 --> 03:06:43,583
Or not learning

4017
03:06:45,631 --> 03:06:47,679
It was a great line from

4018
03:06:48,191 --> 03:06:49,215
The civilian

4019
03:06:49,471 --> 03:06:50,751
Political leader Germany

4020
03:06:52,287 --> 03:06:53,567
A guy named bethmann-hollweg

4021
03:06:54,335 --> 03:06:57,919
He was telling the Kaiser by the end of 1916 he's talking about Falken I

4022
03:06:58,175 --> 03:06:58,687
Are the German millet

4023
03:06:59,711 --> 03:07:01,759
But it could equally apply to a lot of

4024
03:07:02,015 --> 03:07:02,783
Military leaders

4025
03:07:03,551 --> 03:07:05,087
In this war especially at the

4026
03:07:05,343 --> 03:07:05,855
This time

4027
03:07:06,111 --> 03:07:07,135
Do you have to Kaiser quote

4028
03:07:08,159 --> 03:07:09,951
Where does incompetency end

4029
03:07:10,463 --> 03:07:11,999
And criminality begin

4030
03:07:13,535 --> 03:07:14,047
And quote

4031
03:07:14,815 --> 03:07:18,655
How many lies are you allowed to lose experimenting before you learn your lesson

4032
03:07:19,167 --> 03:07:21,983
But there are a great many military historians today

4033
03:07:22,239 --> 03:07:25,055
Who are trying once again if they listen that's what they're doing

4034
03:07:25,311 --> 03:07:28,639
We're still holding them to too high a standard too much

4035
03:07:28,895 --> 03:07:30,175
Hindsight going on here

4036
03:07:30,431 --> 03:07:31,455
Edward Peter heart rate

4037
03:07:31,711 --> 03:07:32,223
Lights quote

4038
03:07:32,991 --> 03:07:33,759
For many people

4039
03:07:34,015 --> 03:07:38,367
The song in the equally ugly Verdun have come to symbolize the Great War

4040
03:07:38,879 --> 03:07:43,487
Futile battles fought with other people's lives by incompetent and uncaring Generals

4041
03:07:43,999 --> 03:07:45,791
In particular for the British she says

4042
03:07:46,047 --> 03:07:52,191
The disaster of the 1st of July on the song has become the sole prism through which the conduct of the whole of the Great

4043
03:07:53,471 --> 03:07:55,519
There is no light and shade here

4044
03:07:55,775 --> 03:07:59,615
Just a dark despair the numbing horror of the teeming casual

4045
03:08:00,383 --> 03:08:04,223
Explanations of what went wrong and why are thrust aside indeed

4046
03:08:04,479 --> 03:08:05,247
In the past

4047
03:08:05,503 --> 03:08:11,647
Subdued references to a quote and quote learning curve for the generals have been seen as an insult

4048
03:08:11,903 --> 03:08:12,415
How to the Dead

4049
03:08:12,671 --> 03:08:16,511
There remains a widespread belief he write that there must have been a better way

4050
03:08:17,023 --> 03:08:20,351
Something else could or should have been done someone must be blamed

4051
03:08:20,863 --> 03:08:23,935
Much of this appropriate has fallen on the head of Douglas Haig

4052
03:08:24,191 --> 03:08:27,007
Who has a Time been revealed as a mass murderer

4053
03:08:27,519 --> 03:08:32,383
Yet this was inevitable price of engaging in Continental Warfare on the main field of battle

4054
03:08:32,639 --> 03:08:34,175
Against the primary enemy

4055
03:08:34,431 --> 03:08:37,503
France was well accustomed to the pain of Continental Warfare

4056
03:08:37,759 --> 03:08:39,295
It was a new experience

4057
03:08:39,807 --> 03:08:41,599
Germany had no exposed flanks

4058
03:08:41,855 --> 03:08:47,999
Just the imposing fortifications of the Western Front defending their 1914 games rested from free

4059
03:08:48,255 --> 03:08:48,767
France and Belgium

4060
03:08:49,279 --> 03:08:52,863
Unfortunately for all their tactical Improvement and Technical Innovations

4061
03:08:53,119 --> 03:08:56,191
The British were just simply not able to breach those defenses

4062
03:08:56,447 --> 03:08:57,983
Or kill sufficient German

4063
03:08:58,495 --> 03:09:00,031
Even in concert with the French

4064
03:09:00,287 --> 03:09:01,055
Ever done

4065
03:09:01,311 --> 03:09:02,847
To bring Germany to its knees

4066
03:09:03,615 --> 03:09:04,127
And quote

4067
03:09:05,919 --> 03:09:07,199
It also makes you wonder

4068
03:09:07,455 --> 03:09:10,015
A little about the quality of the human being

4069
03:09:10,527 --> 03:09:15,647
Who are commanding these Endeavors were making these plans and who are watching

4070
03:09:15,903 --> 03:09:17,183
All these people

4071
03:09:17,439 --> 03:09:19,999
Die and be wounded because of these

4072
03:09:20,511 --> 03:09:23,583
How bad does the general feel the next day

4073
03:09:24,351 --> 03:09:29,983
Well it's not something you can easily figure out again John Keegan seems to be so angry

4074
03:09:30,239 --> 03:09:31,775
At the field Marshal here

4075
03:09:32,031 --> 03:09:32,799
I'm still

4076
03:09:33,055 --> 03:09:33,823
Brothers conflict

4077
03:09:34,079 --> 03:09:35,615
The heat keep you rights

4078
03:09:36,127 --> 03:09:37,407
An answer to that question

4079
03:09:37,663 --> 03:09:42,527
What kind of man do you have to be to start for those kind of casualties in the next day think about continuing

4080
03:09:43,807 --> 03:09:44,575
Peking writes quote

4081
03:09:45,343 --> 03:09:48,671
Haig who his contemporaries found difficult to know

4082
03:09:48,927 --> 03:09:50,719
Has become today in enigma

4083
03:09:51,231 --> 03:09:55,583
The successful generals of the first world war those who did not crack out right

4084
03:09:55,839 --> 03:09:59,423
Or decline gradually into pessimism we're a hard lot

4085
03:09:59,679 --> 03:10:02,751
As they had to be with the casualty figures accumulating on their desk

4086
03:10:03,263 --> 03:10:08,895
Some nonetheless managed to combine toughness of mind with some striking human characteristic

4087
03:10:09,407 --> 03:10:12,223
Jafra he says imperturbability

4088
03:10:12,735 --> 03:10:13,759
Hindenburg

4089
03:10:14,015 --> 03:10:14,527
Gravity

4090
03:10:16,319 --> 03:10:16,831
Fire

4091
03:10:17,343 --> 03:10:18,879
Camaro certainty

4092
03:10:19,135 --> 03:10:19,647
Hey

4093
03:10:19,903 --> 03:10:20,415
He says

4094
03:10:20,671 --> 03:10:25,279
In whose public manner in private Diaries no concern for human suffering was

4095
03:10:25,535 --> 03:10:27,071
Or is discernible

4096
03:10:27,327 --> 03:10:28,863
Compensated for his aloofness

4097
03:10:29,119 --> 03:10:35,263
With nothing whatsoever of the common touch he seemed to move through the horrors of the first world war as if

4098
03:10:35,519 --> 03:10:37,311
Guided by some inner voice

4099
03:10:37,567 --> 03:10:40,127
Speaking of a higher purpose in a personal destiny

4100
03:10:40,383 --> 03:10:42,431
That we now know he says

4101
03:10:42,687 --> 03:10:43,967
Was not just appearance

4102
03:10:44,479 --> 03:10:49,087
Egg was a devotee both of spiritualist practices and a fundamentalist religion

4103
03:10:49,599 --> 03:10:50,623
As a young officer

4104
03:10:50,879 --> 03:10:52,671
Do you take into attending seances

4105
03:10:52,927 --> 03:10:55,743
Where the medium put him in touch with Napoleon

4106
03:10:55,999 --> 03:11:02,143
As commander-in-chief he fell under the influence of a presbyterian chaplain whose sermons confirmed him in his

4107
03:11:02,399 --> 03:11:04,959
Believe that he was in direct communication with God

4108
03:11:05,215 --> 03:11:08,543
And had a major part to play in a divine plan for the world

4109
03:11:09,055 --> 03:11:12,383
Is own simple religion Keegan says he was convinced

4110
03:11:12,639 --> 03:11:14,175
Was shared by his soldiers

4111
03:11:14,431 --> 03:11:18,015
Who were inspired there by to Bear the dangers and sufferings

4112
03:11:18,271 --> 03:11:21,087
Which were there part of the war he was direct

4113
03:11:22,111 --> 03:11:22,623
And quote

4114
03:11:23,903 --> 03:11:24,415
Wow

4115
03:11:26,463 --> 03:11:28,255
Welcome to the controversy and the

4116
03:11:28,511 --> 03:11:29,023
Heat

4117
03:11:29,535 --> 03:11:30,815
The battle of the Somme

4118
03:11:31,071 --> 03:11:35,423
Has generated amongst those who write about it but justifiably so I think

4119
03:11:37,727 --> 03:11:39,775
And truthfully I think they were military

4120
03:11:40,287 --> 03:11:41,311
Who are certainly willing to

4121
03:11:41,567 --> 03:11:42,079
Forgive

4122
03:11:42,591 --> 03:11:43,359
Douglas Haig

4123
03:11:43,615 --> 03:11:44,639
Suffering 6

4124
03:11:44,895 --> 03:11:45,663
Mm casual

4125
03:11:45,919 --> 03:11:46,431
He's on the first date

4126
03:11:46,943 --> 03:11:47,455
All of the song

4127
03:11:47,711 --> 03:11:50,783
If he's inflicted something like 60000 on the Germans

4128
03:11:52,063 --> 03:11:52,831
Instead

4129
03:11:53,087 --> 03:11:56,671
The British suffer those kind of casualties in the German casualties may have been this low

4130
03:11:57,183 --> 03:11:57,695
Six

4131
03:11:59,231 --> 03:11:59,743
12000

4132
03:11:59,999 --> 03:12:01,791
What is the high number used sometimes see split

4133
03:12:03,327 --> 03:12:05,887
Take 60 give 8 you get your face

4134
03:12:08,191 --> 03:12:09,983
Not exactly the position you want

4135
03:12:10,495 --> 03:12:13,567
Your brand new general the new blood the person is going to bring a new

4136
03:12:13,823 --> 03:12:14,335
Centos

4137
03:12:14,591 --> 03:12:15,103
Stashed

4138
03:12:15,359 --> 03:12:16,639
To the war on the Western Front

4139
03:12:17,151 --> 03:12:19,967
All the sudden Douglas Haig been look a whole lot better than the people who care

4140
03:12:20,223 --> 03:12:20,735
Came before him

4141
03:12:22,015 --> 03:12:23,807
Pek John French could have had you suffered six

4142
03:12:24,063 --> 03:12:24,575
2000 cash

4143
03:12:25,087 --> 03:12:26,111
On the first day of the song right

4144
03:12:26,623 --> 03:12:27,135
Previous

4145
03:12:29,183 --> 03:12:29,695
Now

4146
03:12:30,719 --> 03:12:31,743
To put those numbers

4147
03:12:31,999 --> 03:12:33,535
In perspective cuz I was to do this from

4148
03:12:34,559 --> 03:12:36,095
60000 amorphous number

4149
03:12:36,351 --> 03:12:37,375
What what is that compared to

4150
03:12:37,887 --> 03:12:38,655
If there's damage

4151
03:12:38,911 --> 03:12:42,239
British 401 years by the battle of the Somme time

4152
03:12:42,751 --> 03:12:44,799
I've been talking about a horrible day they'd suffered

4153
03:12:45,311 --> 03:12:47,615
You know finishing off Napoleon at Waterloo

4154
03:12:47,871 --> 03:12:48,895
Fluoride in 1815

4155
03:12:49,151 --> 03:12:51,455
All Napoleon killed 8400

4156
03:12:51,967 --> 03:12:52,479
British soldier

4157
03:12:53,247 --> 03:12:53,759
8400

4158
03:12:54,015 --> 03:12:54,783
Compared to 20

4159
03:12:55,039 --> 03:12:56,063
Glock 21 or 19

4160
03:12:57,599 --> 03:12:58,367
Huge difference right

4161
03:12:58,879 --> 03:13:00,159
How about the Second World War

4162
03:13:00,415 --> 03:13:02,207
Are you always think of the second world war being worse

4163
03:13:02,719 --> 03:13:03,231
On the 1st

4164
03:13:03,999 --> 03:13:04,511
Winnie

4165
03:13:04,767 --> 03:13:06,047
British and Americans landed

4166
03:13:06,559 --> 03:13:11,679
On the beaches of Normandy on June 6th 1944 for the famous D-Day Landings and then pushed in LA

4167
03:13:11,935 --> 03:13:13,727
And a not enough

4168
03:13:13,983 --> 03:13:15,007
Attention paid to

4169
03:13:15,263 --> 03:13:17,823
Key part of that whole thing in a widening at the bridge at

4170
03:13:18,079 --> 03:13:20,639
It was hard combat was historically hard combat

4171
03:13:20,895 --> 03:13:21,663
Artichoke

4172
03:13:21,919 --> 03:13:23,455
The British and America combined

4173
03:13:24,223 --> 03:13:24,735
20 -

4174
03:13:25,503 --> 03:13:26,015
To reach

4175
03:13:26,271 --> 03:13:27,551
20000 casual

4176
03:13:28,831 --> 03:13:30,111
Who took in 20 days

4177
03:13:30,367 --> 03:13:31,903
Combined British and American

4178
03:13:32,159 --> 03:13:35,231
To reach one third the amount of casualties

4179
03:13:35,743 --> 03:13:37,023
The British alarm set for

4180
03:13:37,279 --> 03:13:37,791
On the first day of

4181
03:13:38,303 --> 03:13:39,071
That's why

4182
03:13:42,399 --> 03:13:43,423
Wet sounds

4183
03:13:43,935 --> 03:13:48,031
Like Brianna doesn't it those numbers start to sound like what the french are suffering that horrible

4184
03:13:48,543 --> 03:13:51,103
In a battle to bleed their army White

4185
03:13:52,127 --> 03:13:55,967
Well David fromkin in his book a peace to end all peace quotes normanstone

4186
03:13:56,735 --> 03:13:57,247
About

4187
03:13:57,759 --> 03:13:59,039
How large these

4188
03:13:59,295 --> 03:14:01,855
Battles were compared to what the people in Europe were used

4189
03:14:02,111 --> 03:14:02,879
When he says quote

4190
03:14:03,903 --> 03:14:04,927
It has been estimated

4191
03:14:05,183 --> 03:14:06,207
The total

4192
03:14:06,463 --> 03:14:12,607
Of military and civilian casualties in all of Europe domestic and international

4193
03:14:12,863 --> 03:14:13,631
National conflicts

4194
03:14:13,887 --> 03:14:16,703
In the Hundred Years between 1815

4195
03:14:16,959 --> 03:14:18,495
+ 1915

4196
03:14:18,751 --> 03:14:22,335
Was no greater than a single day's combat losses

4197
03:14:22,591 --> 03:14:25,151
In any of the great battles of 1916

4198
03:14:25,919 --> 03:14:26,431
And quote

4199
03:14:29,247 --> 03:14:34,879
Credible statistic when you think of all of the battles that Europeans fought in Europe in in colonies and I wasn't

4200
03:14:35,391 --> 03:14:36,671
All of it put together

4201
03:14:37,183 --> 03:14:38,975
And all the European countries

4202
03:14:39,487 --> 03:14:40,511
400 years

4203
03:14:41,023 --> 03:14:43,071
Doesn't equal one of the bad days

4204
03:14:43,327 --> 03:14:44,095
Effort.

4205
03:14:44,607 --> 03:14:45,119
Or the song

4206
03:14:47,423 --> 03:14:48,191
The society

4207
03:14:48,703 --> 03:14:49,215
Could handle these

4208
03:14:49,471 --> 03:14:49,983
Kind of casualty

4209
03:14:50,751 --> 03:14:51,519
Will remark

4210
03:14:52,031 --> 03:14:54,079
But they took their toll as you might imagine

4211
03:14:55,871 --> 03:14:57,919
The time 5 months of the Somme

4212
03:14:58,175 --> 03:14:58,943
Is over

4213
03:14:59,455 --> 03:15:00,991
You have another million casual

4214
03:15:02,271 --> 03:15:02,783
In 5 months

4215
03:15:03,039 --> 03:15:06,111
So we're done gives you roughly about a million

4216
03:15:06,367 --> 03:15:09,183
And the song gives you roughly about a million

4217
03:15:09,695 --> 03:15:10,975
All at the same time

4218
03:15:12,767 --> 03:15:14,047
The burn rate on the west

4219
03:15:14,559 --> 03:15:15,071
Horrified

4220
03:15:16,607 --> 03:15:18,911
And remember all of these battles

4221
03:15:19,167 --> 03:15:21,215
Are like a lot of littler battles

4222
03:15:21,727 --> 03:15:22,751
Sort of lump together

4223
03:15:24,287 --> 03:15:27,359
Being at the song for example the Germans will Counterattack

4224
03:15:27,615 --> 03:15:30,175
In that 5 month. More than 300 times

4225
03:15:30,431 --> 03:15:34,783
A ton of those counter-attacks in ancient times would have been a battle all by itself right

4226
03:15:35,295 --> 03:15:37,343
Part of the reason why it's so hard to follow

4227
03:15:37,599 --> 03:15:38,623
The nature of these battle

4228
03:15:40,415 --> 03:15:42,463
Churchill has an overall description

4229
03:15:43,231 --> 03:15:44,255
That is just horrifying

4230
03:15:44,767 --> 03:15:45,279
Of

4231
03:15:45,791 --> 03:15:49,887
A conceptual view of this that makes you understand what was really going on

4232
03:15:50,143 --> 03:15:51,935
If you could view it sort of from space

4233
03:15:52,703 --> 03:15:55,007
And he writes about both the Somme and Verdun

4234
03:15:55,263 --> 03:15:55,775
Quote

4235
03:15:56,799 --> 03:16:00,127
The anatomy of the battles of Verdun and the Somme was the same

4236
03:16:00,639 --> 03:16:02,431
A battlefield have been selected

4237
03:16:02,687 --> 03:16:04,991
Around this battlefield walls were built

4238
03:16:05,247 --> 03:16:08,575
Double triple quadruple of enormous Cannon

4239
03:16:09,087 --> 03:16:09,855
Behind These

4240
03:16:10,111 --> 03:16:12,159
Railways were constructed to feed them

4241
03:16:12,415 --> 03:16:14,463
And mountains of shells were built up

4242
03:16:14,719 --> 03:16:16,255
All this was the work of months

4243
03:16:16,767 --> 03:16:19,071
Does the battlefield was completely encircle

4244
03:16:19,327 --> 03:16:24,447
Thousands of Guns of all sizes and a wide oval space prepared in their mitts

4245
03:16:25,215 --> 03:16:28,799
Through this awful Arena all the divisions of each Army

4246
03:16:29,055 --> 03:16:34,175
Battered ceaselessly by the enveloping artillery were made to pass in succession

4247
03:16:34,431 --> 03:16:38,527
As if they were in the teeth of interlocking cogwheels grinding each other

4248
03:16:39,295 --> 03:16:40,319
4 month after month

4249
03:16:40,575 --> 03:16:41,087
He writes

4250
03:16:41,343 --> 03:16:43,391
The ceaseless cannonade continued

4251
03:16:43,647 --> 03:16:45,183
Edits utmost intensity

4252
03:16:45,439 --> 03:16:49,279
10 month after month the gallon divisions of heroic human beings

4253
03:16:49,535 --> 03:16:52,095
We're Torn to Pieces in this terrible rotation

4254
03:16:52,607 --> 03:16:53,631
Then came the winter

4255
03:16:54,143 --> 03:16:57,215
Pouring down rain from the sky to clog the feet of men

4256
03:16:57,471 --> 03:16:59,263
And drawing veils of mist

4257
03:16:59,519 --> 03:17:01,311
Before the Hawkeyes of their artillery

4258
03:17:01,823 --> 03:17:06,175
The arena has used to happen in the Colosseum in those miniature Roman days

4259
03:17:06,431 --> 03:17:07,711
Was flooded with water

4260
03:17:08,735 --> 03:17:12,319
Steven sang with mud churned by thousands of vehicles

4261
03:17:12,575 --> 03:17:17,439
By hundreds of thousands of men and millions of shells replaced the Blasted us

4262
03:17:18,207 --> 03:17:20,255
Still the struggle continued

4263
03:17:20,511 --> 03:17:23,071
Still the remorseless Wheels revolve

4264
03:17:23,583 --> 03:17:26,399
Still the auditorium of artillery roared

4265
03:17:26,655 --> 03:17:27,167
At last

4266
03:17:27,423 --> 03:17:29,727
The legs of men could no longer move

4267
03:17:29,983 --> 03:17:32,799
They wallowed and floundered helplessly in the slime

4268
03:17:33,055 --> 03:17:37,663
Their food and ammunition lag behind them along the smashed and choked roadway

4269
03:17:39,199 --> 03:17:39,711
And quote

4270
03:17:42,015 --> 03:17:43,807
I keep quoting Churchill because wasn't that

4271
03:17:44,831 --> 03:17:45,855
Positively

4272
03:17:46,367 --> 03:17:47,391
Tolkien-esque

4273
03:17:48,671 --> 03:17:50,207
By the way there are people who

4274
03:17:51,231 --> 03:17:54,303
USA the tokens experiences with the first World War

4275
03:17:54,815 --> 03:17:55,327
Influence

4276
03:17:56,095 --> 03:17:57,119
His way of writing

4277
03:17:57,375 --> 03:17:57,887
Inthinking

4278
03:17:58,399 --> 03:18:01,215
But if it did he would have been just wanted millions of others

4279
03:18:01,471 --> 03:18:04,031
People that had their Outlook transform

4280
03:18:04,287 --> 03:18:06,079
How could you not

4281
03:18:08,127 --> 03:18:08,639
As we said

4282
03:18:08,895 --> 03:18:12,991
You imagine writing that last letter home where is essentially a goodbye letter

4283
03:18:13,503 --> 03:18:16,319
Can change you can did I known a lot of people who've had

4284
03:18:16,575 --> 03:18:17,343
Terminal illnesses

4285
03:18:17,855 --> 03:18:21,183
Had months to know the death was in their near future

4286
03:18:21,951 --> 03:18:22,975
It often changes

4287
03:18:23,743 --> 03:18:24,511
It often

4288
03:18:24,767 --> 03:18:29,119
Creates this introspective mood where all of a sudden they're focusing

4289
03:18:29,631 --> 03:18:32,447
On subjects that people don't usually spend

4290
03:18:32,703 --> 03:18:37,567
Hour after hour day after day focusing on but it's right in front of the right if you have terminal

4291
03:18:37,823 --> 03:18:38,591
Cancer

4292
03:18:39,359 --> 03:18:40,895
It's going to be on your mind

4293
03:18:41,663 --> 03:18:43,711
And the thinking about it changes you

4294
03:18:43,967 --> 03:18:45,503
What if you had a terminal disease

4295
03:18:46,015 --> 03:18:50,879
And all of a sudden at the last minute the doctors figured out a way to cure you when you were dragged back from the brink

4296
03:18:51,135 --> 03:18:54,207
But you'd spent a couple of months thinking intensely

4297
03:18:54,719 --> 03:18:55,487
About life

4298
03:18:55,743 --> 03:19:00,351
And death and the meaning of things and what you would have done differently in all these really heavy-duty thoughts

4299
03:19:00,607 --> 03:19:02,399
But most people can only stand to

4300
03:19:02,655 --> 03:19:04,447
Think about in short little burst juice

4301
03:19:05,215 --> 03:19:05,983
There are except

4302
03:19:07,007 --> 03:19:08,031
Now imagine

4303
03:19:08,543 --> 03:19:09,055
Millions

4304
03:19:10,335 --> 03:19:11,103
Doing this 90

4305
03:19:11,359 --> 03:19:12,383
14 1980

4306
03:19:12,639 --> 03:19:13,151
.

4307
03:19:13,663 --> 03:19:16,991
Who would have found themselves in a similar sort of a situation

4308
03:19:17,759 --> 03:19:23,647
Pretty much sure they were going to die in the near future will be horribly disfigured thinking about the heaviest of subject

4309
03:19:23,903 --> 03:19:26,207
Writing letters home to loved one saying

4310
03:19:26,463 --> 03:19:29,279
You know I'm going to miss not knowing my baby daughter and then

4311
03:19:29,791 --> 03:19:30,559
Some of them

4312
03:19:31,071 --> 03:19:32,095
Getting a reprieve

4313
03:19:32,863 --> 03:19:36,703
I'm getting a chance to live this life they were all but writing off

4314
03:19:37,215 --> 03:19:38,751
During the worst of these War XP

4315
03:19:40,287 --> 03:19:41,567
That is a searing

4316
03:19:42,591 --> 03:19:46,175
Personal experience that millions of individual persons

4317
03:19:46,943 --> 03:19:47,455
Went through

4318
03:19:47,967 --> 03:19:48,991
How does that not change

4319
03:19:49,503 --> 03:19:51,039
The society when they go home

4320
03:19:52,575 --> 03:19:53,343
And you know

4321
03:19:53,855 --> 03:19:55,135
One of the things about battles

4322
03:19:55,391 --> 03:19:59,487
Specialty's First World War battles is there so dark are they in there so Industrial

4323
03:19:59,743 --> 03:20:00,255
And they're so

4324
03:20:00,511 --> 03:20:04,351
Unbelievably horrifying the Charnel house Zombie graveyard

4325
03:20:04,863 --> 03:20:06,655
Feel of the battlefield in the first World War

4326
03:20:06,911 --> 03:20:07,423
Make that

4327
03:20:07,679 --> 03:20:08,447
Particularly

4328
03:20:08,959 --> 03:20:09,727
Remind me

4329
03:20:10,751 --> 03:20:12,287
You'll see a lot of Art

4330
03:20:12,543 --> 03:20:14,591
Around the first world war that shows corpse

4331
03:20:15,615 --> 03:20:16,127
Ducane

4332
03:20:16,383 --> 03:20:19,199
And it's not so you feel sympathy with the Dead

4333
03:20:19,455 --> 03:20:23,551
Figure it's so that you understand what it was like for those people living amongst

4334
03:20:23,807 --> 03:20:26,879
All those decaying corpses to deal with that reality

4335
03:20:27,391 --> 03:20:32,255
Mind-bending battles mind-bending enough right you at all the incredible artillery which is

4336
03:20:32,767 --> 03:20:36,095
Disorienting as as all get-out and then throw in

4337
03:20:36,607 --> 03:20:39,679
Bodies in pieces of bodies everywhere when you're living as we've said

4338
03:20:39,935 --> 03:20:40,703
It's a unique

4339
03:20:40,959 --> 03:20:41,471
Experience

4340
03:20:43,263 --> 03:20:44,287
It's a form of hell

4341
03:20:45,823 --> 03:20:46,335
And yet

4342
03:20:46,591 --> 03:20:48,127
Does someone like yours truly

4343
03:20:48,383 --> 03:20:49,407
That creates

4344
03:20:49,919 --> 03:20:51,199
The circumstance

4345
03:20:52,223 --> 03:20:52,735
Where

4346
03:20:53,759 --> 03:20:54,527
Human

4347
03:20:54,783 --> 03:20:56,063
Brotherly love

4348
03:20:57,087 --> 03:20:59,647
Appears so like a light in the dark

4349
03:21:01,183 --> 03:21:03,487
Part of why battles are interesting to study is B

4350
03:21:03,743 --> 03:21:04,255
Because it's you

4351
03:21:05,023 --> 03:21:06,815
Probably figured out you can see the worst

4352
03:21:07,071 --> 03:21:09,887
Human behavior and man's inhumanity to man in them

4353
03:21:10,655 --> 03:21:11,935
But you can also see these

4354
03:21:12,959 --> 03:21:14,239
Pieces of humanity

4355
03:21:15,007 --> 03:21:18,079
Slip through and when they do they are all the more bright

4356
03:21:18,591 --> 03:21:23,455
And noticeable because they're happening in hell as opposed to asking something that happens in your neighborhood

4357
03:21:23,711 --> 03:21:26,783
A little piece of humanity not that surprising in your neighborhood

4358
03:21:27,039 --> 03:21:28,575
Probably makes your day a little brighter

4359
03:21:28,831 --> 03:21:30,111
A piece of humanity in the

4360
03:21:30,367 --> 03:21:31,647
Alabi's Battlefield

4361
03:21:32,671 --> 03:21:34,207
Has a rejuvenating

4362
03:21:34,463 --> 03:21:35,743
Effect for once feel about

4363
03:21:35,999 --> 03:21:36,511
Man

4364
03:21:37,791 --> 03:21:38,559
Take for exam

4365
03:21:41,631 --> 03:21:42,399
These

4366
03:21:42,655 --> 03:21:43,423
No man

4367
03:21:44,703 --> 03:21:46,495
In between the fighting lines of

4368
03:21:46,751 --> 03:21:47,519
The two sides of the West

4369
03:21:48,031 --> 03:21:54,175
Created something that the battles of had forever I'm in the second world war you have these Crossroads

4370
03:21:54,431 --> 03:21:55,455
Set up a sudden

4371
03:21:55,711 --> 03:21:58,783
You know he was death to cross this Crossroad put the Western Front

4372
03:21:59,039 --> 03:22:00,575
Is hundreds of miles

4373
03:22:00,831 --> 03:22:01,343
Rules of

4374
03:22:01,599 --> 03:22:02,367
Trench line

4375
03:22:02,623 --> 03:22:07,743
All of them with this dead zone in between and on the really big front swirl out what's happening

4376
03:22:08,767 --> 03:22:09,791
There was tons of

4377
03:22:10,047 --> 03:22:11,583
Drama in those dead zone

4378
03:22:12,351 --> 03:22:13,375
Things would happen that

4379
03:22:13,631 --> 03:22:14,655
We challenged men's

4380
03:22:15,167 --> 03:22:16,191
Morality

4381
03:22:16,959 --> 03:22:19,007
And what you're willing to do a perfect example

4382
03:22:19,263 --> 03:22:20,799
Is in the battle of the Somme

4383
03:22:22,079 --> 03:22:26,943
When the 60,000 casualties and a lot of other casualties over the course of that battle or happening

4384
03:22:27,199 --> 03:22:31,295
The Germans are often taking pity on their fellow human being

4385
03:22:31,551 --> 03:22:32,831
And the British write about it

4386
03:22:34,111 --> 03:22:34,623
I mean when

4387
03:22:34,879 --> 03:22:35,647
These British

4388
03:22:36,159 --> 03:22:42,303
Attacks would break against the German defense isn't in the wounded would start back toward the safety of their own trenches grabbing

4389
03:22:42,559 --> 03:22:48,191
Even worse wounded people with them and trying to under machine gun and artillery fire get back to their own

4390
03:22:48,447 --> 03:22:50,751
Trenches lot of times these Germans would just stop shoot

4391
03:22:52,287 --> 03:22:56,639
On the first terrible day there were often times where the machine Gunners in the officers were just a stye

4392
03:22:56,895 --> 03:22:57,407
Letting it be

4393
03:22:58,431 --> 03:22:59,455
The human thing to do

4394
03:22:59,711 --> 03:23:00,223
Right

4395
03:23:00,735 --> 03:23:02,783
On the other hand if they had just machine-gun them

4396
03:23:03,039 --> 03:23:04,831
That window surprised anybody

4397
03:23:05,087 --> 03:23:05,599
Either

4398
03:23:06,111 --> 03:23:07,135
What are you doing now

4399
03:23:07,903 --> 03:23:09,183
About those people

4400
03:23:09,439 --> 03:23:11,743
Who are stuck out there in no man's land

4401
03:23:12,511 --> 03:23:13,535
After the attack is over

4402
03:23:14,047 --> 03:23:15,327
There are all sorts of stories about

4403
03:23:15,583 --> 03:23:16,095
People who will

4404
03:23:16,351 --> 03:23:16,863
Simply

4405
03:23:17,119 --> 03:23:23,007
If they can drive themselves to the nearest Shell hole wrap themselves up in the tarp they keep to keep the rain out

4406
03:23:23,263 --> 03:23:25,055
Open up a Bible in just died in

4407
03:23:25,311 --> 03:23:25,823
Shell hole

4408
03:23:27,103 --> 03:23:27,871
When they don't

4409
03:23:28,383 --> 03:23:29,151
Taken off and have it

4410
03:23:29,407 --> 03:23:29,919
A terrible affair

4411
03:23:30,175 --> 03:23:31,711
Fact on the men in the trenches on both sides

4412
03:23:32,223 --> 03:23:35,039
Apaches in the American southwest

4413
03:23:35,295 --> 03:23:36,575
Used to be able to make such good use

4414
03:23:37,087 --> 03:23:38,111
Of pasta

4415
03:23:38,879 --> 03:23:43,743
And if you threaten to torture hostile you did towards her hostage you could get all kinds of

4416
03:23:43,999 --> 03:23:45,535
Concessions from the other side

4417
03:23:46,303 --> 03:23:47,327
Well they were hostages

4418
03:23:48,095 --> 03:23:51,167
Hate is holding in the middle of those no man's land areas

4419
03:23:51,679 --> 03:23:52,703
And what do you do

4420
03:23:52,959 --> 03:23:56,543
When one of them starts asking for help and they're basically calling to you

4421
03:23:57,055 --> 03:23:57,823
And your body

4422
03:23:58,591 --> 03:23:59,359
Terminal Man

4423
03:24:01,663 --> 03:24:02,943
If you want to see their heroism

4424
03:24:03,455 --> 03:24:04,479
And the sacrifice

4425
03:24:05,247 --> 03:24:06,527
Human beings can show

4426
03:24:06,783 --> 03:24:07,551
And in these hellish

4427
03:24:07,807 --> 03:24:08,319
Situations

4428
03:24:09,087 --> 03:24:10,623
Read the accounts over and over about

4429
03:24:10,879 --> 03:24:11,903
How men dealt with

4430
03:24:12,159 --> 03:24:12,927
Scream

4431
03:24:13,695 --> 03:24:14,207
For help

4432
03:24:14,463 --> 03:24:15,231
From No Man's

4433
03:24:17,791 --> 03:24:19,071
A perfect example

4434
03:24:19,327 --> 03:24:23,167
Of the kind of moral dilemmas and self-sacrifice that these situations

4435
03:24:23,935 --> 03:24:24,703
In a create

4436
03:24:25,215 --> 03:24:27,007
Is the story that Robert Graves tell

4437
03:24:27,263 --> 03:24:28,287
Bealls in goodbye all that

4438
03:24:28,543 --> 03:24:30,847
He was serving at the Somme on the Western Front

4439
03:24:31,103 --> 03:24:32,639
And a soldier named Samson

4440
03:24:33,151 --> 03:24:33,663
Gets hit

4441
03:24:34,175 --> 03:24:40,319
In the wave before Graves is wave goes over the tops of graves is just getting ready for this intense experience himself

4442
03:24:40,575 --> 03:24:41,599
I'm going over the top of the trench

4443
03:24:41,855 --> 03:24:44,671
With other human beings right into the teeth of machine-gun Fire

4444
03:24:44,927 --> 03:24:48,767
And all of a sudden you hear the sound of somebody from the last attack

4445
03:24:49,279 --> 03:24:53,631
From No Man's Land you know where it's death to stand up and move around

4446
03:24:54,143 --> 03:24:54,911
Asking

4447
03:24:55,167 --> 03:24:57,471
For help were screaming out and here's what Graves

4448
03:24:57,727 --> 03:25:00,031
Is Right remember he's he's in the state himself

4449
03:25:00,287 --> 03:25:01,055
I'm thinking okay I got it

4450
03:25:02,335 --> 03:25:03,359
Walking machine gun fire

4451
03:25:03,871 --> 03:25:06,175
And I'm just seeing all these other people die in front of me quote

4452
03:25:06,687 --> 03:25:07,967
My mouth was dry

4453
03:25:08,223 --> 03:25:11,295
My eyes out of focus in my legs quaking under me

4454
03:25:11,807 --> 03:25:14,879
I found a water bottle full of rum and drank about half a pint

4455
03:25:15,391 --> 03:25:17,695
It quieted me and my head remained clear

4456
03:25:18,207 --> 03:25:21,791
Samson leg groaning about 20 yd beyond the front Trench

4457
03:25:22,047 --> 03:25:23,839
Several attempts were made to rescue

4458
03:25:24,095 --> 03:25:25,375
And he been very badly hit

4459
03:25:25,887 --> 03:25:27,935
Three men got killed in those attempts

4460
03:25:28,191 --> 03:25:30,239
Two officers in two men wounded

4461
03:25:30,495 --> 03:25:33,567
Andy and his own orderly managed to crawl out to him

4462
03:25:34,079 --> 03:25:35,359
Samson waved and back

4463
03:25:35,871 --> 03:25:38,431
Say he was riddled through and not worth rescuing

4464
03:25:38,687 --> 03:25:41,759
He sent his apologies to the company for making such a noise

4465
03:25:42,527 --> 03:25:43,039
And quote

4466
03:25:43,807 --> 03:25:45,599
Other words just guys out there screaming

4467
03:25:46,111 --> 03:25:49,695
And it's so driving his own comrade crazy that they keep

4468
03:25:49,951 --> 03:25:51,743
Running out there to do something

4469
03:25:51,999 --> 03:25:54,559
And everybody runs out there to do something gets killed

4470
03:25:55,327 --> 03:25:56,863
At what point if you're the wounded

4471
03:25:57,887 --> 03:25:58,655
Do you try to just

4472
03:25:59,423 --> 03:26:02,751
Stop making noise so that they don't keep trying to help you out of sympathy

4473
03:26:03,007 --> 03:26:07,359
When you probably are dying anyway and now you lost three people or more

4474
03:26:07,615 --> 03:26:08,383
Simply trying to

4475
03:26:08,639 --> 03:26:10,431
Prevent the inevitable you're going through

4476
03:26:10,943 --> 03:26:11,455
So

4477
03:26:12,223 --> 03:26:12,991
At night

4478
03:26:13,247 --> 03:26:16,831
When we're told the no man's land area comes to life

4479
03:26:17,599 --> 03:26:18,623
And in a word

4480
03:26:18,879 --> 03:26:22,207
Appears deserted during the daytime at night the trench patrols go out

4481
03:26:22,463 --> 03:26:23,487
The people who

4482
03:26:23,743 --> 03:26:27,071
In a fix the barbed wire the intelligence folks

4483
03:26:27,327 --> 03:26:30,399
The people conducting trench raids I mean supposedly there's a lot of

4484
03:26:30,655 --> 03:26:33,727
Activity in the dark even though star shells Light Up the Sky all

4485
03:26:33,983 --> 03:26:34,495
All the time

4486
03:26:35,007 --> 03:26:35,775
At dark

4487
03:26:37,311 --> 03:26:38,591
Graves in his unit

4488
03:26:39,103 --> 03:26:40,127
Movies out to go

4489
03:26:40,639 --> 03:26:43,455
Cleared any wounded in front of their trenches and he writes quotes

4490
03:26:43,711 --> 03:26:45,759
At dusk we all went out to get the wounded

4491
03:26:46,015 --> 03:26:47,551
Leaving only centuries in the line

4492
03:26:48,063 --> 03:26:50,367
The first dead body I Came Upon was Samson

4493
03:26:50,879 --> 03:26:52,159
Hidden 17th Place

4494
03:26:52,927 --> 03:26:58,815
I found that he forced his knuckles into his mouth to stop himself crying out and attracting anymore men to their death

4495
03:26:59,583 --> 03:27:00,095
And quote

4496
03:27:02,143 --> 03:27:04,703
This poor man out there hit 17 times

4497
03:27:05,471 --> 03:27:08,287
Suffering horribly unable to Keep from Crying Out

4498
03:27:08,543 --> 03:27:10,847
Can't stand the thought of attracting anymore in men

4499
03:27:11,615 --> 03:27:12,383
To rescue him

4500
03:27:12,895 --> 03:27:13,919
And dies with his

4501
03:27:14,431 --> 03:27:15,455
Hand in his mouth

4502
03:27:15,967 --> 03:27:17,759
To keep from crying I mean it is it

4503
03:27:19,039 --> 03:27:20,319
It's it's the beauty

4504
03:27:21,855 --> 03:27:24,415
Finds Its way into the horrific Ness of this war

4505
03:27:25,183 --> 03:27:25,951
If you're that person

4506
03:27:26,207 --> 03:27:26,975
Parent there's nothing there

4507
03:27:28,511 --> 03:27:29,791
Really better than a human being

4508
03:27:30,047 --> 03:27:31,327
You look at that and say

4509
03:27:31,583 --> 03:27:32,095
There's something about

4510
03:27:32,351 --> 03:27:32,863
Not that man sex

4511
03:27:35,167 --> 03:27:36,703
Now Grace tells another story

4512
03:27:37,215 --> 03:27:41,055
Which not only shows the heroism and the beauty of one of his compatriot

4513
03:27:42,079 --> 03:27:44,895
But the same sort of an attitude on the part of

4514
03:27:45,151 --> 03:27:46,687
The people the British start with a bad guy

4515
03:27:47,199 --> 03:27:50,271
The Germans that we said the Germans have been holding their fire quite a bit

4516
03:27:51,039 --> 03:27:52,831
You're doing this bottle and you see it

4517
03:27:53,087 --> 03:27:56,671
On the French side of the British side to I mean this is not abnormal

4518
03:27:56,927 --> 03:27:57,439
It's

4519
03:27:57,695 --> 03:28:01,535
A little bit like that Christmas Truce we talked about in the 1914

4520
03:28:02,047 --> 03:28:04,607
Error of this war we're spontaneously

4521
03:28:04,863 --> 03:28:05,887
Troops got up and

4522
03:28:06,399 --> 03:28:07,679
Should have gave each other a

4523
03:28:08,447 --> 03:28:10,751
Little Christmas love in between the shellings right

4524
03:28:11,263 --> 03:28:14,079
You see this Humanity appear even in this hell

4525
03:28:14,335 --> 03:28:15,615
Graves talks about

4526
03:28:17,151 --> 03:28:18,687
Another soldier in no man's

4527
03:28:19,711 --> 03:28:20,479
Wakes up

4528
03:28:21,503 --> 03:28:23,295
Seemingly dead and then all of a sudden

4529
03:28:23,551 --> 03:28:24,319
Is crying for help

4530
03:28:25,087 --> 03:28:27,903
And when this happens every man in his trench

4531
03:28:28,415 --> 03:28:29,695
Feels like he's going through

4532
03:28:29,951 --> 03:28:31,743
I'm sort of a moral test

4533
03:28:32,511 --> 03:28:33,791
And one man has it

4534
03:28:34,047 --> 03:28:34,815
With flying colors

4535
03:28:35,583 --> 03:28:36,095
Raised right

4536
03:28:38,655 --> 03:28:40,191
On the morning of the 27th

4537
03:28:40,447 --> 03:28:42,239
Briar Rose from no man's land

4538
03:28:42,751 --> 03:28:47,103
A wounded soldier of the Middlesex unit have recovered Consciousness after 2 days

4539
03:28:47,615 --> 03:28:49,407
Delite close to the German wire

4540
03:28:49,919 --> 03:28:51,711
Are men heard it and looked at each other

4541
03:28:52,223 --> 03:28:55,039
We had a tender-hearted lance corporal name Baxter

4542
03:28:55,551 --> 03:29:00,671
He was the man to boil up a special Dixie for the centuries of his section when they came off duty made him a little

4543
03:29:00,927 --> 03:29:01,439
Super T

4544
03:29:01,951 --> 03:29:02,975
As soon as he heard

4545
03:29:03,231 --> 03:29:08,351
The wounded Middlesex man he ran along the trench calling for a volunteer to help fetch him in

4546
03:29:08,863 --> 03:29:10,399
Of course no one would go

4547
03:29:10,911 --> 03:29:12,447
It was death to put one's head over the

4548
03:29:12,703 --> 03:29:13,215
The parapet

4549
03:29:13,471 --> 03:29:15,007
When he came running to ask me

4550
03:29:15,263 --> 03:29:18,079
I excused myself as being the only officer in the company

4551
03:29:18,335 --> 03:29:19,615
I would come out with him at dusk

4552
03:29:19,871 --> 03:29:20,383
I said

4553
03:29:20,639 --> 03:29:21,151
Not now

4554
03:29:21,663 --> 03:29:22,687
So he went alone

4555
03:29:23,199 --> 03:29:24,991
Jump quickly over the parapet

4556
03:29:25,247 --> 03:29:28,575
And then strolled across no-man's-land waving a handkerchief

4557
03:29:29,087 --> 03:29:33,695
The Germans fire to frighten him but since he persisted they let him come close

4558
03:29:34,207 --> 03:29:35,743
Baxter continue tour

4559
03:29:35,999 --> 03:29:37,791
And when he got to the Middlesex man

4560
03:29:38,303 --> 03:29:38,815
Stop

4561
03:29:39,071 --> 03:29:41,631
And pointed to show the Germans what he was at

4562
03:29:41,887 --> 03:29:42,655
What he was up to

4563
03:29:43,423 --> 03:29:45,215
Venidress the man's wounds

4564
03:29:45,471 --> 03:29:50,591
Gave him a drink of rum and some biscuit that he had with him and promised to be back again at nightfall

4565
03:29:50,847 --> 03:29:52,895
He didn't come back grades right

4566
03:29:53,151 --> 03:29:55,967
With a stretcher party and a man eventually recovered

4567
03:29:56,223 --> 03:30:00,831
I recommended Baxter for the Victoria Cross being the only officer who would witness the action

4568
03:30:01,087 --> 03:30:04,415
But the authorities started worth no more than a distinguished Conduct Medal

4569
03:30:04,927 --> 03:30:05,439
And quote

4570
03:30:07,231 --> 03:30:08,767
Sounds worthy of a Victoria Cross

4571
03:30:10,303 --> 03:30:12,351
And that's one of those incidents where you see

4572
03:30:12,863 --> 03:30:15,423
The opposite of man's inhumanity to man

4573
03:30:15,679 --> 03:30:19,263
In an environment designed to Foster the former

4574
03:30:20,543 --> 03:30:22,079
It stands out all the more doesn't it

4575
03:30:23,359 --> 03:30:29,503
The Baxter could have easily been mowed down and if you don't think it happens remember three people were mowed down trying to say

4576
03:30:29,759 --> 03:30:31,551
That wounded Samson character in the first

4577
03:30:34,111 --> 03:30:34,623
I can't help

4578
03:30:34,879 --> 03:30:35,391
Wonder

4579
03:30:36,159 --> 03:30:38,463
How am I generation would handle what these B

4580
03:30:38,719 --> 03:30:39,231
People Workforce

4581
03:30:39,487 --> 03:30:39,999
What to do

4582
03:30:40,511 --> 03:30:42,559
You think of the first day on the battle of the Somme

4583
03:30:42,815 --> 03:30:44,607
Think of yourself in the second

4584
03:30:44,863 --> 03:30:45,375
Wave

4585
03:30:45,887 --> 03:30:46,911
Or the Third Way

4586
03:30:47,935 --> 03:30:50,751
And you hear all this stuff from the officers about all them

4587
03:30:51,007 --> 03:30:53,311
Killer will destroy everybody that nobody be Left Alive

4588
03:30:53,567 --> 03:30:57,663
And then the first wave in front of you units that you know go over the top

4589
03:30:57,919 --> 03:31:00,735
And don't even get near their objective before their cuts a ribbon

4590
03:31:00,991 --> 03:31:03,039
It's an absolute catastrophe

4591
03:31:03,551 --> 03:31:05,599
And screw up and everybody can see it happen

4592
03:31:06,367 --> 03:31:07,647
And then they turn to the next wave

4593
03:31:07,903 --> 03:31:09,439
If maybe that's not you maybe you're in the third

4594
03:31:09,695 --> 03:31:14,559
And tell them to go do the same thing and they doing the same thing happens right it's suicide

4595
03:31:15,071 --> 03:31:16,607
Now they turn to you

4596
03:31:16,863 --> 03:31:18,655
Let me say okay it's your units turn

4597
03:31:19,679 --> 03:31:20,191
What you do

4598
03:31:20,447 --> 03:31:21,983
Forget cowardice for a second

4599
03:31:22,239 --> 03:31:24,031
Because there are people who simply ran away

4600
03:31:24,543 --> 03:31:26,591
Aarhus nerves failed them or whatever

4601
03:31:27,103 --> 03:31:28,127
This is not a question of

4602
03:31:28,639 --> 03:31:29,151
You know

4603
03:31:29,407 --> 03:31:30,431
What could you

4604
03:31:31,199 --> 03:31:31,711
Physically

4605
03:31:31,967 --> 03:31:32,991
This is a question of what

4606
03:31:33,247 --> 03:31:33,759
Would you

4607
03:31:36,831 --> 03:31:37,343
See I think

4608
03:31:38,111 --> 03:31:38,623
A lot of us

4609
03:31:38,879 --> 03:31:39,903
We think to ourselves

4610
03:31:40,671 --> 03:31:42,463
There's no way I'm surviving

4611
03:31:42,975 --> 03:31:44,255
Going out onto that battle

4612
03:31:45,279 --> 03:31:49,375
But if this officer wasn't here telling me to do this and my buddies and I just sort of

4613
03:31:49,631 --> 03:31:52,191
Decided all together we're not doing this

4614
03:31:52,703 --> 03:31:54,239
Maybe something would change you know

4615
03:31:54,495 --> 03:31:55,775
One of the first war novel

4616
03:31:56,031 --> 03:31:58,591
What's come out of the first world war actually came out during the

4617
03:31:59,615 --> 03:32:00,639
Frenchman name

4618
03:32:00,895 --> 03:32:01,663
Henry Barber

4619
03:32:01,919 --> 03:32:02,687
And he wrote

4620
03:32:02,943 --> 03:32:03,711
Something

4621
03:32:03,967 --> 03:32:06,271
Where he as a soldier had served our

4622
03:32:06,527 --> 03:32:12,415
Already he was a disabled veteran he wrote this piece while the war was still going on and it's surprisingly anti-war

4623
03:32:12,927 --> 03:32:15,231
For the government to put up with it during the conflict

4624
03:32:15,743 --> 03:32:19,583
And he implied that the soldiers on both sides the common soldiers

4625
03:32:20,095 --> 03:32:21,631
To just agree with each other

4626
03:32:22,143 --> 03:32:22,911
Vinegar fighting

4627
03:32:23,423 --> 03:32:29,567
And what if they gave a war and no one came right what if the soldiers on both sides of the government can tell it to 5

4628
03:32:30,079 --> 03:32:31,615
And Barbara said that in the book that

4629
03:32:32,127 --> 03:32:34,431
Truthfully the only people who really understood

4630
03:32:34,687 --> 03:32:38,783
What the French soldier and a British soldier were going through in these hellish conditions

4631
03:32:39,295 --> 03:32:41,855
Were the German soldiers on the other side of the nomad

4632
03:32:42,111 --> 03:32:43,903
Plant living under the exact

4633
03:32:44,159 --> 03:32:45,183
Same hellish condition

4634
03:32:47,231 --> 03:32:50,303
When the Germans don't fire on the British were getting their wounded

4635
03:32:51,071 --> 03:32:54,143
A lot of times it's because there's an Unwritten deal that says

4636
03:32:54,655 --> 03:32:56,191
I'm going to leave you alone right

4637
03:32:56,447 --> 03:32:57,215
How to get your wounded

4638
03:32:57,471 --> 03:32:59,775
People are there in the hopes that when it's my wounded

4639
03:33:00,031 --> 03:33:03,103
Did people in no man's land and I'm trying to get them out of there

4640
03:33:03,359 --> 03:33:03,871
You'll let me

4641
03:33:06,687 --> 03:33:08,991
One of the real phenomenons of this war

4642
03:33:10,015 --> 03:33:13,855
Is the fact that when left alone a lot of soldiers on both sides

4643
03:33:14,623 --> 03:33:16,415
Decided to adopt what's what's

4644
03:33:16,671 --> 03:33:19,231
Officially known as a live-and-let-live attitude

4645
03:33:19,999 --> 03:33:23,583
In this war and it was it was common everywhere but the Western Front more than any other

4646
03:33:24,095 --> 03:33:25,119
Where for example

4647
03:33:26,143 --> 03:33:28,703
Soldiers would be required and they hated this job

4648
03:33:29,215 --> 03:33:30,495
To go out at night

4649
03:33:31,007 --> 03:33:32,799
And put more barbed wire

4650
03:33:33,055 --> 03:33:33,823
Stop in the middle of nowhere

4651
03:33:34,335 --> 03:33:35,615
Once you sneak out cuz it's dark

4652
03:33:35,871 --> 03:33:39,711
And you bring wire with you and wire cutters and all these thinking of to go hang new wire

4653
03:33:39,967 --> 03:33:42,527
Extremely dangerous job in both sides hated

4654
03:33:42,783 --> 03:33:43,295
Right

4655
03:33:43,807 --> 03:33:44,575
It's a lot of time.

4656
03:33:44,831 --> 03:33:45,599
They just wouldn't shoot

4657
03:33:46,367 --> 03:33:46,879
At the other pee

4658
03:33:47,135 --> 03:33:49,695
People who were putting wire officers hated this

4659
03:33:50,463 --> 03:33:51,487
And one of the big

4660
03:33:52,255 --> 03:33:54,303
Scandals was after the Christmas Truce

4661
03:33:54,559 --> 03:33:57,375
The so-called Christmas Truce of 1914 both sides with fractions

4662
03:33:57,631 --> 03:34:03,007
The officers had to make all these arrangements so that next Christmas nothing like this happened again in a minute

4663
03:34:03,263 --> 03:34:05,055
Preserved a proper fighting spirit

4664
03:34:05,311 --> 03:34:05,823
I could be the way

4665
03:34:06,079 --> 03:34:07,103
Most elite military

4666
03:34:07,615 --> 03:34:10,175
What phrase about the troops off and found a lot more

4667
03:34:10,687 --> 03:34:12,479
To like about each other than their own office

4668
03:34:14,783 --> 03:34:15,807
Corporate Louis Vuitton

4669
03:34:16,063 --> 03:34:16,831
In the French army

4670
03:34:17,087 --> 03:34:18,367
Write about this incident

4671
03:34:18,879 --> 03:34:20,159
Where a flood occurs

4672
03:34:20,415 --> 03:34:21,439
And all of a sudden

4673
03:34:21,695 --> 03:34:27,839
The Trenches on both sides of no-man's-land have to clear and how you have one of those moments where you just look at your

4674
03:34:28,095 --> 03:34:29,631
And I mean he looks at you and you realize

4675
03:34:30,655 --> 03:34:31,167
The suck

4676
03:34:32,191 --> 03:34:37,311
Who put us into this mess and why are we doing this and he almost right to know as a social

4677
03:34:37,567 --> 03:34:39,615
It was like a lot of these troops in the trenches are

4678
03:34:39,871 --> 03:34:42,431
So he has a worldview that kind of seas

4679
03:34:42,687 --> 03:34:46,015
The upper classes the corporate groups and all that is the problem

4680
03:34:46,527 --> 03:34:52,159
And that the average soldiers in the trenches we're all just kind of common workers being exploited by the man

4681
03:34:52,671 --> 03:34:53,439
He writes about the

4682
03:34:53,695 --> 03:34:54,207
This famous

4683
03:34:54,975 --> 03:34:55,487
Flood

4684
03:34:55,743 --> 03:34:56,767
That he experiences

4685
03:34:57,023 --> 03:34:57,791
And what it does

4686
03:34:58,047 --> 03:34:58,815
Freaks out

4687
03:34:59,071 --> 03:35:01,631
You know his mind is the upper classes in the officer Corps

4688
03:35:01,887 --> 03:35:02,911
But all of a sudden

4689
03:35:03,167 --> 03:35:03,679
Taobao

4690
03:35:04,191 --> 03:35:07,519
Sides in this combat are starting to have some sympathy for each other

4691
03:35:08,287 --> 03:35:09,055
Any rights quote

4692
03:35:10,847 --> 03:35:13,663
One night when the rain came down in Torrance

4693
03:35:13,919 --> 03:35:15,711
The tide invaded our dugout

4694
03:35:15,967 --> 03:35:18,527
I'm cascaded down both sets of steps

4695
03:35:19,039 --> 03:35:23,647
At the height of the storm some of the men had to devote all their efforts to building a dam

4696
03:35:23,903 --> 03:35:25,439
Which the water then broke through it

4697
03:35:25,695 --> 03:35:26,719
Three or four places

4698
03:35:26,975 --> 03:35:29,535
We spent the rest of the night battling the flood waters

4699
03:35:29,791 --> 03:35:35,935
The next day December 10th at many places along the Frontline the soldiers had to come out of their trenches so is

4700
03:35:36,191 --> 03:35:36,703
Not to drown

4701
03:35:37,215 --> 03:35:38,751
The Germans had to do the same

4702
03:35:39,263 --> 03:35:45,407
We therefore had the singular spectacle of the two enemy armies facing each other without firing a shot

4703
03:35:46,175 --> 03:35:48,991
Our common sufferings brought our hearts together

4704
03:35:49,247 --> 03:35:50,271
Melted the hatred

4705
03:35:51,295 --> 03:35:54,111
Nurtured sympathy between strangers and adversaries

4706
03:35:54,623 --> 03:35:57,183
Those who deny it are ignoring human psychology

4707
03:35:57,695 --> 03:35:59,231
Frenchman in German seawright

4708
03:35:59,487 --> 03:36:02,047
Looked at each other and saw that they were all men

4709
03:36:02,303 --> 03:36:03,839
No different from one another

4710
03:36:04,095 --> 03:36:06,143
They smiled exchanged comment

4711
03:36:06,399 --> 03:36:08,191
And reached out in grass

4712
03:36:08,447 --> 03:36:09,727
We shared tobacco

4713
03:36:09,983 --> 03:36:14,335
A canteen of coffee or wine if only we spoke the same language

4714
03:36:15,103 --> 03:36:16,383
One day he writes

4715
03:36:16,639 --> 03:36:20,223
A huge devil of a German stood up on a mound and gave a speech

4716
03:36:20,479 --> 03:36:22,783
Which only the Germans could understand word for word

4717
03:36:23,039 --> 03:36:24,575
But everyone knew what it meant

4718
03:36:24,831 --> 03:36:27,135
Because he smashed his rifle on a tree stump

4719
03:36:27,647 --> 03:36:29,695
Breaking it into in a gesture of anger

4720
03:36:29,951 --> 03:36:32,255
Applause broke out on both sides

4721
03:36:32,511 --> 03:36:34,303
Ally Internationale was sung

4722
03:36:34,559 --> 03:36:35,071
Pizza

4723
03:36:36,095 --> 03:36:36,607
National

4724
03:36:37,119 --> 03:36:37,631
The Socialist cause

4725
03:36:40,191 --> 03:36:40,959
He says quote

4726
03:36:41,215 --> 03:36:46,591
Well if only you'd been there mad King's bloody generals fanatical ministers

4727
03:36:46,847 --> 03:36:48,383
Jingoistic journalist

4728
03:36:48,639 --> 03:36:52,735
Rear Echelon Patriots to contemplate this Sublime spectacle

4729
03:36:52,991 --> 03:36:54,015
But it wasn't enough

4730
03:36:54,271 --> 03:36:54,783
He says

4731
03:36:55,039 --> 03:36:57,087
Did the soldiers refuse to fight one another

4732
03:36:57,343 --> 03:37:00,671
What was needed was for them to turn back on the monsters you were pushing them

4733
03:37:00,927 --> 03:37:01,951
One against the other

4734
03:37:02,207 --> 03:37:03,999
And it cut them down like wild beasts

4735
03:37:04,511 --> 03:37:08,095
For not having done so how much longer would the killing go on

4736
03:37:08,863 --> 03:37:10,399
Meanwhile he says

4737
03:37:10,655 --> 03:37:12,703
Are big shot leaders were in a furor

4738
03:37:12,959 --> 03:37:16,287
What in the lord's name would happen if the soldiers refuse to kill each other

4739
03:37:16,543 --> 03:37:22,175
Our artillery men received orders to fire on any Assemblies of men which were pointed out to them

4740
03:37:22,431 --> 03:37:25,503
Animo down in discriminately both Frenchmen and German

4741
03:37:26,015 --> 03:37:27,807
Just like when an ancient circuses

4742
03:37:28,063 --> 03:37:33,183
They slaughtered wild beasts 2 were too intelligent to tear each other's throats out and devour each other

4743
03:37:33,951 --> 03:37:35,231
Furthermore he says

4744
03:37:35,487 --> 03:37:38,303
Once the front line was established again for better or worse

4745
03:37:38,559 --> 03:37:41,375
It was forbidden under penalty of death to leave the trench

4746
03:37:41,631 --> 03:37:44,447
Any Act of familiarity with the Germans had to cease

4747
03:37:44,703 --> 03:37:45,471
It was over

4748
03:37:45,983 --> 03:37:48,543
What was really needed was a second biblical flood

4749
03:37:48,799 --> 03:37:51,103
Are Universal Deluge to stop the war

4750
03:37:51,359 --> 03:37:54,687
To appease all the anger in the bloody Madness of our leaders

4751
03:37:54,943 --> 03:37:56,223
Who knows he says

4752
03:37:56,479 --> 03:38:00,063
Maybe one day in this corner of Artois they were raised a monument

4753
03:38:00,575 --> 03:38:06,719
To commemorate the spirit of fraternity among men who shared a horror of war and who were forced to kill each

4754
03:38:06,975 --> 03:38:07,999
Each other against their will

4755
03:38:08,767 --> 03:38:09,279
And quote

4756
03:38:11,583 --> 03:38:12,095
There are

4757
03:38:12,607 --> 03:38:16,447
Multiple accounts from socialist soldiers that sound like that

4758
03:38:17,471 --> 03:38:19,263
But it's more complex than then

4759
03:38:19,519 --> 03:38:21,311
Phillip Gibbs tries to make this statement

4760
03:38:21,567 --> 03:38:22,847
And now it can be told

4761
03:38:23,103 --> 03:38:24,127
We talked about this

4762
03:38:24,383 --> 03:38:27,199
Horrible life before soldiers are forced to endure

4763
03:38:27,711 --> 03:38:33,855
In about the complexity involved in trying to make some statement that the soldiers are all of One mind or viewpoint

4764
03:38:34,111 --> 03:38:34,623
Or anything

4765
03:38:35,903 --> 03:38:38,207
We told you weren't Junger the German go through all this

4766
03:38:38,463 --> 03:38:39,487
Terrible stuff

4767
03:38:39,999 --> 03:38:41,023
I'm kind of finds it

4768
03:38:41,279 --> 03:38:42,047
Uplifting

4769
03:38:43,071 --> 03:38:46,655
Gibbs write these horror stories and then says this about the song

4770
03:38:46,911 --> 03:38:47,935
And the soldiers there

4771
03:38:48,191 --> 03:38:48,703
Quote

4772
03:38:50,239 --> 03:38:51,007
But however deep

4773
03:38:51,263 --> 03:38:52,543
The knowledge of tragedy

4774
03:38:52,799 --> 03:38:54,079
A man would be a liar

4775
03:38:54,335 --> 03:38:56,127
If you refuse to admit to heroin

4776
03:38:56,639 --> 03:38:57,919
The gallantry of Youth

4777
03:38:58,175 --> 03:39:00,479
Even the gaiety of men in these infernal months

4778
03:39:00,991 --> 03:39:04,063
Psychology on the song was not simple and straightforward

4779
03:39:04,575 --> 03:39:05,599
Men were afraid

4780
03:39:06,111 --> 03:39:09,183
But fear was not there dominating emotion except in the worst hour

4781
03:39:09,695 --> 03:39:11,231
Men hated this fighting

4782
03:39:11,487 --> 03:39:12,511
Profound excitement

4783
03:39:13,023 --> 03:39:14,303
Often exaltation

4784
03:39:14,559 --> 03:39:15,071
Sometimes

4785
03:39:15,327 --> 03:39:18,143
An intense stimulus of all their senses and Passions

4786
03:39:18,399 --> 03:39:19,935
Before reaction exhaust

4787
03:39:20,447 --> 03:39:23,007
Men became gibbering idiots with Shellshock

4788
03:39:23,519 --> 03:39:24,287
If I saw some of the

4789
03:39:24,799 --> 03:39:25,311
But others

4790
03:39:25,567 --> 03:39:29,151
Rejoiced when they saw our shells plowing into the enemy's earthwork

4791
03:39:29,663 --> 03:39:31,455
Laughed at their own narrow Escape

4792
03:39:31,967 --> 03:39:32,735
Integral test

4793
03:39:32,991 --> 03:39:35,295
Comicality this monster is devil tree

4794
03:39:35,807 --> 03:39:37,855
The officers he writes were proud of their men

4795
03:39:38,367 --> 03:39:40,159
Eager for their honor an achievement

4796
03:39:40,415 --> 03:39:45,535
The men themselves were in rivalries with other bodies of troops and proud of their own prowess

4797
03:39:46,047 --> 03:39:48,607
They were scornful of all that the enemy might do to them

4798
03:39:49,119 --> 03:39:51,167
Getting knowledge discouraged and Power

4799
03:39:51,423 --> 03:39:52,703
They were quick to kill him

4800
03:39:52,959 --> 03:39:55,775
And yet also quick to give him a chance of Life by surrender

4801
03:39:56,031 --> 03:40:00,383
And after that were 9 times out of 10 chivalrous and kindly

4802
03:40:00,639 --> 03:40:02,943
But incredibly brutal on the rare occasions

4803
03:40:03,199 --> 03:40:05,759
When passion overcame them it's some tale of treachery

4804
03:40:07,039 --> 03:40:09,855
They had the pride of a skilled laborer he writes

4805
03:40:10,111 --> 03:40:11,135
In his own crap

4806
03:40:11,391 --> 03:40:12,415
As machine gunners

4807
03:40:12,671 --> 03:40:13,183
Bombers

4808
03:40:13,439 --> 03:40:13,951
Raider

4809
03:40:14,207 --> 03:40:14,719
Trench mortar

4810
03:40:14,975 --> 03:40:15,487
Men

4811
03:40:15,743 --> 03:40:18,815
And we're all Keen to show their skill whatever the risks

4812
03:40:19,327 --> 03:40:20,607
They were healthy animals

4813
03:40:20,863 --> 03:40:23,423
With animal courage as well as animal fear

4814
03:40:23,679 --> 03:40:29,823
And they had some of them a spiritual and moral fervor which bathed them risk death to save a camera

4815
03:40:30,335 --> 03:40:31,615
How to save a position

4816
03:40:31,871 --> 03:40:34,431
40 killed fear that tried to feather them

4817
03:40:34,687 --> 03:40:36,735
4 lead men with greater fear than there

4818
03:40:37,247 --> 03:40:39,039
They live from hour to hour

4819
03:40:39,295 --> 03:40:39,807
And forgot

4820
03:40:40,063 --> 03:40:41,855
The Peril or the misery that had passed

4821
03:40:42,367 --> 03:40:44,927
I did not forestall the future by apprehension

4822
03:40:45,183 --> 03:40:46,719
Unless they were sensitive mind

4823
03:40:46,975 --> 03:40:49,791
With the worst quality men might have in Modern Warfare

4824
03:40:50,559 --> 03:40:51,583
Imagination

4825
03:40:52,607 --> 03:40:53,119
And quote

4826
03:40:54,911 --> 03:40:55,423
Well

4827
03:40:55,679 --> 03:41:00,287
Imagination I can see being a downside if you are in the trenches Under Fire

4828
03:41:01,567 --> 03:41:07,199
And looking at your watch as some of these troops in the trenches did saying I have 15 minutes left to live

4829
03:41:07,455 --> 03:41:08,735
Now I have 10 minutes left

4830
03:41:08,991 --> 03:41:10,527
Now I have 5 minutes left to live in

4831
03:41:10,783 --> 03:41:12,575
Is the countdown to going over the top

4832
03:41:13,855 --> 03:41:14,623
Yes I can see how

4833
03:41:15,391 --> 03:41:15,903
You crazy

4834
03:41:16,671 --> 03:41:17,439
The other hand

4835
03:41:18,207 --> 03:41:21,023
We're getting to the part of the war where the really

4836
03:41:21,279 --> 03:41:24,607
Imaginative Minds can begin to

4837
03:41:25,119 --> 03:41:29,215
Start to have an impact on these brand-new 20th century problems

4838
03:41:29,727 --> 03:41:33,055
It only became apparent about 2 years ago when this War started

4839
03:41:33,567 --> 03:41:36,639
Some of the solutions to the problems the first World War

4840
03:41:37,151 --> 03:41:38,431
Anna brings into play

4841
03:41:38,687 --> 03:41:40,223
Debut during the battle of

4842
03:41:40,479 --> 03:41:45,087
The song and they look once again this is going to maybe be a sub team of this show on intentionally

4843
03:41:45,599 --> 03:41:47,903
They look like something out of Science Fiction in this case

4844
03:41:48,159 --> 03:41:49,183
HG Wells

4845
03:41:49,439 --> 03:41:50,463
Or if you want to believe some

4846
03:41:50,719 --> 03:41:53,023
People go all the way back to Leonardo DaVinci

4847
03:41:53,535 --> 03:41:54,559
People who first

4848
03:41:55,327 --> 03:41:58,143
Come up with the concept of if you will

4849
03:41:59,167 --> 03:42:00,191
A land ship

4850
03:42:01,727 --> 03:42:04,799
Churchill and the Navy called the land battleship

4851
03:42:06,335 --> 03:42:08,127
We know them by the term

4852
03:42:10,431 --> 03:42:13,503
And tank is supposedly simply something that caught on

4853
03:42:13,759 --> 03:42:15,295
It was supposed to be a cover work

4854
03:42:16,063 --> 03:42:17,087
So that no one knew

4855
03:42:17,343 --> 03:42:21,695
What was being worked on in secret in the in the Laboratories of the allies

4856
03:42:22,207 --> 03:42:23,231
They would suggest

4857
03:42:23,487 --> 03:42:24,511
Statistic Giant

4858
03:42:25,023 --> 03:42:25,535
Armored

4859
03:42:26,303 --> 03:42:27,071
Tractor

4860
03:42:27,583 --> 03:42:30,655
Was intended to bring up Supply water

4861
03:42:30,911 --> 03:42:31,935
Her to the Frontline troops

4862
03:42:32,191 --> 03:42:33,471
Under-fire so attack

4863
03:42:33,983 --> 03:42:34,495
He will water toy

4864
03:42:37,567 --> 03:42:43,711
Battle one of these little battles that make up all these giant battles a part of the battle of the Somme on September

4865
03:42:43,967 --> 03:42:44,479
AR-15

4866
03:42:44,991 --> 03:42:45,759
Offensive

4867
03:42:46,015 --> 03:42:48,319
To take a particular part of the battlefield is launched

4868
03:42:48,575 --> 03:42:51,135
And debuting are a bunch of these

4869
03:42:51,391 --> 03:42:51,903
Chanel

4870
03:42:52,415 --> 03:42:55,743
30 or 40 something like that a bunch of them broke down on the way

4871
03:42:58,303 --> 03:42:59,839
You can instantly see

4872
03:43:00,095 --> 03:43:06,239
You know that this is the solution to the problem right if you go to your engineers when the war starts and say listen we got this bar

4873
03:43:06,495 --> 03:43:11,871
McGuire machine gun artillery situation with no man's land in these big trenches you got to get past

4874
03:43:12,127 --> 03:43:14,175
Put your mind to it come back with a design

4875
03:43:14,431 --> 03:43:15,967
They did they got a giant track

4876
03:43:16,991 --> 03:43:18,783
And it's so long that he can

4877
03:43:19,039 --> 03:43:20,575
Most of these

4878
03:43:20,831 --> 03:43:21,343
Trenches

4879
03:43:21,599 --> 03:43:22,111
So

4880
03:43:22,367 --> 03:43:28,511
It can go in and not get trapped most of the time it only goes about the speed of a walking human being but the

4881
03:43:28,767 --> 03:43:30,047
The point isn't to

4882
03:43:30,303 --> 03:43:34,143
In a drive around real fast everywhere the point is to not get killed

4883
03:43:34,399 --> 03:43:36,191
While you're Crossing no-man's-land

4884
03:43:36,703 --> 03:43:41,567
And not get held up by barbed wire these things are designed to Simply run over barbed wire

4885
03:43:42,335 --> 03:43:43,871
Machine gun bullets won't

4886
03:43:44,895 --> 03:43:51,039
Hurt them shrapnel won't hurt them and they'll get to the other side and I'll wipe out strong points and when they debut nobody has any

4887
03:43:51,295 --> 03:43:52,575
Any idea what that's going to be like

4888
03:43:53,855 --> 03:43:57,695
Another one of those moments where you had bite your nails in that you watch the new technology

4889
03:43:58,207 --> 03:43:59,231
In this case

4890
03:43:59,487 --> 03:44:04,863
Not stuff developed in the last hundred years that never had a chance to be tested in this case stop develop

4891
03:44:05,119 --> 03:44:08,191
Specifically in response to problems the first World War

4892
03:44:08,703 --> 03:44:09,727
Gina brings up like

4893
03:44:09,983 --> 03:44:10,751
No man's land

4894
03:44:12,287 --> 03:44:12,799
And

4895
03:44:13,055 --> 03:44:14,591
They perform

4896
03:44:14,847 --> 03:44:15,871
Astoundingly well

4897
03:44:17,663 --> 03:44:19,711
Now they break down a lot

4898
03:44:20,223 --> 03:44:22,271
And other terribly uncomfortable today

4899
03:44:22,527 --> 03:44:25,599
People inside these are large to there like 15 people in these

4900
03:44:25,855 --> 03:44:26,623
I mean you're like

4901
03:44:26,879 --> 03:44:27,903
Almost a boss

4902
03:44:28,671 --> 03:44:29,951
And they don't have a turret

4903
03:44:30,207 --> 03:44:35,327
They have either machine gun that come out of the side or a couple of 6-pounder guns with your about 57 mm

4904
03:44:35,839 --> 03:44:36,607
And yet

4905
03:44:36,863 --> 03:44:38,911
The Germans don't know what they're dealing with here and we

4906
03:44:39,167 --> 03:44:40,959
Have stories of them surrendering to tanks and

4907
03:44:41,471 --> 03:44:44,543
How the reaction on the part of the British troops is either really

4908
03:44:44,799 --> 03:44:46,335
Excited and happy or

4909
03:44:46,591 --> 03:44:48,895
They almost laughing cuz it looks kind of comical

4910
03:44:49,919 --> 03:44:50,943
But in a sense

4911
03:44:51,199 --> 03:44:55,551
This is what we talked about earlier this is the Star Wars steampunk

4912
03:44:55,807 --> 03:44:57,855
Imperial Walker thing for real

4913
03:45:00,415 --> 03:45:06,559
Churchill and the people who would back this idea from the time trench warfare got started that's when the the fur

4914
03:45:06,815 --> 03:45:11,679
First plans were drawn up in the ideas brainstormed for something like this in the French were working on the two by the way

4915
03:45:12,959 --> 03:45:16,287
Churchill was mad and forever afterwards yelled and screamed that

4916
03:45:16,543 --> 03:45:22,431
This concept could have really done a ton if they had just waited till there were enough of these land battleships

4917
03:45:22,943 --> 03:45:25,247
To unleash and have pad make a difference

4918
03:45:25,759 --> 03:45:28,575
The counter-argument which we also understand right is that

4919
03:45:29,087 --> 03:45:32,927
What if they don't work what if we don't know how they work how do we do this if we don't have a

4920
03:45:33,183 --> 03:45:34,463
Dress rehearsal

4921
03:45:34,719 --> 03:45:40,351
Before opening night so Churchill in the people on his side or saying no you wasted it should have been one big opening night that

4922
03:45:41,375 --> 03:45:42,911
Broke the Western Front

4923
03:45:43,423 --> 03:45:47,263
The other side saying are you kidding me there is an open invitation to Murphy's Law

4924
03:45:48,287 --> 03:45:52,383
But if you were looking to try to decide how you like your land battleship

4925
03:45:52,639 --> 03:45:54,175
Concept in practice

4926
03:45:54,687 --> 03:45:59,551
After it was debuted at the Battle of the Somme well all you have to know is Cavalry commander Douglas Haig

4927
03:46:00,319 --> 03:46:01,599
Radioed back to

4928
03:46:01,855 --> 03:46:04,927
Your corporate headquarters at the British Army and said that

4929
03:46:05,439 --> 03:46:06,463
We want more of those tanks

4930
03:46:07,999 --> 03:46:08,511
Now

4931
03:46:09,279 --> 03:46:10,303
Other things happen

4932
03:46:10,815 --> 03:46:11,583
Because of the battle of

4933
03:46:11,839 --> 03:46:13,119
The song two in one was

4934
03:46:13,631 --> 03:46:14,655
It was just yet

4935
03:46:14,911 --> 03:46:16,447
For poor Erich von Falk

4936
03:46:16,703 --> 03:46:22,847
Can find the head of the German military remember he took over after they sacked Von moltke the guy who they started the war with

4937
03:46:23,103 --> 03:46:23,871
And now

4938
03:46:24,127 --> 03:46:28,991
Like a bunch of leaders who owned a football team and continually like

4939
03:46:29,247 --> 03:46:32,319
To change couches Vulcan Hines going to lose his gig

4940
03:46:34,111 --> 03:46:38,463
He's got Verdun on his scorecard now he's got the song and then there's a

4941
03:46:38,719 --> 03:46:41,023
Brusilov offensive and then the last straw

4942
03:46:41,279 --> 03:46:46,911
Is everybody's Whispering that Romania is going to get in the war which doesn't sound like a big deal to watch now

4943
03:46:47,167 --> 03:46:53,311
But if you actually look at the literature especially German austro-hungarian the stuff from that side of your toe they're really like biting their nails

4944
03:46:53,567 --> 03:46:54,079
About the song

4945
03:46:54,335 --> 03:46:57,151
Romania to get in the war half-million bayonets oh my goodness

4946
03:46:57,407 --> 03:47:02,527
Everybody's really worried and apparently Kaiser Wilhelm II German Emperor is really worried in Falcon Heights and now don't worry about it

4947
03:47:03,039 --> 03:47:06,879
They're not going to come in anytime soon maybe later but no but no time soon and then boom almost

4948
03:47:07,135 --> 03:47:08,671
Right after he issues

4949
03:47:08,927 --> 03:47:10,719
Did I won't be coming in they come in

4950
03:47:11,743 --> 03:47:13,279
August 27th

4951
03:47:14,047 --> 03:47:16,351
And that's it falkenhayn get sacked

4952
03:47:18,399 --> 03:47:24,543
The last card by the way I love how he knows his Emperor William and William's little quirks about power

4953
03:47:24,799 --> 03:47:26,847
And Falcon Heights last car that he plays is

4954
03:47:27,103 --> 03:47:28,383
You know if you replace me

4955
03:47:28,639 --> 03:47:30,175
With the people everyone knew they were

4956
03:47:30,687 --> 03:47:35,039
Replacing with have you replaced me with Hindenburg and ludendorff that's it they're not going to listen to you

4957
03:47:35,295 --> 03:47:37,855
I'm the last chance you have of having an influence

4958
03:47:38,111 --> 03:47:38,623
My word

4959
03:47:38,879 --> 03:47:41,951
But that's basically what you said to the Kaiser you won't have any role in this at all

4960
03:47:42,207 --> 03:47:47,839
You better stick with me cuz if you put Hindenburg and ludendorff in charge they going to tell you to go play with your toys in the corner

4961
03:47:49,119 --> 03:47:51,423
Apparently the Kaiser felt like he had no choice

4962
03:47:51,935 --> 03:47:52,447
Saks

4963
03:47:52,703 --> 03:47:53,983
Von falkenhayn

4964
03:47:54,239 --> 03:47:54,751
Who asks

4965
03:47:55,007 --> 03:47:56,543
Spore a military command

4966
03:47:56,799 --> 03:48:00,127
Is giving some people think almost as an insult

4967
03:48:00,383 --> 03:48:02,687
The command to go attack Romania

4968
03:48:02,943 --> 03:48:05,247
Which he didn't foresee them coming into the war

4969
03:48:05,503 --> 03:48:07,807
He takes over a military command and

4970
03:48:08,319 --> 03:48:11,391
Conducts a brilliant campaign against Romania

4971
03:48:11,647 --> 03:48:13,183
Conquering them quick

4972
03:48:14,719 --> 03:48:18,047
Which makes you turn around go now why won't you so scared of those Romanian bayonets

4973
03:48:18,559 --> 03:48:19,071
La Terranea

4974
03:48:20,351 --> 03:48:21,119
Think about

4975
03:48:21,631 --> 03:48:26,239
How that's like a minor league team jumping into the middle of a game against the

4976
03:48:26,495 --> 03:48:27,775
Perhaps best army

4977
03:48:28,287 --> 03:48:31,615
In the 20th centuries of Romania so unequipped for this

4978
03:48:31,871 --> 03:48:33,663
Without a ramp up. And they just got

4979
03:48:33,919 --> 03:48:34,431
Smashed

4980
03:48:34,687 --> 03:48:40,831
And the worst part about the whole thing from the Allied standpoint again the Allies work so hard to get Romania in the conflict is it

4981
03:48:41,087 --> 03:48:45,183
Germany takes over Romania they're going to loot that country of every bit of weed

4982
03:48:45,439 --> 03:48:48,255
And oil in anything they can take to offset

4983
03:48:48,767 --> 03:48:54,911
The damage that the British blockade is doing so in the sentence like they come upon this Romanian store room and they Luther

4984
03:48:55,167 --> 03:48:55,679
The whole thing

4985
03:48:56,191 --> 03:48:56,703
So it

4986
03:48:56,959 --> 03:48:57,983
So the backfires

4987
03:48:58,239 --> 03:48:59,007
On the Allied cause

4988
03:49:01,311 --> 03:49:01,823
Nonetheless

4989
03:49:02,335 --> 03:49:08,479
Hindenburg and ludendorff this new command team the people who have been in charge on the Eastern front for so long and so

4990
03:49:08,991 --> 03:49:11,807
Being the armchair quarterbacks from over there telling

4991
03:49:12,063 --> 03:49:16,927
The rest of the German command what they were doing wrong on the Western Front right now in charge of among other things

4992
03:49:17,439 --> 03:49:18,207
The Western Front

4993
03:49:19,487 --> 03:49:22,047
And they're going to bring A New Perspective in a different way of looking at

4994
03:49:23,327 --> 03:49:23,839
And

4995
03:49:24,863 --> 03:49:25,631
They will

4996
03:49:26,399 --> 03:49:26,911
Essential

4997
03:49:27,167 --> 03:49:29,215
Command this German Army for the rest

4998
03:49:29,471 --> 03:49:29,983
The war

4999
03:49:32,031 --> 03:49:34,591
Now how long the rest of the wars going to be able to

5000
03:49:35,871 --> 03:49:36,639
Is an open question

5001
03:49:38,175 --> 03:49:41,247
As 1960 begins to wonder if you begin to see the discontent

5002
03:49:42,015 --> 03:49:43,039
Cramping up everywhere

5003
03:49:43,295 --> 03:49:44,319
How many different fur

5004
03:49:44,831 --> 03:49:47,135
When you begin to see for example hunger relief

5005
03:49:47,647 --> 03:49:48,415
You'll be a winter

5006
03:49:49,183 --> 03:49:50,975
The famous winter of 1916 in Germany

5007
03:49:51,231 --> 03:49:51,999
It's called the turnip

5008
03:49:52,767 --> 03:49:53,791
Which tells you right there what's go

5009
03:49:54,047 --> 03:49:58,143
And all the all the exports from Romania you can get aren't going to

5010
03:49:58,655 --> 03:49:59,679
Will make up for the

5011
03:49:59,935 --> 03:50:00,703
Overseas

5012
03:50:00,959 --> 03:50:02,495
Import needs of Germany

5013
03:50:04,031 --> 03:50:04,799
The Russians

5014
03:50:05,311 --> 03:50:09,919
Are in terrible trouble remember this is a a regime that almost got overthrown

5015
03:50:10,431 --> 03:50:12,223
10 years before this time.

5016
03:50:12,479 --> 03:50:13,759
They didn't have exactly the

5017
03:50:14,015 --> 03:50:15,039
The greatest most

5018
03:50:15,295 --> 03:50:17,087
Solid foundation anyway

5019
03:50:17,343 --> 03:50:23,231
These million casualties they suffer 1916 at the brusilov offensive among other things are taking its toll

5020
03:50:24,255 --> 03:50:25,279
French soldiers

5021
03:50:26,047 --> 03:50:26,815
Our beginning

5022
03:50:27,071 --> 03:50:28,095
To bleat

5023
03:50:28,351 --> 03:50:29,119
Like sheep

5024
03:50:29,631 --> 03:50:32,447
When they pass by their officers these Replacements will come up

5025
03:50:32,959 --> 03:50:33,727
Marching by

5026
03:50:33,983 --> 03:50:35,519
Camille just here bleeding sound

5027
03:50:36,287 --> 03:50:37,823
Sheep and lamb being led to

5028
03:50:38,079 --> 03:50:40,127
To the slaughter a sort of his one author puts it

5029
03:50:42,175 --> 03:50:42,687
Way that the

5030
03:50:42,943 --> 03:50:43,711
The troops

5031
03:50:43,967 --> 03:50:44,479
Silently

5032
03:50:44,735 --> 03:50:45,503
Protest what they

5033
03:50:45,759 --> 03:50:46,783
Mayfield being done to them

5034
03:50:47,551 --> 03:50:48,575
Homefront

5035
03:50:49,343 --> 03:50:49,855
You can

5036
03:50:50,111 --> 03:50:53,951
Now the tragedy is beginning to really see pin as more and more people

5037
03:50:54,207 --> 03:50:54,975
I personally effect

5038
03:50:55,231 --> 03:50:55,743
It for life

5039
03:50:56,255 --> 03:50:57,535
By this confidence

5040
03:50:57,791 --> 03:50:59,071
Obviously well this isn't

5041
03:50:59,583 --> 03:51:00,095
The

5042
03:51:00,863 --> 03:51:04,191
Text book example I don't think most people find themselves in

5043
03:51:04,447 --> 03:51:05,471
The same situation

5044
03:51:05,727 --> 03:51:06,751
At this German couple

5045
03:51:07,519 --> 03:51:09,567
There's a story from the time period from

5046
03:51:10,079 --> 03:51:12,383
A British observer in Germany

5047
03:51:13,151 --> 03:51:15,455
During the war who was describing a train trip

5048
03:51:16,223 --> 03:51:17,247
She saw a couple

5049
03:51:17,503 --> 03:51:18,271
Man and a woman

5050
03:51:18,527 --> 03:51:19,039
On the train

5051
03:51:19,551 --> 03:51:20,831
And the story is absolutely

5052
03:51:21,087 --> 03:51:23,647
Heartbreaking but in so many ways shows where we are

5053
03:51:24,415 --> 03:51:25,439
By the end of night

5054
03:51:25,951 --> 03:51:26,719
16 in the sky

5055
03:51:28,767 --> 03:51:29,535
The Observer says

5056
03:51:30,559 --> 03:51:31,071
Quote

5057
03:51:31,583 --> 03:51:34,399
A poor woman the other day on the train was holding up her hand

5058
03:51:34,655 --> 03:51:36,703
I'm counting the fingers on it slowly

5059
03:51:36,959 --> 03:51:37,471
1

5060
03:51:37,727 --> 03:51:38,239
2

5061
03:51:38,751 --> 03:51:39,263
3

5062
03:51:39,775 --> 03:51:40,287
4

5063
03:51:40,799 --> 03:51:41,311
5

5064
03:51:41,823 --> 03:51:42,847
Over and over again

5065
03:51:43,359 --> 03:51:45,919
The passengers gradually began to smile at her

5066
03:51:46,431 --> 03:51:51,039
Until at last the man sitting next to her said simply don't laugh at my wife ladies and gentlemen

5067
03:51:51,295 --> 03:51:52,575
I'm taking her to the asylum

5068
03:51:53,087 --> 03:51:54,111
Hurwitz Argon

5069
03:51:54,623 --> 03:51:55,903
She's lost her 5 Sons

5070
03:51:56,415 --> 03:51:57,439
All killed in action

5071
03:51:59,231 --> 03:51:59,743
And quote

5072
03:52:02,047 --> 03:52:04,607
Can you really examine what's already happen

5073
03:52:05,119 --> 03:52:05,631
Since August 9th

5074
03:52:06,143 --> 03:52:06,655
14

5075
03:52:07,423 --> 03:52:08,703
You Come Away with

5076
03:52:09,727 --> 03:52:11,263
The feeling that if you had bet

5077
03:52:12,287 --> 03:52:13,311
On a short war

5078
03:52:13,823 --> 03:52:14,847
Like so many did

5079
03:52:15,871 --> 03:52:17,919
You are amazed at the staying power

5080
03:52:18,175 --> 03:52:18,943
Ribaldis state

5081
03:52:19,199 --> 03:52:20,735
Many of whom didn't look that

5082
03:52:21,247 --> 03:52:23,551
Particularly stable when the war broke out

5083
03:52:24,063 --> 03:52:26,367
Nonetheless as we've been saying throughout this whole program

5084
03:52:26,623 --> 03:52:27,391
There's a limit

5085
03:52:27,903 --> 03:52:28,671
The endurance

5086
03:52:28,927 --> 03:52:29,439
Of anyone

5087
03:52:30,463 --> 03:52:31,999
And we're about to enter the point

5088
03:52:34,303 --> 03:52:34,815
And Brake

5089
03:52:36,095 --> 03:52:37,119
And in the not-too-distant

5090
03:52:38,399 --> 03:52:38,911
Get knocked out

5091
03:52:46,847 --> 03:52:50,943
If you think the show you this hurt is worth a dollar Dan and Ben would love to have it

5092
03:52:51,199 --> 03:52:52,991
About to show it's all we ask

5093
03:52:53,759 --> 03:52:57,599
Go to dancarlin.com for information on how to donate to the show

5094
03:52:58,367 --> 03:53:00,159
One of the justifiable criticism

5095
03:53:00,415 --> 03:53:01,951
You Can level at the show we just

5096
03:53:03,231 --> 03:53:04,767
Was it a focuses inordinately

5097
03:53:05,279 --> 03:53:05,791
On the western

5098
03:53:08,607 --> 03:53:09,887
I did that on purpose

5099
03:53:10,911 --> 03:53:13,215
Because to me when you're talkin about the extremes of human

5100
03:53:13,471 --> 03:53:15,007
Experienced person that comes to my mind when I

5101
03:53:16,287 --> 03:53:17,055
Situation of the West

5102
03:53:17,311 --> 03:53:18,591
In front in the trench war and all that

5103
03:53:19,103 --> 03:53:24,991
And in that sense I'm not that different than most British French and German historian to a focus inordinately

5104
03:53:25,503 --> 03:53:26,271
On the Western Front

5105
03:53:26,527 --> 03:53:27,807
But I think we all know

5106
03:53:28,063 --> 03:53:31,391
But there's a lot of other things going on in this conflict in a bunch of other theaters

5107
03:53:32,927 --> 03:53:34,207
And in the same way

5108
03:53:34,463 --> 03:53:40,607
I was able to avoid talking about those other theaters for awhile my good at the jumping around we would do

5109
03:53:41,375 --> 03:53:45,727
If we try to get everything in there would be more confusing than what we're already giving you which is more

5110
03:53:45,983 --> 03:53:46,495
Confusing the night

5111
03:53:47,007 --> 03:53:47,519
Already

5112
03:53:48,031 --> 03:53:49,823
None the less you could ignore

5113
03:53:50,335 --> 03:53:56,479
Just like most people in Britain France or heck even in New York city in United States when you open up a newspaper in the far corner

5114
03:53:56,735 --> 03:54:00,063
Like page 8 is a little blurb about maybe some

5115
03:54:00,319 --> 03:54:01,599
Obscure Arab

5116
03:54:01,855 --> 03:54:03,391
Tribe Uprising in

5117
03:54:03,647 --> 03:54:05,695
In some out-of-the-way ottoman

5118
03:54:06,207 --> 03:54:06,719
District

5119
03:54:07,231 --> 03:54:08,511
Or something doesn't mean that much

5120
03:54:08,767 --> 03:54:14,143
How much do you're not thinking that much about it after all the Western Front is grinding up a whole generation of Europeans

5121
03:54:14,655 --> 03:54:16,191
And then in 1917

5122
03:54:16,959 --> 03:54:17,471
Events

5123
03:54:17,727 --> 03:54:19,775
In Faraway peripheral places

5124
03:54:20,287 --> 03:54:22,591
Is the way a lot of people in the west might see them

5125
03:54:22,847 --> 03:54:24,639
Rise up and demand to be

5126
03:54:24,895 --> 03:54:25,663
Taken seriously

5127
03:54:28,479 --> 03:54:31,551
Whether it's the Middle East in 1917 and events

5128
03:54:32,063 --> 03:54:36,927
We are still shaking out to this day that are in your headlines daily

5129
03:54:37,695 --> 03:54:38,975
Whether it's the collapse

5130
03:54:39,487 --> 03:54:41,791
Of an ancient European regime

5131
03:54:42,559 --> 03:54:44,095
Which opens the door

5132
03:54:44,607 --> 03:54:45,375
2

5133
03:54:45,887 --> 03:54:47,679
The 20th century

5134
03:54:47,935 --> 03:54:48,447
Most

5135
03:54:49,215 --> 03:54:52,031
Radical regime taking over in a major country

5136
03:54:54,335 --> 03:54:58,175
It's also in 1917 that the vortex of the first World War

5137
03:54:58,431 --> 03:55:00,223
Manages to sucking

5138
03:55:00,479 --> 03:55:02,783
An outside major power

5139
03:55:03,551 --> 03:55:05,855
That for almost a hundred and fifty years

5140
03:55:06,111 --> 03:55:08,415
Has managed to stay out of direct

5141
03:55:08,671 --> 03:55:11,743
Involvement in European Affairs as one of their early

5142
03:55:12,255 --> 03:55:13,535
President that said

5143
03:55:14,303 --> 03:55:19,679
The United States of America doesn't go abroad in search of foreign monsters to slay

5144
03:55:20,703 --> 03:55:21,727
In 1970

5145
03:55:23,519 --> 03:55:24,543
Well maybe just this one

5146
03:55:25,567 --> 03:55:26,079
You know

5147
03:55:26,591 --> 03:55:27,359
To make the world

5148
03:55:28,127 --> 03:55:29,151
Safe for democracy

5149
03:55:31,455 --> 03:55:32,223
Yes indeed

5150
03:55:32,735 --> 03:55:34,271
Many of our modern

5151
03:55:34,527 --> 03:55:35,551
Situation

5152
03:55:36,575 --> 03:55:38,111
Add the seeds for the implant

5153
03:55:39,135 --> 03:55:39,903
In 19

5154
03:55:40,159 --> 03:55:40,671
17

5155
03:55:41,695 --> 03:55:42,463
I will get to

5156
03:55:42,975 --> 03:55:43,487
All that

5157
03:55:44,255 --> 03:55:44,767
And more

5158
03:55:45,791 --> 03:55:46,303
Imparfait

5159
03:55:47,327 --> 03:55:47,839
Blueprint
